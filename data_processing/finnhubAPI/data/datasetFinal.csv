There are 19 Amazon Fresh stores in the UK, all based in London. In a statement on its website, the retail giant said it proposed closing 14 stores and converting five more to its Whole Foods brand.
The statement said: ""We’ve made the difficult decision to launch a consultation with employees regarding the proposed closure of our Amazon Fresh UK stores, following a thorough evaluation of business operations and the very substantial growth opportunities in online delivery.
""In case of closure, our goal is to offer redeployment opportunities to as many affected employees as possible.""
(AMZN)
Amazon (AMZN) added that it would expand partnerships with UK retailers, including Morrisons, Iceland and Co-op.
The company had also previously announced a £40bn investment in the UK as part of its online expansion plans, which included building new fulfilment centres.

Danni Hewson, AJ Bell's head of financial analysis, linked the closures to dwindling customer numbers, saying that although the stores' till-less technology was striking, it ""always felt a little awkward for a post-pandemic shopper"".
“Amazon’s strength is in convenience of delivery, and it’s no surprise that as one door closes, many more van doors are set to open, with the US firm announcing greater access to groceries for its Prime members and plans to offer fresh goods via its online shop window from next year,"" Hewson added.
Many Amazon (AMZN) Fresh locations are clustered in and around central London, while a handful are scattered among greater London boroughs. Here's the full map:

How they perform can serve as a gauge of how the overall sector is doing. And with deep pockets, if they're doing well and spending a lot of money, that can result in a lot of growth for the overall economy.
Some of those stocks, however, have been doing far better than others. The weakest performer in the Magnificent Seven over the past couple of years has been Apple (AAPL 0.62%). The tech giant yields significant power as its iPhones are often seen as status symbols all over the globe. And the business still generates mammoth profits.
But Apple stock has nonetheless been a relatively lackluster buy of late. Could that change, and is it an underrated buy right now?
Why have investors been down on Apple's stock?
Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with its market cap hovering around $3.8 trillion. And yet, it has been an underperforming stock to own in recent years. Since 2023, it has nearly doubled in value, but given the growth in the tech sector, investors would have been better off going with any other stock in the Magnificent Seven over that time frame.
Apple has done better than the S&P 500 (which is up around 74%) over that stretch, but at a time when tech stocks have been soaring, the company has been a laggard rather than a leader.
But it's not exactly a surprise, given that the company hasn't been developing its own chatbot, and it has delayed the rollout of artificial intelligence (AI) features for its iPhones. Its focus on safety and privacy is practical, but it hasn't been winning over growth investors. The concern is that Apple isn't much of an innovator in tech these days. And with its massive ecosystem and the roughly 1.4 billion iPhone users in the world, it may not see a whole lot of incentive in rushing new products and services out.
Does Apple's valuation deserve a trim if it's no longer a top tech stock?
Apple has a phenomenal business, and it is highly profitable. Over the trailing 12 months, its net income has totaled nearly $100 billion, which translates into an impressive 24% profit margin as its revenue over that stretch totaled $409 billion.
But if the company isn't growing at a fast pace and its growth prospects don't change drastically, it calls into question whether the premium the stock trades at is warranted. Currently, Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 37. And yet, the company's sales over the past three quarters have totaled $313.7 billion, representing a modest year-over-year increase of just under 6%.
At that kind of growth rate, I believe the stock should be trading at a P/E multiple of far less than 30. While AI is the big wildcard for the business, which could trigger upgrade cycles in its iPhones and unlock more growth, it's still a big question mark moving forward. If Apple can prove its doubters wrong and be a winner in AI, then the stock may be due for a rally, but there's little reason to expect that will be the case at this stage.
Apple has a terrific business, but investors shouldn't overlook its high valuation
There's no denying Apple's dominance in the smartphone market. But given all the question marks around its future and how competitive its iPhones will be with other AI-powered phones, the stock should arguably be trading at a discount rather than a hefty premium, as it is now. It may not be easy to switch from an iPhone to another phone brand, but over time, consumers may get frustrated with lackluster innovation.
Apple hasn't been a leading innovating company for many years, and the AI boom is simply highlighting what kind of a laggard it is in tech these days. And if it can't quickly convince investors that it's on the right track, the stock may continue to underperform its peers, and the bigger danger is that it may be due for a sizable correction.
The stock's high valuation is a problem as it leaves minimal-to-no margin of safety if you decide to invest in Apple today. And that's why, at least for the time being, I wouldn't buy the stock and instead take a wait-and-see approach with it.",733,trafilatura,,False
company,1758672900,"Prediction: This AI Stock Will Join Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in the $3 Trillion Club by 2026",136857432,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AAPL,Yahoo,Amazon will benefit big time from data center spending.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a12bc481f5741bc9d5a283b9ded4452763f9f17663dca2ec553bcca04b15b15d,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,200.0,"All everyone wants to talk about is Nvidia. The computer chip company is now the largest stock in the world by market capitalization, quickly joining the $3 trillion club along with Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Investors are betting with their wallets that the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power will drive huge earnings growth for the likes of Nvidia.
They are forgetting one company that will be an underrated beneficiary of AI growth: Amazon (AMZN 1.01%). The company has a cloud and computer chip deal with start-up Anthropic, as well as numerous ways to benefit from AI in its media business.
At a market cap of $2.5 trillion today, I think it is an easy hurdle for Amazon to surpass a $3 trillion market cap by sometime in 2026, if not by the end of this year.
Here's why.
AWS and Anthropic
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the original cloud computing juggernaut. In the age of AI, the market is feeling like it is left behind. Alphabet has its own AI infrastructure to build with Google Cloud, while Microsoft won a huge partnership with OpenAI to drive growth for its cloud business. Now, even Oracle is winning contracts from OpenAI in a reported $300 billion deal.
While it would have been nice to see AWS win some of these deals, the division is much more focused on generating positive return on investment than other players, which is likely why Oracle won the recent deal from OpenAI.
Anthropic is AWS' bet as an AI partner, and it is currently flying under the radar. Anthropic is an AI software provider focused on the enterprise and coding markets. Its revenue is exploding higher, growing from annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 billion at the start of this year to $5 billion as of its latest update. AWS is Anthropic's key cloud partner, where it plans to spend billions of dollars to train and run its AI systems. The partnership is so deep that Anthropic is now working with Amazon to build custom computer chips to compete with Nvidia.
Revenue at AWS grew 17% year over year last quarter to an ARR topping $123 billion, although it is growing slower than competition like Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. However, with Anthropic hitting a growth inflection, AWS' revenue should start to accelerate in the coming quarters. With fat operating margins of 37% over the last 12 months, AWS can be a strong contributor to Amazon's consolidated earnings growth through the next few years.
Bringing AI to e-commerce
Not only will AWS earnings benefit from AI, so too will Amazon's e-commerce and media business. Specifically, it will help with its fast-growing advertising segment. Advertising revenue is currently growing 22% year over year and likely has fantastic profit margins.
This week, Amazon released a new agentic AI tool for building advertisements. In the creative studio, even small businesses can now build robust advertisements that will go on the Amazon marketplace, Prime Video, and other Amazon partner platforms. This will greatly expand the addressable market for Amazon's advertising services. With so many small businesses around the world selling on the platform, Amazon is the perfect advertising platform that can connect sellers to willing buyers of its products.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Amazon can deploy AI for robotics, delivery systems, and customer search to improve the value proposition and efficiency of its e-commerce ecosystem. Altogether, it should help retail expand its profitability, which still has a lot of room to grow with just 7.5% profit margins over the last 12 months.
Why Amazon will join the $3 trillion club
Amazon's market cap will surpass $3 trillion shortly because of the huge potential for earnings growth in the next few quarters. The company's EBIT -- earnings before interest income and taxes -- shot up to $77 billion in the last 12 months on margin expansion. As revenue growth at AWS accelerates and margins keep expanding in North American retail due to advertising, investors should see trailing-12-month EBIT cross $100 billion at some point in 2026.
For a high-quality business like Amazon, a multiple of 30 times its trailing EBIT is entirely reasonable. It actually trades at a higher multiple than that right now. Thirty times EBIT on $100 billion in earnings is a $3 trillion market cap. That is the math behind my Amazon prediction, and why I think it is now the best AI stock to add to your portfolio today.",749,trafilatura,,False

Paul Atkins outlines regulatory changes to allow retail investors access to previously restricted private funds
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Paul Atkins said Tuesday that the Trump administration’s plan to open 401(k) retirement accounts to private market investments would give ordinary Americans safe access to opportunities that are currently restricted.
Atkins said that the SEC will work with the Labor Department to broaden access to investments in private funds for ordinary investors who currently wouldn't meet regulatory thresholds that would provide them access.
""Individual investors need to be diversified and the private markets have developed so much because there's a lot of capital available in the private markets,"" Atkins said Tuesday on FOX Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria.""
""And frankly, it's uncool to be a public company, or it has become so, and I want to make IPOs great again,"" Atkins said. ""Thirty or so years ago, when I was a young lawyer starting out in New York, companies like Apple and Microsoft – they had to go public to get capital to build their companies and new products.""
TRUMP SIGNS ORDER TO OPEN 401(K)S TO PRIVATE MARKETS: WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUR RETIREMENT
""Today it's [the] opposite. Companies can stay private longer, and there being so many issues in the public markets between litigation and the short-termism that we were talking about before, the weight of the regulatory apparatus on reporting and that sort of thing, compliance,"" Atkins said.
""Then finally, the weaponization of corporate governance, so those issues have really decreased the attractiveness of being a public company,"" he said. ""We aim to make that better again.""
Currently, investments in private companies are limited to people who satisfy the ""accredited investor"" threshold. The rule aims to protect unsophisticated investors from financial risks associated with investments in private companies, which can be illiquid and aren't subject to public financial reporting requirements.
SENATE CONFIRMS TRUMP'S SEC CHAIR PICK PAUL ATKINS
The rule stipulates that qualified accredited investors must have a net worth over $1 million excluding their primary residence, or income over $200,000 individually (or $300,000 as a couple) in each of the past two years, with the reasonable expectation of the same in the current year.
It also includes professional criteria to satisfy the rule, including investment professionals with Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82 licenses, executives of the company selling the security, or family clients of family offices and knowledgeable employees of a private fund they want to invest in.
Atkins explained that private market investments can help investors diversify their portfolios as public markets become more concentrated, noting the rise of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that have driven much of the market's gains in recent years.
LABOR SECRETARY UNVEILS UNPRECEDENTED PLAN TO SLASH 63 'OUTDATED AND BURDENSOME' RULES
""We only have half the number of public companies as we had 30 years ago, and if you look at the S&P 500 it's rather top-heavy with respect to the 'Magnificent Seven,'"" Atkins said. ""What industry are they in? IT basically, technology, and we saw what has happened in the past when the market gets too concentrated.""
The SEC chairman noted that work remains to be done in putting up regulatory guardrails for opening private market investments to retail investors before they will be available as options in their retirement plans or other investment accounts.
""The key word here is diversification, and so we have to put in guardrails for retail investors to have exposure to these sorts of investments because they can be illiquid, the valuations can be off,"" Atkins said. ""There are a whole host of things – where the retail investor fits in the capital stack of the company, and then finally what the liquidity is of the investment.""

""We have to put guardrails around them, have 'most favored nation status' for those sorts of investments. Their advisors will obviously have fiduciary duty and that sort of thing.

While the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12% so far in 2025, major semiconductor exchange-traded funds are by far outperforming the market.
And while companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom are having solid years, they need a company to actually fabricate the semiconductors that they're designing. That's where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.84%) comes into play, and why it's one of the most consequential stocks on Wall Street right now.
About TSMC
Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest independent semiconductor foundry. It makes advanced semiconductor chips for multiple companies, including Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, AMD, and others. The company says it used 288 different process technologies to produce nearly 12,000 products in 2024, proving its broad capabilities to literally any type of client.
According to research by The Motley Fool, 60% of the company's revenue comes from manufacturing its specialized 3 nanometer (nm) and 5nm chips. The transistor sizes are important -- a nanometer is 1 billionth of a meter, so the more transistors TSMC can squeeze into a semiconductor chip, the faster it can work.
Back in the second quarter of 2022 -- which is not that long ago -- TSMC earned 30% of its revenue from 7nm chips. But now it gets a full 36% of its revenue from 5nm chips and 24% from 3nm chips, according to The Motley Fool's research.
TSMC is one of four companies that make 3nm chips at scale, in addition to Samsung, Intel, and Xiaomi. TSMC and Samsung already have plans to mass-produce the 2nm process in 2025.
To say the chips are in high demand is an understatement. TSMC announced that its revenues in August were $11.13 billion, up 33% from a year ago and up nearly 4% on a sequential monthly basis.
The company is investing $165 billion into building new production facilities in Arizona to fabricate semiconductors domestically, which will help it get around any trade issues between Beijing and Washington.
Other ways that TSMC makes money
While the high-powered 5nm and 3nm chips make up the lion's share of TSMC's revenue, it also has other sources:
Smartphones (27%): TSMC's semiconductors helped make 5G smartphones function. 5G was one of the biggest developments of the smartphone industry in this decade, allowing customers to access the internet with connections as speedy as a broadband connection. 5G's higher data speeds allow for high-resolution video, real-time gaming, and quick downloading speed.
While the percentage of TSMC's revenue stream involving smartphones fell from 33% to 27% in the last year, this is still a critical space for TSMC. Apple highlighted the company's partnership with the fabricator in August when it announced a $600 billion commitment to manufacturing in the U.S.
Internet of Things (5%): TSMC's revenue from Internet of Things devices fell from 6% to 5% in the last year. This involves a variety of products including smart home devices, smart city devices, and wearable technology. Examples include smartwatches, industrial sensors, medical monitors, lighting, speakers, and robotic vacuums that don't need high-powered 3nm or 5nm chips to function.
Automotive customers (5%): This includes companies like Tesla, which are working to make autonomous driving a reality. This also involves creating chips for electric vehicles, driver assistance systems, and in-car infotainment systems.
The bottom line
TSMC is continuing to advance its technology to create smaller transistors in order to fabricate more powerful chips, and as long as it continues down this path, it will remain the world's top and most significant chip fabricator. That gives it an essential position in today's AI-driven stock market, making Taiwan Semiconductor stock for investors to consider.",615,trafilatura,,False
company,1758459900,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon,136836406,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AAPL,Yahoo,These two dominant tech enterprises possess attractive qualities.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c3c36c3951911e9b49ff1bb246b6242da97434b3e2d3ef37ef7e5928ed15b729,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-apple-vs-amazon/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-apple-vs-amazon/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-apple-vs-amazon/,200.0,"Apple (AAPL 0.62%) and Amazon (AMZN 1.01%) have both been wonderful companies for investors to have owned. In the past decade, the consumer electronics giant's shares are up 723% (as of Sept. 17), while the e-commerce juggernaut's shares have climbed an even better 777%.
These are two of the most valuable enterprises on Earth. But which of these dominant tech stocks is the best one to buy today?
Apple's strong brand supports huge profits
Apple is a phenomenal company. I don't think there are many people who would argue with that statement. There are three key reasons why investors should think this way.
The first reason Apple is a great business is because of its powerful brand, which resonates so well with consumers across the globe. Apple's products and services are extremely popular and user-friendly, supported by the company's successful history of innovation that includes adding new features and devices to the mix. This also aids ongoing pricing power.
Apple's ability to seamlessly blend hardware and software is what creates its robust ecosystem. This is another reason to appreciate the business. The ecosystem is what essentially locks users in, discouraging them from switching to competing products and services. This helps Apple generate recurring revenue from its suite of services.
Apple doesn't struggle when it comes to profitability. It generated net income of $23.4 billion just in the last quarter (Q3 2025 ended June 28). And in the past decade, the company's net profit margin has averaged a superb 23%. This gives the company the financial horsepower to return lots of capital to shareholders, mainly through stock buybacks that totaled $21 billion just in the last fiscal quarter. Apple's financial strength is a third reason investors will like this business.
AWS is Amazon's most promising segment
Amazon is also a high-quality business. I believe there are also three reasons that support this perspective.
For starters, Amazon operates in multiple growth markets. It not only benefits from the popularity of online shopping, the area that it's a dominant player in, but it's also involved in streaming entertainment and digital advertising. Many investors might not realize that Amazon generated $15.7 billion just in ad revenue in Q2, up 22% year over year. This introduces a high-margin revenue stream.
Another growth engine, which is another reason to admire this business, is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cloud computing has been a major growth industry in the past decade, and it should continue going forward. This is especially true as companies not only move IT spending off-premises but start to invest significant resources into developing artificial intelligence. AWS generated more than half of Amazon's entire operating income last quarter, a share that will probably rise in the future.
The third reason why Amazon is a wonderful business is because it's proving that it can scale up in a profitable manner. Credit goes to running the business with a focus on operational efficiencies, which is exactly what CEO Andy Jassy has done in recent years. Amazon's Q2 net income was 250% higher than in the same period five years ago.
The best opportunity
Apple and Amazon are two of the best businesses on the face of the planet. Companies obviously can't get their market caps measured in the trillions of dollars without doing some things right. But which is the better stock to buy right now?
I believe that title goes to Amazon. It has better growth prospects, as it operates in numerous industries that have meaningful expansionary potential over the long term. Slower growth, particularly in the retail operations, can be offset by the gains with AWS and digital advertising. Amazon might also enter new markets in the future.
Plus, its valuation is reasonable at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30.1. Amazon is positioned better to produce a higher return over the next five years.",639,trafilatura,,False

Just don't deny Warren Buffett's market-beating results. Shares of his company -- conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway -- have reliably outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.52%) since he took the helm back in 1970. Investors only needed to remain patient enough to let time do the bulk of the genius investor's work.
The thing is, he's as good at his job today as he's ever been. That's why you'd be wise to poach a few of his picks while you still can before Buffett steps down as Berkshire's CEO at the end of this year.
With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings that would be great additions to almost anyone's portfolio right now.
Apple
Anyone keeping tabs on Apple (AAPL 0.62%) of late almost certainly knows it's been a challenging year for the company. What was supposed to be a solid 2025 fueled by demand for its AI-capable iPhones and its custom-built artificial intelligence (AI) solutions has been anything but solid. As it turns out, not only were Apple's suite of AI tools a disappointment, consumers aren't exactly clamoring for handheld access to such technology anyway. That's a big reason this stock's still down from its late-December peak even with its bounceback from April's low.
It's also worth noting that Berkshire has been paring back its stake in Apple since early last year, and by quite a bit, from more than 900 million shares then to only 280,000 now. Although it's not clear if Buffett and his lieutenants culled the bulk of their Apple position specifically because of Apple's AI headwinds, it is clear Berkshire's chiefs no longer felt comfortable holding such a big stake in the company.
Well, good news for faithful Apple shareholders is on the horizon. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives recently noted, ""We believe that iPhone 17 [the newest iteration of the smartphone] preorders will be up 5%-10% vs. last year as we estimate that roughly 20% of the 1.5 billion users worldwide have not upgraded their phones over the past four years.""
This jibes with similar optimism from JPMorgan (JPM -0.16%) analyst Samik Chatterjee as well as analysts with Morgan Stanley (MS 0.08%). This suggested demand also indirectly indicates faith in Apple's top-down overhaul of its AI-powered digital assistant -- which flopped last year -- will be ready when it's re-released early in the coming year.
It's also possible that consumers just weren't ready to embrace first-generation AI technology and were simply waiting to see what it was and how it worked. Even Apple's die-hard fans could have been looking to sidestep the bumps in the road that any new tech tends to run into.
Whatever the case, after a tough year, Apple appears to be getting back to its old impressive self.
For what it's worth, despite all the recent selling, Apple is still Berkshire Hathaway's biggest stock holding, occupying more than 20% of its portfolio of publicly traded companies.

Kroger (KR 0.85%) will never be a high-growth name, for the record. The grocery industry is just too mature and too competitive.
Not every investment has to be a growth stock, though. You could still do well with a dividend-paying value name like this one.
Kroger is, of course, one of the nation's biggest grocery chains, operating 2,731 stores that serve more than 11 million customers every day. Last year, it turned in a net operating profit of more than $3.8 billion and net income of nearly $2.7 billion, which is huge by grocery store standards.
But still -- groceries? Don't dismiss the way this company is modernizing (and even digitizing) this old brick-and-mortar business. For instance, while its same-store sales grew 3.4% year over year during the second quarter of 2025, its online sales improved by 16%. That's business which could have easily been lost to rival Walmart or in some instances even lost to Amazon. Indeed, e-commerce now accounts for about one-tenth of Kroger's revenue.
In the meantime, Kroger is monetizing its online presence in an even more creative way -- through advertising. National brands can now pay the grocer for more prominent promotion at Kroger.com.
Perhaps the most meaningful way Kroger builds long-term value for shareholders, however, is with its dividend paired with stock buybacks. The forward-looking yield of 2% isn't exactly thrilling, but it's based on a dividend payment that's now been raised for 19 consecutive years at an average annualized growth rate of 13%. At the same time, persistent stock repurchases have whittled down the number of outstanding shares of Kroger from roughly 1.6 billion as of 2000 to less than 700 million now, with another $2.5 billion just waiting to be spent on buybacks before the end of this year.
This might help put things in perspective: Between the buybacks, reinvested dividends, and the stock's simple price appreciation, over the course of the past 20 years, an investment in Kroger stock would have outperformed the same-sized investment in an S&P 500 index fund.
BYD Company
Finally, add BYD Company (BYDDY 1.78%) to your list of Buffett stock picks that just might belong in your portfolio as well.
You may think you've never heard of it, but you're probably more familiar with it than you realize. Remember the electric vehicle (EV) company that became bigger than Tesla (as measured by unit sales) early this year? That's BYD. You've just heard little about it because the Chinese company primarily serves the Chinese market.
That's changing, though. While you still can't purchase a BYD-made EV in the United States, registrations of BYD vehicles in Europe soared more than 200% to 13,503 in July of this year, extending a growth streak that's most definitely taking a toll on Tesla's share in the EV-receptive market.
In fact, the company's so confident of this continued growth that it's committed to manufacturing all of its EVs intended for European drivers within Europe by 2028. Indeed, BYD is aiming to sell half of its cars outside of China by 2030. With a fleet of seven massive cargo ships that can each carry thousands of vehicles, it could do it regardless of where these cars end up being manufactured.
Although U.S. consumer interest in EVs is only lukewarm (at best), the International Energy Agency predicts the worldwide number of EVs will quadruple between the end of last year and 2030.
It's admittedly not Buffett's usual kind of stock pick. He's frequently touted the value of America's capitalistic economy and the ingenuity it inspires, and tends to limit his holdings to U.S. stocks. For the record, it's not as if Berkshire owns a massive number of BYD shares. Its 162.6 million shares are only worth about $2.3 billion at this time or less than 1% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.
The fact that Buffett made the unusual trade in the first place back in 2008 and has since stuck with most of the position this whole time, however, speaks volumes about its potential.",1174,trafilatura,,False

- The new store is seen by many as a symbol of Detroit's ongoing revitalization.
- Hundreds of customers lined up for the opening, which coincided with the release of the new iPhone 17.
Apple CEO Tim Cook made a surprise appearance in Detroit on Friday, Sept. 19, thrilling a crowd of hundreds who had lined up to check out the new downtown Apple Store.
Amid loud cheers and clapping, the famous tech executive opened the front doors of the store for business at 5 p.m. He then lingered outside for several minutes, shaking hands and posing for selfies as customers streamed in.
There were several hundred people waiting in line to enter the new store at 1430 Woodward Ave., next to the Shinola Hotel. The arrival of a downtown Apple Store has been a long-awaited event in the city and is viewed by many downtown boosters as a further demonstration of Detroit's comeback after years of struggles and the 2013-14 municipal bankruptcy.
Robert Pawlowski, 20, of Southgate, was among the lucky several dozen store visitors who had a chance to meet and exchange words with the Apple CEO.
""One thing I can cross off on my bucket list is meeting Tim Cook,"" he said. “I got a selfie and I shook his hand.""
Those in line for the new Detroit store included a mix of Apple customers who were eager to buy the new iPhone 17, which had its in-store release date Friday, along with those simply curious to see the new store.
Aaron Murphy, 32, who lives downtown, said the new store means that he no longer has to drive to Troy to visit the Apple Store in Somerset Collection mall.
“I crack the screen on my phone a lot, so I’m out there a lot,"" Murphy said.
Also in line was Kenera Colley, 31, who moved to downtown Detroit from Texas this summer. She said she joined the Apple Store line just to experience the excitement and see what was going on.
""I love Detroit — it's growing on me!"" she said.
Another high-level Apple executive at the grand opening was Deirdre O'Brien, the company's senior vice president of Retail + People.
Asked by the Free Press whether the company has any plans to replace the Apple Store that recently closed at The Mall at Partridge Creek in Macomb County, she offered an emailed response:
""We loved serving our customers in Partridge Creek, and while we don’t have anything to announce today, we are always looking for opportunities to connect with even more customers in Michigan.""
O'Brien also explained why Apple decided to put a store in downtown Detroit.
""Apple Downtown Detroit, our first downtown store, has been years in the making and marks a historic moment for the company,"" she said in the email.
""Detroit has a special place in our hearts: as the home to an Apple Developer Academy in partnership with Michigan State University, as well as the Apple Manufacturing Academy, which we recently opened right here in downtown. We couldn’t be more excited to be expanding our investment in the city with opening of this new store.""

company,1758292200,Prediction: This AI Growth Stock Will Become Europe's First $1 Trillion Company by 2035,136817997,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AAPL,Yahoo,"Even near a 52-week high, ASML has plenty of room to run for patient investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2b7bde98783357de6cea9864dd5240c863df836525404dbfedb822bdd9b0168d,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,200.0,"On Sept. 15, Alphabet joined Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple as the fourth U.S. company to surpass $3 trillion in market capitalization. But turn your attention across the pond, and there is not a single European company that is worth over $1 trillion, or even half that amount.
Here's why Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML -1.55%) is the best-positioned company to surpass $1 trillion in market cap within the next decade.
Why leading European companies are much smaller than top U.S. companies
The European stock market is highly fragmented. Instead of being viewed as European Union companies, Siemens is a German company, Novo Nordisk is a Danish company, and Shell is a British company. It would be like if U.S. investors viewed Oracle and Tesla as Texas companies versus Microsoft and Amazon as Washington companies.
There are also different regulations in Europe and more conservative pension and funding rules. Companies tend to be more specialized, although there are some conglomerates, like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, that united French luxury brands in the 1980s.
Most importantly, European stock markets simply haven't benefited from technology as much as the U.S. Many of Europe's largest companies aren't tech enterprises. In contrast, the U.S. stock market is dominated by tech-focused companies like the ""Ten Titans"" that continue to make up a larger share of the S&P 500. The U.S. is the tech capital of the world, and the tech sector makes up around a third of the S&P 500 -- illustrating its importance in the U.S. market.
ASML is an anchor in the AI industry
ASML popped 6.5% on Monday after a sell-side analyst who had been neutral on the stock upgraded it to a buy. The move pushed ASML's market cap to $341 billion -- making it the most valuable European company, even ahead of LVMH. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years, ASML would need a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% -- which seems reasonable for a cutting-edge technology company that heavily benefits from artificial intelligence (AI).
There's no contest that ASML is my top AI stock to buy now and hold for the long term. Holding a stock for years or even decades takes a lot of conviction. For ASML, the essential ingredient in the investment thesis recipe is its monopoly over the most complex part of the semiconductor manufacturing process. ASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems use lenses to print features on microchips.
There are plenty of companies that make DUV machines, including Nikon and Canon, which specialize in camera lenses. However, what sets ASML apart is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. These machines use mirrors to reflect light because EUV light has a wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers (almost X-ray range), which is too small to pass through glass. At a wavelength that small, a glass lens would absorb the light instead of bending/refracting it.
Achieving such a small wavelength unlocks untold efficiency improvements, allowing ASML's machines to pack more transitions per chip by printing more precise features (narrower lines, smaller spacing, etc.). It's an incredible engineering feat, and one that is driving advancements in AI.
EUV's smaller wavelength, fewer steps, and high efficiency make it a must-have for fabs like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung Electronics, and Intel to handle increasingly sophisticated designs from Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.
Steady growth at a great value
Despite the long-term potential, ASML warned investors during its last quarterly earnings release that it may not grow in 2026 -- which sparked a steep sell-off in the stock. However, ASML reaffirmed its 2030 targets. The high end of its guidance range calls for doubling revenue relative to 2024 levels. Additionally, ASML expects its gross margin to expand to the high 50% range, likely because high-margin EUVs are expected to make up an increasingly larger percentage of its sales mix compared to DUVs.
Even after its run-up, ASML sports a reasonable 31 forward price-to-earnings ratio, which is far cheaper than many other fast-growing AI stocks, especially considering ASML's strong moat in EUV technology. What's more, the company has a strong dividend. Currently yielding 0.8%, the quarterly payout is a nice cherry on top for investors seeking to add some passive income to their long-term holdings.
Round out your AI portfolio with ASML
ASML isn't a high-flying AI stock that is heavily disrupting cloud computing or making next-generation chips. Nor is it a tech conglomerate like Microsoft and Alphabet, which have a lot of moving parts in addition to their AI focus. However, ASML is well positioned to grow earnings by double digits over the long term, in lockstep with fabs expanding their manufacturing capacity to meet AI demand.
The stock is an especially attractive buy for investors who have valuation concerns about the current market, especially leading S&P 500 tech stocks. However, it's important to understand that ASML's results can swing based on its order volumes from key customers, as well as geopolitical tensions and trade policy.
Although ASML is a Dutch company, it is heavily influenced by U.S. trade actions. So, ASML's growth could stall in the near term due to factors outside of its control. Therefore, it's best to approach the stock with a long-term mindset, especially as a balanced play bridging the gap between growth and value.
In sum, ASML will benefit from higher chip demand, especially from AI. The stock may be a perfect buy for investors with exposure to other aspects of the value chain, such as the chip designers, fabs, or cloud computing plays. Adding an equipment supplier like ASML, rather than doubling down on just one part of AI, is a great way for investors to build a diversified portfolio.",947,trafilatura,,False

Here's what investors need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Tick Higher as Major Indexes Look to Add to Records
Stock futures are slightly higher after markets hit record highs yesterday on a surge in tech stocks. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were each up about 0.1% recently. The Russell 2000 small-cap index recorded its first record close since November 2021 on Thursday amid optimism about the prospect for further interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, is at 4.14% this morning, up from yesterday's close. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is down slightly at around $116,500, while gold futures are holding steady at around $3,680 an ounce.
2. Trump, Xi Set to Discuss TikTok Ownership Deal
President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday to negotiate a deal to keep video app TikTok operating in the U.S., according to media reports. The call is expected to come at around 9 a.m. ET. A reported framework for a deal would have Oracle (ORCL) lead a consortium of companies that operate the social media app. Trump this week signed an executive order to push back a deadline for Chinese owner ByteDance to divest its ownership of the company, extending it to mid-December. Oracle shares were up about 1% in premarket trading.
3. Apple iPhone 17 Goes on Sale, Strong Demand Reported
Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 17 lineup went on sale Friday, reportedly drawing long lines of customers in Europe and Asia amid strong demand for the new products—especially for the Pro models. The iPhone 17 features four models, including the “Air,” its thinnest model to date. Other models feature longer battery life, more scratch-resistant materials, and better cameras than earlier models. Apple stock has lost 5% of its value since the start of the year, making it the only member of the Magnificent 7 group of mega-cap tech companies to lose ground. Investors have been concerned that Apple has been slow to bring artificial intelligence features into its products. Apple shares were up about 1% ahead of the bell on Friday.
4. FedEx Shares Gain After Company Reinstates Full-Year Outlook
FedEx (FDX) shares moved higher as the company reinstated its full-year outlook, after suspending it in June over tariff uncertainty. FedEx said it expects 4% to 6% revenue growth this fiscal year, above analysts' estimates as compiled by Visible Alpha. FedEx posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.83 on revenue that climbed close to 3% to $22.2 billion in the first quarter, topping analysts' estimates, as volumes in the U.S. rose. The shipper also said it's on track to reduce costs by $1 billion in fiscal 2026 and spin off its freight business by next June. FedEx shares, which had lost about a fifth of their value so far in 2025 coming into today's session, were up about 1% in recent premarket trading, well off their earlier gains.
5. Shares of Homebuilder Lennar Fall as Earnings Drop, Revenue Misses Expectations
Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) reported declining quarterly profits amid continued sluggishness in the U.S. housing market. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.29 for its fiscal third quarter, above analyst estimates tracked by Visible Alpha, but lower than the $4.26 it reported in the year-ago quarter. Lennar’s quarterly revenue of $8.8 billion was more than 6% lower than the year-ago quarter and below the Visible Alpha consensus. Lennar increased new orders by 12%, but it had to rely on incentives to achieve those results, sending the average sales price down to $383,000 and reducing its gross margin by 17.5%.

- Apple's iPhone 17 lineup went on sale Friday, with early sales of the devices across the U.S, Europe and Asia reportedly drawing long lines amid strong demand—especially for the Pro models.
- The phones have met with a mixed reaction from analysts with some saying they are waiting for AI-powered upgrades to the models next year.
- Apple shares have struggled this year amid Wall Street consensus that its devices have been slow to catch up in the AI race.
Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 17 lineup went on sale Friday, with early sales of the devices in the U.S and the rest of the world reportedly drawing long lines amid strong demand—especially for the Pro models.
The queues began in Asia and Europe then continued in the U.S., where CEO Tim Cook greeted a long line of customers at the company’s flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York City.
The tech giant introduced the lineup earlier this month and opened them up for pre-orders, with the new phones including a thinner model, the iPhone Air, as well the more expensive iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and iPhone Air and also new Apple Watch and AirPods models. The iPhone 17 Pro is selling for $1,099, up $100 from the iPhone 16 Pro, with storage of 256 gigabytes, or double the previous model's and a longer battery life.
The phones had met with mixed reaction from analysts, with some, like Morgan Stanley, calling the iPhone Air “a small positive surprise” while others said they are waiting for AI-powered updates to the lineup that could give Apple’s stock, the sole underperformer among the Mag 7 tech giants, a bigger catalyst for gains.
Apple's Slow Rollout of AI Features Have Hit Its Stock
The shares have been under pressure on the back of Wall Street concerns that the tech firm has been slow out of the gate in the AI race, with even the new devices lagging at a time when analysts increasingly are touting wearables like smart glasses as a key device to access the technology. Apple has also been increasingly losing ground in China, the world’s largest smartphone market, to domestic rivals like Huawei and Oppo.
According to CNBC, demand is especially strong for the Pro and Pro Max models, with lines in London “notably longer” than they were for the iPhone 16 and consumers in Beijing queuing up the night before to get their hands on the models following strong pre-order sales in China.
Bloomberg said demand for the phones was also strong in Hong Kong, though noted some consumers in China were complaining on social media that they were easily scuffed.
Apple shares are rising 3% in intraday trading Friday and have lost 2% of their value so far this year.

Investors closely parsed Fed chair Jerome Powell’s remarks, which hinted at the potential for more rapid monetary easing over the next year.
On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 11-1 to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, with Trump ally Stephen Miran dissenting in favor of a deeper half-point cut. The Fed’s latest projections point to two more cuts this year, which would bring the federal funds target range down to 3.50%–3.75% by December.
October is historically a strong month for bitcoin
Crypto investors highlighted the seasonal pattern that often favours bitcoin during this stretch of the annual calendar.
“Since 2020, every September FOMC (except during the 2022 bear) has set bitcoin (BTC-USD) up for a massive pump,” entrepreneur and bitcoin investor Lark Davis wrote on X. “It’s less about the decision itself, and more about seasonality. Bitcoin thrives in this stretch. Uptober is real.”

Ethereum (ETH-USD) gained 1% over the past 24 hours, but still remains trapped in a four-week band under the $4,900 mark.
Other major cryptocurrencies have advanced, with dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Binance’s BNB (BNB-EUR) token both up more than 4%, while XRP (XRP-USD) rose nearly 3% following a bullish breakout pattern.
Solana briefly topped $245, rising by almost 4% as optimism grew around CME Group’s plan to launch SOL and XRP options on October 13, a move seen as opening the door to greater institutional involvement.
Still, not all observers were convinced the Fed’s latest cut was a clear positive. “The weakening labor market ultimately convinced the FOMC to cut the rate, but this decision is not a clear positive with recent data showing inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target,” said Jai Kedia, research fellow at the Cato Institute. “Monetary policy rules would advocate keeping rates steady or even a minor increase.”

- U.S Steel (now owned by Nippon Steel) became the world's first $1 billion enterprise in 1901.
- General Motors rode the automotive boom to beat every other company to the $10 billion milestone in 1955.
- General Electric built a conglomerate that became the world's first $100 billion business in 1995.
- Apple crossed the most significant milestone of all in 2018, when successful products like the iPhone catapulted the company to a $1 trillion valuation.
There are now nine American companies with valuations of at least $1 trillion, and four of them have graduated into the ultra-exclusive $3 trillion club: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) (GOOGL -0.15%).
Alphabet is the newest member, having officially joined on Monday, Sept. 15. It's the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and more, all of which are being supercharged by artificial intelligence (AI).
Its stock is in the neighborhood of a record high right now, but its attractive valuation suggests more upside could be on the way. Read on.
Google Search turned AI from a threat into a tailwind
Wall Street expects Alphabet to generate a record $394 billion in total revenue during 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. Google Search is likely to account for more than half of that figure on its own, so it's the company's most important segment by far.
When AI chatbots like ChatGPT went mainstream two years ago, investors feared they would drive internet traffic away from Google Search because they offered a faster, more convenient way to find information online. However, Alphabet mounted an aggressive response to protect its golden goose.
The company developed a family of large language models (LLMs) called Gemini -- and its own chatbot, which bears the same name -- to compete with start-ups like OpenAI. And those LLMs also power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews, which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to create more comprehensive answers to search queries.
Overviews appear above the traditional Google results, so users no longer have to spend time sifting through web pages to find the information they need. Over 2 billion people are using them every month, and Alphabet says they generate advertising revenue at roughly the same rate as regular Google Search outputs, so they aren't hurting the company's core business.
Google Search's revenue growth actually accelerated from 9.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to 11.7% during the second quarter, suggesting the business is building momentum, not slowing down. This offers some proof that AI Overviews are having the desired effect.
Google Cloud is Alphabet's growth engine
Google Search might be Alphabet's biggest business, but Google Cloud is the fastest growing. It generated a record $13.6 billion in revenue during the second quarter, which was up 32% year over year. That growth rate accelerated from 28% in the first quarter.
Google Cloud operates state-of-the-art data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers such as Nvidia, and it rents the computing capacity to developers, which use it to build AI software. The platform also offers access to hundreds of ready-made LLMs, including Gemini, which developers can use to accelerate their progress. Over 85,000 organizations are now using Gemini to create AI software.
This business still has plenty of room to grow because it had a $106 billion order backlog at the end of the second quarter, from customers waiting for more data center capacity to come online. That was up 38% year over year, so based on Google Cloud's revenue growth during the quarter, demand appears to be increasing even faster than supply.
The stock still looks cheap
The U.S. Department of Justice won a lawsuit against Alphabet last year, which determined that the company used monopolistic practices to safeguard its market share in the internet search industry. For example, Alphabet paid Apple enormous annual fees to make Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone, making it almost impossible for other search engines to compete.
Lawmakers sought to break up Alphabet by forcing it to sell certain assets, which could have significantly disrupted the company's ability to generate revenue. Its valuation has been suppressed for the last couple of years while this saga played out, as investors braced for the worst.
But earlier this month, the judge in the case handed down a rather lenient decision that will allow management to continue paying partners like Apple, as long as the deals aren't exclusive. He also declined to support the Justice Department's proposed breakup.
Alphabet stock has surged by almost 20% since the ruling, which catapulted the company into the $3 trillion club. But with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 26.8, it's still the cheapest stock in the ""Magnificent Seven"" (a group of peers operating at the forefront of the AI industry), as shown in the chart below.
For that reason, I think Alphabet stock still has plenty of room to run.",832,trafilatura,,False

Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) rose nearly 3% in pre-market trading on Thursday after the company announced a $5bn investment in fellow chipmaker Intel (INTC).
Nvidia (NVDA) said it will invest $5bn in Intel's common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. This came as part of an announcement that the two companies would be working together to develop artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and personal computing products.
Shares in struggling chipmaker Intel (INTC) soared 29% in pre-market trading on the back of the announcement.
Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that Nvidia's (NVDA) investment in Intel (INTC) is ""less about money and more about influence"".
""The deal deepens cooperation between two US chip giants, with Intel set to use Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPU technology and Nvidia gaining a stronger foothold in domestic chip production,"" he said.

""For Intel, this is another welcome boost, both financially and strategically, as it leans on Nvidia (NVDA) to stay competitive,"" said Britzman.

Nvidia (NVDA) was also in focus following a report that China has banned the country's major technology companies from buying its AI chips.
The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told firms, including ByteDance and Alibaba (9988.HK, BABA) to stop their testing and orders of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, citing three people with knowledge of the matter.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told press in London on Wednesday: ""We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be.""

One of these moves was buying Apple (AAPL 0.62%) stock in 2016, despite famously avoiding technology stocks because he considered them outside his area of expertise. Another was selling a big chunk of his Apple holdings this year, despite its market-crushing returns.
Even as he was selling a big chunk of his big winner Apple, Buffett hung on to his entire stake in Coca-Cola (KO -0.82%), which has been one of his worst performers lately. Does Buffett know something we don't? Should investors consider following the ""Oracle of Omaha"" into a position?
A massive stake
Buffett's stake in Coca-Cola is huge. Berkshire Hathaway owns 400 million shares of the beverage giant, with a current market value of $28.3 billion. That represents 11% of Berkshire's entire stock holdings.
Coca-Cola is roughly tied with Bank of America (BAC 0.11%) as the third-largest position in Berkshire's stock portfolio, behind its longtime $48.4 billion stake in American Express (AXP 0.18%) at No. 2. Buffett's aforementioned Apple position, currently worth $57.4 billion, is still his top holding, even after he sold 20 million shares in the second quarter.
Berkshire first bought Coca-Cola shares in 1988, and continued buying through 1994, at which point Buffett had invested $1.3 billion in the company. Just over 30 years later, not only are his shares worth more than 21 times what he paid for them, he'll rake in $816 million in dividend payments -- more than 60% of his initial investment -- this year alone. That's one amazing set of returns!
But what have you done for me lately?
Coca-Cola may be one of Buffett's biggest holdings, but recently it certainly hasn't been one of the best. If we look at the performance of Buffett's biggest holdings since the time he bought Apple in 2016, there's a clear winner and a clear loser.
| Stock/Index | Total Returns Since 3/31/2016 |
|---|---|
| Apple | 846.5% |
| American Express | 507.3% |
| Bank of America | 361.5% |
| S&P 500 Index | 276.7% |
| Berkshire Hathaway | 248% |
| Coca-Cola | 93.4% |
Yes, if Buffett had sold his Coca-Cola stock and put the money into any one of his other top holdings -- or even just used it to buy back Berkshire shares, or invest in an S&P 500 index fund -- he would have had astronomically better returns. Incidentally, it doesn't matter if you go back a few more years: Coca-Cola's returns -- on both a total return basis and a straight price basis -- have lagged the others all the way back to the Great Recession (at which point Coca-Cola finally starts outperforming Bank of America only).
So, why does Buffett keep hanging on to this longtime dud, and what does it mean for the rest of us?
Great for dividends, not for growth
Warren Buffett is a big fan of Coke as a beverage. In 2023, he claimed to drink five Cokes a day, and said he would rather give up a year of his life than stop doing so. However, he's also a big fan of Coca-Cola as a reliable, well-managed business.
In his 1988 letter to shareholders, Buffett extolled Coca-Cola's business model, saying of the company: ""[W]hen we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever."" In his 2022 letter, he focused on the dividend-paying power of Coca-Cola:
The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke's quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to [continue to] grow.
Buffett is right about that. As a Dividend King, Coca-Cola is likely to continue increasing its dividend payouts every year, even though its yield is already an above-average 3%. Investors looking for stability and a rock-solid dividend can't do much better than Coca-Cola. For growth-focused investors, or those looking for market-beating performance over the long term, there much are better opportunities elsewhere.",703,trafilatura,,False

But the artificial intelligence (AI) boom upset those rankings, helping AI giant Nvidia to zoom ahead into the top spot, with a market value of more than $4 trillion. In recent days, another AI player has seen its market value increase, pushing it into the $3 trillion club with Apple and Microsoft.
Of course, this isn't actually a real club with membership rules and benefits, but rather a way of referring to the few companies that have reached such an enormous market capitalization. It's important to note that all these players are in the tech industry, and each is involved in AI to a certain degree. Let's take a look at this new addition to the exclusive group of $3 trillion stocks and find out whether it's one to buy.
Billion-dollar earnings
So, which company has passed the key level of $3 trillion, bringing it closer to market giants Apple and Microsoft? I'm talking about Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) (GOOGL -0.15%), owner of something you probably use every day -- the world's No. 1 search engine, Google. On top of this, Alphabet is the parent of high-growth cloud business Google Cloud and generates revenue through the sale of hardware such as smartphones. All these businesses have helped Alphabet deliver billion-dollar revenue and profit quarter after quarter.
Alphabet has also become a key player in the field of AI, offering a vast number of services through Google Cloud, which has supercharged that unit's revenue in recent years. In the latest quarter, the company reported that cloud revenue soared 32% to more than $13 billion, boosted by AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions.
The company has been using AI itself to make gains across its Google Search business, too. For example, Alphabet's large language model (LLM) Gemini is improving advertisements across the platform to generate better results. Considering ads are Alphabet's biggest revenue driver, this is an important move that may prompt advertisers to spend more.
An antitrust lawsuit
This paints a very bright picture, but in recent times, one particular risk darkened the image: a U.S. antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet. A district court ruled last year that Alphabet's Google was an illegal monopoly, and the U.S. Justice Department recommended a breakup of Google. Though many investors (including myself) didn't expect this worst-case scenario to unfold, the possibility still represented a headwind for the stock.
Earlier this month, though, a district judge ruled that Alphabet wouldn't be ordered to sell Google's Chrome browser or the Android operating system. Instead, the decision ordered Alphabet to share search data with rivals. Removing the worst scenario from the landscape, the decision drove Alphabet shares higher and helped the company's market value advance past $3 trillion.
Now, let's return to our question: Following this much-awaited outcome, is now a good time to buy Alphabet stock? As mentioned, Alphabet's businesses are going strong -- and the latest court ruling suggests this trend will continue. The company's leadership in search, along with its use of AI, should keep ad revenue climbing, and overall demand for AI is set to power Alphabet's cloud revenue growth.
The cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" stock
Alphabet's recent gain in market value alone isn't a reason to buy the stock, but the other positive points I've mentioned all add to the buy case for this stock. ""But what about price?"" you might ask. Even though Alphabet's valuation had increased, it remains reasonable at 25 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock is still the cheapest among all the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- these are the tech players that have driven market gains over the past two years.
Alphabet's valuation today, despite the recent share price performance, also supports the idea of getting in on this tech player.
Of course, Alphabet faces competition in the cloud business, and the company must continue to invest heavily to meet the needs of AI customers. But this tech player has the strength to do so and is well positioned to be among the AI winners as this growth story continues. All this means that today, after the biggest headwind has subsided, is the perfect time to buy Alphabet shares.",704,trafilatura,,False

Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England said interest rates must be cut “gradually and carefully” after voting to hold borrowing costs. Members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) were split 7-2 on the decision, with Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor backing a quarter of a percentage point reduction.
Bailey said: “We held interest rates at 4% today. Although we expect inflation to return to our 2% target, we’re not out of the woods yet so any future cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.”

It comes as the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the rate to its lowest level for more than two years at its last meeting in August. However, analysts believe there will be no further cuts this year.
Money markets have increasingly priced out the possibility of another cut in 2025, assigning less than a 30% chance of a reduction before year-end. Most traders now anticipate the next move will come in April 2026 at the earliest.
Additionally, the MPC also decided to dial back the speed of its “quantitative tightening” (QT) programme, to £70bn over the next year. That’s down from £100bn over the last 12 months. City economists had expected the QT programme to be cut to around £70bn, so the decision fell in line with forecasts.

Gold dips after Federal Reserve cuts interest rates Gold prices retreated on Thursday morning, pulling back from record highs after the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and signalled a measured path of monetary easing for the remainder of the year. At the time of writing, gold futures (GC=F) dropped 1.2% to $3,674 per ounce, while the spot price of gold retreated 0.7% to $3,647.93 a troy ounce, after hitting a record high of $3,707.40 during Wednesday's session. The Fed reduced rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday to 4%-4.25%. The Federal Open Market Committee projected two further cuts in 2025, but just one in 2026, reinforcing a cautious approach to monetary policy. Chair Jerome Powell characterised the move as a “risk-management cut” in response to signs of a softening labour market and heightened employment risks. “We’ll be taking decisions meeting by meeting,” Powell said, hinting that a series of aggressive reductions is not on the table. The Fed’s measured tone prompted some investors to lock in profits following gold’s recent surge. ""The Fed is signalling uncertainty with Powell calling this a 'risk-management' cut which has triggered some quite understandable profit-taking,"" Tai Wong, an independent metals trader, told Reuters. ""A retracement or at least a consolidation is healthy; I don't expect an unusually deep pullback. Unless we get below major technical support at $3,550, the short-term uptrend should remain intact,"" he added.
India payment cards market to surpass $704bn in 2025 India’s payment card transaction value (including point-of-sale (POS) payments and ATM cash withdrawals) is estimated to reach INR59.2 trillion ($704.4bn) in 2025, supported by growing preference for electronic payments and rise in consumer spending, GlobalData said. Its payment card analysis revealed that card payments value (including payments at POS and initiated remotely) in India registered a growth rate of 7.8% in 2024 to reach INR27.5 trillion ($328.9 billion). Amid the rising consumer spending, decreasing interest rates and inflation, card payments value is estimated to reach INR30.1 trillion ($358 billion) in 2025 registering a higher growth rate of 9.4%. Conversely, the usage of cards for ATM cash withdrawals is on decline with the total ATM cash withdrawals value set to decline by 4.9% in 2025e. Yasaswini Pujitha, banking and payments analyst at GlobalData, said: Card payments represent 50.8% of the total payment card transaction value, slightly outpacing ATM cash withdrawals in 2025e. The RBI announcement to increase ATM withdrawal fees from INR21 ($0.25) to INR23 ($0.27) for transactions exceeding the monthly limit of five free withdrawals, from May 2025, is expected to further discourage cash withdrawals.

Nvidia to invest $5bn in Intel The world’s leading chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has announced a new partnership with struggling semiconductor company Intel (INTC). Nvidia and Intel will team up to work on custom data centres that form the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure as well as personal computer products, Nvidia said in a press release. Nvidia also said it is investing $5bn (£3.6bn) in the common stock of Intel, which has been struggling. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals. The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut. Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that has propelled Nvidia into the world’s most valuable company. In premarket trading, Intel shares soared 30%.
Bond yields little changed Bank of England’s decision to slow the pace of its quantitative tightening programme has caused a muted reaction in the bond market on Thursday. The yields, or interest rate, on UK 10 and 30-year bonds are little changed on the back of the news, with no meaningful change to prices. Kathleen Brooks, research director at brokerage XTB, said:
Bitcoin price climbs above $117K after Fed interest rate cut Bitcoin (BTC-USD) extended gains on Thursday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, its first reduction in nine months. The world’s largest digital asset (BTC-USD), climbed above $117,000 (£85,840) on Thursday, its highest level since August 17. The move ended a week-long sideways trend and lifted the broader crypto market following the Federal Reserve’s dovish policy shift. Investors closely parsed Fed chair Jerome Powell’s remarks, which hinted at the potential for more rapid monetary easing over the next year. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 11-1 to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, with Trump ally Stephen Miran dissenting in favor of a deeper half-point cut. The Fed’s latest projections point to two more cuts this year, which would bring the federal funds target range down to 3.50%–3.75% by December. Crypto investors highlighted the seasonal pattern that often favours bitcoin during this stretch of the annual calendar. “Since 2020, every September FOMC (except during the 2022 bear) has set bitcoin (BTC-USD) up for a massive pump,” entrepreneur and bitcoin investor Lark Davis wrote on X. “It’s less about the decision itself, and more about seasonality. Bitcoin thrives in this stretch. Uptober is real.” Read more here
Taiwan holds interest rates at 2% It's certainly has been a busy week this week for central bank rate decisions, and today we also had news that Taiwan’s CBC left its borrowing costs unchanged amid “rapid economic growth and low inflation”. The central bank kept interest rates at 2% after its economy expanded 3.1% in the second quarter thanks to booming exports related to demand surrounding AI. Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics said:
Bank of England slows quantitative tightening in boost for Rachel Reeves The Bank of England (BoE) has reduced its quantitative tightening (QT) envelope from £100bn to £70bn with a broad landing zone of £65-75bn. The move comes as a potential boost for Rachel Reeves ahead of her November budget amid concerns the bank was pushing up borrowing costs by smothering the bond market with UK debt. The bank's quantitative tightening programme influences how much money the chancellor will have to keep the public finances in balance, adding to the cost of servicing the national debt. A slowdown in how fast the BoE reduces its balance sheet could help lower yields on bond markets, which is the return that issuers of debt, such as the Treasury, must pay to buyers. Under the QT programme, Threadneedle Street has been selling some of the government bonds it bought during the financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. It will lower its stock of UK government bond purchases by £70bn over the next year, taking its total to £488bn. Since 2022, the BoE has reduced its gilt holdings from £875bn to £558bn. The monetary policy committee (MPC) was split over its decision to slow the pace of its bond-selling programme on Thursday. Seven MPC members, Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor, voted in favour of cutting its UK government bond purchases by £70bn over the next year. However, Catherine Mann wanted a larger slowdown in QT, cutting sales to £62bn over the next year. Chief economist Huw Pill voted to cut stocks by £100bn, meaning the same pace of reduction as over the last 12 months. Governor Andrew Bailey said:
MPC in 7-2 vote split Members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) were split 7-2 on today's interest rate decision, with Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor backing a quarter of a percentage point reduction. Andrew Bailey said:
Bank of England holds interest rates at 4% The Bank of England opted to hold interest rates steady at 4% on Thursday, defying hopes for further monetary easing this year and dealing a blow to mortgage holders and borrowers across the UK. The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had previously lowered the Bank rate from 4.25% to 4% at its August meeting, the first cut in over two years. However, with inflation proving more stubborn than anticipated, Thursday’s decision signals a more cautious approach from Threadneedle Street. Fresh inflation data published on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose by 3.8% in August, nearly double the Bank’s 2% target and unchanged from the previous month. Analysts widely interpreted the figures as a sign that further rate cuts are unlikely in the near term. Money markets have increasingly priced out the possibility of another cut in 2025, assigning less than a 30% chance of a reduction before year-end. Most traders now anticipate the next move will come in April 2026 at the earliest. Read the full article here
IonQ continues to pop after completion of Oxford Ionics acquisition Shares in quantum computing company IonQ (IONQ) popped nearly 8% in pre-market trading on Thursday. The jump in shares came after IonQ announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the US Department of Energy to advance the development and deployment of quantum technologies in space. Niccolo de Masi, CEO of IonQ, said: ""By working alongside the DOE, we aim to demonstrate the power of quantum computing and networking to enable new applications for secure communications."" ""This MOU reflects the growing importance of quantum technologies in achieving global leadership in space innovation and cybersecurity."" In addition, IonQ said on Wednesday that it had completed the acquisition of UK-based firm Oxford Ionics, as well as announcing plans to buy US company Vector Atomic.
UK's Octopus Energy to spin off technology arm Kraken Octopus Energy said on Thursday it would spin its technology arm Kraken Technologies off and named Tim Wan as the newly separated company's chief financial officer, as Britain largest electricity supplier focuses on its core operations. Kraken, which provides energy software technology to energy majors including EDF, National Grid US and Tokyo Gas, has hit $500m in committed annual revenue through licensing deals. The separation will give Kraken independence to invest and expand as needed, and help reassure Kraken's clients about any potential conflicts of interest from being owned by a competitor. ""Kraken is now a globally successful business in its own right, operating independently for some time – completing our journey to full independence is a strategic and inevitable next step,"" Kraken CEO Amir Orad said in a statement. Incoming CFO Wan was the finance chief at US-listed software platform Asana from 2017 until 2024 where he oversaw the company's market listing. While Octopus Energy did not provide specifics of Kraken's spin off, a Sky News report in July said the technology group could be valued at as much as 10 billion pounds ($13.63 billion), if separated. The spin off is also expected to boost Australian electricity and gas retailer Origin Energy, which owns about 23% of Octopus. Origin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Norway cuts interest rates Following on from the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates last night, the Norges Bank has reduced its policy rate from 4.25% to 4% today. It comes as high interest rates have helped to cool the Norwegian economy and dampen inflation. Governor Ida Wolden Bache said: The bank added that “a somewhat higher policy rate will likely be needed ahead compared with the outlook in June”. “If the policy rate is lowered too quickly, inflation could remain above target for too long. On the other hand, an overly tight monetary policy stance could restrain the economy more than needed to bring inflation down to target.”
FTSE risers and fallers Here are today's top risers and fallers on the FTSE 100:
The worst airlines for flight delays More UK flights are delayed now than before the pandemic, with airline Tui (TUI1.DE) ranked worst in punctuality. Data from consumer body Which? showed that Tui (TUI1.DE) was the worst for punctuality, with the lowest average percentage of on-time departures. In 2024-25, an average of 59.2% of Tui's departures were on time, a drop from the 67.2% average from back in 2019. Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) came in second-worst, with 66% of flights delayed, and Ryanair (RYA.IR) third, with only 66.5% of flights departing on time. Next comes easyJet (EZJ.L), with punctuality at the airline coming in at 67.8%. Jet2 (JET2.L) recorded 68% of flights leaving on time in 2024-25, and British Airways (IAG.L) was the most on-time company on the list, with 68.7% of flights leaving on time.

Pets at Home nosedives as profit forecast slips and CEO leaves And stocking with corporate news in London, Pets at Home (PETS.L) shares tumbled 22% in early trade after it announced the sudden departure of its CEO and warned profits would be in the range of £90m-£100m for the year. This was well below the £115m expected and down from £133m last year. It told the City that boss Lyssa McGowan has “left the business with immediate effect”, and that a search for a permanent replacement was underway. Ian Burke, non-executive chair, has assumed the role of executive chair, meaning he will be running the business until a permanent CEO has been found.
Next sounds alarm on UK sales growth Next shares fell sharply on Thursday after revealing a cautious outlook, losing more than 6% in London. The British fashion retailer reported a 13.8% rise in first-half profit and reaffirmed its full-year guidance, but warned that it expects the UK economy to weaken and its sales growth to slow. Next also admitted that vacancies have fallen across the board, down 35% over the last two years, but with deeper falls at its stores. Applications have also increased by 76%, with applications per vacancy 2.7 times higher than two years ago. The company said: The high street bellwether still expects second-half full-price sales growth to slow to 4.5%, versus growth of 10.5% in its second quarter when it benefited from a cyberattack at rival Marks & Spencer. Next maintained its forecast for full-year pre-tax profit of £1.105bn ($1.51bn), up from £1.011bn in 2024/25. Pre-tax profit was £515m in its first half to end July.
Bank of England set to leave rates on hold The Bank of England (BoE) is set announce its latest policy decision at noon today. It is widely expected that Threadneedle Street will keep rates unchanged at 4%. It comes as the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the rate to its lowest level for more than two years at its last meeting in August. However, analysts believe there will be no further cuts during the rest of this year. Money markets are indicating a 97% chance of ‘no change’, and just a 3% possibility of a hike back to 4.25%. Deutsche Bank UK economist Sanjay Raja expects a 7-2 vote split, with Alan Taylor and Swati Dhingra, opting for a quarter-point rate cut. The main focus instead is set to be on any changes to their forward guidance and the quantitative tightening decision. He argued that there is a material risk that the MPC abandons its “gradual and careful” guidance surrounding the downward path for Bank Rate. He also expects the MPC to reduce their QT envelope from £100bn to £70bn with a broad landing zone of £65-75bn. Ahead of the decision, the latest UK inflation data for August came in steady at 3.8% on Wednesday, while core CPI fell to 3.6%, both in line with consensus. Last night, the Federal Reserve cut US interest rates for the first time this year, responding to signs that the jobs market in America is weakening.
US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates Last night, the Federal Reserve cut US interest rates for the first time this year, responding to signs that the jobs market in America is weakening. It lowered the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points, putting it in a range of 4% to 4.25%, the lowest level since late 2022. He also described the decision as a “risk-management cut”, and markets were left feeling less confident on the extent of the likely easing cycle. Treasury yields were higher across the curve by the close with US equities largely flat after a choppy post FOMC in last couple of hours of trading. The Fed’s dot plot saw the median dot narrowly shift from 50bp to 75bps of total cuts for 2025, so implying 25bps cuts at each of the remaining two meetings. The 2026 and 2027 median dots were also 25bps lower at 3.4% and 3.1% respectively even as median growth and inflation projections for 2026 were both revised two-tenths higher compared to June. This suggested a more dovish Fed reaction function to the evolving balance of risks, and in the press conference Chair Powell said it was ""risks that we’re seeing to the labour market” that drove the rate cut as the labour market could no longer be described as “solid”.
Asia and US overnight Stocks in Asia were mixed overnight, with the Nikkei (^N225) rising 1.2% on the day in Japan, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) fell 1.4% in Hong Kong, erasing earlier gains. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) was 1.2% down by the end of the session. In South Korea, the Kospi (^KS11) added 1.4% on the day. It came as Australia's unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2% in August, but employment unexpectedly declined, with the economy losing approximately 5,400 jobs, including a drop of 41,000 in full-time positions, despite an increase in part-time roles. The report implies that the labour market may be gradually softening. There is no change to the house view of a November, February and March series of 25bps cuts to a 2.85% terminal rate but the report leans on the dovish side. Additionally, New Zealand’s economy contracted more than anticipated in the second quarter, as weak manufacturing activity and declining export volumes largely counterbalanced modest growth in private spending. The economy contracted 0.9% compared to the previous quarter, worse than the expected 0.3% decline, and reversing the revised 0.9% increase from the previous quarter. Furthermore, GDP decreased 0.6% year-on-year, falling short of expectations that growth would remain stable. GDP had also declined 0.6% in the first quarter. Across the pond on Wall Street, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 0.3% down after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time this year. The Dow Jones (^DJI) gained 0.6% by the close.

- Alphabet this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted recently by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom
- Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have trended sharply higher this month.
- The measuring principle projects bullish price targets at $261 and $286.53. Investors should also watch key support levels on Alphabet's chart around $215 and $201.
Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom.
The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business.
Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year.
Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for.
September Rally in Focus
Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month.
While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking.
It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers.
Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring.
Bullish Price Targets to Monitor
Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements.
To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value.
When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201).
Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201).
Key Support Levels Worth Watching
The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap.
Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

- Apple shares have declined 5% since the start of the year, making it the only Magnificent Seven stock in the red for the year.
- The iPhone maker has struggled to roll out artificial intelligence features, leading Wall Street to debate whether the company should make an uncharacteristically large acquisition to close the gap with big tech peers that have gone all in on AI.
- Low expectations heading into this year's iPhone upgrade cycle could boost the stock in the near term, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring.
The Magnificent Seven is living up to its name this year, with one glaring exception.
Apple (AAPL) shares have stalled out, with the iPhone maker’s stock down 5% in 2025 as of Tuesday's close. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN), the Mag 7's next-worst performers, are up single digits, and the remainder of the group—Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META)—has gained between 20% and 33%. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up 18% for the year, compared with the S&P 500's 12% gain.
Artificial intelligence, the technology that's sent so many stocks soaring, is the main reason Apple has struggled. The consensus on Wall Street is that Apple was slow out of the gate in the AI race, and has failed to deliver with the AI features released so far.
While other tech giants quickly pivoted to all things AI when ChatGPT took off in late 2022, it took Apple two years to launch its first major AI tool, Apple Intelligence. In the year since, Apple has delayed new features, raising concerns that the company lacks a clear strategy to deploy the increasingly ubiquitous technology.
The Trump administration’s efforts to revive U.S. manufacturing haven’t helped matters. Apple makes the vast majority of its products in China and neighboring countries that may face high tariff rates. While Apple products are currently exempt from tariffs, the White House has repeatedly caught industry off guard with sudden and dramatic changes to trade policy.
What Will It Take for Apple Stock To Catch Up?
“In our view, what needs to be settled before shares can regain more momentum is clarity on Apple’s AI strategy,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in an iPhone 17 release preview earlier this month.
For months, Wall Street has been debating how Apple can turbocharge its AI efforts, whether through acquisitions or partnerships. CEO Tim Cook said in July that Apple is “very open to M&A that accelerates our road map.”
Related Stories
Earlier this year, executives reportedly discussed acquiring AI search start-up Perplexity, which at the time was valued at $14 billion. But the company is notoriously averse to large deals. Despite booking nearly $100 billion in profit last year, Apple’s $3 billion acquisition of headphone maker Beats in 2014 remains its largest transaction to date.
For now, Apple appears to be prioritizing partnerships over acquisitions. In June, the company expanded its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its devices. And Apple is reportedly considering partnering with Alphabet to launch an AI-powered search tool as part of a Siri revamp planned for next year.
Low iPhone 17 Expectations Could Be a Blessing
Woodring sees the potential for iPhone 17 upgrades to give Apple stock a slight boost in the near term.
iPhone launches tend to be “buy the rumor, sell the news” events, with shares running up in anticipation of the event and selling off as products are unveiled. This year’s event was no exception. Apple last week introduced the iPhone Air, its first major iPhone design overhaul in nearly a decade. Shares fell the day of the launch and have been treading water in the week since.
But according to Woodring, low expectations could be to Apple’s advantage. Wall Street consistently underestimated iPhone sales growth between 2011 and 2020, but has repeatedly overestimated growth since then. Woodring predicts this dynamic has made analysts too pessimistic about the upcoming iPhone upgrade cycle.
“The iPhone 17 launch as a ‘sell the news’ negative catalyst could actually turn out to be a positive catalyst for the stock, and set up potential positive estimate revisions and stock outperformance into year-end,” said Woodring.
A report from Bank of America on Tuesday suggested demand for the new line of iPhones is stronger than in recent years. As of Monday, a pre-ordered iPhone 17 was expected to ship within 19 days, compared with the iPhone 16’s 10-day wait at this time last year.
“In fact, the ship dates for the iPhone 17 are the highest since the iPhone 11, which indicates healthy demand,” according to the report.",771,trafilatura,,False

Nvidia, the world's largest company, dominates the AI chip market. Meanwhile, Microsoft's tremendous revenue backlog created by the booming demand for its AI cloud and productivity services is one of the reasons why it is the second-biggest company in the world. Apple, the other name on the $3 trillion-plus market cap list, is also looking to capitalize on the proliferation of AI to supercharge its growth. Alphabet, like Microsoft, is a cloud computing player and digital advertising leader.
However, there is another big tech company that's winning big from AI adoption within its industry and could witness outstanding growth. Let's take a closer look at that name and check why it has the potential to enter the $3 trillion market cap club ahead of peers, including Amazon.
Digital advertising dominance is set to give this tech giant a major boost
Meta Platforms (META 0.71%) is the sixth-largest company in the world with a market cap of $1.9 trillion. It is known for its family of social media applications, including Instagram, Facebook, Threads, and WhatsApp, which have billions of users. This puts Meta in a terrific position to capitalize on the massive digital advertising market.
Grand View Research estimates that the digital ad market could generate $1.1 trillion in revenue in 2030. That would be a huge improvement over last year's revenue of $488 billion. Meta is taking advantage of AI to ensure that it can corner a nice chunk of this massive addressable opportunity on offer. It is using AI to drive stronger engagement across its apps, apart from giving advertisers access to AI tools so that they can improve audience targeting and create ad campaigns easily.
For instance, smaller advertisers can use Meta's generative AI creative tools to create and optimize ad campaigns for Facebook and Instagram, eliminating the need to hire a separate agency. Meanwhile, the AI-recommended content that's driving an increase in time spent on both Facebook and Instagram is another positive for advertisers since they have a chance to capture more eyeballs.
Additionally, Meta's AI advertising tools use real-time data from campaigns so that they can be optimized for better performance, helping advertisers reach a wider audience at lower costs. As mentioned in a company blog post citing a recent study conducted by Meta management: ""This study also assessed the impact of our new AI-driven advertising tools and found that they drive a 22% improvement in return on ad spend for advertisers. This means that for every dollar U.S. advertisers spend with Meta, they see a $4.52 return when they use our new AI-driven advertising tools.""
As such, it is easy to see why Meta is growing at a much faster pace than the digital ad market. Its second-quarter revenue increased 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. For comparison, the digital ad market is predicted to grow by almost 8% in 2025. Meta, therefore, seems to be capturing a bigger chunk of the lucrative digital advertising market. Not surprisingly, Meta expects massive growth in generative AI-fueled revenue, which will be enough to help it join the $3 trillion club.
Meta Platforms projects a massive spike in its AI revenue
In June last year, Meta management estimated that its AI revenue in 2025 could hit at least $2 billion (according to unsealed court documents). By 2035, the company estimates this figure to land between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion. That forecast points toward massive growth considering that Meta is expected to end 2025 with $196 billion in revenue.
But even if Meta's AI revenue lands at the midpoint of its guidance range after a decade, the company would see a massive spike in its top line that could send its market cap way beyond the $3 trillion mark in the long run. Importantly, analysts also updated their growth expectations, and that's not surprising considering the points discussed above.
But then, there is a good chance that the company will be able to outpace these expectations as it has the potential to keep growing at a faster pace than the 15% annual growth that the digital ad market is expected to clock. Assuming it can hit 20% revenue growth in 2026 and 2027, Meta's top line could jump to $282 billion after two years (using 2025's projected revenue of $196.1 billion as the base).

On Wednesday UBS maintains its 'neutral' rating on the Apple stock, along with its $220 target price, saying that data measuring iPhone availability in 30 countries suggested 'mixed' demand for the new iPhone 17, available for pre-order since last Friday.Overall, delivery times in the US suggest that demand for the Pro and Pro Max models is lower than for the iPhone 16, with a waiting time of around 26 days for the iPhone 17 Pro Max compared to around 27 days for the 16 Pro Max and around 39 days for the 15 Pro Max, the analyst said.The wait time for the iPhone 17 Pro is around 12 days, down from 18 days for the launch of the 16 Pro and 23 days for the 15 Pro, he continues.While acknowledging that the arrival of the ultra-thin Air model makes year-on-year comparisons somewhat difficult, UBS highlights a waiting time of around 9 days for the Air, compared to around 8 days for the 16 Plus, which leads it to believe that despite the change in format, demand remains broadly comparable.In the entry-level segment, the wait time for the base 17 model is around 13 days, compared to around eight days last year, an increase that could indicate that consumers are shifting toward lower prices given the high prices of the other three models, which could potentially be negative for the average selling price (ASP) and gross margin if the trend continues, the broker concludes.",251,trafilatura,,False

Just consider this: In July 1975, the entire U.S. GDP barely cleared $1.7 trillion. Fast-forward to 2025, and the five largest companies in the world -- Nvidia (NVDA 1.68%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%), Apple (AAPL 0.62%), Amazon (AMZN 1.01%), and Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) (GOOGL -0.15%) -- individually command valuations at or above that.
At the moment, two companies are within a few hundred billion of the $2 trillion mark. These are Meta (META 0.71%), $1.9 trillion, and Broadcom (AVGO 1.36%), $1.7 trillion.
But there's another company that looks strong enough to cross the $2 trillion mark by 2028, or even sooner than that. Indeed, it's a company without which several tech giants would lose their dominance: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.84%). Here's why I think its market cap of about $1 trillion will double in three years.
Why TSMC fits the $2 trillion thesis
TSMC is the world's first and largest pure-play semiconductor foundry. What that means is simply this: Instead of designing chips, TSMC manufactures them for hundreds of clients. These clients include other trillion-dollar companies, like Nvidia and Apple, as well as semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 6.23%).
Just how dominant TSMC is in the foundry industry can be summed up by two pieces of data: TSMC commands about 70% of the global foundry market (according to data by research firm TrendForce), and it held about 35% of the expanded foundry market for more advanced chips in the first quarter of 2025 (according to Counterpoint Research).
To put it another way, TSMC's second-quarter 2025 foundry revenue was more than $30 billion. The foundry revenue of its closest competitor, Samsung, was about $3.16 billion, according to TrendForce.
TSMC has been dominating the foundry scene since Dr. Morris Chang founded the company in 1987. Superior execution by Chang and his successors has dug TSMC a deep competitive moat in the advanced chip industry. The company is often the first (or sole) supplier for some of the most advanced chips on the market.
What needs to happen for TSMC to hit a $2 trillion valuation by 2028
By now, it's clear that TSMC is in firm control of the foundry market. But the question still remains: Can this company's market cap really double in three years?
One back-of-the-envelope way to answer this is by looking at the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). At today's price, TSMC is trading at about 22 times earnings. If we keep that multiple the same, the company needs to double its net income (projected to hit about $48 billion in 2025) to about $90 billion to $100 billion by 2028.
On paper, that doesn't sound all that outlandish. Indeed, Wall Street is already forecasting high-teens percentage revenue growth through 2027, and TSMC's margins are some of the best in the business. If TSMC can keep a stronghold on the chipmaking industry, its current trajectory could be enough to get it to the $2 trillion mark by late 2028 or early 2029.
TSM Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
But I don't want to make it sound as if this will be a walk in the park. TSMC doesn't operate in a vacuum, and several headwinds could knock the company off course. Geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan is an ongoing concern and was the reason Warren Buffett cited when he sold most of his TSMC stock a couple of years ago. Likewise, the current geopolitical rift between China and the U.S. could cause problems for TSMC down the road. It's notable, for instance, that the U.S. recently revoked fast-track export licenses for shipping U.S. chipmaking equipment to TSMC's main plant in China.
At the same time, TSMC stands at the center of one of the most exciting developments in technology: artificial intelligence. As AI models get larger and computing needs explode, demand for TSMC's most advanced chips only grows. This should be even more the case when it starts producing 2-nanometer chips, which, according to TSMC, will consume 25% to 30% less power than its 3nm chips, even when configured to run at the same speeds.
Whether that's enough to outweigh political risks and other headwinds is an open question. Still, if tailwinds hold and the company keep producing at today's rates, $2 trillion in three years isn't out of reach at all.",730,trafilatura,,False

Fed officials voted in favor of a 25 basis point cut, a move widely expected by the market, following its two day policy meeting.
It came as the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) and European shares mostly pushed higher on Wednesday after Donald Trump arrived in the UK for his second state visit.
The US president and first lady, Melania Trump, touched down on board Air Force One ahead of a series of events over the next two days, including a carriage procession with King Charles, military parades and a possible flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets.
Coinciding with his visit, British pharmaceutical giant GSK (GSK.L) revealed plans to invest $30bn (£22bn) in research and supply chains in the US over the next five years. It includes $1.2bn of new money to build an AI-powered biologics factory in Pennsylvania that will develop treatments for the lung diseases COPD and asthma, as well as cancer.
It will also fund the roll-out of AI across GSK’s (GSK.L) existing five manufacturing sites in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Maryland and Montana.
Trump's arrival also heralded the first tech deal between the two countries, as major companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) committed to investing billions in Britain.
The transatlantic pact is focused on developing the fastest growing technologies such as AI, quantum, and nuclear, according to a government statement.

Bank of Canada cuts interest rates by quarter point
The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates by a quarter point to 2.5% as expected. The rate is now below the midpoint of the bank’s 2.25% to 3.25% neutral range estimate for the first time since the early stages of the COVID pandemic.
Governor Tiff Macklem highlighted three factors behind the decision to cut rates today:
-
The softness of the labour market,
-
Recent more encouraging core price data
-
The government’s decision to remove most of its retaliatory tariffs on US goods
However, he struck a cautious tone in relation to US trade policy, saying: ""the disruptive effects of shifts in trade will add costs even as they weigh on economic activity. It is difficult to predict the extent of cost increases, where they will show up, and how they could be passed through to consumer prices.""
The Bank dropped the line from its previous policy statement that said “if a weakening economy puts further downward pressure on inflation and the upward price pressures from the trade disruptions are contained, there may be a need for a reduction in the policy interest rate.”
It also reiterated that it will be assessing the extent to which weakness in exports “spills over into business investment, employment, and household spending”, how “trade disruptions are…passed on to consumer prices” and “how inflation expectations evolve”.

Lyft jumps on Waymo partnership
Lyft (LYFT) shares jumped 12% on Wednesday after the ride hail company and Uber (UBER) rival said it's partnering with Alphabet-owned (GOOG, GOOGL) robotaxi firm Waymo to offer self-driving cabs in Nashville in 2026.
“We’re delighted to partner with Lyft and launch in Nashville next year, as we continue to scale our Waymo ride-hailing service to more people in more places,” Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a statement Wednesday.
Waymo is in expansion mode: the company on Tuesday said it obtained a permit to test its driverless taxis at the San Francisco International Airport, and its cabs are already available in the city of San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin and Atlanta.
Uber shares fell 4% on news of the Waymo-Lyft partnership. Lyft shares pared initial gains, up 15% shortly before the market open.

Failed house sales cost UK economy at least £1.5bn a year
House sales that fall through are costing the UK economy at least £1.5bn a year, research from Santander (BNC.L) has shown.
The bank found that there are more than half a million (530,000) house sales that fall through each year in England and Wales, which is costing UK consumers £560m directly, as well as resulting in a further £950m hit to the wider economy.
That's according to Santander's ""Fixing the broken chain"" report, published on Wednesday, with the findings based on independent economic analysis from WPI Economics and a survey of more than 2,000 consumers by research firm JL Partners.
The report highlighted that nearly a quarter (23%) of consumers will have experienced a property chain fail.
The economic analysis showed that the direct cost to consumers of this through expenditure on elements such as mortgage and solicitors’ fees that consumers cannot recoup, is £560m annually.
This is 40% higher than the £400m estimate used by the government earlier this year, when it set out plans to modernise and streamline the way people buy and sell property.

UK will be AI superpower, Nvidia boss tells BBC
Nvidia boss Jensen Huang has told BBCNews “this is the week that I declare that UK will be an AI superpower.”
He also has spoken on AI jobs, the UK company he is backing, China and quantum computing.
It comes as Huang said he was ""disappointed"" by restrictions of exporting its most advanced chips, which are in demand for developing artificial intelligence, to China.
Adding to the problems, the Financial Times reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources, that China's internet regulator is banning domestic tech companies from buying an Nvidia chip model tailored for the local market.
China is the world's second biggest AI computing market and Nvidia has contributed more than most companies, he said.
“I’m disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out, you know, between China and the United States, and I’m understanding of that, and we’re patient about it,"" he said.

What's the number one trending ticker today?
Shares in Nio were the number one trending ticker this morning on Yahoo Finance, as the Chinese EV maker got a fresh Wall Street upgrade.
UBS upgraded the stock to 'Buy' from 'Neutral' and raised its price target for the second time in two weeks after the EV maker said it planned to raise up to $1bn via a share offering.
UBS analyst Paul Gong said Nio’s “latest products could further attract consumers after the US$1bn equity offerings strengthened visibility on its healthy operations.”
Nio’s jump by over 8% on Tuesday propelled the stock to its highest level since last October. The company has also benefitted from optimism around its new model.
Nio will begin deliveries of the new ES8 SUV this weekend, priced to compete with Tesla's (TSLA) Model Y.

Bank of England set to hold interest rates
The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to maintain its key interest rate at 4% on Thursday, a decision that will affect millions of mortgage holders, many of whom are facing the challenge of refinancing at higher rates.
Conflicting economic data is driving the cautious stance. On the one hand, signs of a softening labour market are emerging. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed a 5.8% drop in job openings between May and July, with 718,000 positions available across most sectors. Average wage growth dropped slightly to 4.8%, while the unemployment rate held at 4.7%.
The UK economy stagnated in July, adding pressure to chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her autumn budget. The flat performance aligned with City expectations and followed a 0.4% expansion in June.
Also, inflationary pressures continue to trouble policymakers. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation remained at 3.8% in August, a 19-month high that sits well above the Bank’s 2% target. Air fares rose by less than they did a year ago, while prices increased at restaurants and hotels, and for petrol and diesel.
Despite the cooling labour market, high inflation remains a significant factor in the BoE's decision-making.
Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has warned that there is “considerably more doubt” about when the central bank will be able to cut interest rates again.

Manchester United posts sixth straight annual loss
Manchester United reported an annual net loss for the sixth consecutive year on Wednesday and forecast lower revenue for this fiscal year, highlighting the football club's ongoing financial struggles.
The Premier League side posted a £33 million ($45m) loss for the year ended June 30, an improvement on the previous year's £113.2m deficit.
The narrower full-year loss reflects significant cost-cutting measures aimed at shoring up finances after several years of underperformance both on and off the field.
The club said it expects revenue of between £640m and £660m for its fiscal 2026, compared with 666.5 million pounds reported for the year ended June 30.
Manchester United's New York-listed shares were down 3.8% at $15.79 in premarket trading.
The Premier League has in recent years tightened club spending regulations under its Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR), designed to level the playing field and curb excessive spending by wealthy owners.
Manchester United has racked up losses of about £175m since fiscal 2023.

Eurozone inflation comes in softer than expected at 2%
Annual inflation in the eurozone came in at 2.0% in August, in line with the target set by the European Central Bank (ECB). A year earlier, the rate was 2.2%.
The figure was stable month-on-month, as June and July also saw price pressures at 2%, Eurostat said on Wednesday, updating its earlier estimate of 2.1%.
Meanwhile, European Union annual inflation was 2.4% last month, remaining stable compared to July. A year earlier, the rate was 2.4%
Food, alcohol and tobacco had the highest annual rate during the month, recorded at 3.2%, compared with 3.3% in July.
This was followed by services (3.1%, compared with 3.2% in July), non-energy industrial goods (0.8%, stable compared with July) and energy (-2.0%, compared with -2.4% in July).
The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (0.0%), France (0.8%) and Italy (1.6%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Romania (8.5%), Estonia (6.2%) and Croatia (4.6%). Compared with July 2025, annual inflation fell in nine Member States, remained stable in four and rose in fourteen.

UK house prices and rents slow in July
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed this morning that average house prices in the UK in July came in 2.8% higher than a year earlier, down from 3.6% price growth in June.
Growth has slowed sharply since hitting a two-year high in March, when buyers rushed to complete sales before a tax break on house purchases expired.
Across the UK, the average house price in July was £270,000. Average house prices increased by 2.7% to £292,000 in England, by 2% to £209,000 in Wales, and by 3.3% to £192,000 in Scotland.
The average house price for Northern Ireland was £185,000 in the second quarter of 2025, up by 5.5% annually.
Rents charged by private landlords rose by 5.7% year-on-year in August, down from an annual rate of 5.9% in July – the smallest annual increase since December 2022.

Fed expected to cut US interest rates
The US Federal Reserve is set to announce its latest decision on interest rates later today. It is widely expected to cut rates by a quarter point to 4.25% - the first rate cut since December.
Even if today’s decision ends up being a 25bp cut as expected, the meeting still has the potential for dissents in both directions.
All eyes will also be on the quarterly dot plot for where officials think rates will move next, as there is the potential for a big divergence between different officials.
On the theme of central banks, we’ll also get a decision from the Bank of Canada, who are widely expected to deliver a 25bp rate cut of their own.

Rachel Reeves on inflation data
In response to today's ONS inflation data, chancellor Rachel Reeves said:
Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said: “Inflation held steady in the 12 months to August, remaining at 3.8%, offering little relief for cash-strapped households still grappling with overstretched budgets. Persistent inflation is also unwelcome news for chancellor Rachel Reeves as she prepares for her autumn budget.
""Persistently high inflation mixed in with sluggish economic output and a cooling jobs market only adds to the pressure as she considers which taxes she may target to plug the black hole in the public finances.""
Reeves is due to present the autumn budget on 26 November, which is widely expected to include tax increases in an attempt to balance the nation’s books.

UK inflation holds steady at 3.8%
The rate of inflation was stuck at a 19-month high during August, official figures show, keeping pressure on households as the Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday showed the annual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer prices index remained at 3.8% last month, the same level as July and in line with expectations.
Air fares rose by less than a year ago while prices increases at restaurants and hotels, and for petrol and diesel, were higher.
The core rate of inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food costs, fell to 3.6% in August, also as forecast by economists.
The rate of food and drink inflation rose to 5.1% in August from 4.9% in July as shoppers continued to face higher prices for items at the till. This means that a supermarket shop that cost you £100 this time last year would be £105.10 now.
ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said:
Vegetables, milk, cheese and fish became more expensive, while bread and cereals and oil and fats became cheaper.

""The United Kingdom and the United States stand together today as first partners on defence, first partners in trade, with the groundbreaking deal we struck in May and now with the new agreement that we’ve just signed this afternoon, when confirming our status as the first partners in science and technology, ready to define this century together just as we did the last,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Trump said that the countries' ""enduring connection is why I was thrilled that the United Kingdom was the very first country with which we made a historic trade deal and a very good trade deal"", calling Starmer a ""tough negotiator"".

Trump said the Tech Prosperity Deal announced by the UK and US on Tuesday was ""one of a kind"". He said it would ensure the US and UK ""lead the next great technological revolution side-by-side"".
The landmark tech deal came as several major US and UK companies pledged transatlantic investments. Earlier on Thursday at a state visit business event, Starmer said that £250bn was ""flowing both ways across the Atlantic"".
US companies have pledged £150bn worth of investment in Britain during Trump's state visit, in a package of deals set to create more than 7,600 jobs across the UK.
A number of tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), had already announced billions of pounds of investment in the UK earlier this week.
New investment pledges announced on Wednesday included £100bn over the next decade from private equity giant Blackstone, £3.9bn from investment firm Prologis (PLD) and £1.5bn from data software platform company Palantir (PLTR).
The UK government said this marked the largest investment package ever associated with a visit of its kind, surpassing previous records set by the Chinese and Korean state visits in 2015 and 2023 respectively.",407,playwright+trafilatura,,False

""Apple's not really innovating,"" was one analyst's reaction. ""We were like, 'meh,'"" said another. On Wednesday, shares of the tech giant fell more than 5% from Tuesday's pre-rollout high, and remain down more than 6% year to date.
Here's why this might be a great time to buy the stock.
Slow and steady
In the famous Aesop fable, the ""slow and steady"" tortoise beats the fast-moving hare in a race. But that's not the way things usually work in the tech world.
Investors are constantly clamoring for big new innovations and bold new designs. But for the past several years, Apple has only offered incremental upgrades to its iPhone and other products. Yes, each camera is slightly better, each processor is a bit faster -- but (aside from its niche $3,499 Vision Pro VR headset), the company's most recent product launches were the HomePod smart speaker in 2018 and AirPods in 2016.
Apple is also widely regarded as being behind its big tech peers in the AI race, and Tuesday's iPhone 17 rollout didn't showcase any new AI capabilities like the ones Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) featured in its new Pixel phone rollout in August.
The conventional wisdom says that without a game-changing product or innovation (like, for example, the rumored foldable iPhone Air), Apple's inferior position in the AI race is going to weigh on its near-term earnings. But there's another factor that might tip the scales in Apple's favor.
Nothing lasts forever
There's always going to be a market for iPhones. Sooner or later, older models go obsolete (or get cracked screens, or fall into the toilet, or...). And that may be about to happen for a massive group of iPhone users.
Of the top 10 iPhone models in use today, by far the most popular is the iPhone 13 -- which came out in 2021 -- with a 16% user share. Meanwhile, 2020's iPhone 12 still has a 7.2% user share, and 2019's iPhone 11 has a surprisingly strong 9.2% share of users (including me). That means nearly one-third of current iPhone owners -- more than 400 million people -- are using a model that's at least four years old. These are models with 12-megapixel front cameras (vs. 48-megapixel on the new iPhone 17), lightning connectors as opposed to USB-Cs, and no ProMotion 120 frame-per-second refresh technology or Neural Engine AI compatibility.
It's no coincidence that Apple explicitly compares the iPhone 17's specs to the iPhone 13's on its website, boasting that the A19 chip's CPU is 1.5x faster and its GPU more than two times faster, with a battery that supports 11 more hours of video playback on a charge. The company is also offering store credit for trade-ins of ""iPhone 13 or higher."" Tim Cook and company clearly know that a lot of iPhone 13 users may be in the market for a new phone, and they're specifically encouraging them to upgrade now.
Brand loyalty
But will someone upgrading their iPhone 13 actually buy a new iPhone instead of a Pixel or another competitor? For the vast majority of iPhone users, the answer is yes. In May, research firm CIRP pegged Apple's iPhone customer retention rate at an industry-leading 89%, compared to just 76% for runner-up Samsung. That's especially impressive given how fierce the competition is.
Apple's major upgrade cycle may have already begun: the company reported double-digit iPhone revenue growth in its most recent quarter. In other words, this slow-and-steady tortoise could actually be winning the race without a flashy new product. The market seems oblivious, though: on a price to free cash flow basis, Apple's 37x valuation is much lower than Alphabet's 45x and Microsoft's (MSFT 0.22%) 53x.
Now looks like a good time to buy shares of Apple, before big iPhone sales numbers -- or an actual flashy new product -- surprise the market and send shares higher.",657,trafilatura,,False

Is this quantum computing leader worth its $22 billion price tag today? Let's look at what the numbers really say.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=37a13f90d8779d903e1ac97aa90b8b61ca4fe8712e9fbf3a0fc6c1ee9cf13827,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/24/is-ionq-stock-a-buy-now/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/24/is-ionq-stock-a-buy-now/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/24/is-ionq-stock-a-buy-now/,200.0,"Quantum computing has been a hot topic since the fall of 2024. On the heels of major news in this high-tech industry, headlines and online searches on this topic even eclipsed the massive interest in artificial intelligence (AI). That's quite an accomplishment in this AI-centered economy.
The technology holds a ton of long-term promise. Eventually, quantum computers should be able to crack math problems that today's digital computers can't handle. From encryption and health research to financial analysis and cybersecurity, quantum computing will disrupt many industries forever.
As a result, lots of investors want to get in on this exciting technology's biggest long-term winners while they're still small. According to Swiss investment bank UBS, quantum computing could generate annual sales of $20 billion by the year 2030, with companies earning a total market capitalization of at least $300 billion. As of Sept. 23, the four largest pure-play quantum computing stocks add up to a $43.7 billion market value.
The largest name in that group is IonQ (IONQ -3.56%), sporting a $22.1 billion market cap. The stock skyrocketed last year, calmed down for a while, and got back to exploring fresh all-time highs this month.
Is IonQ just getting started on a massive wealth-building growth story, or is the stock just wildly overheated right now?
Let's find out.
IonQ's financials are scarier than a quantum physics exam
Until recently, most of IonQ's massive stock gains had nothing to do with business results. In fact, these financial statements are grim reading.
With $52.4 million of trailing revenues and $419.3 million in operating expenses, the company is deeply unprofitable. IonQ has financed its operations with proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) in 2021, but has burned through nearly half of the $636 million IPO stash so far. The company's balance sheet currently holds enough cash equivalents to get through the next two years -- but IonQ keeps burning more cash every year.
Instead, IonQ investors have celebrated technological advances with share price pops. Most of these steps forward were taken in some other company's labs, including Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) (GOOGL -0.15%) and IBM (IBM -0.95%). It's great to have some of the brightest research teams on the planet pushing quantum computing tech toward store shelves and usable systems -- but they are also scary mega-rivals in the same business space.
September was a busy month for IonQ
IonQ's most recent price jumps have been different, though. The company has taken several big steps forward in September.
The surge started on Sept. 10, when IonQ started a new business unit aimed at securing Federal contracts. IonQ already has a few agreements with federal entities such as the U.S. Air Force and Oak Ridge Labs. The unified front of IonQ Federal should help the company find deeper government relationships over time and coordinate its contract-seeking efforts.
Then, IonQ got British regulatory clearance for the proposed buyout of Oxford Ionics. The $1.1 billion stock-based deal closed quickly. IonQ is making the most of its red-hot stock -- this was the fourth share-based buyout to close in 2025.
And the momentum kept going last week, as IonQ committed to researching quantum computing in space, supporting a broader project by the U.S. Department of Energy.
IonQ has plenty of business irons in the fire right now. To keep the fires burning, management is taking advantage of its soaring stock price to grow its research teams and patent portfolios without spending precious cash.
Why I'm watching IonQ from the sidelines
So this little company is going places. IonQ hopes to have a powerful quantum computing system with 2 million reliable qubits by the year 2030, opening the door to commercial success.
If the company can deliver on that promise, early IonQ investors could be in for a treat. However, I see a couple of problems here.
-
2030 is a long way off and many things can change before then. Today's promising quantum physics research project could be a bust, undermining IonQ's viability in the long run. Sure, there might be positive surprises too -- they're just far less likely.
-
With a $23.2 billion market cap, IonQ is already valued like a large company. The stock trades at 422 times trailing sales. It makes market darlings like Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) and Palantir Technologies look affordable by comparison, trading at respective price-to-sales ratios of 27 and 126.
IonQ's looming business risks and soaring stock valuation add up to a simple conclusion: I don't recommend picking up this stock today.
Perhaps I'll regret sitting on my hands when IonQ completes its million-qubit system and starts making Nvidia-like profits. But investing is essentially an exercise in statistics, and I like my chances just fine here on the sidelines. I know I said that 2030 is far off, but this kind of game-changing research could take decades. So, the 2030 system deadline looks too quick, and larger rivals seem better equipped to reach that goal anyway.
So if you want to make serious investments in the future of quantum computing, I'd suggest going with tech titans like Alphabet, Nvidia, or IBM. IonQ could be a fun, speculative holding in a diversified portfolio, as long as you keep that initial investment fairly small.",871,trafilatura,,False

The announcements were timed to coincide with US President Donald Trump’s historic second state visit to the UK, during which his friendly relationship with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the royal family was on full display.
Of these commitments, more than £30bn are in the technology sector, where major industry players are investing in building AI infrastructure and developing research and development (R&D) capabilities in the UK.

Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms.
OpenAI, for example, is launching Stargate UK to “strengthen the UK’s sovereign compute abilities” in partnership with Nvidia and UK-based data centre provider Nscale. Nvidia is separately committing to spending up to $15bn in R&D in the UK, working with partners CoreWeave and Nscale. However, the bulk of the tech investment is coming from Microsoft, which committed $30bn to building AI infrastructure in the UK in the next four years.
The UK Government says these investments “will bring new healthcare breakthroughs, clean homegrown energy, and more investment into local communities and businesses in Britain and the United States”. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle called it a “huge vote of confidence in our economy”.
However, reactions have been mixed. The prospect of building massive hyperscalers in the UK has already gotten pushback because of the water and energy-intensive nature of these developments. The potential of US tech to further crowd out the domestic tech industry is also a long-standing concern.
Nick Clegg, former president of global affairs at Meta and the UK’s former deputy prime minister, called the multibillion-dollar agreement “sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley”. Clegg highlighted that these investments would reinforce the UK’s tech dependency on the US, highlighting that US companies stood the most to gain. “It is all one-way traffic,” he said.
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataInvestment Monitor asked multiple analysts for their thoughts on these investments. Their answers suggest a more nuanced picture and touch on the secondary industries that could benefit from these investments, the relatively low costs in the UK for US tech companies, a lack of cooperation with UK organisations and more.
Eugenia Perozo (EP): Do you think the tech deals will ultimately benefit the UK or are they “sloppy seconds”?
Christopher Granville (CG), managing director at TS Lombard: Foreign direct investment (FDI) in highly productive and technologically advanced sectors must be a net benefit for the recipient in all the usual ways. Not just the presence of employing strategic investors like Google’s venture north of London, and the employment that comes from that, but all types of transfer of know-how, skills development and so on. FDI that fits those criteria, which is certainly the case here, has to be economically beneficial.
There are all types of collateral stimuli to ancillary industries and suppliers, such as in energy. One of the other projects discussed on the Trump state visit was mutually beneficial cooperation in nuclear modular reactors, which are certainly relevant to the required energy sources for data centres.
EP: The US has tried to condition many tariff deals on countries giving favourable conditions to big US tech companies (with some success). While the UK has so far resisted US pressure to scrap the Digital Services Tax (DST) and the Online Safety Act, do these investments increase the risk of that happening?
Laura Petrone, principal analyst of Strategic Intelligence at GlobalData: I haven’t seen a clear intention of making the DST or the Online Safety Act a part of these negotiations. Yes, there is a pressure from the Trump administration, but there is also a lot of rhetoric.
This is legislation that is also quite popular among the UK public, because the impact that access to very, very harmful content has had on young people and children’s mental health is a very sensitive issue. I don’t think it would be a wise move from the government’s side to compromise on this. The same is true for the DST. It is more symbolic for the Trump administration, and it is also symbolic from the UK side to show that they are not going to compromise on tax or digital sovereignty.
There is also AI regulation. I see some more compromise on this side. The UK doesn’t have a regulation, but it is trying to work on a light-touch bill. So how this will be shaped might be influenced by the dispersion from the US administration.
CG: I would see zero chance of the UK Government adjusting the Online Safety Bill. Given the optics, this would be perceived to have been under pressure from the Trump administration. If that turns out to be a deal breaker for some of these FDI projects, so be it. I don’t believe that would be politically or socially sustainable in the UK. As for taxation, my conclusion would be the same, but softer, because tax rules can always be negotiated and discussed. In fact, the whole point about the DST, both from the UK and from the EU, is that such taxation is explicitly designed to be a provisional stopgap until there is a fully implemented multilateral framework for taxing the corporate income of arbitrage-fuelled companies in tech, pharma and other sectors. The DST framework is not something that is designed to be there forever.
In February, following US Vice-President JD Vance’s visit to Europe, the EU signed up to a safety charter for AI; the UK did not. The government was therefore signalling it was more open to US integration with the US AI sector, in the hope of getting all those benefits for the UK economy. So, the UK is clearly ready to make some trade-offs to capture US tech investment and US integration – but I simply cannot see that the UK Government would alter its regulation on online safety in a way that was perceived to have been necessary to obtain this FDI in tech from the US, even despite that background.
Alexandros Xenofontos (AX), economist at TS Lombard: US tech companies want to be in the UK. It is an attractive investment because we do have the talent, resources and cheaper labour costs compared to Silicon Valley salaries, with the same amount of skills. The UK can give some pushback to US demands on the Online Safety Bill or the DST because it ultimately knows that it is an attractive location in the tech sector.
EP: There currently seem to be two versions of the UK from a business perspective. On the one hand, domestic businesses are struggling with rising costs on all fronts. On the other hand, US tech companies seem eager to make these investments here. What do you make of that discrepancy?
AX: US companies are finding it quite attractive to invest in the UK because they have a lot of dry powder; therefore, they have the capacity to invest in the UK, where there hasn’t really been a lot of investment. They are leveraging the lack of investment, swooping up market share and talent, becoming more competitive. It is the right time for them. It is relatively cheaper to do it in the UK than in the US.",1234,trafilatura,,False

- Alibaba is reportedly planning to spend even more on AI in the next three years than the $53 billion it said previously, marking the latest announcement by a large tech firm to spend big on the technology.
- The Chinese tech firm's CEO announced the AI spending plan, according to reports, just days after Nvidia said it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI.
China’s top tech firm is spending even more than it originally planned on AI, turning up the heat on U.S. chip giants like Nvidia (NVDA) in the race to dominate the technology.
Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) CEO Eddie Wu reportedly said Wednesday that the Chinese company has raised its AI budget to more than the $53 billion three-year outlay it announced in February. The spending plan marks the latest push by a tech firm to invest big in AI, the technology that has fueled U.S. stock markets to hit record highs. Nvidia said earlier this week it plans to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT owner OpenAI.
“We are vigorously advancing a three-year, 380 billion [yuan] AI infrastructure initiative with plans to sustain and further increase our investment according to our strategic vision in anticipation of the [artificial superintelligence] era,” Wu said at Alibaba Cloud’s annual flagship technology conference, according to CNBC.
Why This Matters to You
The boom in AI spending by tech firms has helped propel the U.S. stock market to record highs this year. American tech firms are a big reason for this, but increasing spending on AI in China—by Alibaba and rivals like Baidu—is also behind this spending, and comments today from Alibaba's CEO indicate that it could continue.
Wu has said he sees companies globally spending around $4 trillion globally on AI over the next five years, and “Alibaba needs to keep up,” Bloomberg said.
Alibaba shares have more than doubled so far this year, as co-founder Jack Ma returned to Beijing's fold and the ecommerce giant doubled down on its ""AI first strategy."" On Wednesday, they rose 9% in intraday trading.
Adding to the investor optimism, Cathie Wood's funds bought Alibaba shares, according to a daily trading report from her Ark Investment Management. Bloomberg noted it was the star fund manager's first purchase in the Chinese company in four years.
Alibaba didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

The company has a dominant lead in creating the GPUs designed specifically for artificial intelligence use cases.
Most analysts are big fans of Nvidia as both a business and as an investment. But one analyst, Jay Goldberg, has a $100 price target for Nvidia stock, the lowest on Wall Street. Whether or not you agree with him, every investor should understand why he expects the stock to fall over 40%.
3 reasons Goldberg is bearish on Nvidia stock
Nvidia is growing by leaps and bounds. Sales are up by more than 1,000% over the past five years. And given that the AI market is expected to grow by more than 30% annually for years to come, Nvidia's double-digit growth rates should be here to stay. But shares trade at a lofty 27 times sales, and Goldberg thinks there are cracks beginning to show in Nvidia's growth story.
His first issue is with Nvidia's exposure to China. The ongoing trade war has disrupted the company's ability to sell its marquee chips to the country, a country that has an AI industry growing by 50% or more per year. Nvidia reportedly struck a deal with the U.S. to resume exports, but ongoing issues with the Chinese government may allow Chinese chipmakers to catch up and secure domestic market share.
Goldberg is also concerned with Nvidia's bullishness surrounding agentic technologies. While agentic services do pose a long-term growth story, Goldberg thinks that the world is still many years away from any meaningful real-world adoption of this technology.
Finally, Goldberg cautions investors that there may be a short-term limit to the skilled labor pool that can scale for AI demand as much as forecasts predict. Even Nvidia has admitted that a huge workforce retraining will be required in an AI-enabled world.
While you may not agree with Goldberg's contrarian outlook, even Nvidia's most bullish investors can benefit from understanding the challenges the company faces.",334,trafilatura,,False

There was little fresh news affecting the company directly, still it managed to drift 2% higher in price across the trading session. Lingering positive sentiment related to the recently announced Nvidia buy-in, in addition to recent analyst moves, played a role in this.
At any rate Intel beat the S&P 500 index, which fell by 0.6% Tuesday.
Chipping away
To a degree, investors are still reacting to the blockbuster news from the end of last week that Nvidia will invest a meaty $5 billion in Intel's equity, and the two chip giants will collaborate on certain projects. More recently, on Monday a European bank upgraded its recommendation on the stock.
Mind you, the analyst didn't exactly join the bull stampede on Intel; still any upgrade is reason for renewed optimism. That pundit, Hans Engel of Austrian lender Erste Group, changed his recommendation to hold from his previous sell. It wasn't immediately clear what price target Engel set.
According to reports, the analyst's modification is due to what he considers to be progress in the company's transformation program. He wrote in his Intel update that the chipmaker has successfully increased production speed, which should have positive knock-on effects with key fundamentals.
Potential flip into the black?
Speaking of Nvidia, Engel wrote that the company and fellow state-of-the-art chip manufacturer Broadcom are currently testing Intel's production platform, which bodes well for its future. Also, in his view, if Intel can continue roping in new clients for its contract manufacturing business, the company has a shot at returning to profitability.",276,trafilatura,,False

If you invested $10,000 in Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW 0.47%) stock five years ago, you'd have $225,000 now -- roughly $90,000 more than a $10,000 investment in Nvidia over the same time period. Indeed, the small toy company has provided investors with a return of 2,150%. It's a story you've got to see to believe.
An incredible comeback story
To be fair, setting the clock at five years ago may be cherry-picking a little. Build-A-Bear stock had dropped sharply in the early days of the pandemic. So five years ago is an apt time to start the clock. That said, the company's profitable growth has been spectacular.
As of Feb. 1, 2020, Build-A-Bear had generated $339 million in total trailing-12-month revenue. By Feb. 1, 2025, that had jumped about 47% to $496 million in trailing-12-month revenue. That represents a roughly 8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
Build-A-Bear Workshop has more than 600 stores, some of which are owned by the company and others that are franchised. Customers come in and have an entire experience. They pick out a plush toy and ""customize"" it by controlling how much fluff goes on the inside.
Build-A-Bear seems to be enjoying an uptick in demand for a few simple reasons. For starters, the company was founded in 1997. Youngsters back then are parents now and are taking their kids in for the nostalgic experience that they had. The company has also done a good job of leaning into trends by licensing popular characters from modern TV shows for kids. And it hasn't shied away from using e-commerce to its advantage, as well.
Revenues are steadily increasing for Build-A-Bear. But its profitability and use of cash have been equally impressive. Its current operating margin of 14% is at an all-time high. And its earnings per share (EPS) are also at an all-time high, in part thanks to its share count being at an all-time low.
To summarize, demand is strong for Build-A-Bear, lifting profit margins. The company is debt-free with relatively low capital requirements. Therefore, management gives back to shareholders with stock buybacks. And it's even paid some special dividends in recent years to go along with its quarterly dividend.
Can the formula keep working for this cheap stock?
Build-A-Bear stock currently trades for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16. Granted, it's been cheaper in the past -- much cheaper. But a P/E of 16 is still a discount to the overall stock market and means there's minimal valuation risk here.
Since Build-A-Bear stock is still relatively cheap, can the business keep delivering on the simple formula that's made it such a monster stock in recent years? (As a reminder, the formula is consistent growth, strong profits, and generous returns to shareholders.) I believe it can.
There are two factors that can keep growth going for Build-A-Bear. First, consumer traffic is still positive even in a strained U.S. economy. In the second quarter of 2025, store traffic was up 3%. And the company's evolution into more of a collectible business fueled impressive Q2 e-commerce growth of 15%. Second, Build-A-Bear is opening a lot of new locations in international markets.
This growth can keep margins strong for Build-A-Bear. Higher store traffic at company-owned stores is good for profitability. And its growth overseas is via franchised and licensed locations, which is higher-margin revenue. So its profit margins may be at all-time highs, but it appears sustainable.
Assuming it's sustainable, I expect Build-A-Bear to continue with paying dividends and doing stock buybacks. After all, there's not much need when it comes to investing its cash elsewhere in the business.
To be clear, I don't expect greater than 2,000% stock returns for Build-A-Bear stock over the next five years. But based on everything going right for the business right now as well as its still-cheap stock price, I wouldn't be surprised if it outperformed the market average again over the next five years.",767,trafilatura,,False
company,1758478320,Big Tech's $4 Trillion Artificial Intelligence (AI) Spending Spree Could Make These 2 Chip Stocks Huge Winners,136836368,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,These companies supply chips to the biggest players in AI.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5844614f199da5acdb82a283d76156ce3a33bb630e2e42954b27a191faccc734,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/big-techs-4-trillion-ai-chip-stocks-winners/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/big-techs-4-trillion-ai-chip-stocks-winners/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/big-techs-4-trillion-ai-chip-stocks-winners/,200.0,"Leading tech companies are spending billions on data centers to support growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) compute capacity. AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) recently said it expects spending on AI infrastructure to reach between $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.
This estimate suggests the current bull market for tech stocks could extend for several more years. If your portfolio is light on AI exposure, here are two chip stocks to consider buying right now.
1. Nvidia
For investors looking for the best chip stock to benefit from this opportunity, Nvidia still has to be considered the top choice. It's the most valuable company in the world for a reason. It continues to grow at impressive rates, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the benchmark for AI workloads.
Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips are experiencing robust demand. In the most recent quarter, management said the Blackwell platform grew 17% sequentially over the previous quarter. Strong demand contributed to the company's total revenue increase of 56% over the year-ago quarter.
Nvidia's largest customers are the big tech giants, including Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Google Cloud. These companies have tens of billions of dollars they can afford to spend on AI infrastructure, which benefits Nvidia. Google alone plans to spend $85 billion this year on data centers and technology to support its growth.
Nvidia's advantage can be seen in how leading cloud service providers are transitioning to Nvidia's new Blackwell GB300. Management described it as a ""seamless"" upgrade over the shared architecture, software, and physical footprint of the GB200. The GB300 is a liquid-cooled rack that houses 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 Arm-based Nvidia Grace central processing units (CPUs).
Large data centers install thousands of these racks to run AI training and inference workloads, and Nvidia's shareholders are cashing in. ""The scale and scope of these build-outs present significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia,"" CFO Colette Kress said on the fiscal Q2 earnings call.
Nvidia is one of the most profitable companies in the world, with $86 billion in trailing-12-month net income. The high margins Nvidia earns on its data center business should translate to significant earnings growth and return potential for investors as spending on AI infrastructure increases.
2. Broadcom
For a second chip stock that complements Nvidia, investors could consider Broadcom (AVGO 1.36%). It supplies networking, software, and specialized chips for a range of markets, including smartphones, industrial applications, and data centers.
The demand for high-performance computing in data centers is driving significant growth for the company. Broadcom's custom AI accelerators are in high demand due to their power efficiency and performance relative to Nvidia's costlier, and more power-hungry GPUs.
Both Nvidia and Broadcom can thrive because the AI opportunity is that big. There are simply not enough chips to go around. Companies have literally begged Nvidia for more GPUs, and when they can't get them, they consider alternatives. Broadcom just recently announced a $10 billion deal to build custom AI chips for an undisclosed customer, but analysts believe that customer is ChatGPT's OpenAI.
Broadcom stock is surging, up 55% year to date, and for good reason. Business is booming. AI-related revenue grew 63% year over year to $5.2 billion, or about a third of its total business, and management expects AI chip revenue to accelerate next quarter.
Meanwhile, Broadcom's networking products, such as high-performance Ethernet switches, are also in high demand, since AI workloads require massive data throughput and transfer speeds. Broadcom also has a high-margin infrastructure software business that is used to monitor and secure data center operations.
The company has a long history of delivering profitable growth that rewards shareholders, and it's certainly delivering for investors as the AI boom heats up. Revenue is expected to increase 22% this year, before accelerating to 32% next year. Investors should expect the stock to outperform the market over the next five years.",646,trafilatura,,False
company,1758463800,The Intel-Nvidia Deal Looks Like Terrible News for AMD,136836372,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,AMD's market share gains could come under pressure.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6704d916cc14ef06ce5e928a1116b574e5eb56c176b1df4ee76c87e2f6585b87,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-intel-nvidia-deal-looks-like-terrible-news-for/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-intel-nvidia-deal-looks-like-terrible-news-for/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-intel-nvidia-deal-looks-like-terrible-news-for/,200.0,"On Thursday, Intel (INTC -0.11%) and Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) announced a shocking deal that will pair the two companies' technologies in PC and data center central processing units (CPUs). This news looks problematic for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 6.11%). AMD has made an extraordinary comeback over the past decade in both markets, with a unit market share across PCs and servers of around 24% in the second quarter, up from 11% in 2016. Those gains could come under pressure once the Intel-Nvidia partnership bears fruit.
In the PC market, Intel and Nvidia will develop systems-on-a-chip (SOCs) that integrate Intel's CPU cores with an Nvidia RTX graphics processing unit (GPU) chiplet. In the data center market, custom Intel CPUs with Nvidia's NVLink technology will be used directly by Nvidia, and the GPU giant will also offer the chips to third-party customers. NVLink is Nvidia's proprietary high-speed connection technology that's a more performant alternative to the standard PCI Express interface.
In the PC market, in particular, AMD will have a fight on its hands as it looks to preserve its market share.
AI PCs have been slow to take off
The PC CPUs that come out of this deal are targeting ""a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs,"" according to Intel's press release. Gaming laptops and gaming handhelds would be the natural form factors for the new CPUs, given the gaming performance that Nvidia's GPU technology will enable. But Nvidia's GPUs will also provide hefty artificial intelligence (AI) computing horsepower.
As a category, AI PCs aren't particularly impressive right now. PCs running Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm CPUs with enough AI computing capacity to run some AI workloads locally get lumped into this category, but they're just not capable enough for AI to be a strong selling point. Microsoft's Copilot+ initiative, which puts that label on certain AI PCs, was a disappointment when it debuted last year. The AI features included brought little to the table, and anything useful still required calling out to a cloud service.
For AI PCs to truly take off, they need to be powerful enough to run capable AI models locally that can perform useful tasks for the user. Once a PC can handle running a competent AI writing assistant or a useful AI coding assistant, the appeal of the AI PC expands dramatically.
A potential AI powerhouse
The CPUs that will emerge from the Intel-Nvidia deal appear to be squarely aimed at the AI PC opportunity. Nvidia's GPU technology has become the industry standard for AI computing, and the GPU chiplet included in these new CPUs could provide enough AI computing capacity to handle more complex AI workloads.
Some of AMD's Ryzen PC CPUs include both a neural processing unit and a GPU to accelerate AI workloads. The high-end Ryzen AI Max+ 395, for example, offers overall AI performance of 126 TOPs, or trillions of operations per second. That's nothing compared to dedicated GPUs, and it's certainly not enough to run truly capable AI models. Nvidia's midrange RTX 5060 laptop GPU, for example, offers 440 TOPS, while its high-end RTX 5090 laptop GPU clocks in at 1,824 TOPS.
We don't know exactly what the Intel-Nvidia CPUs will look like, but they could push the envelope when it comes to AI computing capacity, thanks to Nvidia's GPUs. By putting an Nvidia GPU on the same chip as the CPU, rather than pairing the CPU with a discrete GPU, latency can be reduced, power efficiency can be improved, and costs can be brought down.
AMD makes competitive products, but the PC CPU market is a whole new ball game when Intel CPUs integrated with Nvidia GPUs start shipping. AMD's presence in gaming laptops and gaming handhelds will likely come under pressure, and the larger battle for AI PC market will be much tougher with Intel and Nvidia teaming up.",646,trafilatura,,False

Here's what's behind its gains.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f574570fadc0a1a018350b73871a44a765101e9ef71001b581d3cedecc59a3db,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-motley-fool-has-3-key-insights-for-investors/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-motley-fool-has-3-key-insights-for-investors/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-motley-fool-has-3-key-insights-for-investors/,200.0,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.84%) might not get as much attention as Nvidia or Palantir Technologies, but TSMC, as the chip-manufacturing giant is also known, continues to look like a big winner in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.
Since the beginning of 2023, roughly when ChatGPT was launched, the stock is up 252%, and the business has delivered smashing results on both the top and bottom lines. Its revenue has grown rapidly. Its margins have expanded, and it has stretched its competitive advantage. As the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing company, it's become an even more valuable partner for chip designers like Nvidia that rely on it for manufacturing.
TSMC's strong growth rate has continued through the year as its revenue jumped 34% in August, and the company is guiding for $31.8 billion to $33 billion in revenue for the third quarter with an operating margin of 45.5% to 47.5%.
Let's take a closer look at how TSMC makes its revenue and what it tells us about the future of the company, using this research from The Motley Fool.
1. North America is playing a bigger role
North America has long been the company's biggest market, but it's become even more central to TSMC's business in recent years.
In the second quarter, sales to North America made up 75% of its revenue, up from 56% in the first quarter of 2020. That transition has taken place during a massive data center buildout in North America and because TSMC's biggest customers like Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices come from the U.S.
Additionally, TSMC has been courted by both the Biden and Trump administrations as a key manufacturing partner at a time when the U.S. is seeking to promote domestic semiconductor manufacturing to ensure it has an adequate supply of chips.
TSMC is currently building multiple plants in the U.S. and has received billions in grants from the CHIPS Act. Additionally, its share of business going to China has fallen from 22% to 9% during that time due in part to slowing economic growth in political pressure in the form of export controls from the U.S.
2. Its technology is advancing quickly
Another major transition that has taken place with TSMC's business in the last few years is that advanced chips for high-performance computing have commanded an increasing share of its business.
In the second quarter, advanced chips, which the company defines as 7 nanometers (nm) or less, made up 64% of its revenue, compared to just 35% in the beginning of 2020 when it didn't make 3nm or 5nm chips.
Sixty percent of TSMC's revenue now comes from those two nodes, a reflection of both the company's advancing technology and the demand for more powerful chips, both of which have helped widen the company's economic moat. TSMC will soon start manufacturing chips under a 2nm process.
3. High-performance computing is the future, and the present
At one point, smartphones were the biggest platform that TSMC served, but these days it's been replaced by high-performance computing, which includes chips like Nvidia's that are intended for data centers.
From the first quarter of 2020 to Q2 2025, the percentage of revenue coming from high-performance computing jumped from 30% to 60%. Meanwhile, the percentage of revenue coming from smartphones has fallen from 49% to 29%. Considering TSMC's strong growth, that's more a reflection of the maturing of the smartphone market rather than a decline in revenue.
However, the percentage of revenue share coming from high-performance computing only grow as hyperscalers and other companies are pouring hundreds of billions into AI and data centers.
What it means for TSMC
While competitors like Samsung and Intel have struggled in recent years, TSMC seems to have done everything right as it's on top of all the key trends in the semiconductor industry.
For investors, the stock also continues to look well-priced, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, which is cheaper than most of its AI stock peers. Given its dominance in chip manufacturing and strong competitive advantages, TSMC looks poised to outperform for years to come.",680,trafilatura,,False

Of the 10 largest American companies by market cap, the top seven are technology sector companies, specializing in hardware, software, e-commerce, internet search, cloud services, or social media.
Nevertheless, investors shouldn't be confused -- many of these tech giants have plenty of room to grow. Today, three Motley Fool contributing analysts will explore the case for some of their favorites: Meta Platforms (META 0.71%), Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%), and Alphabet (GOOG -0.30%).
Meta is leveraging its lucrative business model to invest in AI
Jake Lerch (Meta Platforms): Not only is Meta Platforms a big tech stock with ample room to grow, but this social media giant could one day become the largest of them all.
It comes down to three simple factors:
- Meta's enormous reach
- The company's lucrative business model
- Meta's artificial intelligence (AI) investments
Let's start with its reach. Meta boasts nearly 3.5 billion daily average users (DAUs) -- roughly 43% of the population of Earth. The scale here can be tough to wrap your head around, but needless to say, it's enormous. Accordingly, the company can leverage this vast network to generate staggering sums of revenue and profit.
Case in point: As of Meta's most recent earnings report (for the six months ending on June 30, 2025), the company generated nearly $90 billion in revenue and $35 billion in net income. That works out to about $500 million in revenue and almost $200 million in net income each and every day.
To put this in context, Domino's Pizza records about $5 billion in revenue each year -- Meta generates a similar amount of revenue every 10 days. What's more, Meta's revenue is growing at an astounding rate of more than 21%.
Finally, we must discuss what Meta is doing with all this money. To summarize, it's pouring tens of billions into AI investments. It has secured hundreds of thousands of high-end GPUs to power the latest AI models, it has extended lucrative signing bonuses to AI researchers, and it's poured tens of billions into projects ranging from the metaverse to wearable augmented reality (AR) glasses.
In summary, Meta is leveraging its enormously profitable social media business to construct an AI empire. In my view, that is a wise investment that could fuel decades of future growth.
Despite unprecedented gains, this AI growth story is far from over
Will Healy (Nvidia): Looking at the trajectory of Nvidia over the last few years, one cannot blame some investors for thinking the bull market in Nvidia has played out. The stock has risen by nearly 1,200% since its November 2022 low. Additionally, with a market cap of $4.1 trillion, rapid growth is unlikely to occur as easily.
However, Nvidia has benefited precisely because it has created and dominated the market for AI accelerators. The company, which was once known best for its gaming chips, derived 88% of its revenue from the data center segment (which designs AI accelerators) in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended July 27).
Also, with Grand View Research forecasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip market of 29% through 2030, its growth is not on track to stop anytime soon.
Although growth rates have slowed in recent quarters, Nvidia's performance far exceeds this estimate. In the first half of fiscal 2026, its $91 billion in revenue increased by 62% from year-ago levels, an impressive feat for a company of its size.
Still, even with that gain, rising demand has spiked production costs, leading its cost of sales to increase by 131% during the same time frame. Consequently, its $45 billion in net income for the first two quarters of the fiscal year amounted to a 43% increase, a more modest rise that keeps Nvidia in a growth mode.
Over the last three years, profits have grown so rapidly that its P/E ratio is at 49 despite the stock's massive gains, and a 38 forward P/E ratio confirms its continued growth trajectory. Considering the 54% yearly revenue increase Nvidia has forecast for fiscal Q3, investors should expect its stock to climb for the rest of this year and beyond.
Alphabet is up 40% over the past three months, but there is still time to buy
Justin Pope (Alphabet): Technology juggernaut Alphabet continues to rip higher, but I'm still calling this winner a buy. What investors have seen is simply a metaphorical coiled spring that has now unleashed its pent-up energy following the company's favorable outcome in its antitrust litigation.
The stock felt selling pressure for months as Wall Street worried that the courts would take drastic measures to rectify Alphabet's anticompetitive practices in its search engine business. Rumors suggested potential forced sales of key assets, such as the Chrome web browser or Android smartphone operating system. It appears that those worst-case scenarios are out of play.
Now, investors can focus on all the things going right at Alphabet. The company's Gemini AI app has climbed to the top of smartphone app stores, and Google Cloud is thriving as AI demand drives more cloud consumption in Alphabet's direction.
Last but not least, Alphabet's Waymo autonomous ride-hailing service is steadily expanding across the United States. Meanwhile, Tesla's robotaxi, its primary competition, remains confined to a fixed area in Austin, and has reportedly gotten into a few accidents already despite the safeguards in place.
The stock has surged over the past few months, but shares remain valued at roughly 25 times estimated 2025 earnings. That's still a solid deal for one of the world's most prominent technology companies and an emerging leader in AI infrastructure and software, especially if the company can meet Wall Street's expectations of 15% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years.",967,trafilatura,,False
company,1758454200,3 Quantum-AI Stocks That Could Be Better Buys Than Traditional Tech Giants,136836379,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,There could be multiple winners in the quantum computing arms race.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5873fcdb57defd3880016eda5c98ab964b9828628c89218a085ca184e1f3b71f,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/3-quantum-ai-stocks-that-could-be-better-buys-than/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/3-quantum-ai-stocks-that-could-be-better-buys-than/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/3-quantum-ai-stocks-that-could-be-better-buys-than/,200.0,"Artificial intelligence (AI) investing is still the primary driver in today's market, although quantum computing investing could become mainstream by as early as 2030. However, investors don't need to invest in one or the other; some of the quantum computing pure plays are dabbling in both spaces. This could open up a huge investment opportunity over the next few years and deliver shareholders market-crushing returns.
The standard they'll be judged by is whether they can outperform traditional big tech companies, as they have long led the market to new heights. Additionally, some of them, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), are also competing in the quantum computing arms race alongside the AI buildout.
I've got three stocks that fit the bill that could outperform traditional tech companies, with one of them potentially coming as a surprise.
IonQ and D-Wave Quantum
IONQ (IONQ -3.56%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS -0.42%) are two of my favorite quantum computing pure plays to follow. Each is taking a unique approach to the quantum computing industry, potentially giving them a leg up if their novel solutions work.
IonQ utilizes a trapped-ion approach, which has a few key advantages over the more popular superconducting approach. Instead of needing to cool a particle to nearly absolute zero, a trapped-ion computer can perform its tasks at room temperature. This reduces input costs, making it easier to deploy. Additionally, a trapped ion calculation is far more accurate than a superconducting one at this time. IonQ holds multiple world records for the most accurate quantum computers, and this could make it a top pick by potential clients.
D-Wave Quantum uses a quantum annealing approach, which isn't intended for broad use like a trapped ion or superconducting quantum computer might be. Instead, it works by finding the lowest energy state in a system, which represents the optimal solution. This makes it ideal for tasks like statistics or logistics networks, which represent a massive use case for quantum computing.
Each company is also looking at deploying its solutions for AI. IonQ's researchers have utilized several existing large language models and improved them by incorporating quantum computing. This cut down on energy cost and provided better-performing models. D-Wave Quantum is also involved with integrating quantum computing applications with AI, specifically focusing on applications where pre-trained AI could assist businesses and researchers.
Both companies are approaching integration with quantum computing in a hybrid approach, which involves using quantum computers to enhance what traditional computers are already doing. Currently, the king of traditional AI computing is Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%), and it's also dabbling in the AI realm.
Nvidia
Nvidia isn't developing a quantum processing unit to replace its graphics processing units (GPUs). Instead, it's evolving its popular CUDA software to include quantum computing plug-ins, morphing the platform into CUDA-Q.
This is a smart approach by Nvidia, as it allows it to continue focusing on the AI arms race while capturing the upside of quantum computing. This approach will ensure that Nvidia's GPUs are needed in a hybrid computing application, which will continue to be the vast majority of use cases that deploy quantum computing.
While some may argue that Nvidia could be classified as a ""traditional"" tech company, I don't think it falls under this classification, as it's only a computing hardware provider that just happens to be the largest company in the world due to extreme demand. Nvidia is making a ton of money from its GPU sales to traditional big tech companies, and I think it's well-positioned to outperform in the current environment as well as in the future, when quantum computing potentially becomes a commercially viable technology.",608,trafilatura,,False

It has been outshined by its rival Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) in the biggest computing buildout of all time, and there doesn't appear to be a path where AMD can be a direct competitor with Nvidia. Instead, it's only viewed as an alternative so customers can push back against Nvidia if it gets too aggressive with pricing.
Furthermore, AI hyperscalers are starting to design their own chips in collaboration with Broadcom, creating another fierce competitor for AMD. Alongside all of that, AMD isn't completely focused on high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs). It also has an embedded processor division as well as other computing chips used in gaming consoles and PCs.
All of this creates a company that is more diversified than its peers. However, diversification isn't always a good thing, especially when one division is experiencing a generational growth opportunity.
So, what will AMD's stock price be by 2030? Let's take a look.
AMD is a more diversified business than Nvidia
AMD splits its business into three primary divisions: data center, client and gaming, and embedded.
Data center isn't AMD's largest division by revenue; Client and gaming is by a slim margin. In Q2, data center revenue was $3.24 billion versus client and gaming's $3.62 billion. However, AMD's data center divisions were heavily affected by the ban on selling computing hardware to China, which also affected Nvidia.
When comparing Nvidia and AMD's data center growth, it's quite heavily favored in one direction. AMD's data center revenue increased by 14% year over year in Q2, while Nvidia's rose by 56%. This clearly indicates that AMD is getting smoked by Nvidia, and doesn't really have a chance to catch up.
Most AI hyperscalers have already built a ton of infrastructure using Nvidia's technology, and when these GPUs eventually burn out, it would cost a significant amount more to switch over to AMD's architecture versus staying with Nvidia's. As a result, AMD is stuck in second place.
To make matters worse for AMD, its embedded and client and gaming divisions do not have significant long-term potential. These are divisions that over the long term won't grow much more than 10% annually, making them essentially market performers.
This doesn't bode well for AMD, especially with its already expensive valuation.
AMD's expensive stock price is holding its long-term potential back
Despite AMD clearly being a second-place company, it's actually more expensive than its peer.
AMD's 41 times forward earnings price tag isn't cheap, and I'm not sure its growth justifies it. In 2025 and 2026, Wall Street analysts project 28% and 22% revenue growth, respectively. There are plenty of companies that are expected to grow near that level over the next few years that don't have nearly the premium that AMD does, so this also works against it.
However, that's not the only way for a company to perform. AMD is also working on improving its margins, something that it has done consistently over the past few years.
If AMD can improve its margins to 15% by 2030, it could be a winning investment. If AMD trades at a more reasonable valuation of 30 times forward earnings, grows at a 20% pace, and achieves that margin level, it could be worth about $225 per share.
However, that's only a 40% upside from today's stock price. I think there are a lot better stocks to invest in than AMD, as it doesn't have the growth that others in its industry have. Furthermore, if the AI market goes down, it will drag AMD's stock with it. It may not decline as much as Nvidia's, but it would still result in hefty losses. There are far better alternatives to invest in than AMD, and I think investors would be better off picking those stocks instead.",637,trafilatura,,False
company,1758451500,The Ultimate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now,136836383,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,Nvidia is still at the top of the list of AI stocks.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6dd8bc805435fece90f4ecc9be28438ef93b3bdb7d9bf519711ff5d7c02b40c2,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-ultimate-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-to-b/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-ultimate-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-to-b/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-ultimate-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-to-b/,200.0,"Artificial intelligence (AI) investing continues to be the best choice in the market. The AI hyperscalers are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out computing capacity, and any company that is a beneficiary of this spending is an excellent place to invest.
One of the most popular investments from the beginning of the AI race has been Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%). Despite being among the best performers over the past few years, Nvidia is still the ultimate AI stock right now, I believe, especially if its market projections come true.
Nvidia makes lots of money from each GPU it sells
Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which specialize in computing tasks that require plenty of horsepower. They can process multiple calculations in parallel, an effect that can be amplified by connecting hundreds or thousands of them in clusters. This is what occurs in giant AI data centers, where companies connect 100,000 or more GPUs to form supercomputers.
Nvidia's data center GPUs aren't cheap, so it makes a fortune off of each one sold. It's rare to see a hardware company with the margin profile that Nvidia has, but it has consistently delivered a profit margin greater than 50% over the past few years.
This allows the chipmaker to generate huge profits, which is why the stock has increased so much over the past few years. And if management is right about the general direction of AI spending, its stock is just getting started.
Nvidia's growth is far from over
During the company's second-quarter conference call, management estimated that global data center capital expenditures will rise to anywhere from $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Currently, AI hyperscalers are spending around $600 billion annually, and with Nvidia estimated to generate $206 billion in revenue during this fiscal year, it's safe to say that it gets around a third of all data center spending.
That indicates that the company's revenue could be $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion by 2030. Should it reach that level, it would be an annual growth rate of 37% on the low end of management's projection. If Nvidia can maintain its impressive profit margins, it's not unreasonable to think that its stock could rise by a corresponding amount over the next five years.
A 37% annual return wouldn't just outperform the market; it would crush it. The S&P 500 tends to return around 10% annually, so Nvidia could easily be the ultimate growth stock to buy now.
However, this projection isn't without its caveats. Its biggest clients would need to continue spending nearly all of their cash flow on AI infrastructure for this to come true. If they don't see a reasonable return on investment, they may begin to taper off their spending.
Furthermore, management's projection includes all data center spending. So, if a competitor comes out with a GPU alternative, it's possible that Nvidia loses market share and doesn't get a third of total data center spending.
Even if it falls short of its projection, there's still plenty of wiggle room for it to be a top-performing stock over the next five years. I think it's an excellent buy at this price point, and anybody who's still bullish on the AI trend should consider buying shares of Nvidia today.",544,trafilatura,,False
company,1758371520,Meet the Skyrocketing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That's Leaving Nvidia in the Dust,136828083,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,"This cloud computing stock has more than doubled in 2025, and it still has room to rise.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f530eb51c9da030ae386f5d68744bd4a8824597fd4ec112b3ef30afff44e654f,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/the-skyrocketing-ai-stock-thats-leaving-nvidia-in/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/the-skyrocketing-ai-stock-thats-leaving-nvidia-in/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/the-skyrocketing-ai-stock-thats-leaving-nvidia-in/,200.0,"Nvidia, which pioneered the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chip space, has been one of the top performing stocks on the market in the past three years, delivering gains of more than 1,200% on the back of the remarkably strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely used for training AI models and running inference applications.
That's why Nvidia's returns of 32% so far in 2025 may appear lukewarm to investors. After all, with a market cap in excess of $4.3 trillion, it is now the world's largest company. So, expecting Nvidia to replicate the eye-popping returns that it has clocked in recent years isn't reasonable, especially considering that its growth rate, though healthy, is relatively slower than it was before.
However, there are smaller companies out there capitalizing on the fast-growing demand for AI hardware that can still deliver phenomenal returns to investors. One of these is Cloudflare (NET 0.66%), which has significantly outperformed Nvidia so far this year -- it's up by a remarkable 110% -- and has the potential to fly higher.
Cloudflare's focus on building a global GPU network is paying off
Cloudflare was traditionally known for offering content delivery network (CDN) services and a reverse proxy network that helps make internet connections faster, secure, and more reliable. Its cloud security solutions also secure data across public cloud networks, private cloud networks, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, among other systems.
However, the AI trend has helped it unlock a lucrative growth avenue. It is now leveraging its massive global network of servers to deploy graphics processing units (GPUs) and bring edge AI processing capabilities to its customers. The company's network spans 300 cities, and management said last year that the entire network would be equipped with GPUs to run AI inference applications closer to end users, which will help reduce latency and improve performance.
Based on what management said on the company's latest earnings conference call, Cloudflare has achieved that goal. And demand for its Workers AI serverless GPU platform -- which allows customers to run AI models on Cloudflare's network and forego investing in and managing expensive hardware -- has been solid.
Cloudflare customers can access more than 50 AI models on the Workers AI platform to build applications based on their needs. They can also store large datasets on the Cloudflare network at competitive costs. Importantly, Workers AI has a pay-as-you-go business model, so customers aren't locked into subscription contracts.
This consumption-oriented model is working well for Cloudflare as it helps the company lower the barrier to entry for companies looking to run AI inference in the cloud. The company landed several multimillion-dollar contracts for Workers AI in the second quarter, which explains the impressive 39% year-over-year increase in its remaining performance obligations (RPO) to almost $2 billion.
This metric refers to the total value of a company's unfulfilled contracts, and it's worth noting that Cloudflare's RPO growth substantially exceeded the 28% year-over-year spike in its Q2 revenue to $512 million. What this means is that Cloudflare is landing new contracts at a faster pace, setting up a nice revenue pipeline for the long run that should lead to accelerating top-line growth. Moreover, the analysts at Fortune Business Insights forecast that demand for edge AI will increase at an impressive annualized rate of 33% through 2032.
In that context, I won't be surprised to see Cloudflare's revenue pipeline improve further, especially considering that there is a tremendous need for GPU-powered AI cloud computing capacity.
But is the stock worth buying following its phenomenal surge?
Cloudflare's big rally so far in 2025 has left it trading at 40 times sales. That's expensive when compared to Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 26. However, Cloudflare's RPO growth is accelerating. The company reported a 37% year-over-year increase in the metric in Q2 2024, indicating that its future revenue pipeline growth is ticking up.
As a result, it wouldn't be surprising to see Cloudflare's top-line growth accelerate in the future -- which is precisely what analysts are predicting.
For some perspective, Nvidia's top-line growth rate is expected to slow down.
So, there is a good chance that Cloudflare may be able to justify its expensive sales multiple by clocking faster growth than the AI chip leader. That's why investors who have a tolerance for risk and a willingness to pay a premium valuation for this AI stock should consider accumulating it, even after its remarkable rally this year.",739,trafilatura,,False

Investors who back the right players in the space have the opportunity to score big gains with companies that have attractive risk-reward profiles.
With that in mind, read on for a look at two leading AI players that have been identified by some Motley Fool contributors as leading candidates to be the world's top two most valuable companies five years from now.
Nvidia will still lead
Jennifer Saibil (Nvidia): AI continues to be the strongest trend in business today, and it's much more than buzzy hype. It's already changing how people do everything from read and shop to study and play, and its capabilities are only becoming more powerful as industry leaders invest in upgrading their technology. Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) is at the center of AI trends. It's the highest valued company in the world today, and it's likely to remain in the top spot as clients need its best-in-class products to boost their own AI businesses.
Although it's facing new competition from other AI chip designers, it's constantly raising its game to stay in the top spot. It has as much as 95% of the market for AI chips, and it supplies the top AI companies, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.
These companies have accelerated their investments in AI, and that includes Nvidia's best -- and most expensive -- graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive the most powerful AI capabilities. Together, these three companies are spending at an annual run rate of nearly $300 billion combined, and that's expected to increase.
Nvidia's growth has been wild, especially for a company as large as it already is. In the 2026 fiscal second quarter (ended July 27), revenue increased 56% year over year, and that included a charge related to China sales that couldn't go through.
Management is looking for $54 billion in third-quarter sales, or 54% higher than last year. It's also a profit machine, with a 72.4% gross margin and a 56.5% profit margin in the quarter.
On top of upgrades to its chips, which keep becoming even more powerful, Nvidia is investing in new products like data centers and supercomputers. It just launched Rubin CPX, which it calls an entirely new category of processors that can handle AI reasoning faster and more seamlessly than anything else on the market.
At its current rate of performance and innovation, expect Nvidia to stay on top of the market over the next five years.
Don't underestimate Amazon
Keith Noonan (Amazon): Despite owning and operating the leading cloud infrastructure service, Amazon (AMZN 1.01%) has seen its stock post relatively underwhelming performance amid the rise of AI. While the company's share price has risen 50% over the last five years, the performance comes in far below the 95% gain for the S&P 500's level across the stretch.
Comparing Amazon's gains over the last half-decade to the 148% gain for Microsoft stock and the 1,260% gain for Nvidia produces an even starker contrast.
Amazon's relative underperformance can be explained by rising competition in cloud computing, pressures from tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. But while the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 and its peers in the ""Magnificent Seven"" over the last half-decade, there are some good reasons to think that it could rise to become one of the world's two most valuable companies over the next five years.
While Amazon Web Services (AWS) has seen a rise in competition in the cloud-infrastructure services space, it has also generally continued to post strong growth and encouraging margins. As the leading cloud infrastructure network, there's a good chance that AWS will continue strong growth connected to the launch and scaling-up of new AI applications.
The market's enthusiasm for AWS' momentum has also been dampened somewhat by headwinds that have faced the e-commerce business over the last five years, but that could start to change in the not-too-distant future.
Amazon's online retail business has faced challenges connected to the coronavirus pandemic, high levels of inflation, and tariffs. On the other hand, the e-commerce unit could actually be in the early stages of benefiting from powerful long-term tailwinds.
The combination of AI and robotics stands to make the company's online retail operations significantly more efficient. With new automation technologies, Amazon has the opportunity to dramatically improve margins for its huge e-commerce business and transform its profitability profile at large.",752,trafilatura,,False
company,1758364200,5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Far Better Buys Than Palantir,136828087,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,"The market is full of reasonably priced AI investments, but Palantir isn't one of them.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7fef5ef4ba3388cbd9ac8c192a74b9747df4f63de181b1c316198b0ef30a80a5,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,200.0,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.34%) has been on an impressive run over the past few years. The stock is up 2,570% since the start of 2023, making it an even better performer than Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) over that timeframe. While that share price performance is great, the business is note growing at quite that pace and Palantir's stock may have gotten ahead of itself. As a result, there are plenty of stocks that look like far better buys than Palantir right now.
I've identified five companies that investors might want to consider before Palantir, and there's one glaring reason why any of this group of five stocks is a far better investment.
Palantir's stock has gotten ahead of itself
Palantir's AI software has seen significant growth recently, driving Palantir's 48% year-over-year revenue increase in Q2. I wouldn't be surprised to see the growth rate accelerate through the end of the year, but it will take a lot more than that to justify Palantir's stock price.
Although the stock price has increased 25-fold since the start of 2023, its quarterly revenue has only risen by 81%. This suggests that nearly all of Palantir's stock performance can be attributed to its valuation rising, which becomes evident when examining its valuation multiples.
At 126 times sales and 267 times forward earnings, Palantir is one of the most expensive stocks in the market.
It's rare for any stock to trade in the triple-digit price-to-sales (P/S) ratio range, let alone one that isn't doubling or tripling its revenue year over year, yet that's where we find Palantir. Palantir's stock has years of growth baked into the stock price, which will impede future returns. As a result, I think AI investors should consider other options, especially those with more reasonable valuations.
The market is full of promising AI investment opportunities
There are multiple ways to invest in the AI arms race, but my preferred approach is through companies that provide the computing hardware necessary to power AI computing. Chief among these are Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO 1.36%). Nvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), which are utilized for training and running AI models. Its GPUs are responsible for almost all of the AI technology we utilize today, and it will remain a top choice in the future.
Broadcom is also making a name for itself in two areas. First, its networking switches help stitch back information that is calculated across multiple computing units. Second, its custom AI chips, which are designed in collaboration with an end user, are starting to challenge Nvidia's computing dominance. Both companies will continue to be excellent AI investments as AI infrastructure spending ramps up.
Another important field in the hardware space is chip fabrication. My favorite fabricator by far is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.84%). TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, as they lack the in-house capabilities to do so. It has a long track record of continuously innovating and producing the world's most powerful chips, and an investment in TSMC is a bet that we're going to need more advanced chips in great quantities in the future (which is a safe bet).
Another company along the same lines as TSMC is ASML (ASML -1.55%). ASML manufactures extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are required in the chip manufacturing process. ASML is the only company in the world with this capability, making it a technological monopoly. As more chip foundries are built to handle the massive demand for AI-related equipment, ASML is expected to continue growing.
Lastly, I like Alphabet (GOOG -0.30%) (GOOGL -0.15%), which is both a hardware player (through its cloud computing service) and an AI developer (with its leading AI model, Gemini). The market has doubted Alphabet since it fell behind at the start of the AI arms race, but it has quickly found its running legs and is back in the AI race, and is a strong bet to continue being a market leader.
A look at their valuations shows that all five of these companies are far better buys than Palantir, and investors should consider this group first.",680,trafilatura,,False
company,1758362100,5 Top AI Stocks Prominent Billionaires Are Buying,136828088,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,Billionaire investors were piling into these names in Q2.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9453a9e12f8b0fd08d65b624dd1f2464628870eccf7dab641c3ae6d4fed31a16,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/5-top-ai-stocks-prominent-billionaires-are-buying/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/5-top-ai-stocks-prominent-billionaires-are-buying/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/5-top-ai-stocks-prominent-billionaires-are-buying/,200.0,"Billionaire portfolio managers typically become billionaires because they are good investors. That is why it can sometimes be smart to make note of the moves these investors are making to see if you might want to do the same.
Let's look at five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that billionaires were buying in Q2 and see if they might help you in your efforts to boost your portfolio.
Philippe Laffont: Nvidia and Broadcom
Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, which is a technology-focused hedge fund. While he may not be a household name, Laffont manages money for rich and powerful clients, including Amazon (AMZN 1.01%) founder Jeff Bezos.
Public filings show the billionaire was buying two top AI chip stocks in Q2, adding to his positions in Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) and Broadcom (AVGO 1.36%). He increased his Nvidia stake by 34% and those shares now account for 5% of his overall portfolio. He upped his Broadcom position by 58%, and it now represents 4.3% of his holdings.
With Nvidia predicting that AI infrastructure spending could climb from $600 billion to as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade, it's easy to see why Laffont is bullish on AI chip stocks. Nvidia is obviously the undisputed leader and has been the biggest beneficiary of the race to build out new AI data centers. Given the wide moat it's created through its CUDA software platform, the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are likely to remain the primary chips powering AI workloads long into the future.
However, Broadcom is also becoming a major player in the space by helping customers design custom AI chips. As good as Nvidia's chips are, customers do not want to solely rely on the chip giant, and those with deep pockets that are building massive data centers have been increasingly turning to Broadcom. While custom chips lack the flexibility of GPUs, they often can have higher performance and cost savings for the specific task for which they've been designed.
With AI chip demand surging, both Nvidia and Broadcom look like they will be long-term winners.
Stanley Druckenmiller: TSMC
Stanley Druckenmiller manages the Duquesne Family Office. This basically means that Druckenmiller became so rich that he no longer needs to manage the money of outside investors and is happy just investing his own money.
Druckenmiller was also investing in the AI chip theme, but instead of buying shares in chip designers, he added to his position in the company that manufactures the advanced chips: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.84%). Druckenmiller boosted his position by 28%, taking it up to a 4.3% position in his portfolio.
The beauty of investing in TSMC is that Druckenmiller doesn't have to pick a chip winner. TSMC is currently the only foundry that is able to make advanced chips with a high yield rate (this means with only a few defective chips per wafer) at scale. That has made it a close partner to every chipmaker and given it strong pricing power.
With the need for AI chips growing and potential in emerging industries like robotaxis and quantum computing, TSMC looks like a long-term winner.
Bill Ackman: Amazon and Alphabet
Famed investor Bill Ackman is head of Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman has always been fond of the consumer space, and he's playing AI in much the same way, making a large investment in Amazon in the quarter and increasing his bet on Alphabet (GOOGL -0.15%) (GOOG -0.30%). Amazon was a new investment for Ackman, and it represents a little over 9% of his portfolio, while he boosted his position in Alphabet so it now accounts for 15% of his holdings.
Both Amazon and Alphabet are cloud computing leaders that are seeing huge demand for their services. They also both have their own custom AI chips, which can help improve performance and reduce costs. This space is booming, and both are investing aggressively to take advantage of the opportunity.
Meanwhile, both companies are also deploying AI to help power their core businesses. Amazon is using AI to make its e-commerce business more efficient. This includes everything from having AI-powered robots in its fulfillment centers to using AI to optimize delivery routes and improve supply chain management. It's also using AI to drive its fast-growing sponsored ad business. This is all leading to strong operating leverage in its retail operations.
Alphabet, on the other hand, is using AI to help power its search business. AI Overviews is leading to more search queries, and it's just started rolling out its new AI Mode globally. In addition, newer features such as Lens and Circle to Search are also driving more queries, with many having a commercial intent (this is when a user is searching for products or services to purchase).

But Griffin consistently sold the stock (reducing his exposure in seven of the previous eight quarters) before his big purchase in 2025's Q2. Citadel now has more money invested in Nvidia than at any point since 2022, suggesting Griffin was too quick to sell and has since realized his mistake.
Here's what investors should know.
Tesla: The stock Ken Griffin sold in the second quarter
Tesla's electric car business is struggling. Automotive sales have declined in three straight quarters as the company has navigated increased competition, elevated interest rates, and brand damage caused by CEO Elon Musk's political activities. The company lost more than 3 percentage points of market share in the last year as Chinese automaker BYD became the global leader in electric car sales.
However, Tesla has a substantial opportunity in autonomous driving technology. It recently introduced its first commercial autonomous ride-sharing (robotaxi) service in Texas. The company is also testing its vehicles in California, and it recently won approval to begin testing in Nevada. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates robotaxi revenue will reach $84 billion by 2035.
Importantly, while Tesla trails the market leader Alphabet's Waymo -- which has commercial autonomous ride-sharing services in five U.S. cities -- the company arguably has an edge. Whereas Waymo relies on a costly sensor suite that requires city streets be mapped in extensive detail beforehand, Tesla relies solely on computer vision, which is less expensive and more scalable.
Meanwhile, Tesla is also developing an autonomous humanoid robot called Optimus. Musk says it will account for as much as 80% of the company's value in the future, telling analysts earlier this year, ""Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue."" Tesla hopes to manufacture at least a million units annually within five years.
Tesla currently trades at a 170 times forward earnings based on estimates for 2026, which make it the third-most expensive stock in the S&P 500. Put bluntly, the company is wildly overvalued if it fails to deliver on robotaxis and autonomous robots. But the current price may appear reasonable in hindsight if it executes on those opportunities. Investors will have to decide which outcome they see as most likely.
Nvidia: The stock Ken Griffin bought in the second quarter
Nvidia dominates the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips often called artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators because they speed up demanding workloads like AI training and inference. Nvidia has over 80% market share today, and many analysts think the company will maintain that level for the foreseeable future.
Nvidia dominates the AI accelerator market not only because its chips consistently deliver superior results when benchmarked against alternatives but also because the company complements its GPUs with adjacent networking hardware and central processing units (CPUs), as well as software tools that streamline the development of a wide variety of AI applications.
Blayne Curtis at Jefferies last year highlighted that competitive moat in a note to clients. ""Nvidia is in control of the ecosystem on both the hardware and software front, and their current cadence of new generations should make that lead only [grow] further,"" he wrote. Indeed, while Nvidia just recently started shipping its latest GPU (called Blackwell), its next generation GPU (called Rubin) will launch next year.
Looking ahead, Nvidia is well positioned to maintain its momentum. CEO Jensen Huang expects AI data center expenditures to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by the end of the decade, up from about $600 billion today. That means its addressable market will grow at least 400% in the next five years, which implies annual revenue growth in the upper 30% range at a minimum.
Indeed, Wall Street estimates Nvidia's earnings will increase at 36% annually during the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 50 times earnings seem quite reasonable. Patient investors with a time horizon of at least three years should feel comfortable buying a position in this semiconductor stock today.",775,trafilatura,,False
company,1758358800,3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in September,136828091,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,"Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are three top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy now.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9288fd2b070aa5debb26b02ee4e14115a05f3f1c6e56d1208b671ade34b9acc4,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/3-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/3-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/3-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,200.0,"The biggest driver of the market remains artificial intelligence (AI), which makes it a space where investors need to have some exposure. Some of the biggest growth, meanwhile, continues to come from the build-out of the data center infrastructure needed to run AI.
Let's look at three top tech stocks set to benefit from the continued spending on AI infrastructure.
1. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 1.36%) has suddenly become one of the most important players in the AI infrastructure build-out. With companies looking for alternatives to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), they are increasingly turning to Broadcom to help them design their own custom chips, which can be cheaper to operate and more efficient for inference workloads. This is an area where cost matters because inference is an ongoing expense, not a one-time training run.
Broadcom helped Alphabet design its tensor processing units (TPUs) that now help power its cloud computing unit, and that success led to Meta Platforms and ByteDance turning to Broadcom for help as well. These three customers alone represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity by fiscal 2027 (ending October 2027).
However, those customers are just the tip of the iceberg. The company recently revealed that a fourth customer, widely believed to be OpenAI, has already placed a $10 billion order for chips that will be delivered next year. With OpenAI and Oracle planning to spend $300 billion building out data centers over the next five years, Broadcom looks like it will be a key beneficiary. Meanwhile, Apple is also working with Broadcom to develop its own custom AI chips.
Broadcom's role in creating custom AI chips is only going to become more important as inference grows in importance. That makes the stock a long-term buy that investors will want to take a closer look at now in order to take full advantage of the potential gains.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.84%) has become the heart of the AI chip industry, as it is the company responsible for manufacturing most of the world's advanced chips, including those used in AI.
Manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex process that requires both technological expertise and scale. Foundries must continue to push down node sizes, which is how many transistors can fit on a chip, to help improve chips' performance and power consumption. They also need to maintain high yields, which means most of the chips on a wafer are free of defects and usable.
Competitors like Intel and Samsung have tried to close the gap in advanced chips, but they've both struggled to produce acceptable yields at smaller node sizes. This has essentially left TSMC as the only real game in town when it comes to producing advanced chips at scale with consistent yields. As a result, it has become a key partners for all the top chip designers. This dynamic has also given it strong pricing power, with the company set to raise prices next year by another 10%.
No matter who wins market share in AI chip design, TSMC is set to benefit because it is the one that builds the chips. And with AI chip demand expected to continue to soar, TSMC is poised to continue to be a big winner. Now is the time to give this stock a closer look.
3. ASML
If TSMC is the heart of the chip industry, ASML (ASML -1.55%) is the company that makes the tools that allow that heart to keep beating. ASML basically has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the technology needed to make advanced chips. Without its machines, TSMC, Intel, and Samsung would not be able to manufacture any advanced chips whatsoever.
Each EUV machine can cost $220 million or more, and its next-generation high-NA EUV machines cost nearly double the price. Intel was the first foundry to adopt high-NA EUV for use in production, while TSMC has taken delivery of its first machine and is testing it, but wider adoption may not come until later in the decade. Still, to push node sizes down even further, foundries will eventually need its newer high-NA EUV machines.
That said, with AI chip demand surging and foundries continuing to expand capacity, ASML will keep selling more of its existing EUV systems for years to come. There really is no alternative supplier for this technology, which gives ASML a very wide moat and pricing power.
The company also recently took a large stake in AI start-up Mistral AI, and it plans to incorporate its large language models (LLMs) throughout its product portfolio and operations. The collaboration looks like a low-risk move that could have solid benefits, but the biggest reason to own the stock is that it has a monopoly on the technology needed to make AI chips.",796,trafilatura,,False
company,1758357600,Investors Should Ask: Who Wins More From This $6.3 Billion CoreWeave-Nvidia Agreement?,136828092,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,NVDA,Yahoo,Perspectives and risk tolerances could drive this choice.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2fff1b05c97700349109550951a49eca39d12ab92c80ce8d9835871d33ea2997,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/investors-who-wins-coreweave-nvidia-deal/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/investors-who-wins-coreweave-nvidia-deal/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/investors-who-wins-coreweave-nvidia-deal/,200.0,"CoreWeave (CRWV 3.70%) just announced that it has landed an order from AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) worth at least $6.3 billion. The deal obligates Nvidia to purchase its residual unsold capacity until April 13, 2032, if it is not already purchased by CoreWeave's customers.
CoreWeave is a longtime Nvidia client. It has purchased hundreds of thousands of GPUs, which CoreWeave rents out to clients. With the agreement, CoreWeave gains an additional revenue source.
Still, investors need to remember that the spare capacity was valuable enough to pay CoreWeave $6.3 billion, raising questions about which company will reap the greater benefit. Thus, investors should take a closer look at the deal to see whether CoreWeave or Nvidia benefits more.
How CoreWeave benefits
CoreWeave obviously benefits from the deal since it has a guaranteed customer, and it will receive $6.3 billion in revenue over the length of the agreement.
But understanding the benefit fully means knowing what CoreWeave offers to the market. CoreWeave is an artificial intelligence (AI) based cloud computing company. It differs from cloud providers like Amazon's AWS as it builds servers specifically for workloads related to AI, machine learning, high-performance computing, and visual effects.
It also provides customers with the latest hardware, can handle heavy workloads at lower costs, and its per-instance pricing allows customers to manage their costs more closely. Such an approach makes CoreWeave valuable to the AI industry, but it can also leave it with unused capacity. Nvidia's move to claim that spare capacity should therefore provide CoreWeave with some degree of stability.
Knowing that, investors should note where CoreWeave stands financially. Its $58 billion market cap is a tiny fraction of Nvidia's $4.25 trillion size. Also, even though CoreWeave's revenue of $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 grew by 275% yearly, it still lost $605 million during that time. Such losses mean it will likely have to turn to capital markets to raise funds.
That need is even more acute because it pledged to spend between $20 billion and $23 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2025 alone. So it needs deals like the one with Nvidia so it can recoup its capex investments and eventually grow into a profitable operation.
Why Nvidia made this agreement
What may confuse investors is how the deal helps Nvidia. Even though Nvidia and CoreWeave are close partners, CoreWeave's business requires it to purchase Nvidia's latest AI accelerators. But investors may not understand why it chose to spend $6.3 billion to help this particular customer.
For one, Nvidia owns 24.3 million shares of CoreWeave as of June 30, about 5% of the outstanding shares. The agreement goes a long way toward solidifying Nvidia's investment and the relationship between the two companies.
Intense demand for AI has led to a shortage of cloud capacity, so this deal also gives Nvidia a claim over a scarce commodity. Thanks to this deal, Nvidia will have to rely less on large cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft, giving it more control over its destiny in this regard.
Furthermore, having CoreWeave in a more solid financial position means CoreWeave will more likely meet the aforementioned goals on capex spending. With that, it will spend more on Nvidia GPUs, helping to boost the size and expanse of the AI ecosystem over which it has considerable control.
What may look like charity to CoreWeave will likely serve Nvidia's interests in the end.
Does CoreWeave or Nvidia benefit more from the deal?
This deal will probably benefit both companies, although CoreWeave is likely to derive more benefit, at least from an investor perspective.
Nvidia may benefit more in an abstract sense, as it gains influence over the AI ecosystem. Nvidia's larger size also makes it a safer investment, a welcome relief to investors who feel uncomfortable buying into a money-losing company spending heavily on capex.
Still, the Nvidia deal offers a considerable boost to CoreWeave's top line. This makes it more likely that CoreWeave's massive spending will ultimately deliver positive returns for the company.
CoreWeave's much smaller size also means it can attain higher percentage growth from a much smaller base. The doubling of CoreWeave's value takes its market cap to $116 billion. The same percentage move would take Nvidia's market cap to $8.5 trillion, a challenging feat in a market that has yet to see a company with a $5 trillion market cap.
In the end, CoreWeave comes with higher risks than Nvidia. However, if you are willing to take a chance, CoreWeave offers greater potential for higher-percentage returns.",757,trafilatura,,False

Two names that have attracted growing attention this year are Oracle and CoreWeave.
Unlike the tech titans that dominate headlines, Oracle and CoreWeave are carving out their niche at the infrastructure layer of the AI ecosystem. The opportunity they've identified is straightforward but also mission-critical: providing cloud-based access to GPUs. These chips -- designed primarily by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices -- remain supply constrained as they are largely absorbed by the world's largest companies.
This supply imbalance has created an opportunity to enable AI model development by offering GPUs as a service -- a business model that allows companies to rent chip capacity through cloud infrastructure. For businesses that cannot secure GPUs directly, infrastructure services are both time-saving and cost-efficient.
In the background, however, a small, albeit capable, company has been competing with Oracle and CoreWeave in the GPU-as-a-service landscape. Let's explore how Nebius Group (NBIS 0.17%) is disrupting incumbents and why now is an interesting time to take a look at the stock for your portfolio.
17.4 billion reasons to pay close attention to Nebius
Last week, Nebius announced a five-year, $17.4 billion infrastructure agreement with Microsoft. For reference, up until this point, Nebius' management had been guiding for $1.1 billion in run rate annual recurring revenue (ARR) by December. I point this out to underscore just how transformative this contract is in terms of scale and duration.
The Microsoft deal not only places Nebius firmly alongside peers like Oracle and CoreWeave in the AI infrastructure conversation, but it also serves as validation that its technology is robust enough to meet the standards of a hyperscaler.
For Microsoft, the partnership is equally strategic. With GPUs in chronically short supply and long lead times to expand data center capacity, this agreement allows Microsoft to secure adequate compute resources without stretching internal infrastructure or assuming the upfront capital expenditure (capex) budget and execution risks that come with it.
Why this deal matters for investors
AI investment is not a cyclical trend -- it's a structural shift. Enterprises are deploying applications into production at unprecedented speed, workloads are scaling rapidly, and new use cases in areas like robotics and autonomous systems are emerging.
For companies that supply the compute underpinning this increasingly complex ecosystem, these dynamics create durable secular tailwinds. By securing Microsoft as a flagship customer, Nebius has established itself within this foundational layer of the AI infrastructure economy.
Is Nebius stock a buy right now?
Since announcing its partnership with Microsoft, Nebius shares have surged roughly 39% as of this writing (Sept. 16). With that kind of momentum, it's natural to wonder whether the stock has become expensive. To answer that, it helps to put its valuation in context.
Prior to the Microsoft deal, Nebius was guiding for $1.1 billion in ARR by year-end. If I assume Microsoft's $17.4 billion commitment is evenly spread across five years (2026 to 2031), that adds about $3.5 billion annually -- bringing Nebius' pro forma ARR closer to $4.6 billion.
Against its current market cap of $21.3 billion, Nebius stock trades at an implied forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.6. On the surface, that looks meaningfully discounted to peers like Oracle and CoreWeave.
That said, there are important caveats to consider. My analysis assumes no customer attrition over the next several years -- this is unrealistic due to competitive pressures. While Nebius may continue winning large-scale contracts, it's also reasonable to expect some customer churn.
Moreover, comparing Nebius' future ARR to Oracle's and CoreWeave's current revenue base is not an apples-to-apples match. Oracle, for example, has reportedly inked a $300 billion cloud deal with OpenAI. Meanwhile, CoreWeave also has multiyear, multibillion-dollar commitments tied to OpenAI. The catch is that OpenAI itself doesn't have the cash on its balance sheet to fully fund these agreements -- leaving questions about their viability.
In short, Nebius appears attractively valued relative to its peers -- but the landscape is evolving quickly and riddled with moving parts. The more important takeaway is that Nebius is now winning significant business alongside its brand-name peers.
In my eyes, this validation in combination with ongoing structural demand tailwinds makes Nebius a compelling buy and hold opportunity as the AI infrastructure narrative continues to unfold.",726,trafilatura,,False

Much like Cathie Wood's long-standing conviction in Tesla, Kindig has consistently expressed unwavering enthusiasm for semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%).
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Kindig sparked debate after revealing her forecast that Nvidia could reach a $6 trillion market cap by the end of next calendar year -- implying roughly 43% upside from its current levels.
Below, I'll outline the logic behind Kindig's projection and then examine the key drivers that, in my view, lend credibility to her thesis.
What would it take for Nvidia to reach a $6 trillion valuation?
The vast majority of Nvidia's revenue is driven by its data center segment. In the second fiscal quarter (ended July 27), Nvidia reported $41.1 billion in data center sales -- a 56% increase year over year. This translates to an annualized run rate of roughly $160 billion.
Kindig argues that the probability of Nvidia reaching $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue by year end -- or a $200 billion annual run rate -- is ""very high,"" given the company is still in the early stages of scaling its next-generation Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPU architectures.
She further contends that Wall Street is underestimating capital expenditure (capex) trends across AI hyperscalers. In her estimation, analysts are not fully modeling the scale of demand for Nvidia's GPUs.
Kindig's math suggests that surging investment in infrastructure could push Nvidia's data center operation to $75 billion in quarterly sales ($300 billion annual run rate) by the end of next year -- implying 50% growth compared to her 2025 year-end figures.
Of course, understanding the arithmetic is just one piece of the story. The larger question is why I share Kindig's bullish stance -- and what's truly at stake for Nvidia as AI infrastructure spending accelerates.
What are the pillars supporting Nvidia's data center growth?
At the core of Kindig's thesis is hyperscaler capex spending. The world's largest cloud providers -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- are committing unprecedented sums to expand compute power, setting the stage for the next phase of the AI era.
The rationale is straightforward: As AI workloads grow and new applications emerge, both training and inference require increasingly sophisticated infrastructure. With hyperscalers doubling down on budgets, Nvidia is positioned to be the primary beneficiary as its GPUs remain the backbone of these AI services.
Consider robotics as an example. Companies like Amazon and Tesla are investing in systems that can navigate warehouse operations with human-grade precision. Training physical systems to interpret and engage with real-world environments is far more complex than the reactive large language models (LLMs) that power today's chatbots. Such advancements require massive GPU clusters -- precisely the systems Nvidia delivers.
Autonomous systems in transportation, manufacturing, and defense follow a similar trajectory. Moving from proof-of-concept to commercial deployment will drive an exponential increase in demand for compute. Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and its successors are designed for this leap -- combining efficiency with processing power that makes Nvidia an indispensable supplier for enterprises building mission-critical workflows.
At the same time, cloud infrastructure is undergoing its own major transformation. A new wave of GPU-as-a-service agreements is gaining momentum, with companies renting access to GPU capacity through providers such as Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nebius Group.
This model creates a multiplier effect for Nvidia whereby the company is not only supplying GPUs to the hyperscalers, but it's also partnering with specialized cloud operators that lease its hardware downstream. As businesses increasingly adopt multi-platform cloud strategies, they distribute workloads across several providers. In turn, this expands Nvidia's footprint in the swiftly evolving AI hardware ecosystem.
Is Nvidia stock a buy now?
Taken together, these catalysts create powerful secular tailwinds supporting Nvidia's long-term growth. The company's expanding data center business is not merely a byproduct of hyperscaler infrastructure investment; rather, it is the inevitable outcome of structural shifts driving the next generation of AI applications.
At a high level, the precise timing of a $6 trillion valuation is less important than the underlying trend: Nvidia is well-positioned to remain the dominant force in AI infrastructure. Against this backdrop, I think the stock offers meaningful alpha potential and makes for a compelling long-term position.",714,trafilatura,,False

Just had a great design review today with the Tesla AI5 chip design team! This is going to be an epic chip.
-- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 6, 2025
And AI6 to follow has a shot at being the best by AI chip by far.
Switching from doing 2 chip architectures to 1 means all our silicon talent is focused on making 1...
Tesla's efforts to move into custom silicon could be significant for the company's next-generation products -- but what might they mean for semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia?
What is the AI5 chip, and why does it matter?
AI5 -- and its successor AI6 -- are simply Tesla's internal codenames for its next generation of custom chips. While Musk's comments may fuel a debate over which company is designing the most advanced silicon, investors should look past the surface-level narrative. His underlying message points to something larger: Tesla is pursuing deeper vertical integration of its technology stack.
The rationale is straightforward. By consolidating its high-end computing onto a single family of purpose-built chips, Tesla gains greater control over both performance and cost -- and can streamline engineering cycles and accelerate product development. From a financial perspective, this strategy also has the potential to improve unit economics by reducing supply chain risk and expanding profit margins over time.
How do these investments impact Tesla's AI ambitions?
Tesla's AI ambitions can be divided into two categories: self-driving cars and humanoid robotics. While these markets target different end users, the unifying theme is autonomy.
Importantly, autonomy will not be achieved as a singular breakthrough -- it will be the product of constant iteration. Both Tesla's robotaxis and its Optimus robots rely on taking in fresh real-world data and using machine learning loops to steadily become ""smarter"" and more capable over time.
Is this a checkmate move against Nvidia?
Given the context above, it's critical to note that Nvidia remains the leader in powering the training side of AI workloads. Tesla may have bold ambitions in custom silicon design, but the key question for investors is whether its efforts could truly disrupt Nvidia's dominance in the data center landscape.
At present, I see that as highly unlikely. Nvidia's entrenched position -- anchored not only by its hardware but also by its widely used CUDA computing platform -- gives the company broad ecosystem advantages. Coupled with its rapid pace of product development -- it rolled out its Blackwell Ultra GPUs earlier in this quarter, and will launch its next-gen Rubin GPUs in 2026 -- these factors make it difficult for any competitor to materially erode Nvidia's lead in AI infrastructure at this time.
Nvidia's dominance is not solely a function of its chips. Rather, the company's comprehensive hardware-software stack creates immense friction for enterprises considering moving some of their business to rival platforms. This creates a formidable technological moat and durable competitive advantage for Nvidia.
With this in mind, the broader takeaway is that Nvidia's flywheel is unlikely to come to a sudden halt simply because one company is choosing to become more self-reliant. While Tesla may eventually compete with Nvidia in the autonomous vehicle chip market, it is quite likely to remain a complementary player -- or even an Nvidia customer -- when it comes to AI training protocols.
Against this backdrop, Tesla's progress in developing its own infrastructure is notable, but those efforts are still in their early stages. All the while, Nvidia continues to roll out improved successor architectures to its already industry-leading GPUs.
The bottom line is that while Tesla may find ways to meet some of its chip needs in-house over time, it is still far from achieving a checkmate position against the AI chip leader.",665,trafilatura,,False

- Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in Intel this week, raising worries Arm and Advanced Micro Devices could face stiffer competition.
- However, some Wall Street analysts indicated the tie-up could have less of an impact on Arm and AMD than a slide in their shares would suggest.
- Bank of America and Bernstein analysts said shares of companies that sell chipmaking equipment could get a boost if the deal leads to more business for Intel's foundry.
Some investors reacted strongly—and quickly—to Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel, fearing stiffer competition for Arm and Advanced Micro Devices. Those initial worries appear to have subsided, but questions about how much to read into the deal remain.
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) design partner Arm (ARM) slipped 7% in the wake of yesterday's deal, which included a plan for Intel and Nvidia to co-develop AI chips. AMD (AMD) shed nearly 6% before recouping most of those losses. Some Wall Street analysts indicated the tie-up would have less of an impact than the initial moves would suggest.
Bank of America analysts on Friday said they see “limited near-term impact” for AMD and ARM because of the tie-up. They maintained ""buy"" ratings for both companies' shares, and pointed to potential upside for companies that sell chipmaking equipment or software used in the design process. Shares of firms in those businesses, including ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Lam Research (LRCX), have gained since yesterday's announcement.
The impact on AMD could be “less impactful than we might have thought at first blush,” Bernstein analysts wrote, saying they see sentiment for manufacturing equipment makers like ASML getting a boost.
One open question for investors: whether the Intel-Nvidia tie-up might mean more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other companies. The deal announced Thursday did not include foundry commitments.
Bernstein said Nvidia’s moves could indicate a preference for its existing manufacturing partners like TSMC (TSM)—as well as a desire to buy goodwill from the U.S. government, which now holds a 10% stake in Intel, without a deeper commitment.
“Both companies went out of their way to sing TSMC’s praises (which makes sense as neither can afford to alienate their most important supplier at this point),” Bernstein analysts said, noting that even if Nvidia moved forward with an Intel manufacturing deal, it would still continue to work with TSMC, likely not making much of a dent in that company's business.
Nvidia ""is already undoubtedly ‘engaging’ with Intel to at least evaluate their foundry prospects as, presumably, are many others,"" Bernstein wrote. ""Everyone wants to be able to have Intel as a second source.""",439,trafilatura,,False

Most investors seem confident that this event marks a turning point for Intel stock, and that brighter days lie ahead -- but one big banker is not so sure!
This morning, Citigroup downgraded Intel stock to sell. Intel stock was down 3.3% through 2:25 p.m. ET in response.
Citi's the odd one out
It's worth noting that Citi seems pretty lonely in its pessimism. According to data from The Fly, at least four separate investment banks have raised their price targets on Intel since news of the Nvidia investment appeared. One banker, Benchmark, even upgraded Intel stock on the news, and set a $43 price target.
But not Citigroup.
While reluctantly raising its price target in tandem with the rising stock price, Citi complains that ""investors expect that a foundry deal is upcoming,"" but Intel's foundry business ""has a minimal chance of succeeding,"" reports The Fly.
Is Intel stock a sell?
Foundry worries lie at the heart of Citi's decision to downgrade Intel stock and, I must admit, Nvidia does have its work cut out for it if it hopes to help turn around the fortunes of its rival.
According to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, Intel's foundry business did only $17.5 billion in revenue last year, and foundry revenue has been falling for the last two years. The foundry unit also lost $8 billion in 2024 -- meaning for every $1 worth of chips Intel makes on contract for a customer, the company loses about $0.46.

It's up 1,300% over the past five years, and it doesn't look like it's anywhere near done.
Its growth prospects are up for debate amid increasing competition and its sheer size, which makes it harder to report high percentage growth. Still, there are many reasons to believe in Nvidia's future. Here's one reason investors still have time to buy Nvidia stock.
Hyperscalers are spending
There are several ways to envision Nvidia's opportunity, and one of them is to analyze how its largest clients are spending money on its products.
Nvidia works with the largest cloud operators in the world, the hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. These companies are building out their large language models (LLM) and offering top artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to their millions of customers, who in turn are using these platforms to create the next generation of generative AI apps.
This is the AI revolution that's changing how people do business, shop, pay, and more, and these hyperscalers need Nvidia's powerful chips to drive their AI models.
Just take a look at how much these three companies are spending this year on capital expenditures, and you can see how Nvidia's business is going to be a crucial part of this process for the foreseeable future. Amazon is spending at a run rate of $120 billion, Microsoft at $100 billion, and Meta at about $65 billion. These are accelerations from last year, and as companies require more power, those numbers are likely to keep going up. Nvidia doesn't collect every dollar of these sales, but it dominates this market.
I wouldn't bet on Nvidia offering the same kind of growth it has in the past over the next five years, but it's still likely to beat the market and offer value for shareholders.",331,trafilatura,,False

This month, Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%) is joining the fray, taking a roughly 4% stake in the company following a $5 billion investment.
The deal surprised many investors given Nvidia has amassed such a dominant lead in key growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI). And notably, the $5 billion price tag is relative chump change for Nvidia. That figure represents just 0.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. But when you dig deeper, the partnership between Intel and Nvidia makes a lot of sense. In fact, there are two promising reasons the deal could help solidify Nvidia's leading market share for AI chips.
The details of the Nvidia and Intel partnership are revealing
Let's take a direct look at the details of this partnership, beginning with some comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to understand what exactly is going on.
""This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem -- a fusion of two world-class platforms,"" Huang said in a news release. ""Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.""
While there is some technical jargon in these comments, they get to the heart of what this partnership is all about. Nvidia has had a heavy lead in AI chips for years. Many estimates peg the company with a 90% market share in this category. Intel, meanwhile, still holds a heavy lead in CPU market share. Its chips in that category control around 60% of the market. Around 50% of desktops run on Intel chips, plus 73% of laptops and 76% of servers. It is this server market share that Nvidia is most interested in.
Since 2021, Intel stock lost around 50% of its value. Nvidia shares, meanwhile, gained more than 1,000%. Why such a difference in performance if both companies have high market shares in their respective categories? According to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, ""The success of modern AI techniques relies on computation on a scale unimaginable even a few years ago."" The AI chips of today, the center adds, ""are tens or even thousands of times faster and more efficient than CPUs for training and inference of AI algorithms.""
The AI market is expected to grow by 30% or more per year for decades to come. With early investment, Nvidia was able to dominate this huge growth market, which demands parallel processors designed to run thousands of simultaneous operations over more general-purpose processors that Intel produces.
Still, the AI industry requires both AI-focused GPU and CPU chips to function. CPU chips can excel in low-latency tasks where efficiency is a priority. And data centers around the world leverage both CPUs and GPUs to operate.
The partnership between Intel and Nvidia essentially commits Intel to build custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms. It also requires Nvidia to integrate its GPUs more directly into Intel's client PCs. The result is a mutually embedded ecosystem that can improve the performance and efficiency of both companies' products. It's why Huang described the partnership as a ""fusion of two world-class platforms"" that will help both companies expand their ecosystems.
Both Intel and Nvidia come out as winners
This partnership ensures two things.
First, Nvidia will now have a tighter grip on its hardware stack. As the company proved with its CUDA developer platform, Nvidia is very skilled at integrating various components to maximize performance and vendor lock-in. More control over the CPU side of the stack gives Nvidia even more ability to advance its tech stack in ways that competitors can't match -- at least for now.
Intel, meanwhile, will now be able to integrate Nvidia's leading AI capabilities in ways its competitors will find difficult to match. CPUs are already being designed with dedicated AI cores, and the combination of Intel's and Nvidia's technology should make Intel's chips more appealing to its end markets, especially data centers looking to add more Nvidia chips. Intel CPUs now become the clear complementary solution.
Nvidia's $5 billion investment isn't the key mover in this story. Instead, it's the intertwining of each company's tech stack that will provide the most long-term benefits.",714,trafilatura,,False

It had no permanent CEO until March, when industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan took over after former CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced out. Intel's foundry business, a capital-intensive endeavor meant to open up Intel's manufacturing technology and facilities to third-party customers, wasn't winning meaningful customers. Tan made it clear that without significant external revenue, Intel may have to get out of the chip manufacturing business altogether.
For the foundry to work, Intel needs plenty of cash to scale up its Intel 18A process and complete development of its upcoming Intel 14A process. It also needs enough external customers to justify those massive investments. The company got both on Thursday, courtesy of Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%).
A game-changing deal
Artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader Nvidia has agreed to a deal with Intel that will see both companies jointly develop multiple generations of data center and PC products. For the data center, custom x86 chips will be used by Nvidia and sold to other customers. In the PC market, Intel's CPU technology will be combined with Nvidia GPU chiplets to create system-on-chips that will be offered to external customers.
This announcement comes on the heels of Intel's push into custom silicon. Earlier this month, Intel disclosed that it was creating a new group that would design custom semiconductor chips for external customers. Nvidia appears to be the first such customer.
Importantly, Intel will also manufacture these custom Nvidia chips. The company didn't disclose timelines, process nodes, or much other information, but the announcement noted that Intel would both ""design and manufacture"" custom data center and client CPUs integrating Nvidia technology. Intel desperately needed a major external foundry customer, and now it has one.
Intel also desperately needs capital to fund its foundry business, and the other part of the deal with Nvidia provides just that. Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel, buying shares at $23.28 a pop. Intel didn't disclose the planned use of this capital injection, but the company certainly needs cash to scale up its latest process nodes.
Cash infusions are adding up
Nvidia's $5 billion investment adds to Intel's haul over the past month. In August, Intel reached a deal for the U.S. government to invest $8.9 billion in the company. Some of the funding came from previous grants under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which had not yet been paid, although those grants originally had conditions that were then dropped as part of the deal. Intel confirmed that it had received a $5.7 billion payment from the U.S. government in late August related to the deal.
Intel also received a $2 billion investment from Softbank in August, announced a few days before the deal with the U.S. government. The Softbank investment, the Nvidia investment, and the payment from the U.S. government add up to a $12.7 billion cash infusion. Intel also recently closed on its sale of a majority stake in Altera, which brought in an additional $3.3 billion. All told, that's around $16 billion in cash, before any taxes related to the Altera sale.
These cash infusions give Intel some breathing room, and the collaboration with Nvidia provides an enormous vote of confidence for Intel's custom silicon business and its foundry business. While Intel's turnaround will still be a slow process, things are clearly looking up for the struggling chip company.",567,trafilatura,,False

As of 11:58 a.m. ET, the stock was up 7% on the news.
ASML rides Intel's coattails
ASML, which is the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) to make semiconductors, counts Intel, one of the world's biggest chip manufacturers, as a major customer, along with TSMC and Samsung, though Intel has struggled badly in recent years.
The thinking seems to go that the Nvidia partnership could breathe new life into Intel, boosting its foundry and creating new demand for ASML, though the deal doesn't directly focus on Intel Foundry.
In response to the news, Bank of America raised its price target from $724 to $941 and reiterated a buy rating on the stock, noting that a more competitive Intel should be a positive for semiconductor equipment companies.
Can ASML keep gaining?
After missing out on the AI rally over much of the past year, ASML is finally gaining traction, as investors have responded positively to recent news, including its deal to take a stake in Mistral AI for 1.3 billion euros, and signs that TSMC is increasing its capital expenditures budget.

The artificial intelligence (AI) cloud infrastructure, or neocloud, company evolved out of the Russian tech company Yandex, which was delisted from the Nasdaq after Russia invaded Ukraine. The company sold off its Russian assets and rebranded as Nebius, based in Amsterdam.
Now, Nebius is one of the fastest-growing stocks on the market. In the second quarter, revenue jumped 625% to $105.1 million, and the stock is up a whopping 424% this year, outpacing virtually every other AI stock on the market.
Nebius surged by nearly 50% in one session after it announced a blockbuster deal with Microsoft. The tech giant signed a contract for $17.4 billion in GPU services through 2031. This shows that despite the company's relatively low revenue, it's bringing in billions in contract commitments. Nebius' larger peer, CoreWeave, is also delivering massive growth, with its revenue up 207% in the second quarter to $1.21 billion.
Why the neocloud is growing so fast
The so-called hyperscalers -- the big cloud computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, along with Meta Platforms -- are expected to spend roughly $300 billion on capital expenditures, with much of that going to data centers to meet demand for AI computing power.
Nebius and CoreWeave are much smaller than the hyperscalers, so by dollar value, they are growing more slowly. Still, demand for AI cloud servers is so strong that it is propelling these companies' revenue up triple digits, and prompting Microsoft to commit $17.4 billion to Nebius.
As long as AI demand remains strong, we're likely to see outsized growth from Nebius and CoreWeave continue this year.
But it's a risky model
The neocloud companies need to spend on capex to build data centers and fill them with GPUs. In order to fund that spending, it has to take on debt.
Nebius had $1 billion in debt at the end of the second quarter against $1.7 billion in cash, and it will need to borrow more money to fund its expansion and to make up for losses. Because of that business model, Nebius is also losing a lot of money. The company reported an operating loss of $111.2 million in the second quarter, more than it brought in for revenue.
By comparison, the larger CoreWeave now has $11 billion in debt and is on track to pay more than $1 billion in interest expense this year, though Nebius may be on a better trajectory.
What Nebius will look like in a year
More than most AI stocks, Nebius and CoreWeave seem like avatars for the broader AI boom. Their performance is likely to track with broader interest and demand for AI computing power.
Based on the recent momentum, there looks to be plenty of runway left in the AI boom, meaning there's a good chance Nebius will be higher in a year, and it could be significantly higher if it can secure more deals like the one with Microsoft.
However, Nebius remains a high-risk stock, and it's likely to take a dive if the AI narrative wanes. There are a number of reasons that could happen, whether it's economic weakness, a slowdown in AI capex spending, disappointing software sales, or disillusionment with AI products.

One AI stock that has done extremely well is Nebius Group (NBIS 0.17%), which owns and operates data centers specifically tailored for running large language models (LLM) that power AI applications. Nebius' stock joined the Nasdaq in October last year and is up roughly 465% since. After such a big run, is Nebius still a buy?
Business is really starting to hum
Nebius has a complex history. The assets that comprise the company today used to be owned by the Russian search giant Yandex, but when Russia invaded Ukraine, the U.S. placed a lot of sanctions and regulatory actions that required Russian companies to delist from U.S. exchanges. In 2024, a group of assets was split off from Yandex to form Nebius in a $5.4 billion deal. These assets included the core cloud data center business, data labeling, self-driving vehicles, and an education technology business.
Nebius, which is now based in Amsterdam, then rejoined the Nasdaq last October and raised a $700 million round of financing led by several major venture capital firms and Nvidia, which is a key partner of the firm. Nebius has six locations with data center space, including its own data center in Finland, a new facility in New Jersey that will soon be live, and colocations in Missouri, the United Kingdom, Iceland, and France. These data centers are equipped with clusters of the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia, which are then available to companies looking to run AI applications.
While there are competitors in this space, Nebius also offers tools that help developers build AI models and that better train and enhance large language models. Nebius' balance sheet is also strong with moderate levels of debt and the company uses a more conservative depreciation length of four years on its GPUs.
In the second quarter of 2025, Nebius reported $105 million of revenue, up 625% year over year, although the company's adjusted net loss climbed to $91.5 million, up from an adjusted loss of $61.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. Management also raised the company's guidance to an annual revenue run-rate of $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of this year.
However, everything changed recently when Nebius announced a multi-year deal with Microsoft, which will likely start in 2026 and last through 2031. The deal is worth $17.4 billion, but has the potential to be worth as much as $19.4 billion. On the news, Nebius' stock soared 50%. Furthermore, CEO Arkady Volozh said in a statement that he thinks there are more deals to come.
Is the stock a buy?
Assuming Nebius' deal with Microsoft is for six years for $17.4 billion implies annual revenue of $2.9 billion, which would bring the company close to a $4 billion annual run rate when you add in Nebius' initial expected revenue run rate by year end. With the company trading at a roughly $24.5 billion market cap, that means the stock trades at roughly 6 times revenue. That's not necessarily cheap, but it's by no means expensive among high-flying AI stocks.
It's also good news to see Volozh hinting at other deals, and Nebius also owns other assets that could eventually be of value. I also like the fact that Nebius has a strong balance sheet, and seems to be conservative in its depreciation of GPUs. For all of these reasons, I think the stock is a buy. However, after such a big run, I would recommend dollar-cost averaging.",615,trafilatura,,False

According to a report by Catherine Bolgar on Microsoft’s official website, this innovation, called in-chip microfluidic cooling, can remove heat up to three times more efficiently than the commonly used cold plates.
The new system addresses the issue of heat generated by AI chips, which has been increasing with each new generation of technology.
The cooling system uses microfluidics, a method that directs liquid coolant directly into the silicon chip. This is achieved by etching minuscule channels on the back of the chip, allowing for effective heat removal.
Bolgar wrote that the research team used AI to identify unique heat signatures within a chip to direct the coolant more precisely. Microsoft claims this approach could enhance efficiency and sustainability for future AI chip designs.
During lab-scale tests simulating a Teams meeting, microfluidics reduced the maximum temperature rise inside a GPU by 65% and improved power usage effectiveness.

By GlobalDataSashi Majety, senior technical programme manager for cloud operations and innovation at Microsoft, highlighted the necessity of moving beyond traditional cold plate technology within five years to keep pace with evolving AI chip designs.
According to Microsoft, creating effective microfluidic systems presents significant engineering challenges. The dimensions of these cooling channels are comparable to human hair, requiring precise design and manufacturing processes.
Microsoft corporate vice president and cloud operations and innovation chief technical officer Judy Priest said: “Microfluidics would allow for more power-dense designs that will enable more features that customers care about and give better performance in a smaller amount of space.
“But we needed to prove the technology and the design worked, and then the very next thing I wanted to do was test reliability.”
Microsoft worked with Swiss startup Corintis to use AI in developing a bio-inspired channel design, resembling natural structures like leaf veins.
Over the past year, Microsoft produced four iterations of the design as part of its prototyping efforts. The process involved creating a leak-proof package for the chips, finding optimal coolant formulas, testing various etching methods, and establishing a manufacturing process.
The company plans to further explore integrating microfluidic cooling into future generations of its chips and collaborate with partners for broader implementation across its data centres.

Caledonia residents learned that Microsoft is the company behind ""Project Nova,"" a proposed data center support project for the village.
Microsoft told village officials Sept. 23 that it intends to build facilities on 244 acres of land to support its far larger data center operation in Mount Pleasant.
Before its effort in Caledonia was made public, Microsoft announced a second $4 billion data center on Sept. 18 to go with its first data center which is planned to be fully built in 2026.
However unlike the property in Mount Pleasant, Microsoft would need to land to be rezoned, which is where the Caledonia officials come in.
""Offers have been accepted on land so that's not a problem,"" Caledonia Village President Tom Weatherston said in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""That zone change if approved – if approved – reverses back if Microsoft doesn't do anything in the next few years.""
Weatherston said most of the property is owned by We Energies and the rest of the land is owned by small farmers but he didn't know the specific use.
""Knowing Caledonia, probably horses,"" Weatherston said.
In a statement Microsoft said:
""This week, as we introduce ourselves to neighbors in Caledonia, we look forward to working together to build a project that reflects the values and priorities important here – including those related to the character of the community and the environment.""
The company went on to say it plans to work with We Energies on a proposed rate plan to pay more for its energy usage and it emphasized its construction of a 250-megawatt solar plant in Portage County.
""Locally, Microsoft continues to expand partnerships that create direct connection with those who could benefit – including with the United Way of Racine County and Gateway Technical College for digital skills training, and Root Pike WIN and the Ecojustice Center on environmental sustainability. ""
Project will be considered by Plan Commission, Village Board
If the project moves forward and is approved, and Microsoft builds on it as intended, Weatherston said it would make the company ""the largest taxpayer in the village.""
""Microsoft is a very environmentally friendly company and they tend to work very closely with the towns and villages. I see a lot of upside if this gets approved,"" Weatherston said.
Laura Million, deputy director of Racine County Economic Development Corp., said Microsoft is seeking approval from the village to begin to design and build on the land.
“So the rezone portion of this is what’s most important to them at this point in time,"" Million said. ""Until (Microsoft) gets into the details of planning the site, we won’t have a clear understanding of what kind of investment is going to be there.”
And unlike the development in Mount Pleasant, there is no tax incremental finance district associated with this project which could mean more revenue for the village.
While residents may have not enjoyed the secrecy that came with this development, Million said Microsoft is being cautious.
“They want to be a good community partner, that’s why they’re coming out at this point in time,” Million said. “It’s an opportunity for Microsoft to address residents, concerns, and there will be even more information next week at the public hearing at the Plan Commission.”
On Sept. 24, residents can ask questions of village and company officials at an informational session at 5 p.m. at Caledonia Village Hall 5043 Chester Ln.
The Plan Commission is scheduled to meet on Sept. 29 to discuss and vote on the rezone of the project. If it is approved it goes to the Village Board on Oct. 14.
'It's not a stand alone project'
At the Sept. 9 village board meeting, several residents spoke against the prospect of a data center before it was publicly known the company was going to be Microsoft.
Weatherston said he's been urging Microsoft to be more public with its plans for the village.
""In the absence of the truth people make up their own story,"" Weatherston said.
Dale Kooyenga, president and CED of Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, said this development is “part of a Microsoft integrated strategy across the region.”
“It’s not a stand-alone project. This has been given tremendous throught,” Kooyenga said adding the amount of water Microsoft is planning to use is not as large as some in the community think.
Environmental and labor groups have urged Microsoft to be transparent with its projects in Wisconsin. Kooyenga said it can be difficult for companies to be completely transparent as plans evolve.
“There is no industry that’s moving as fast and as dynamically as the data center industry and powering AI,” Kooyenga said. “You always have to manage this delicate balance between transparency and between good information.”

Last week, LinkedIn announced an update to its Terms of Service in order to cover expanded use of user data for its AI tools, as well as an expansion of the member data that it shares with Microsoft for Microsoft’s own ad targeting and promotions.
Essentially, LinkedIn will now share your profile and activity data with Microsoft, in order to enable Microsoft to better target its own promotions based on the same.
And LinkedIn will now also be better enabled to utilize the opposite as well.
LinkedIn’s added a related explainer in its overview of how businesses can use third party data to target ads on LinkedIn which explains how LinkedIn advertisers will now also be able to reach users based on data insights from Microsoft.
As per LinkedIn:
“Outside of the Designated Countries, the U.K., and California, LinkedIn also receives data from its affiliate, Microsoft, about activity on their and their advertisers’ sites and apps, including through use of technology similar to the LinkedIn Insight Tag. LinkedIn can use this information to improve its ability to reach an advertiser’s target audience as well as to improve ad performance and provide aggregate reports about advertising campaign performance to advertisers.”
So basically, LinkedIn is now integrating more data from Microsoft, via Microsoft’s own performance and data tracking measures, in order to provide expanded targeting options and insight for your campaigns.
Which could be valuable. Microsoft has its own Universal Event Tag (UET) for ad performance tracking, which records what customers do on various websites, and shares that information back to Microsoft. That enables Microsoft to track conversion activity and other behavioral data, which LinkedIn will seemingly now be able to incorporate into its own ad offering.
Microsoft also has additional ad engagement and data tracking measures that will feed more data into LinkedIn, which could facilitate expanded opportunities for your campaigns.
It’s more data, and more data is always better, and it may end up being a helpful addition in your process.",357,trafilatura,,False

Two of the biggest winners were Nvidia, which supplies the data center GPUs for processing those complex AI tasks, and Microsoft, which owns a big stake in ChatGPT's creator OpenAI.
Other stocks that were driven higher by the AI boom include Oracle, which supports those AI services with its cloud infrastructure platform; Broadcom, which supplies infrastructure chips for AI-oriented data centers; and Meta Platforms, which uses AI to craft better targeted ads across its social media apps.
All of those blue chip tech stocks are still reliable long-term investments. But if you want some balanced exposure to the AI market without buying individual stocks, you should consider investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is broadly diversified across dozens of top names.
The top AI-oriented ETF is the Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AIQ 1.19%), which was launched on May 11, 2018. It's risen 225% since its inception and outperformed the S&P 500's 144% gain and the Nasdaq's 205% gain. Should you still invest in this leading ETF today?
What does AIQ actually own?
AIQ holds 88 stocks across a wide range of industries. Its top five holdings -- which together account for 17.5% of its portfolio -- include Alibaba, Alphabet, Tesla, Oracle, and Broadcom. The IT sector accounts for 70.6% of its holdings, and 69.1% of its stocks are based in the United States.
By industry, AIQ allocates 37.6% of its portfolio to software and services stocks, 20.5% to semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks, and 12.5% to technology and hardware equipment stocks. But it splits the remaining 29.4% between industries that aren't as closely associated with the AI industry -- including the consumer discretionary, automotive, transportation, commercial services, financial services, and healthcare equipment industries.
AIQ says it invests ""without regard for sector or geography"" because the AI market ""spans multiple segments"" and the ""most innovative companies"" include ""both household names and newcomers."" AIQ has $5.26 billion in assets, and it charges a total expense ratio of 0.68%. That's slightly higher than the median expense ratio of 0.56% for actively managed ETFs. As of this writing, AIQ's shares are only trading a few cents above its net asset value (NAV) of $48.74 per share. It also trades at a reasonable 25.5 times its trailing earnings, compared to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq's price-to-earnings ratios of 30.8 and 32.9, respectively.
But there's a simpler ETF play on the AI market
AIQ consistently beats the market, it's well diversified, and it doesn't look expensive. But it has also underperformed another popular ETF, the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 0.67%), ever since its inception. QQQ, which tracks the narrower (and higher-growth) Nasdaq-100 index, has rallied 252% since AIQ's first day on the market.
QQQ's top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Broadcom. All of those stocks have plenty of exposure to the AI market, and it doesn't own a lot of AIQ's slower-growth AI-adjacent stocks. QQQ is also passively managed -- since it simply tracks the Nasdaq-100 -- and charges a lower expense ratio of 0.2%.
Is it the right time to invest in AIQ?
AIQ is a stable ETF that could stay ahead of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, but it's over-diversified in sectors that are only slightly related to the AI market. It might attract a lot more attention than other ETFs because it's branded as an AI ETF, but buying QQQ -- which gives you plenty of exposure to the top AI names -- seems like the smarter move.",602,trafilatura,,False

That's a net worth of $100 billion. The rising value of Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%) stock in the late 1990s ballooned his wealth well beyond that of anyone else in the world. In fact, it would be another 18 years until another tech company founder joined Gates in the club.
Today, though, Gates isn't worth much more than he was in 1999 despite the fact that Microsoft's market value climbed almost eightfold from its April 1999 level. That's because he's given much of his wealth away to the Gates Foundation, a nonprofit that supports public health, gender equality, economic development, and education around the world. He plans to contribute practically all of his remaining wealth to the foundation before it winds down operations in 2045.
Funding the efforts and research that go into supporting those causes is a trust with a portfolio of publicly traded equities worth about $48 billion as of this writing. And more than two-thirds of that portfolio is invested in just three remarkable stocks.
1. Microsoft (28% of assets)
The primary way Gates funds the foundation is with donations of his shares of Microsoft, the company he founded 50 years ago. In 2022, he donated $5 billion on top of a $15 billion pledge made in 2021. As of the end of June, the foundation's trust fund held 26,191,207 shares of Microsoft stock, according to its Form 13F filing with the SEC. That's worth about $13.4 billion as of this writing.
While the Gates Foundation sold some shares of Microsoft to fund its grants, that position remains the trust's largest holding. That's in part due to the strong performance of the stock over the last few years.
Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of artificial intelligence spending in recent years. Its cloud computing segment, Azure, is now a $75 billion business, and it grew 39% year over year in the company's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter. That growth should continue, as management notes it remains supply constrained.
Indeed, Microsoft sports a massive backlog of remaining performance obligations for its cloud business. While that figure includes its cloud-based enterprise software solution, Microsoft 365, growing demand from AI developers for computational power has been the segment's key growth driver. But the enterprise software business remains a key component of the business, too, providing huge amounts of cash flow and stable demand, and supporting Microsoft's massive investments in new data centers. The company plans to spend a record $30 billion in capital expenditures this quarter alone.
Microsoft currently sports a forward P/E ratio of 33. That's a premium price, to be sure, but its consistent growth and position among AI stocks make it well worth that premium.
2. Berkshire Hathaway (25%)
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.06%) (BRK.B 0.18%) has been a longtime holding of the Gates Foundation trust fund due to many years of contributions from CEO Warren Buffett. Buffett, a longtime friend of Gates, donates a sizable number of shares to the foundation each year, but those donations come with the stipulation that it disburses an amount equal to the value of his donations plus 5% of its existing assets. Buffett has decided to discontinue his annual donation upon his death.
With plans to spend $200 billion over the next 20 years, the Gates Foundation should have no problem meeting Buffett's requirements. Even with the requirements in place, the trust has built up a sizable position in the stock. It held 24,123,684 shares as of the end of June, a stake worth $11.8 billion today.
Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have declined in value since May, when Buffett announced that he's retiring as CEO effective Jan. 1. It seems that investors aren't willing to pay as much of a premium for the stock if Buffett's no longer going to be in charge of the investment decisions at the conglomerate.
But Berkshire's operating results have been strong. Its operating earnings came in above expectations last quarter, and were even stronger if you discount the impact of foreign exchange rates. However, the combination of growing operating cash flows, interest income, and the reduction of some positions in the portfolio has left a massive stockpile of cash on Berkshire's balance sheet as Buffett and his team wait for good opportunities to invest that money.
Berkshire now trades at a price-to-book ratio of just under 1.6. Buffett last had the company repurchase its own shares when the ratio was closer to 1.5, so investors may want to wait for the stock to come down to that level before picking up shares.
3. Waste Management (15%)
Waste Management (WM 0.66%) has been a longtime buy-and-hold investment for the Gates Foundation trust, which rarely sells the company's shares. In fact, the only quarterly decline in the trust's WM share count came last summer, when it sold a small portion of its holding. It still owns 32,234,344 shares, worth a total of about $7 billion as of this writing.
Waste Management is emblematic of an investing style Gates picked up in part from Buffett and that he has directed his investment team to follow: it's a boring business with a wide competitive moat.
Regulatory hurdles make it practically impossible to open new landfills in many parts of the U.S., which makes the more than 250 landfills that Waste Management already owns and operates extremely valuable assets that aren't likely to face fresh competition. Meanwhile, Waste Management's scale allows it to optimize route density to maximize revenue and minimize operating expenses.
That's reflected in its EBITDA margin, which came in at 29.9% last quarter, despite headwinds from its newly acquired medical waste business. While the new business segment contributed significant operating revenue, it's a drag on its profit margins. Still, strong organic growth enabled it to maintain a similar margin profile to the same period a year ago, resulting in overall EBITDA growth of 19%.
Shares of Waste Management trade today at an enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiple of about 15, based on forward estimates. That's a fair price to pay for a company that's producing strong organic growth and strategically acquiring new businesses exhibiting good synergies with its excess cash flow. It has been a long-term winner for Gates, and it could be a great boring business for average investors to own as well.",1057,trafilatura,,False

Google and PayPal partner in preparation for agentic commerce
Google and PayPal want to “help advance the intelligent agent revolution” by making the next generation of digital commerce more accessible to a broad swath of consumers.
The two companies announced Wednesday that they had entered a multi-year partnership focused on upgrading consumers’ transaction experience for evolving AI systems. One of the goals of the partnership is to solidify the necessary cogs for future agentic commerce by leveraging PayPal’s data capturing, identity verification and payment solutions and using Google’s AI savviness. While the two companies have a vested interest in pushing agentic commerce forward, they also highlighted the need for reliable, safe transactions, particularly with AI’s involvement. The partnership announcement comes just one day after Google unveiled its Agent Payments Protocol, which is intended to foster trustworthy transactions led by agents.
Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said the partnership will have far-reaching implications for the technology and e-commerce industries, if executed as planned.
“In this emerging world of agentic commerce, trust and innovation are key,” Chriss said in a statement. “Together with Google, we are leading the way for digital commerce, ensuring greater opportunities for merchants and users worldwide. We are bringing PayPal’s products and services to billions of Google users and redefining what’s possible at global scale.”
The move comes a few months after major payment providers Visa and Mastercard announced that they had teamed up with some of the world’s largest AI companies to enable agentic commerce securely and without sacrificing consumers’ sensitive information.
While the work stemming from those partnerships has not yet come to life at scale, the hope is that linking payment systems with existing AI shopping applications can allow for a truly autonomous experience that would see assistants purchasing items on consumers’ behalf based on a specific inquiry.
Uber Freight upgrades TMS with AI
Uber Freight announced at Deliver 2025, its annual conference, that it had upgraded the AI capabilities available on its platform in an effort to make logistics simpler and more efficient.
Uber Freight’s transportation management system (TMS) has been leveraging AI for some time, but this week, Uber announced that clients can now use the platform to track and handle the order-to-cash journey of shipments in full. That means that, where operators may previously have needed separate, disconnected systems, they can now leverage a single platform that helps them decision quicker and identify issues sooner.
Uber said the platform gives operators “greater control of freight spend and more accurate forecasting across the network.” The company’s hope is that clients use the TMS for real-time information, rather than treating it as a source for completed transactions and freight runs.
In addition to its spend upgrades, Uber has added more features to its procurement platform. The company said it can now automate the data-gathering and modeling behind bid awards. Rather than having a human spend days or weeks finding the information, requesting quotes and evaluating the options against one another, Uber Freight’s platform can generate a real-time comparison of costs, carriers, available services and more. What’s more, the system can project financial and performance metrics ahead of an operator choosing a specific carrier or plan.
The logistics player hopers that, in doing so, it can help clients cut costs and make faster decisions relying on data.
Steve Barber, vice president of product at Uber Freight, said it has already been leveraging agentic AI in its operations with customers, and noted that it expects to provide tangible improvements with these new capabilities.
“From procurement to payment, shippers face constant complexity across the freight lifecycle. Through continued investment in platform innovation, Uber Freight delivers the tools, automations and integrations that simplify the work and unlock meaningful outcomes such as faster decisions, smarter cost control, and more resilient supply chains,” Barber said in a statement.
Seattle-based startup secures pre-seed for in-store feedback
Seattle’s Ethosphere announced Tuesday that it has raised a $2.5 million pre-seed round. Point72 Ventures led the round, with additional participation from AI2 Incubator, Carya Ventures, Pack VC, Hike Ventures and J4 Ventures.
Ethosphere uses microphones to anonymously and securely capture real conversations between in-store retail associates and customers. It then parses through the key parts of the conversation, generates a transcript and passes feedback to both the employee and their manager.
Evan Smith, CEO and co-founder of Ethosphere, said the technology brings a unique use case for AI into companies’ stores and creates a proactive learning opportunity for employees as they go through their normal days.
For instance, Ethosphere might tell a manager that a particular associate is excellent at greeting and interacting with customers, but often shares incorrect product information about a newly stocked product line. The system may then recommend that the manager review the descriptions with that employee to ensure future accuracy.
“AI is bringing change to every industry, and retail is no exception, but there is a significant gap in how the technology can be applied in a useful, human-focused manner,” Smith said in a statement. “Ethosphere wants to bridge that gap by empowering retailers to invest in their people, recognizing that a well-supported and knowledgeable team is the key to building exceptional customer experiences. This human-centric approach not only enhances brick-and-mortar purchasing but also directly impacts a company’s bottom line by fostering loyalty and driving sales. We’re partnering with major brands to achieve this goal.”
The startup plans to use the funding to scale up the pilots it has already started with undisclosed “major retail brands.” Its site also shows that it’s hiring a senior software engineer, who would “lead a squad of two to four engineers” and build various systems to support the continued development of Ethosphere.
Ralph Lauren introduces Microsoft and OpenAI-powered shopping assistant
Ralph Lauren announced last week it had introduced a new, conversational AI chatbot it calls Ask Ralph.
Ask Ralph can handle consumer styling questions and provide recommendations on matching existing items, finding the right outfit for an occasion and more. For instance, a consumer might tell the chatbot that they need to attend an important business meeting and would like to purchase an outfit that matches their favorite navy blue blazer. For the brand, the idea is that consumers can work with the chatbot “just as they would with a stylist in a Ralph Lauren store.”
David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, said allowing consumers to have richer e-commerce experiences will allow the brand to foster an even deeper connection with its shoppers.
“Whether getting ready for a first day of a new job, or creating the perfect look for a night out, Ask Ralph is about more than just discovery—it is about engaging consumers with what they love most about Ralph Lauren: our iconic, unique take on style, providing timeless head-to-toe looks that inspire them to step into our world,” Lauren said in a statement.
Ask Ralph is available only in Ralph Lauren’s app for U.S. users. The brand partnered with Microsoft to leverage its Azure OpenAI platform to enable the technology.
Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president of global industry solutions at Microsoft, said the partnership felt like a natural step for the brand and the technology provider, especially in a moment where consumers are changing their shopping and discovery habits.
“AI is transforming the way consumers get inspired, educated and purchase from fashion brands around the world,” Bransten said in a statement. “We’re proud to bring the combination of our trusted generative AI capabilities through Azure OpenAI together with Ralph Lauren’s iconic brand to pave the way for an entirely new conversational commerce experience.”
Inspectorio introduces intelligence layer Paramo
Supply chain intelligence firm Inspectorio announced Thursday it is introducing Paramo, which it calls “an AI-native ‘intelligence layer’ that is embedded across Inspectorio‘s entire supply chain platform.
Today, some AI solutions are deployed in pieces—for instance, a company might have one provider’s technology running to streamline inventory management and another platform leveraging different data to aid with insights on risks impacting their shipments. Because those two systems are not integrated with one another—that is to say, they don’t leverage the same data sources and don’t have the same baseline for external information—they cannot effectively interact one another, nor can they make parallel recommendations informed by context from the other.
But Inspectorio wants to change that with Paramo. The company said it has built a unified system that uses structured data from retailers and suppliers, with the intention of creating a single source of truth that underlays the recommendations an AI model provides to a user. That system then employs copilots and agentic AI to handle myriad tasks inside an organization. Inspectorio said it has trained the copilots to handle risk detection, document scanning and more. The agents, meanwhile, are meant to independently handle tasks that streamline brands and retailers’ sourcing, compliance and traceability strategies. If the system is deployed as designed, it could help the technology provider’s clients lower their technology and sourcing spends, upgrade compliance protocols and expedite sourcing.
Chirag Patel, CEO at Inspectorio, said supply chain management needs to be able to evolve effectively alongside technology.
“As retailers and brands navigate an increasingly complex supplier landscape, high-quality data and production chain visibility fuels more trustworthy outputs and decision making,” Patel said in a statement. “Organizations must evolve their operations by increasing agility and automation, and Paramo enables brands and retailers to transform this disruption into stability and growth. Embedded operational intelligence is the only way to future-proof operations. Paramo sets the industry standard for the future of supply chain management.”",1627,trafilatura,,False

The additional financial commitment brings its total investment in the US state to more than $7bn.
It follows the ongoing construction of a separate data centre at the same location, which has a budget exceeding $3bn. It is scheduled for completion in early 2026.
The construction of its first Mount Pleasant facility, dubbed Fairwater, will host “hundreds of thousands of the world’s most powerful Nvidia GPUs, operating in seamless clusters connected by enough fibre to wrap the planet four times over”, said vice-chair and president Brad Smith.
Microsoft stated that the processors will support training for frontier AI models and aim to deliver performance above current supercomputing systems.
The second site will be similar in size and scale to Fairwater, the company said.

By GlobalDataMicrosoft has partnered with Gateway Technical College to launch Wisconsin’s first Datacenter Academy, with a plan to train more than 1,000 students over five years for data centre roles.
Smith said that, together with more than 40 partners, including the United Way, the University of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Technical College System, it has supported AI training for 114,000 people statewide, including 1,400 in Racine County.
Microsoft noted that it has sponsored and helped open a manufacturing-focused AI Co-Innovation Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with partners including WEDC, Gateway Technical College and TitletownTech.
It added that the lab has supported 23 companies such as Regal Rexnord, Renaissant and BW Converting, including companies based in Racine County such as Wiscon Products.
The company said it has expanded broadband access to more than 9,300 rural residents and delivered next-generation service to 1,200 homes and businesses in Sturtevant.
It added that local companies will be able to collaborate with its engineers on AI projects and that students can pursue training for roles in operations and IT through regional programmes.

The world's biggest public company Nvidia announced on Thursday that it would invest £2 billion (€2.3bn) in UK artificial intelligence start-ups.
The pledge comes as a number of other tech firms are also making promises to funnel capital into the country, notably during US President Donald Trump’s trip to the UK. The announcements have turned the nation into the centre of the AI world this week.
During Trump's state visit, the UK has secured a series of investments amounting to £150bn (€172.2bn) spread out across the UK's technology, finance and energy sectors, creating more than 7,600 jobs, according to the government.
Private equity group Blackstone pledged to spend £100bn (€114.8bn) over 10 years, and Microsoft made a £22bn (€25.25bn) commitment.
Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has been in Britain, too, attending events with the US president along with other Silicon Valley bigwigs.
Among the new initiatives announced, Nvidia has pledged to invest £11bn (€12.6bn) to help build UK AI factories by the end of 2026, with partners including CoreWeave, Microsoft and Nscale. It is also seeking to boost quantum computing in the UK.
The further £2bn the company has just pledged to spend in the country will go towards supporting the start-up ecosystem.
""The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the UK to compete in the AI market globally,"" Nvidia said.
The company also noted that scaling AI companies is currently difficult in the country due to ""limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital (VC) outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs,"" it said.

It includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Meta Platforms, Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%), and Nvidia.
There is an argument for investing in each of these corporations. All are leaders in their respective fields, generally deliver excellent financial results, and are led by impressive CEOs. But which one is the best option right now?
Going by average Wall Street price targets (according to Yahoo! Finance), the answer is Microsoft. The tech company price target implies an upside of 20.1% from its current levels, higher than that of its peers in the trillion-dollar club, as of this writing. Whether Microsoft is a better pick than these other companies, though, the stock looks attractive. Here's why.
The artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind
Microsoft has been firing on all cylinders, as its cloud division, Azure, is taking off. This segment has been the company's top growth driver for some time, but its momentum has accelerated thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). Based on current trends, investors can anticipate continued growth driven by cloud and AI for Microsoft in the foreseeable future. Here are three reasons why.
First, demand for AI-related services continues to surge. That's partly what's powering not just Microsoft, but several other tech leaders as well.
Second, Microsoft's cloud division has been gaining on the leader in the field, Amazon. Microsoft's established relationship with companies that use its computer operating systems and productivity tools is likely playing a role here. Microsoft also grants users access to OpenAI's large language model through Azure. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is still seen as a (perhaps the) industry standard, something that is likely pulling at least some companies toward Azure versus competing providers.
Third, in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2025, Microsoft topped $100 billion in commercial bookings for the first time in its history, with the metric increasing 37% year over year. It ended its fiscal year with a contracted backlog of $368 billion, even higher than its trailing-12-month revenue of $281.7 billion.
Microsoft's financial results during its latest period were excellent. Revenue jumped 18% year over year to $76.4 billion. Azure revenue was up 39% year over year. Operating and net income increased 23% and 24%, respectively.
Expect the tech giant to maintain that momentum -- or something close to it -- through the next 12 months at least.
Think long term
Will Microsoft match Wall Street's price target in the next year? In my view, there is a good chance that it can. However, even if it doesn't, the stock appears incredibly attractive to investors focused on the long term.
Although the company's AI and cloud businesses are booming, this is likely still the early stages of these industries' growth stories. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pointed out last year that 85% of IT spending still happens on-premises.
In other words, cloud computing hasn't taken over yet -- not even close. Microsoft is about as well-positioned as any company to benefit from this long-term tailwind.
Besides the fact that it is already a leader and is proving it can thrive despite stiff competition, Microsoft's cloud services come with high switching costs, granting it a strong competitive advantage. So, the future is bright for the company. And that's before looking at its dividend.
Also, Microsoft is one of the top dividend payers among the trillion-dollar companies. It has increased payouts by 130.6% in the past decade. Although its forward yield of 0.7% is unimpressive, the company's strong underlying business and ability to generate significant amounts of free cash flow more than compensate for that.
Lastly, Microsoft still looks reasonably valued. The company's 33 forward price-to-earnings ratio isn't significantly higher than the 29.2 average for the information technology sector.
The stock certainly deserves a premium. And at current levels, there should be plenty of upsides for Microsoft, especially for investors who hold on to the company's shares for a long time.",658,trafilatura,,False

We're still in the early innings of this exciting technology, but most companies agree that 2030 will be a turning point in this space. However, waiting until 2030 to start investing in this field after the winners are established is a mistake. Many of these companies will likely have dramatically increased in value by then, causing investors to lose out on massive returns.
By investing today, it's possible to pick some of the winners in this space before they've become too large to provide substantial returns. I've identified four options that appear to be excellent investments in quantum computing, ranging from startups to established big tech players. By staying balanced in this opportunity, investors can capitalize on the trend while ensuring positive returns.
Pure plays: IonQ and D-Wave Quantum
The stocks that most investors consider in reference to the quantum computing arms race are pure-play investments, such as IonQ (IONQ -3.56%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS -0.42%). These companies are startups that have no other goal besides developing commercially viable quantum computing technologies, and their upside could be immense if they achieve their goals.
IonQ and D-Wave only have market caps of $16.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. This makes them relatively small companies in general, although they could grow to be monsters if their technology becomes widespread.
The primary reason I prefer these two over many of the other quantum computing pure plays is their approach to quantum computing. The most popular quantum computing technique is superconducting, which involves cooling a particle to near absolute zero to utilize its quantum mechanics to perform calculations. This is an incredibly cost-intensive process, and may be cost-prohibitive in deploying quantum computing at scale, especially in the early years.
IonQ doesn't use this approach; its quantum computing technology is known as trapped ion. This provides several key advantages, namely cost (because it doesn't require cooling a particle to absolute zero, it can be done at room temperature) and accuracy. IonQ holds world records in quantum computing accuracy and with the largest concern surrounding quantum computing being how accurate it is, I think IonQ's technology could be a popular pick.
D-Wave isn't taking the same approach as many companies. Instead of creating a general-purpose quantum computer, it's developing a quantum annealing platform. This approach cannot be applied to every quantum computing application, but it excels at optimization problems, which can be solved by finding the lowest energy state in a system. D-Wave's technology will be useful in determining logistics networks and statistical models, which represent a large chunk of quantum computing use cases. D-Wave doesn't have to capture the entire market; it just needs to secure enough business to make it viable.
Both of these two stocks are high-risk, high-reward investments, and balancing them out with more established players is a smart idea.
Legacy tech companies: Microsoft and Alphabet
Both Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%) and Alphabet (GOOG -0.30%) (GOOGL -0.15%) are developing quantum computing technologies in-house for their cloud computing divisions. Currently, Alphabet and Microsoft are paying a substantial premium to their current primary computing hardware supplier, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). If they can develop a viable quantum computing option for these platforms in-house and not have to purchase them from a third party like IonQ or D-Wave, they will save a ton of money and become more profitable.
This makes quantum computing a highly lucrative field to invest in, and both companies have already announced significant breakthroughs in the realm of quantum computing. Furthermore, these two companies have nearly unlimited resources to deploy compared to IonQ and D-Wave, and it may become too cost-intensive for them to compete against Microsoft and Alphabet in the long run.
However, David versus Goliath stories exist for a reason, and IonQ and D-Wave may ultimately prevail against their larger competitors, but there's no way to know that right now.
By purchasing all four of these stocks, investors are taking a balanced approach to the quantum computing investment trend. This gives them the upside of pure plays like IonQ and D-Wave, while also investing in established players like Microsoft and Alphabet, which continue to benefit from the ongoing AI arms race. I believe this cohort has a great chance to outperform the market, and if IonQ or D-Wave achieves significant success, this group could crush the broader market.",733,trafilatura,,False

With the technology looking to be a game-changer that could reshape the world we are living in, it is a place you want to be invested.
Let's look at three top AI stocks to buy right now.
1. Nvidia
No company has captured the AI infrastructure wave like Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%). Its graphics processing units (GPUs) went from powering video games to becoming the must-have hardware for training AI models, and it hasn't let go of that lead.
The company built a deep moat with CUDA, as most code for optimizing GPUs was written using its proprietary software platform. Switching off CUDA would mean rewriting code and retraining engineers, which is why Nvidia controls over 90% of the AI GPU market.
Nvidia also smartly moved early into networking. Its NVLink technology lets its GPUs work together as a single system, which is critical for running AI workloads. Its acquisition of Mellanox, meanwhile, gave Nvidia a major presence in data center networking. Last quarter, its networking revenue nearly doubled to $7.3 billion.
Nvidia sees the AI infrastructure market growing to be between $3 trillion to $4 trillion in the next several years from around $600 billion today. With AI infrastructure spending still booming, Nvidia looks well-positioned to continue to be one of AI's biggest winners.
2. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL -0.15%) (GOOG -0.30%) has quickly turned what was seen as a threat into a growth driver. A year ago, many investors thought AI would cannibalize Google Search, but search revenue growth has actually picked up. Features like AI Overviews, Lens, and Circle to Search are driving more queries, and many of those have commercial intent, which feed into Alphabet's massive ad network. The recent federal court decision letting Alphabet keep not only Android and Chrome, but also the key parts of its Apple search deal intact, was another big win, preserving its distribution advantage.
AI is also giving Alphabet's cloud computing business a boost. Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% last quarter and profits more than doubled, with demand for AI infrastructure leading the way. Alphabet is one of the few players with a fully integrated AI stack. It not only owns the infrastructure, but it also has one of the top AI models in Gemini and its own custom AI chips. The company's impending acquisition of fast-growing cloud computing security company Wiz only further fortifies its cloud offering.
In addition to search and cloud computing, Alphabet has other bets that could pay off in the future. At the top of this list is its Waymo robotaxi business, which is expanding quickly around the country. The company needs to lower the costs of its vehicles and gain scale, but this is another big potential long-term growth driver. The company is also investing in quantum computing, having made strong progress in reducing error rates with its Willow chip. Quantum computing is years away from being commercialized, but it could be another big opportunity.
Between its strong, growing core business and the potential of its emerging bets, Alphabet is a stock to own for the long haul.
3. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%) moved quickly to make AI a core part of its strategy, starting with its big investment in OpenAI. That deal gave it early access to OpenAI's most advanced large language models (LLMs) and allowed it to roll out AI assistant copilots across its productivity suite. Those copilots are now gaining traction with enterprise customers.
The even bigger driver has been with its cloud business, as customers have flocked to Azure to gain access to OpenAI's models. This growth was still going strong last quarter, with Azure revenue jumping 39%. Revenue could have been even higher if not for capacity constraints. Microsoft is ramping up capital spending to add GPUs and servers directly tied to AI workloads, which should support continued growth.
Microsoft and OpenAI recently announced that they have come to an agreement to change their relationship to allow OpenAI to restructure into a for-profit company. While terms were not disclosed, it should allow Microsoft to gain preferred access to OpenAI's technology and share in its revenue growth.
Microsoft was firing on all cylinders last quarter, with strong growth across its segments, driven by AI. Given its leadership in workforce productivity tools and cloud computing, the stock looks like it will be a long-term AI winner.",741,trafilatura,,False

Its customer base includes the three largest cloud service providers: Amazon (AMZN 1.01%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG -0.30%) (GOOGL -0.15%).
However, Nvidia's reach isn't limited to the biggest of the big. It also works closely with many rising stars. CoreWeave (CRWV 3.70%) is arguably the most prominent example, especially considering that Nvidia has a multibillion-dollar stake in the AI-focused hyperscaler.
It stands to reason that Nvidia wants all these partners to succeed. But did the GPU giant just help Amazon, Microsoft, and Google at CoreWeave's expense?
Nvidia's retreat
Nvidia launched DGX Cloud in 2023. The company billed the new platform as a way for enterprises to get immediate access to Nvidia's AI supercomputers so they could train generative AI and other advanced AI models.
But Nvidia appears to be retreating from this market. The Information, a website that focuses on technology industry news, recently reported that Nvidia is primarily using DGX Cloud for internal use now instead of marketing the platform to customers.
Is there other evidence that supports the view that Nvidia is shifting its strategy? Maybe. In the past, Nvidia highlighted its DGX Cloud services when discussing cloud spending commitments in its quarterly 10-Q filings. In the company's update for the second quarter of 2025, though, DGX Cloud wasn't mentioned in this context.
Instead of marketing the DGX Cloud platform to customers, Nvidia appears to be focusing now on its Lepton GPU rental marketplace. CEO Jensen Huang explained in the May 2025 announcement of Lepton that the new service ""connects our network of global GPU cloud providers with AI developers.""
Helping the ""big three,"" hurting CoreWeave?
Some industry observers saw DGX Cloud as a move for Nvidia to compete against the major cloud service providers. But Nvidia rented GPUs from CoreWeave to use with DGX Cloud. Could the company's reported move to back away from marketing DGX Cloud help Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud while hurting CoreWeave? The short answer is ""no.""
For one thing, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud host DGX Cloud. Although AWS didn't, there's no solid proof that Nvidia's cloud platform hurt its business.
A retreat from DGX Cloud wouldn't hurt CoreWeave, either. CoreWeave recently disclosed that Nvidia will purchase $6.3 billion of its unused cloud computing capacity through April 13, 2032.
Perhaps most importantly, though, Nvidia might not be retreating from DGX Cloud as reported by The Information after all. According to Data Center Dynamics, Alexis Bjorlin, who is Nvidia's vice president and general manager for DGX Cloud, said, ""DGX Cloud is fully utilized and oversubscribed, and we are expanding its scale.""
Winners all around
Whatever Nvidia's strategy with DGX Cloud is, I don't think CoreWeave has anything to worry about. My view is that all of these stocks -- Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and CoreWeave -- are poised to be big winners over the long run.
The AI boom doesn't appear to be slowing down. That's great news for Nvidia because more of its GPUs will be needed. It's great news for Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and CoreWeave because their cloud platforms will continue to enjoy tremendous demand.
It's possible that the momentum could even accelerate. I think Nvidia's technological advances will play a key role, if so. For example, the company plans to launch Rubin CPX, a new class of GPUs built for massive-context inference, in late 2026. This new technology could pave the way for an explosion in the use of AI in software development and long-form video creation.
As the smallest of the group, CoreWeave might have the most room to run. However, I expect all five of these top AI stocks will deliver tremendous gains over the next 10 years and beyond.",636,trafilatura,,False

- Microsoft plans to spend $4 billion to build a second data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin.
- The new facility will be part of a distributed training supercomputer for Microsoft's artificial intelligence services.
- This brings Microsoft's total spending in the Racine County complex to approximately $7.3 billion.
- Environmental groups have raised concerns and filed a lawsuit over the data centers' electricity and water usage.
Microsoft plans to spend $4 billion to build a second data center in Mount Pleasant that it says will be the most advanced AI center in the world.
The new project includes construction of the facility and technology infrastructure, according to a company announcement on Sept. 18.
The latest announcement brings the cost of Microsoft's Racine County developments to about $7.3 billion, including the $3.3 billion commitment the company made in 2024.
At the time of the initial Microsoft announcement in May 2024, which included a visit from President Joe Biden, the Journal Sentinel reported that the company's Racine County spending could easily exceed $10 billion, given the huge parcel of land it controls there.
Much of the work is taking place on land previously acquired by the Foxconn Technology Group for a high-tech manufacturing complex that was touted by state and federal officials, including President Donald Trump, as transformational for the state's economy.
While the Foxconn project failed to live up to its original promises, the infrastructure work to bring utilities to the area helped Microsoft choose the property for this development.
The second Microsoft data center is planning to house part of what the company calls a distributed training super computer. Microsoft said the facility will be the most advanced AI data center in the world.
Brad Smith, Microsoft president and vice chair, said when the first data center opens, the facility plans to house hundreds of thousands of the world’s most powerful NVIDIA graphic processing units which will be critical for the company's AI development and one of the most unique pieces of technology in the world.
“The data center that you’ve seen rising up in Mount Pleasant goes live early next year and it will house what is literally, the most powerful super computer on planet Earth,” Smith told an audience at Festival Hall in Racine. “In fact that building will have the super computer that is 10 times more powerful than any super computer anywhere in the world.”
The company plans to build the second largest ""chiller,"" which is used to cool the technology used in the facility, in the world. The largest chiller is in Qatar, Smith said.
But beyond the constrution and operation of the facility, Smith said the company is helping create a ""data center academy"" at Gateway Technical College and its partnerships with University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Titletown Tech will be critical to training workers and partnering with area small businesses.
Microsoft says the Racine County data center would be the first of several facilities, located in multiple states, in the company's latest initiative to compete with other technology companies like Facebook's parent company Meta on artificial intelligence.
Construction of first Racine County data center nearly done
Microsoft is finishing construction on its first Racine County data center, which is to be completed in early 2026. The company says it will hire more than 400 employees to work at the first data center and once the second data center is open, the total number of employees plans to be nearly 800 for both facilities.
Construction for the second data center plans to be finished by the end of 2028. Thousands of construction jobs are planned to be related to the completion of the data center, the company said.
Gov. Tony Evers said the Microsoft investment is “making Wisconsin home of the most powerful data center in the world.”
“We’ve seen the benefits for Wisconsin workers with tens of thousands of construction workers and skilled labors participating in this project,” Evers said. “This project is creating good family sustaining union jobs across the entire region from carpenters, plumbers and electricians.""
Evers said innovation is part of the state's tradition and the new AI frontier has been used in different areas like advanced manufacturing, biohealth and personalized medicine.
“That puts Wisconsin on the very cutting edge of AI power, not just in the United States, but across the world,” Evers said. ""Thanks to Microsoft's partnerships, the new Innovation Lab at UW-Milwaukee hundreds of small and lean-in-size business owners are learning how to use AI.""
Microsoft development watched closely by environmental groups
Data centers require massive amounts of electricity and water. Those demands have stirred international concerns, and Wisconsin environmental groups have raised questions about plans from Microsoft and other companies in the Badger State.
On Sept. 15, Midwest Environmental Advocates, on behalf of Milwaukee Riverkeepers, filed a lawsuit against the city of Racine, which provides water to Mount Pleasant, for documents related to the Microsoft development.
On Sept. 16, the city of Racine released a document showing that the first Microsoft data center would use 234,000 gallons of Lake Michigan water per day and discharge back into Lake Michigan 81,000 gallons per day in 2026.
The document also stated the rest of the expansion could use up to 2,814,000 gallons of water per year with wastewater discharge of 2,031,000.
Smith says Microsoft plans to minimize water use
Smith addressed the water concerns saying, ""Lake Michigan has nothing to fear from our data center"" and added the company has built data centers in places like Phoenix, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
""We build data centers in the desert, that's because we've figured out how to run them without using a lot of water,"" Smith said adding the company has developed at ""closed-loop cooling system.""
The chiller plans to take hot water through a series of pipes, stretching more than 60 miles, and use giant fans, which are 20 feet in diameter, to cool the hot water and then is piped back into the facility.
Smith said more than 90% of the facility is going to rely on the system that's circulated continously and the remaining portion will use outside air for cooling and switching to water on days when it's above 85 degrees.
Smith said the data center has enough fiber cable to circle the Earth four times, and also have a modest annual water use requiring roughly the amount of water a typical restaurant uses annually or ""what an 18-hole golf course consumes weekly in peak summer.""
Separate from the lawsuit, Clean Wisconsin conducted an analysis of the power used by data centers in Mount Pleasant and Port Washington stating the facilities could use more electricity than all the houses in Wisconsin.
The first data center uses about 450 megawatts. Microsoft and We Energies have proposed a special rate specific for data centers to minimize impact on local residents.
Smith said Microsoft is ""pre-paying for the energy and electrical infrastructure that we’ll use—ensuring prices remain stable and protecting consumers from future cost increases because of our data center.""
""We will match every kilowatt hour we consume that comes from a fossil fuel source one for one with carbon-free energy we put back onto the grid,"" Smith said. ""This includes a new 250 (megawatt) solar project in Portage County that is under construction to support this commitment. And our partnership with WE Energies ensures we will continually explore and add energy transmission, generation, and usage—under transparent tariffs that support grid reliability.""

The AI neocloud company announced a huge deal with tech giant Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%), and its shares soared nearly 50% the next day.
That was great news for Nebius shareholders, but investors who hadn't gotten involved beforehand might wonder if, after that monster move, it's too late to jump into the stock. I think not, because there's one compelling reason to believe that there are more gains to come.
Building data center capacity to meet demand
Nebius provides advanced cloud computing services designed for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. That a hyperscale cloud provider like Microsoft would desire Nebius' data center AI infrastructure capacity should be eye-opening for investors. The deal is worth up to $19.4 billion, which is more than Nebius' total market cap was at the time of the announcement. It shows how much demand there is for the AI infrastructure Nebius provides.
With demand so far outpacing supply, Nebius Group should be announcing more deals like this. Proof of that demand is the reason investors should look into buying Nebius shares. Just this week, it was revealed that Nvidia has placed a $6.3 billion order with cloud AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave.
That came on the heels of news that tech giant Oracle expects its cloud infrastructure revenue to soar eightfold over the next four years. Oracle also said it signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in its most recent fiscal quarter.
That type of activity and spending should continue. And it's the reason that Nebius stock still looks attractive even after its recent move higher.",277,trafilatura,,False

The three stocks that I've listed here have tremendous long-term growth prospects, offer great dividends, and have been increasing their payouts for years.
These are the types of stocks that are good buys even without factoring in their dividend payments, and that's what makes them no-brainer investments for the long haul.
Walmart (WMT -0.47%), Eli Lilly (LLY 0.72%), and Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%) may not be the highest-yielding stocks around or appear to be the most exciting options for dividend investors, but they have the potential to be amazing dividend growth stocks in the future.
1. Walmart
Walmart is a top retail stock to own, but its dividend may not be all that exciting as it yields just 0.9%. That's below the S&P 500 average of 1.2%, which already isn't all that high to begin with. But shares of Walmart have skyrocketed more than 120% over the past five years. If not for such an impressive rally, the stock would be yielding far more than it is.
That's not a bad problem for income investors to have. The company has been growing its dividend generously, the stock has simply been incredibly hot. As the share price rises, the yield declines. It's a much better position to be in than a high yield due to a crashing share price.
Earlier this year, the big-box chain announced it was raising its dividend by a generous rate of 13%. It's the 52nd year in a row that this Dividend King (stocks that have increased their dividends for over 50 years) has boosted its payout, and underscores just how underrated of a dividend stock it is. Many dividend growth stocks make just small incremental increases to their payouts for the sake of keeping their streaks going. Walmart, however, has rewarded its shareholders with a sizable, double-digit increase.
The company is in a sweet spot where it can attract both low and high-income shoppers, with the latter making more trips to their local Walmart recently in an effort to save amid inflation and rising costs. Walmart's business has proven to be resilient over the years and with strong grocery operations and opportunities in e-commerce and advertising, this is a business that still has plenty of growth potential in the long run.
2. Eli Lilly
Another stock that's doing so well its yield is low is drugmaker Eli Lilly. The company's business has been thriving due to the success of its popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro (diabetes) and Zepbound (weight loss), which are raking in billions for the business.
Eli Lilly's yield looks paltry at just 0.8% and its massive gains of around 400% in five years help explain why its payout also doesn't look all that high. And if you think Walmart's recent dividend increase was impressive, consider that Eli Lilly announced a 15% increase to its payout last December. And that was the seventh straight year it has boosted its dividend by such a generous amount.
The mammoth growth the healthcare company is experiencing makes it a compelling option for both growth and dividend investors alike. Even despite such significant increases to the dividend, the stock's payout ratio is less than 40%.
Eli Lilly has generated more than $53 billion in sales over the past 12 months and it was only a few years ago when its annual revenue was less than $30 billion. This is a growth beast that's worth buying and holding for the long haul.
3. Microsoft
The lowest-yielding stock on this list belongs to tech giant Microsoft. At less than 0.7%, this is another seemingly unimpressive dividend stock that is better than it looks. Like the other growth stocks on this list, it has performed exceptionally well in the past five years, rising by around 150% over that stretch.
The tech giant has been increasing its dividend since the early 2000s and it has more than doubled its payout within the past decade. And with so much growth on the horizon due to artificial intelligence (AI) and the business already being flush with cash, I believe Microsoft will raise its dividend at high rate for years to come.
Over the trailing 12 months, Microsoft has generated an incredible $71.6 billion in free cash flow and its dividend payments during that stretch have totaled just $24.1 billion. It may not be a terribly popular dividend growth stock to own today, but over time and as its dividend continues to increase, that's likely to change.",758,trafilatura,,False

The stock popped in response to a highly ambitious five-year roadmap to grow Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) from around $10 billion in annual revenue to a staggering $144 billion.
If Oracle achieves this goal, OCI will surpass the current size of the leading three cloud giants by revenue -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.
On Thursday, a 6.2% decline in Oracle, paired with a 6% jump in Tesla, led to Ellison slipping $1 billion below Elon Musk on the billionaire leaderboard, according to Bloomberg. Regardless, Ellison is now in a virtual tie with Musk as the richest person in the world because of his massive stake in Oracle.
Here's why Ellison's ownership of Oracle is great news for long-term investors, and whether the growth stock is a buy now.
The billionaire throughline
A common theme among the world's richest people is that the primary source of their wealth is existing ownership in one company. With the exception of the three Walton children, who inherited large stakes in Walmart, the other nine people on the list of the 10 richest billionaires all played pivotal roles in growing a business, and still hold meaningful positions in those businesses.

Ellison is unique because he owns such a massive amount of Oracle, whereas other founders have decreased positions in their businesses over time. So even though Oracle isn't worth as much as other ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, or Nvidia, Ellison's massive stake can put a charge in his net worth when Oracle soars.
From a legacy stalwart to a cutting-edge AI play
Founder-led companies can be especially effective in the ever-changing technology sector. Ellison's large ownership stake and role as CTO make him heavily involved in Oracle's strategic direction.
Oracle has completely transformed its business model from a large database infrastructure and enterprise software model to a cloud computing giant. To pull it off, Oracle has had to invest a ton of capital, and fast, as the cloud computing race is highly competitive. Its capital expenditures (capex) have exploded higher -- outpacing revenue and earnings growth. So Oracle has taken on a considerable amount of debt to foot the bill.
Oracle is spending so much so quickly that its capex is now higher than its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Most of its capex is going toward building data centers. It's worth noting that capex doesn't even factor into Oracle's operating expenses with its existing businesses. This illustrates the extent of Oracle's leverage.
Oracle's spending is sky high and adds a considerable amount of risk to Oracle's investment thesis. With so much skin in the game, Ellison clearly saw this move as the right one for the long-term growth of the company. Ellison co-founded the company nearly 50 years ago in the late 1970s. So in this vein, Ellison's position is like Bill Gates still being a part of the top brass at Microsoft and having a massive stake in the company.
Oracle still has room to run
Ellison isn't calling all the shots at Oracle, but his large stake gives the company a level of credibility and a vote of confidence for individual investors interested in buying or holding the stock. If Ellison is putting his chips on the table and taking this big bet on cloud, then he must really believe it's the right long-term move, even if it takes a sledgehammer to Oracle's balance sheet and cash flow in the near term.
Wall Street was around. Oracle has nearly doubled in the last year and is up over 300% in the last three years. Investors often prefer capital-light, high-margin business models like those of Nvidia and Apple. Both companies design their products and outsource manufacturing, leading to high margins. But in Oracle's case, its capital-intensive strategy is a strength, as it is at the cutting edge of the future of hyper-efficient cloud computing.
Oracle isn't cheap by any means, but the stock could still be a good long-term investment for risk-tolerant investors seeking innovative companies where founders still have substantial financial incentives to make growth investments pay off.",856,trafilatura,,False

UBS analyst Paul Gong said Nio’s “latest products could further attract consumers after the US$1bn equity offerings strengthened visibility on its healthy operations.”
Nio’s jump by over 8% on Tuesday propelled the stock to its highest level since last October. The company has also benefitted from optimism around its new model.
Microsoft’s investment, the largest ever made by the company in the UK, will fund an expansion of Britain’s AI infrastructure, which Labour sees as a key part of its efforts to secure economic growth, and the construction of the country’s largest AI supercomputer.
Brad Smith, vice chairman and president of the firm, said it had “many conversations” with the UK government, including No 10, “every month”, adding that the investment would have been “inconceivable because of the regulatory climate” in previous years.
“You don’t spend £22bn unless you have confidence in where the country, the government and the market are all going,” he said. “And this reflects that level of confidence.”
Microsoft is backing tech firm Nscale to contribute towards developing a major data centre in the UK, which the company said would help build out Britain’s cloud and AI infrastructure.
Asked how much electricity capacity would be required for the build-out and how this would be supplied, Smith said: “We already have the contracts in place for the power that will be needed for the investments that we’re announcing here.”
Officials said the investment enabled by the tech partnership could speed up development of new medicines and see collaboration on research in areas such as space exploration and defence.
Chinese tech giant Baidu saw its Hong Kong shares surge by almost 16% on Wednesday as analysts upgraded its in-house chip venture. Its US-listed shares are up 8% in pre-market trading.
The jump – the biggest in over two years – came as equity research firmArete Research Services lifted its rating on Baidu’s American depositary receipts to 'Buy' from 'Sell', based on a positive outlook for its AI chip and cloud-computing revenue.
Baidu has been aggressively trying to grow its AI-related chip and computing business, which supports its popular large language model and AI chatbot, called Ernie Bot.
According to researchers from Arete, Baidu’s growing chip venture has the potential to more than offset the impact from the company’s struggling online advertising business.
According to a report from The Information, Baidu is currently trialling its Kunlun P800 chip, designed to train advanced iterations of its Ernie AI models. This initiative comes as Beijing is keen to have its technology firms not be so dependant on the US for components, amid Washington's tightening of export restrictions on high-end AI chips.
On Wednesday, the FT reported that China’s internet regulator has banned the country’s biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips.
Shares in Rivian were just below the flatline in pre-market trading after the EV maker started building a long-delayed electric car in Georgia, as investors remain cautions amid a challenging US market.
The California-based company started work on a $5bn facility in Georgia despite US president Donald Trump's push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. From October, US buyers will no longer quality for savings of up to $7,500 per car.
Rivian chief policy officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they are superior.
“We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. “And we’re going to prove that we’re going to be successful in the future.”
The stock rose 5% on Tuesday on the back of the announcement, but was back in the red as the money-losing company struggles with weak sales, particularly of its R1T pickup.
Shares in Barratt Redrow climbed in London after the housebuilder reported a rise in profits but warned about tax hike fears disrupting the property market.
The housebuilder said it sees “limited growth” for the year ahead amid a challenging property market and buyer worries over tax hikes in the upcoming budget.
It expects to complete between 17,200 and 17,800 homes in 2025-26, but forward orders are slightly lower, at 10,350 as of August 24, compared with 10,398 a year ago.
It came as the firm – Britain’s biggest housebuilder – reported underlying pre-tax profits rising 26.8% to £488.3 million in the 53 weeks to June 29.
It said house completions came in lower than it had forecast, at 16,565 over the year, against a target of between 16,800 and 17,200.
The group, which bought rival Redrow in a £2.5bn deal last October, said the budget scheduled fot 26 November has added “additional risk” to the outlook.
David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said the “housing market remains challenging and we anticipate limited growth in 2025-26”.
He said the long-term outlook was “compelling”, but flagged homebuyer caution.
Thomas said the firm’s forecast assumes a normal autumn selling season, but warned the “extended period through to the budget … and related uncertainties around general taxation and that applicable to housing, has introduced additional risk”.

In the same spirit, you might peek to see what some of the richest investors have been buying -- and that's far less problematic. It's natural, in fact, to wonder where the supposed smart money is going.
Here, then, are some relatively recent purchases made by some billionaires. I found them by checking their most recent 13F filings, which reveal purchases and sales.
1. Warren Buffett
Let's start with the most well-known of this bunch, Warren Buffett, who's famous for, among other things, growing the value of his company, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.06%) (BRK.B 0.18%), by an annual average of around 20% for a whopping 60 years. In recent times, Berkshire's investment decisions have occasionally come from his investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler, and Todd Combs.
As I write this, the latest 13F for Berkshire Hathaway reveals that the two biggest purchases in the quarter ending June 30 were UnitedHealth Group (UNH 2.13%) and Nucor (NUE 1.56%).
UnitedHealth has seen its shares drop in the wake of multiple Department of Justice investigations and misconduct allegations (yikes!) -- not to mention the assassination of its CEO last year. Buffett is known for capitalizing on opportunities, and he or his lieutenants clearly viewed the market reaction as overreaction. Indeed, UnitedHealth has been offering promising news lately, including meeting its Medicare Advantage plan enrollment targets.
Nucor, meanwhile, is a low-cost steelmaker, and a really big one at that. It's also been strategically savvy, as when it started producing building parts for data centers. Steel is a cyclical business, trending up and down depending on the economy, and Nucor is recently at a low point, offering a nice entry point for long-term believers.
Both UnitedHealth and Nucor offer dividends, too -- recently yielding 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively.
2. Bill Ackman
Then there's hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, of Pershing Square Capital Management. In the same quarter, his biggest purchases by value were Amazon (AMZN 1.01%) and Google parent Alphabet. It's not hard to see why anyone might invest in either of those. (It's worth noting that Ackman is famous for running a concentrated stock portfolio, with only 12 holdings in his fund, which was valued at $13.7 billion in late June.)
Amazon has multiple irons in the fire, most notably its massive marketplace and its dominant Amazon Web Services (AWS). Despite its huge size, recently valued at $2.5 trillion, it's still growing at a respectable clip, posting second-quarter results that featured net sales up 13% year over year.
CEO Andy Jassy noted: ""Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out as we've expanded Alexa+ to millions of customers, continue to see our shopping agent used by many millions of customers, launched AI models like DeepFleet that optimize productivity paths for our 1M+ robots, ... and released Bedrock AgentCore to enable [AI] agents to be operated securely and scalably.""
Speaking of AI, Ackman recently had 45% of his portfolio in three AI stocks, and Alphabet is one of them. Alphabet's Google search is an 800-lb. gorilla, but many had wondered if AI would threaten its dominance. Instead, the company has been using AI as a tailwind, with search revenue growth actually accelerating recently.
3. Stanley Druckenmiller
Less well-known, Stanley Druckenmiller heads the Duquesne Family Office, which was valued at $4.1 billion mid-year. The fund's top purchases by value in the second quarter were Entegris (ENTG 1.58%) and Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%).
Microsoft's growth potential is clear, as it encompasses the widely used Office productivity software, its Azure cloud computing platform, the popular Xbox gaming platform, and the Windows operating system, among other assets. It's another massive tech company that's somehow still growing rapidly, with its fourth-quarter revenue up 18% year over year and net income up 24%. It's another heavy investor in AI.
Entegris is less well known, but it's a critical support company for the semiconductor industry, offering ""purification solutions and advanced materials."" Druckenmiller is investing in a ""pick-and-shovel"" manner with this stock, as it's an adjunct to the fast-growing chip industry, with its offering critical for chip makers.
These are just some of the investments that some financial bigshots made recently. If you search for 13F filings now and then, you'll find plenty more. Of course, always do your own digging into any portfolio candidate before buying.",746,trafilatura,,False

- Bitcoin financial services firm Fold revealed details for its upcoming BTC rewards credit card.
- The card will be issued on the Visa network in a team-up with Stripe.
- Fold's stock is down more than 14% on the day after opening strong.
Bitcoin financial services company Fold Holdings announced Tuesday that its previously delayed BTC rewards credit card will run on the Visa network thanks to a team-up with financial infrastructure firm Stripe. But while Fold’s stock (Nasdaq: FLD) started off hot on the day, it quickly plunged.
The Fold Bitcoin Credit Card will let users accumulate Bitcoin through everyday spending, offering up to 3.5% back on all purchases with no spending categories or deposit requirements, the company said.
Users earn an unlimited 2% back instantly, plus up to 1.5% additional when paying through their Fold Checking Account. Enhanced rewards of up to 10% are available with major partners, including Amazon, Target, Home Depot, Uber, Starbucks, and hundreds of other brands.
FLD opened at a price of $4.69 on Tuesday after closing at $3.88 on Monday. However, the buzz didn’t last, with the price plunging to $3.32 as of this writing, marking a more than 14% dip on the day.
“Our credit card offers clear and compelling value and makes Bitcoin easily accessible to everyone,” said Fold founder, Chairman, and CEO Will Reeves, in a statement. “There are no categories to manage, no tokens to stake, no exchange account or balance requirements; just real Bitcoin, earned automatically with every purchase.”
No timeline has been announced for the Fold credit card’s release.
Stripe said that it has already processed over $3.1 billion in transaction volume and distributed more than $83 million in Bitcoin rewards. The company also holds 1,485 BTC in its treasury, worth about $167 million at present.
Fold’s stock surged on Friday, roughly doubling in price and peaking above $7 per share amid speculation that veteran crypto industry investor Mike Alfred was joining the company.
Instead, another publicly traded crypto company, Bakkt, announced Alfred’s appointment to its advisory board on Monday, prompting its own stock spike. Bakkt is up nearly another 18% so far on Tuesday, rising to $17.31 as of this writing.
The price of FLD fell on Monday following the Bakkt appointment announcement, and has continued to fall on Tuesday. Even so, FLD remains up about 8% over the last week, though it’s down about 12% on the month.
Bitcoin itself is roughly flat on the day at a current price of $112,774, but has fallen about 3% on the week.
Myriad Markets users have recently turned bearish on the top cryptocurrency's chances of rising to $125,000—which would be a new all-time high mark—sooner than it can fall to $105,000.
As of this writing, 53% of predictors expect it to hit the lower mark sooner than the higher price. That mark has grown substantially over the last week, rising from about 38% on September 16.

Amazon does not always get to win. That is twice now over recent years that the Seattle behemoth thought it could roll over the incumbents in London - but got it wrong.
News that all 19 Amazon Fresh stores are to shut down – all but one are based in London – does not come as a huge surprise. In The Standard’s local branch on Moorgate shoppers rarely outnumbered staff, while the food hall in a neighbouring Marks & Spencer was often rammed.
This admission of defeat comes seven years after Amazon closed its restaurant delivery service. That lasted just two years but never made significant inroads into a sector already dominated by Deliveroo and Uber Eats.
There was simply no space for Amazon and very little affection for its rather soulless “Just Walk Out” payment system
Tesco, Sainsbury, Marks and the Co-op have also carpet bombed London with hundreds of convenience stores.
More recently the arrival of Aldi and Lidl and their rapid roll-out in London has just made the grocery landscape in the capital even more intensely competitive.
There was simply no space for Amazon and to be frank very little affection for its rather soulless “Just Walk Out” automatic payment system.
It may only be the most fleeting of human contacts but it seems the British public get more out of a couple of minutes of interaction at a till than many people assumed.
My observation, walking past the Amazon Fresh store on a daily basis, was there was almost an aversion to going into a grocery shop named after a tech brand where some shoppers, including myself, were confused about how to pay.
It is no reflection on the food on offer. On my one visit, the sandwich I bought was perfectly adequate. So why did I never go back?

Companies that operate AI infrastructure like Amazon and Alphabet are racing to build new data centers that are powered by renewable energy. The main challenge isn't in building new data centers, but in scaling up the required amount of renewable energy.
This is where hydrogen fuel comes into play. Hydrogen fuel has long been a promising power source for the renewable economy. But high costs have prevented the technology from being adopted at mass scale. The massive buildout of infrastructure to enable the AI revolution could change all of that. Does that make Plug Power stock a buy? You might be surprised by the answer.
Artificial intelligence is creating a huge surge in power demand
The world's energy systems are about to be transformed thanks to a huge surge in demand for AI technologies, a surge that is expected to be sustained for decades to come. Energy use by data centers -- critical infrastructure that is largely powering the AI revolution -- has historically grown by 12% or more annually. The sharp uptake in AI demand more recently should see that growth rate rise even higher.
Not only will we see a sharp increase in power demand, but the type of power that will be demanded is expected to change. That's because many technology companies have internal mandates that require high levels of renewable energy. The existing grid isn't transitioning to renewable energy fast enough, causing some companies to build out their own energy supplies. Google, for example, is funding the development of three new nuclear sites in the United States to maintain its position as a carbon neutral business.
According to data from the International Energy Agency, electricity demand from data centers will more than quadruple by 2030. The organization believes that this transition has the ""potential to transform how the energy sector works."" In other words, expect major shifts in how energy is created, stored, and used in the future. This will include a massive build-out in renewable energy, but also a shift toward private energy generation versus simply tapping into the grid. Companies like Google will create energy generation facilities designed mostly for its own use.
Plug Power has already recognized the opportunity to supply the AI industry with localized, renewable energy. Companies may build out their own hydrogen solutions, but grid operators can also turn to hydrogen in order to compensate for highly variable demand. The company said in a blog post:
As AI demand grows, power grids are struggling to keep up. Hydrogen steps in to help when the grid is under pressure. Hydrogen production systems can quickly adjust how much energy they make based on real-time needs. This helps reduce power costs and prevent blackouts.""
For years, the primary issue with hydrogen adoption has been cost competitiveness. But much of hydrogen's high costs come from a lack of scale. Tech giants armed with big budgets could change all of that. After all, nuclear power in the U.S. was long deemed ""dead"" due to the related exorbitant costs. The rise of AI could finally tip the scales for the world's hydrogen buildout.
Is Plug Power stock a buy due to rising demand for AI?
Expect big things when it comes to hydrogen's potential to power the AI revolution. Does that make Plug Power stock a buy? Surprisingly, no.
The challenge with Plug Power stock today isn't necessarily the viability of hydrogen power -- though there are still legitimate questions related to that issue as well. Instead, at least from an investor's perspective, the problem is the company's mounting losses.
In recent years, Plug Power has been posting net losses of around $200 million to $300 million per quarter. That's more than 10% of the company's entire market cap every 90 days. To compensate, the company has turned to government loans and share dilution. Over the past three years, for example, the company's total share count has nearly doubled.
While the AI revolution shows promise for hydrogen power over the long term, heavy share dilution means that Plug Power shareholders today will see their gains diluted heavily, possibly leading to minimal or even negative gains over the long haul. Additionally, there are concerns that Plug Power's technology -- which focuses on proton exchange membrane fuel cells over more efficient and adaptable solid oxide fuel cells -- isn't even the best fit for AI applications. So while hydrogen has the potential to power part of the AI revolution, Plug Power stock in particular still isn't a buy for wise investors.",772,trafilatura,,False

In general, the average investor shouldn't take investing moves by a billionaire and a trillion-dollar corporation as the gospel because the goals and risk tolerance aren't always aligned. However, getting inspiration from Buffett and Berkshire has proven to be a good choice for many investors.
If you have $1,000 available to invest, the following two Berkshire stocks are great choices for long-term investors.
1. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN 1.01%) isn't one of Berkshire's largest holdings (less than 1% of its portfolio), but it's one of the most thorough companies in its portfolio. Although Amazon became a household name because of its e-commerce business, it has grown into a full-blown conglomerate covering many different industries.
E-commerce continues to be Amazon's biggest moneymaker, accounting for close to 60% of its revenue in the second quarter, but its largest growth engine is undoubtedly its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was only 18% of its Q2 revenue, but it's the bulk of its profits.
Amazon's revenue growth has been slower than that of other big tech competitors like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in recent quarters, but its profits (looking at operating income) have been growing impressively. In Amazon's case, it helps to focus on its profit growth instead of revenue growth because its high-margin businesses like AWS and advertising are driving a lot of its earnings growth. These segments are also on the earlier ends of what they can grow to be.
AWS is still the leading cloud provider, but Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud have been gaining ground. That said, the cloud computing industry is expected to grow to the point where AWS can organically benefit as the industry's largest player. I suspect it'll be the top player in the industry for quite a while.
As far as advertising, artificial intelligence (AI) and Amazon's growing web of businesses are unlocking new ways to monetize Amazon's technology. It has Amazon Prime, Twitch, Amazon Music, and, beginning this year, NBA broadcasting. Combined, these platforms give Amazon premium advertising opportunities across shopping, streaming, gaming, and live sports.
Amazon is a business that I feel comfortable holding on to for the long term because it's diversifying its business and solidifying itself as a major part of many different industries. That's a recipe for long-term success.
2. Visa
Visa (V 0.24%) is the largest payment processor in the world by a large margin, giving it a competitive moat that's built to last for quite some time. That's one of the characteristics Buffett is known for wanting before investing in any business.
Visa is accepted by over 150 million merchants worldwide, and in the 12 months leading up to March 31, it processed close to 316 billion transactions totaling around $16.1 trillion. Needless to say, Visa is an important part of the global financial ecosystem.
One of the best parts of Visa's business is that it's able to operate with extremely high margins because once the initial infrastructure is put in place, it can reap the benefit of increased transactions without needing to spend extra money or take on more overhead. Its profit margins are routinely the highest in the business and one of the highest you'll see from a company in most industries.
Visa has routinely outpaced the S&P 500, especially over the past decade. It has averaged close to 17% annual returns in that span, compared to the S&P 500's 12.7% average. We can't predict if it will continue outpacing the S&P 500, but it has plenty of growth opportunities ahead of it that suggest it has a real chance at doing so.
On a broad level, Visa should be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the growth in digital payments. Many places in the world are becoming less cash-dependent and embracing card transactions (both physical and contactless). This bodes well for Visa, whose business model revolves around taking a percentage of each transaction that occurs on its network.
Given that it is the most widely held and accepted card worldwide, potential cardholders and merchants have an incentive to choose Visa. That's a large part of why I also feel comfortable holding on to Visa's stock for the long haul. It has solidified itself as a business that's too important to the global financial world to go away.",750,trafilatura,,False
company,1758442500,2 Top AI Growth Stocks to Buy in September,136836424,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AMZN,Yahoo,These stocks offer attractive growth prospects at a reasonable price.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=14cf73b690444fa1603ed3c00123fbccfd5c414dd7db9b155b55e96f5ae876cf,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,200.0,"Tech giants continue to announce more capital investment in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Demand remains strong from large enterprises looking to gain better insights from their data using AI-powered services in the cloud.
Two companies that are benefiting from these trends are Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) (GOOGL -0.15%) and Amazon (AMZN 1.01%). These companies are in a strong competitive position to bring AI innovation to consumers and enterprises, and better yet, their stocks are reasonably valued relative to their earnings potential.
1. Alphabet
Shares of Alphabet have surged in 2025 as investors begin to recognize Google as an AI juggernaut. Google's Gemini AI model powers intelligent features across all the company's services, including Search, Google Cloud, and other apps. With 2 billion people using services like Google Search and Gmail every day, that makes Google one of the top consumer brands profiting from AI.
Google Search is having a strong year, all thanks to AI. Search revenue grew 12% year over year in Q2. New features like AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving more search frequency and new use cases for Search that is fueling more advertising revenue.
On the enterprise side, Google Cloud is seeing tremendous demand for AI services. Businesses are migrating their data to leading cloud platforms to access AI-powered analytics and application-building tools. This drove an impressive 32% year-over-year increase in cloud revenue last quarter, while the segment's operating profit more than doubled.
AI is also bringing internal improvements to Google's operations, such as automating more than 30% of its code. This frees up time for Google's engineers to work on new ideas that can speed up its product development. This has the potential to accelerate its growth over the next decade, which isn't reflected in the stock's valuation.
Management plans to spend $85 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, up from the previous estimate of $75 billion. This is to meet the growing demand for cloud and other services, signaling that Google's future growth is undervalued.
Even after the recent climb, the stock still trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23 based on 2026 estimates. This is attractive for an AI-first company that should deliver double-digit annualized earnings growth over the long term.
2. Amazon
Amazon is another tech juggernaut that would make a solid addition to any investor's portfolio right now. Its financial results have been solid this year, with improving sales and profitability in its largest business, e-commerce. But Amazon is also the leading cloud services provider, which is raking in billions in annualized revenue for enterprise AI services.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) generates $116 billion in annualized revenue. This represents 18% of the company's total revenue, but produces most of the company's profit. While AWS is facing greater competitive pressure from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, it continues to sign major deals with global brands. Last quarter, AWS signed new agreements with PepsiCo, Peloton, and Warner Bros. Discovery, among others.
Demand for AI is so great it is stretching AWS' computing capacity. Specifically, generative AI solutions are experiencing triple-digit year-over-year growth. This means as Amazon invests in bringing more compute capacity online, AWS revenue could accelerate in 2026.
AI is also benefiting Amazon's e-commerce operations through more intelligent delivery routing, inventory placement, and faster order processing, with more than 1 million robots at its warehouses. This shows a valuable synergy taking shape where AI improves the efficiency of the e-commerce business, while higher revenues from e-commerce help fund more investment in research and development for AI innovation in cloud services.
In many ways, Amazon has become an AI-first business, making it a solid choice for investors looking for a relatively safe business to invest in AI for the long haul.
The stock is trading at a forward P/E of 30 times, using next year's earnings estimate. This is reasonable for a business that just posted a year-over-year earnings increase of 33%, partly driven by AI-driven cost efficiencies in e-commerce. Analysts expect the company to deliver 17% annualized earnings growth, which could double the stock by 2030.",676,trafilatura,,False
company,1758409500,Hertz Stock Pops Following News of Amazon Deal. Time to Buy?,136836426,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AMZN,Yahoo,It's an unexpected team-up between the auto rental veteran and the retailing powerhouse.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=35ed78aa2c1e127444ff20494464f0406a1e188ab744a27f8d0891e96ffd1e23,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/hertz-stock-pops-following-news-of-amazon-deal-tim/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/hertz-stock-pops-following-news-of-amazon-deal-tim/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/hertz-stock-pops-following-news-of-amazon-deal-tim/,200.0,"In the popular imagination, Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ 2.24%)isn't an ideal, or even appropriate, choice of business partner for Amazon (AMZN 1.01%).
After all, the former company is an auto rental incumbent of longstanding, and the latter is a monster retailer. Yet the two businesses announced a collaboration in mid-August, and investors liked what they heard about the deal. Here's a look at why, and whether it makes Hertz stock a buy now.
Surprisingly, also a seller
Hertz is a retailer through its Hertz Car Sales unit, although of course it's almost entirely identified as a rental agency.
So it might have been surprising to read Hertz's announcement that it is going to be a seller on Amazon Autos. Customers purchasing a Hertz used vehicle will be able to pick it up at one of the 45 Hertz Car Sales outlets in this country. At first, this service will be offered in Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston and Dallas as a pilot program. If successful, it'll expand nationwide.
Judging by the market's reaction to the news, investors are thinking the deal will surely be beneficial to Hertz.
Known unknowns
It's highly uncertain by how much, however. The company provided almost no details of the Amazon Autos deal, and that includes financial particulars like estimated revenue. That isn't all that surprising because the rental king is awfully mum about the performance of Hertz Car Sales. In fact, the division gets merely two mentions in the company's 22-page second quarter of 2025 earnings report.
In that document, Hertz only says that Hertz Car Sales' volume was the highest in all of the second quarters stretching back five years. No further information is provided.
Hertz probably doesn't break out the unit's fundamentals because they (likely) aren't impressive. Given that, I don't think the Amazon deal will be any kind of game changer, and I wouldn't trade the stock purely on the news. If it gets Hertz to be more transparent about its retail efforts, however, at least that will be a small victory for shareholders.",341,trafilatura,,False
company,1758395700,Prediction: These 2 Warren Buffett Stocks Could Beat the Market in the Next Decade,136830040,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AMZN,Yahoo,These stocks have strong track records of success and offer investors who initiate positions today plenty more to look forward to.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0d7e27c91b07528e2267665a4aaccfe98baa7305a5012baf58bf363eb6707fb0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-warren-buffett-stocks-could-bea/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-warren-buffett-stocks-could-bea/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-warren-buffett-stocks-could-bea/,200.0,"Warren Buffett will step down from his role as the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. Although his legendary decade-long tenure is coming to an end, investors can still learn a great deal by studying the man's investing philosophy and examining the conglomerate's famous portfolio, which contains many excellent buy-and-hold options.
Two of the top picks among Berkshire Hathaway's 41 holdings are Amazon (AMZN 1.01%) and Visa (V 0.24%). These market leaders have the potential to deliver superior returns over the next decade.
Here is why.
1. Amazon
Amazon is a highly profitable company with U.S. and international operations in e-commerce, grocery shopping, video and music streaming, advertising, and cloud computing. However, outside of its cloud operations, the company's business is relatively low-margin.
In the second quarter, Amazon's North America and international segments had operating margins of 7.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Here's the good news: In the next decade, e-commerce should continue expanding internationally, granting significant growth prospects to these parts of Amazon's business.
In the meantime, the company will seek to improve its margins by implementing artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across its operations. The company has deployed more than a million industrial robots in its warehouses to that end. Amazon's North America and international segments generate hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Even modest margin improvements annually over the long run could have a meaningful impact on the company's bottom line.
Then there is Amazon's fast-growing cloud unit. It is responsible for most of the company's operating and net income, thanks to its much juicier margins. With a suite of AI services whose demand continues to grow, Amazon Web Services should maintain this momentum for the foreseeable future. Lastly, some of Amazon's newer initiatives are expected to make a meaningful impact in the next decade as well.
Consider the company's Amazon Pharmacy. The U.S. prescription drug market is expected to be worth approximately $374 billion in revenue this year. Amazon boasts 180 million Prime members in the U.S. and offers a range of perks, including fast and free shipping, allowing patients to avoid the long lines at pharmacies. If the company can scale this business and the rest of its healthcare operations, it could have a meaningful impact on its results by 2035.
Even without that, though, Amazon's prospects for the next decade look highly attractive. Investors can safely add shares of the e-commerce specialist and hold onto them for a long time.
2. Visa
Visa owns one of the world's leading global payment networks. The company facilitates credit and debit card transactions, earning a fee for each. So, every time anyone swipes or taps a card branded with Visa's logo, the company pockets a percentage of the transaction amount. That's quite the business model.
To get an idea of the scale of Visa's business, consider that there are about 5 billion of its branded cards in circulation across some 200 countries, and the company supports hundreds of billions of transactions annually and trillions in total payment volume.
The result: Visa generates consistent revenue and profits, and it has for the past decade. The company also boasts a high-margin business. Visa's network infrastructure is already in place and can support its transaction volume with minimal additional cost.
The financial specialist also avoids the headaches associated with credit risk, as it does not issue the credit card itself. This also means it doesn't receive money from interest. Still, Visa's fee-based, capital-light model yields gross and net margins of around 80% and 50%, respectively, which is exceptional for a company of its size.
Although Visa has already achieved tremendous success, there is still plenty of room to grow, as the world increasingly requires digital (non-cash or check) methods of payment. Besides the fact that cash is clunky and less convenient to carry in high amounts than a credit card, the growth of e-commerce is also playing a role in this, since cash is an option in physical retail stores, but digital methods of payment are practically mandatory on e-commerce platforms.
Visa still estimates there's trillions worth of cash and check transactions to bring into its ecosystem. The company should ride that wave in the next decade and deliver excellent returns along the way.",708,trafilatura,,False

“It was the realisation that I needed to do things very differently. You're talking about a 45-minute journey to college, making new friends and understanding that the world is maybe broader than everything I've seen up to that point.”
It didn't take him long. When Tobun completed his health studies degree in 2001 he began to take a shine to business. He read newspapers, listened to the news and took in that the then-Labour government was starting to change how schools were funded.
He conceived a ‘one-stop shop service’ idea to oversee support, facility and construction services, which were previously under local authority remits. Tobun pitched the idea to The Prince's Trust for a £3,000 grant but was turned down.
However, his bus journey home from Clapham cemented a desire to succeed. “I was just going to try and that clearly was one of the greatest decisions I ever made,” he says.
Living in a crowded home, he used a £500 undergraduate overdraft to secure two months’ rent on a small office space nearby. It was a former boiler room with no windows and Tobun recalls dripping with sweat, even with the door open, as he scoured the Yellow Pages and hit the phones.
His business break came at age 22 when the female head of London's Walworth Academy asked him to tender for its support services. Tobun wore a suit for the first time and, realising he couldn’t compete with the other experienced companies in the room, focused on what he could do.
“That shifted my pitch completely because it became about, ‘You need this done in six weeks. You need people who are flexible and agile to be able to meet this'. I said I'll do whatever it takes to make sure this is delivered. This is the only opportunity I would ever get.”
Tobun won the £250,000 contract, marking the beginning of a journey into multiple sectors spanning three continents. His company, GV Group, has now grown into one of the UK's largest independent transport and logistics companies. Twenty years after Tobun entered the business world, GV Group had sales of £33m.
After brokering his first school contract, Tobun began to focus on improving last-mile delivery in London. In a pre-congestion charge era, Tobun won a deal with Westminster Council to oversee logistics and supply chain across its borough after concocting a schools partnership plan where cooked meals could be offered to all.
His portfolio expanded to Platebox, delivering school meals annually, and Foodmove, which facilitates cross-sector warehousing and deliveries. Tobun also envisaged London's streets becoming clogged with heavy lorries and the rise of delivery services.
As his businesses grew under the flagship GV Group — originally called Gate Ventures, with the first two letters of a friend Gavin and his own forename — Tobun began to look into automating his services by building a marketplace platform to help small businesses and upwards.
“It was future-proofing what tomorrow might look like, and what I've always focused on about business is what people can't see,” says Tobun.
Tobun’s latest venture is with AI-led, last-mile logistics platform Routd, which has launched in the US with a global contract from Amazon and helps delivery drivers and transport firms. The company is forecast to achieve a turnover of over £3.5m in 2025, its second full year of trading. Tobun anticipates a £15m turnover for Routd by 2028.
“I was in the US and someone asked me how I, as a UK company, came to the US and made such a success,” says Tobun. “I said it was because what happens is British people come to America and try to be American.
“I was very clear. The uniqueness is that we come from a very diverse environment. So it meant that every time I think about the profile of what a customer looks like, I think about all those people.
""And I was just very clear that we were going to be true to what we do, which is: 'how do we add value to a business?'""
Employing around 1,000 staff globally at GV Group, with half based in the UK, the fast-growing Routd has about 40 employees. “For me, the Holy Grail is always about what the future holds and creating an agile business that continues to meet those ever-changing demands,” he adds.
Next year will mark Tobun’s 25th year in business, including his early forays as a solo entrepreneur. “I've learned very quickly that people can let you down when everything is at stake,” he adds. “It took me 10 years to have ‘CEO’ on my business card, because for me it was a reminder that without people there is no Tevin.""
“It was just a constant reminder that leadership has to be leading from the front, where people understand that you are very clear on the role they play for the success of a company.”
In 2023, Tobun was inducted into the Dr Martin Luther King Board of Sponsors at Morehouse College in the US. In January he was given the Freedom of the City of London. Over two decades on from first venturing away from his south London roots, Tobun also returned last summer to Middlesex University to receive an honorary degree.
“No matter your background,” he said at the time, “I urge each and every graduate to have the audacity to believe they can rewrite their narrative and build a legacy no matter how humble their beginnings.”
CEO Says: Tevin Tobun on...
How I lead
""When you try to join our team, I always try and make people understand that it's not about being a cog in the wheel, it's being in an entrepreneurial business. I didn't learn business the traditional way. I've never applied for a job, I was never a junior or senior manager. I learned business by making mistakes. So, the very first thing is accepting that you will make mistakes and spending your energy fixing them.
Let everybody just come up with ideas, but be much more accepting that I might say something that just doesn't work, and doesn't make sense. We'll try something else. And that is really creating an environment where sometimes in meetings you'll be stunned at what people bring to the table.""",1082,playwright+trafilatura,,False

The U.S. and U.K. governments agreed Thursday to cooperate in developing the two countries' artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and nuclear energy sectors, and to spend $350 billion doing so.
$350 billion in total investment -- but how much for nuclear?
The British government says 150 billion pounds (US$195 billion) will be invested in the U.K., which it calls a ""record-breaking investment,"" leaving $155 billion for the American AI, quantum, and nuclear sectors. But how much of this money goes to Nano Nuclear?
- Britain's Urenco and America's Radiant will supply $5.3 million worth of HALEU fuel to the U.S.
- America's X-Energy will help Britain's Centrica build ""up to 12 advanced modular reactors"" worth ""at least 40 billion pounds.""
- Last Energy and DP World will build ""one of the world's first micro modular nuclear power plants"" in London.
That's all they have to say on the subject of nuclear investments -- no mention of Nano Nuclear Energy stock at all.
Is Nano Nuclear Energy stock a buy?
Fact is, the biggest beneficiary here appears to be X-Energy (and its partner Centrica). If you recall, X-Energy is a private company backed by Amazon, partnering to build several gigawatts-worth of nuclear reactors for Amazon's data centers in the Pacific Northwest.

Recent volatility has cracked open entry points in three platforms growing 13% to 27% annually, with moats that deepen as they scale.
Unlike the artificial intelligence (AI) darlings trading at 100 times sales, these businesses already generate meaningful cash while riding secular trends untouched by Fed cycles or politics. Read on to find out more about these three incredible growth stocks.
The Everything Store's second act
Amazon (AMZN 1.01%) posted $167.7 billion in 2025's second-quarter revenue, up 13% year over year, proving the $2.5-trillion giant still grows like a challenger. Its India marketplace cut losses by 89%, showing international units are finally nearing profitability. Meanwhile, Amazon's rolling out AI-powered ""Seller Assistant"" tools to help merchants optimize operations, potentially creating a high-margin software stream Wall Street hasn't priced in.
While Amazon Web Services (AWS) faces tough competition from Microsoft and Alphabet, advertising and international markets are expanding margins and diversifying growth. Trading at around 30 times forward earnings, Amazon is still growing faster than many software peers at richer multiples. The risks -- regulation and cloud deceleration -- are real, but its scale, diversification, and steady margin gains make execution the story that matters.
The metaverse that actually makes money
Roblox (RBLX -0.22%) generated $1.08 billion in Q2 2025 revenue, up 21%, while daily active users reached 111.8 million -- network effects that every metaverse ""wannabe"" envies. The platform's user-generated content model means Roblox doesn't pay for game development, though it invests heavily in infrastructure and content moderation. Revenue jumped 27% over the trailing 12 months to $4.02 billion, fueling the stock's 195% rally over the same period.
Unlike Meta's cash-burning metaverse or Epic's closed ecosystem, Roblox's virtual-goods economy generates substantial revenue even while the company invests in growth. Its expansion beyond gaming into concerts, education, and brand experiences multiplies the addressable market. Content moderation, child safety concerns, and current net losses remain legitimate risks. Still, with users creating content for each other, Roblox owns a metaverse generating real revenue growth rather than just promises.
The arms dealer to e-commerce warriors
Shopify (SHOP 2.38%) reported Q2 2025 revenue of $2.68 billion (up 31% year over year), with gross merchandise volume climbing to $87.8 billion, up from $67.2 billion a year ago. The core platform is accelerating after exiting capital-intensive logistics powered by subscriptions and merchant services that scale without heavy fulfillment costs. Unlike marketplaces that compete with sellers, Shopify is aligned with merchant success, which strengthens loyalty and reduces regulatory risk.
Free-cash-flow margin reached 16%, showing the model generates real cash even as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability remains uneven. Risks from small business pressures and broader macroconditions are real, but global e-commerce penetration is still early. AI tools for inventory, marketing, and checkout optimization make merchants more successful, driving higher transaction volumes that flow directly into Shopify's results.
The growth gauntlet
Amazon, Roblox, and Shopify illustrate what separates true compounders from fleeting fads. Each delivers double-digit annual revenue growth, business models that strengthen with scale, and cash generation instead of endless burn. Amazon anchors global digital commerce, Roblox owns the social graph of Generation Alpha, and Shopify empowers entrepreneurs at every level.
These are secular trends that will persist regardless of Fed policy or political noise. Volatility may shake near-term conviction, but companies doubling revenue every few years create wealth that value traps never can. After recent gains, these growth stocks still stand out as compelling long-term buys.",592,trafilatura,,False
company,1758281100,2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now,136818056,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AMZN,Yahoo,AI is a critical component of success for these companies.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6ed999fe570fe1186804d846d37f65ce7c4ac235be2ac6a41524b7d1ff1eb51c,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,200.0,"Investments related to artificial intelligence (AI) tend to attract considerable interest and investor returns. As this technology offers new innovations and transforms existing industries, these company's shareholders will likely reap the benefits.
Although investors may widely understand some of these available opportunities, the range of lucrative AI investments will likely extend far beyond AI stalwarts such as Nvidia and Palantir. As the technology brings more transformation, investors should prepare for these stocks to rise amid an increased AI focus.
Amazon
At this point, investors widely understand the success of Amazon (AMZN 1.01%). As a pioneer in e-commerce and cloud computing, it has evolved into a conglomerate supported by several consumer-related and tech businesses.
Still, if that leads consumers and investors to overlook it as an AI company, they are likely making a huge mistake. As the world's leading cloud infrastructure company, Amazon Web Services (AWS) plays a critical role in supporting AI-related functions for its clients.
Its generative AI application builder, chatbots, and code builders are just a few examples. Considering that AWS makes up the majority of the company's operating income, this success is crucial to its growth.
The examples are also extensive on the e-commerce side of the business. It supports shopping services and customer service functions for its customers. That underpins fast-growing enterprises within the company, such as digital advertising and third-party seller services. Additionally, AI bolsters robotics and supply chain management to improve efficiencies within its logistics network.
Even though it generated $323 billion in net sales in the first half of 2025, its 11% annual growth is slower than in past years. Still, Amazon kept cost and expense growth in check, meaning its $35 billion in net income for the period grew by 48% compared to year-ago levels.
Overall, the stock is up by about 25% over the last year, which lags the aforementioned rate of profit growth.
However, its 35 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is not far above the S&P 500 average of 31, meaning the stock sells at a significant discount compared to past years. With its profits likely to continue growing at a rapid pace, now appears to be a great time to add shares.
Upstart Holdings
Upstart Holdings (UPST 0.75%) applies AI to a business long overdue for a technical upgrade -- loan evaluation.
The Fair Isaac Corporation controls the dominant loan evaluation metric, the FICO Score. Nonetheless, the scoring system has not undergone a significant update since its introduction in 1989, leaving the industry vulnerable to competitive challenges.
Upstart continues to upgrade its technology, updating its AI-driven model and approving 92% of loan applications without human intervention. Thanks to the added factors it considers, its model can approve 101% more applicants without increasing risks to lenders, according to Upstart.
Additionally, Upstart has derived the majority of its revenue from evaluating personal loans. Still, it is gaining traction in the auto loan market, and it has begun evaluating applicants for home equity lines of credit. Those avenues should dramatically expand the company's addressable market.
Amid those initiatives, investors should expect considerable growth for Upstart over the next few years. Also, on a macro level, the Federal Reserve moved to trim interest rates, a factor that should further supercharge growth.
Indeed, growth has returned to Upstart after recent declines in loan volumes. In the first half of 2025, revenue of $471 million increased by 84% compared to the same period last year.
During that period, it limited the rise in expenses to 24%, returning the company to profitability. Though the net income for the first two quarters of 2025 is just $3.2 million, it is a vast improvement from the $119 million loss during the same time frame in 2024. Investors have noticed these improvements, and the stock is up by almost 75% over the last year.
Admittedly, the profit levels are too modest to yield an applicable P/E ratio. Still, the forward earnings multiple of 40 is arguably cheap when considering its AI-driven potential for transformation, making Upstart stock an attractive choice for investors.",672,trafilatura,,False
company,1758277500,The Rise of Amazon Ads: Who the Winners and Losers Are,136818058,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AMZN,Yahoo,Amazon's growing ad business and its partnership with Netflix could reshape connected TV advertising.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3bc505b6a646206e55e44a59fe985ed35f9029e94864c42771760d71d8c8c38d,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,200.0,"Amazon (AMZN 1.01%) has quietly built a digital advertising business that's now too big to ignore. In 2024, Amazon Ads generated more than $50 billion in revenue, making it one of the fastest-growing segments of the company.
The company's recent partnership with Netflix only underlines Amazon's growing role in the space. By selling Netflix's advertising inventory through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), Amazon has solidified its position as a must-use platform for marketers. For investors, the question is no longer whether Amazon Ads is a real contender, but which players will win and which ones will lose as its influence expands.
Winners: Amazon, premium streamers, and advertisers
The most obvious winner here is Amazon itself. The company has a combination of advantages in the digital ad space that most of its rivals can only dream of: authenticated user data, purchase intent signals, and premium inventory across retail, video, and streaming. By combining these assets inside its demand-side platform, Amazon makes it easy for advertisers to reach high-value audiences with measurable outcomes.
The Netflix deal adds even more muscle. Streaming has become the new frontier of advertising, and Netflix is the crown jewel of connected TV inventory. By bringing Netflix ads into its DSP, Amazon gives marketers access to premium content and simplifies the buying process. For advertisers, that's efficient and measurable. For Amazon, it's a flywheel: more data, more inventory, and more ad dollars staying inside its ecosystem.
Advertisers also come out ahead -- at least in the short term. With Amazon, they get better targeting and closed-loop attribution, tying impressions directly to purchases. The flip side is concentration risk: The more marketing budgets shift into Amazon, the less leverage advertisers may have down the road, echoing what's already happened with Alphabet and Meta.
Premium streamers like Netflix (and Roku) also benefit. They gain access to Amazon's massive advertiser base and infrastructure, and they don't have to build their own sales machines from scratch. This ensures they can compete with traditional broadcasters and newer entrants alike.
Losers: Independent adtech companies, smaller publishers, and other ""walled gardens""
The rise of Amazon Ads is not good news for everyone. Independent demand-side platforms, especially The Trade Desk, could face more competitive pressure. For years, The Trade Desk positioned itself as the independent alternative to Google and Meta, offering neutrality, transparency, and cross-channel reach. However, if advertisers can purchase premium streaming inventory directly through Amazon's DSP, The Trade Desk's leverage could slowly diminish.
That said, neutrality still matters. Some advertisers may resist relying too heavily on Amazon, preferring to use independent platforms that can span connected TV, retail media, and the broader open web. The Trade Desk's relationships with Disney, Roku, and other publishers give it some weight, but it's too early to say whether such relationships will be enough to preserve the company's moat.
Smaller publishers also risk losing ground. If ad dollars consolidate into Amazon, Netflix, and other large platforms, independent websites could struggle to attract marketing spending. AI-driven search further complicates this picture, reducing traffic to traditional publishers and shrinking the open web ad supply.
Even Alphabet and Meta will feel the heat. While they still dominate digital advertising, Amazon is steadily taking more share in two critical areas: retail media and streaming video. Meta's performance ads look less differentiated when brands can advertise right at the point of purchase on Amazon. Alphabet faces pressure as product searches increasingly begin on Amazon rather than Google, while its YouTube unit must contend with Netflix and other streaming platforms selling ads through Amazon's DSP.
The bigger and longer-term picture
Amazon isn't just another player in digital advertising -- it's building a vertically integrated ecosystem. From retail data to Prime Video and now Netflix, Amazon controls both the data advertisers crave and a large slice of the available ad inventory. This integration makes it one of the most powerful ad businesses in the world.
For the industry, the trend is clear: Scale and data are driving consolidation. Advertisers increasingly want major partners that can deliver both reach and measurable results. Amazon checks both boxes, and that creates structural challenges not only for independents like The Trade Desk but also for giants like Alphabet and Meta.
What does it mean for investors?
Amazon Ads is a clear long-term winner. The Netflix deal strengthens Amazon's position in connected TV, expands its already rich inventory pool, and makes its DSP more indispensable to advertisers.
For rivals like The Trade Desk, the challenge is differentiation. Its neutrality, transparency, and ability to bridge multiple channels remain valuable, but the fight for premium streaming inventory is heating up.
In other words, Amazon isn't just competing in advertising anymore. It's setting the rules of the game. It's a great time to be bullish about Amazon stock (and to an extent, major publishers like Netflix or Roku), but less so on independent platforms like The Trade Desk.",814,trafilatura,,False

Here's what investors should know about these AI stocks.
1. Amazon
Amazon has evolved from an online bookstore into a titan across three major industries: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. The company has developed artificial intelligence products and features across all three business segments, but innovations in retail and cloud services are particularly noteworthy.
Retail
Amazon has built 1,000 generative AI applications to make its retail business more efficient, including tools that optimize inventory placement, demand forecasting, and last-mile delivery. It has also built an AI model that helps robots navigate warehouses faster, and it's building an AI model that lets workers engage robots conversationally. Amazon is also testing humanoid robots for package delivery.
Cloud
Amazon Web Services (AWS) has engineered custom chips for AI training and inference that management says offer better price performance than current GPUs. It has also introduced a generative AI development platform called Bedrock, and recently added tools that assist customers in building and scaling AI agents. Further, AWS is the primary cloud provider for Anthropic, one of the fastest-growing AI start-ups.
Amazon reported second-quarter financial results that crushed estimates on the top and bottom lines. Sales increased 13% to $168 billion on particularly strong sales growth in the advertising segment, coupled with solid momentum in the retail and cloud segments. Operating margin expanded more than a percentage point, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings rose 34% to $1.68 per diluted share.
Wall Street says Amazon's earnings will grow at 10% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look expensive. But I think analysts are underestimating. Amazon beat the consensus estimate by an average of 22% over the last six quarters, and spending across its three major markets is forecast to increase between 11% annually and 20% annually through 2030. Investors should feel comfortable buying this stock today.
2. HubSpot
HubSpot introduced its marketing automation software in 2006, and the company remains a leader in that space, but its product portfolio has evolved into a full customer relationship management (CRM) platform. It features productivity tools for sales, customer service, and marketing, as well as tools for commerce, data management, and content management.
Last year, HubSpot introduced Breeze, a suite of artificial intelligence features that simplify work across its CRM platform. Breeze includes a general copilot that handles simple tasks like summarizing business data, as well as customizable AI agents built for specific tasks like creating marketing content, engaging sales leads, and answering customer questions.
HubSpot reported solid second-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Its customer count increased 18%, and the average subscription revenue per existing customer increased 1%. Revenue rose 19% to $761 million, and non-GAAP earnings rose 13% to $2.19 per diluted share. CEO Yamini Rangan said strong adoption of AI features across the CRM platform was a key contributor.
Wall Street estimates HubSpot's adjusted earnings will grow at 22% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 61 times earnings look relatively expensive. However, HubSpot consistently beat the consensus earnings estimate in the last six quarters, and I think that trend will continue as the company pursues what management sees as a $128 billion opportunity by 2029. Investors should consider buying a small position.",690,trafilatura,,False

- FedEx expects to fully onboard its large-package delivery deal with Amazon by the carrier's third quarter, which runs from December to February, EVP and Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on an earnings call Thursday.
- The arrangement announced in May had minimal impact on FedEx's first quarter, according to Carere. But once onboarding is complete, the Amazon volume ""will support continued U.S. domestic revenue growth in the quarters ahead,"" she added.
- FedEx will deliver the volume — consisting of heavier-weight parcels — as part of its Ground portfolio, Carere said at a May investor conference. She emphasized that the deal isn't on the scale of Amazon's UPS arrangement, which is shrinking as UPS prioritizes more profitable shipments.
Dive Insight:
FedEx executives touted Amazon and several other customer wins in the earnings call as the carrier looks to maintain momentum in a volatile trade environment.
For example, Carere pointed out Best Buy's recent decision to name FedEx as the retailer's primary national parcel carrier. Best Buy will tap into an ""advanced visibility tool"" from the delivery giant to provide real-time tracking and customer order communication, she said.
""By providing customers with more timely and accurate updates, the company also expects to reduce support calls, cancellations and reship costs,"" Carere said.
Beyond large-scale shippers, FedEx grew revenue tied to U.S. small- and medium-sized businesses by more than 10% YoY in Q1. Small shippers are a lucrative target for both FedEx and UPS, and FedEx is leaning on direct sales, its loyalty program and other tactics to gain an edge.
""This was fueled by focused and targeted sales execution and a close alignment between our sales and our operations teams,"" Carere said of the revenue jump. ""This collaboration is accelerating onboarding, shortening deal cycles and driving meaningful new acquisition.""
FedEx is overhauling its U.S. operations in the midst of these customer additions. The company's Network 2.0 plan aims to merge its historically separate Express and Ground networks to boost its bottom line and improve its competitive positioning.
Through that effort, FedEx is shuttering dozens of facilities to minimize operational overlap. The company has closed about 140 facilities and converted 360 stations to handle the combined volume so far, President and CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call. As progress continues, FedEx exited Q1 with 18% of its U.S. average daily volume flowing through the new Network 2.0 model.",400,trafilatura,,False

As of mid-September, the stock is up only about the mid-single digits year to date, while the S&P 500 is up roughly in the low teens. That gap has opened even as the retailer and cloud leader posted strong financial results and guided to solid growth.
Amazon, of course, is the e-commerce and cloud-infrastructure giant behind online retail, Prime, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). With the market's attention rotating across themes this year, Amazon's quieter performance masks improving fundamentals. That mismatch sets up a straightforward case: The business is strengthening while the growth stock is merely getting by, creating an opportunity for investors who want to get off the sidelines and own shares of a great company for the long haul.
Momentum is building where it matters
Amazon's latest quarter underscored durable growth and expanding profitability. In Q2, the company's net sales rose 13% to $167.7 billion and operating income climbed 31% to $19.2 billion, lifting the operating margin to 11.4%, up substantially from 9.9% in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share were $1.68, up 33% year over year. Management also pointed to a healthy outlook: Third-quarter net sales are expected to grow 10% to 13%, with operating income between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion.
Beneath the headline numbers, the three engines investors care most about are moving in the right direction. First, AWS revenue increased 17% to $30.9 billion. Operating margin in the segment was 32.9%. While that margin is lower than the prior quarter as Amazon invests in capacity and power to meet artificial intelligence (AI) demand, trailing-12-month AWS operating margin remains a robust 36.8%. Second, advertising services revenue rose 23% to $15.7 billion, showing the company's growing clout with merchants and brands. Third, the core retail network continues to scale efficiently: operating income in its important North America retail segment increased 48% to $7.5 billion, with the segment margin improving to 7.5%. Its international retail segment saw operating income jump from $0.3 billion to $1.5 billion as sales rose 16% year over year.
In his comments in the company's second-quarter earnings release, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy drew attention to AI.
""Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I'm excited for what lies ahead,"" Jassy said.
Put simply, Amazon is converting more of its enormous revenue base into profit as logistics and data center assets scale.
The investment case today
The near-term bear case boils down to two points: massive capital expenditures and competition. Capital spending remains heavy as Amazon expands data centers, networking, and power to support AI workloads; reflecting the build-out, trailing-12-month free cash flow (the cash left over after both regular operations and capital expenditures are taken care of) was $18.2 -- down from $53 billion in the year-ago period. And in cloud, Microsoft and Alphabet are formidable, well-capitalized competitors that are similarly investing aggressively in AI.
Those are real considerations, but they sit alongside strengthening unit economics in retail, a rapidly expanding ads business, and a cloud platform that is growing rapidly as Amazon pivots to AI-centric demand. Additionally, Amazon's significant investment in AI can also be seen as a reason to be upbeat. After all, the company wouldn't be spending so aggressively if it didn't believe there would be a payoff.
With shares trading in the low-$230s as of this writing, Amazon trades for roughly 35 times earnings. That is not cheap, but context matters: Operating margin for the company has marched from single digits to more than 11%, and the company could see additional operating leverage as revenue rises and as AWS becomes a larger share of overall revenue. Additionally, if AWS's already lucrative margins stabilize as new capacity comes online, and retail continues to generate mid- to high-single-digit margins at scale, earnings power may climb faster than revenue over the next few years. In that scenario, today's multiple may not look demanding.
On the other hand, a slower economy could weigh on discretionary spending, and cloud optimization could resurface. Further, power constraints or supply chain delays tied to data center buildouts could also pressure AWS's margins in the near term. Investors, therefore, should keep an eye on capex and AWS profitability as leading indicators.
But the bigger picture is constructive. Amazon is firing on several cylinders: retail margins are improving as the logistics network densifies, advertising is growing at meaningful rates, and AWS remains the backbone for thousands of enterprises. Not to mention that Amazon is layering in AI services across its business, creating new long-term growth opportunities. These dynamics -- broad-based growth, rising profitability, and aggressive investment in AI -- make a compelling case to use 2025's relative underperformance as an opportunity to buy into the stock's weakness. For investors looking to beef up a portfolio with a high-quality compounder, buying Amazon while sentiment is only lukewarm could prove to be lucrative over the long term.",830,trafilatura,,False

According to Mordor Intelligence, the global retail market is forecast to expand to $27.3 trillion this year, with an annualized growth rate topping 6% through 2030.
Despite the razor-thin margins often associated with retail sales, the rewards can be lucrative for the businesses that stand out, such as Amazon, Walmart, and Costco Wholesale (COST -0.03%).
But what makes these three retail leaders successful is their dynamic operating approach. They're constantly innovating in their own unique ways and finding new pathways to boost sales and keep customers loyal to their ecosystem of products and services. This is especially true for warehouse club Costco, which has made three sizable changes over the last year, including a brand-new perk that's dividing many of its 79.6 million paying members.
1. The first annual membership fee increases in seven years
No change has been more pronounced over the last year than Costco's decision to increase its annual membership fees.
Beginning on Sept. 1, 2024, Gold Star and Business members saw their annual membership fee rise from $60 to $65, while Executive cardholders had their yearly fee jump from $120 to $130. It's also worth noting that Executive cardholders receive 2% back on most qualifying purchases, and the annual amount back they're eligible to receive increased from $1,000 to $1,250 on Sept. 1, 2024.
This was a seemingly long overdue fee increase, with the last occurring in 2017.
While this is a relatively small price to pay for consumers to gain access to Costco's warehouses, it's a big deal for the company and Costco stock shareholders. It purposely purchases products in bulk to lower its per-unit cost and undercut mom-and-pop shops and national grocery chains on price. To ensure that it can keep its prices well below the competition on the basic need goods that draw consumers into its stores, it leans on membership fees to do the heavy lifting.
Costco's membership fees flow almost directly to its bottom line. They provide a healthy margin buffer that allows the company to offer amazing grocery deals and to buy unique items that you'll only find in its warehouses (gold bars and one-off, high-end jewelry and timepieces).
2. Required members to scan their card or QR code at store entrance
The second meaningful adjustment made to Costco's rules and policies over the last year was clamping down on non-members entering its stores.
In August 2024, Costco Wholesale announced plans to begin using scanning devices at the entrance of all of its locations, which would be implemented in the ""coming months."" Members would be required to scan their membership card or a digital QR code upon entry, and may have to show valid identification if their membership card doesn't have a photo on it.
This change was made to ensure that its aforementioned 79.6 million paying members, as of the end of the fiscal third quarter (May 11, 2025), are the one's receiving all the perks. Removing non-members from the equation helps Costco maintain its razor-thin margins on popular items, and also plays a critical role in keeping food court prices down.
In addition to having members scan their membership card upon entry, Costco removed the ability for non-members to purchase food court items, which includes the famous $1.50 hot dog combo.
3. Offered a new shopping perk to its highest tier of cardholders
But the change that's left its domestic membership base divided went into effect earlier this month.
Initially announced in June but not fully implemented until Sept. 2, Executive cardholders have exclusive early morning shopping access to Costco's U.S. warehouses seven days a week. During weekdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., only Executive members are allowed to shop in its stores. On Saturdays, this exclusive shopping window is narrowed to 30 minutes, 9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
As you can imagine, this probably doesn't sit well with U.S. Gold Star and Business cardholders -- but it serves a purpose.
According to the company, 37.6 million (47%) of its 79.6 million paying members are Executive tier. However, these 47% accounted for 73.1% of net sales during the fiscal third quarter. Pleasing this group of cardholders and ensuring their annual renewal rate is above 90% is paramount to Costco's long-term success. For what it's worth, the cumulative renewal rate for members across all tiers was a solid 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada during the fiscal third quarter.
Furthermore, dangling the proverbial carrot of exclusive shopping hours, following a $250 increase to annual Executive membership rewards last year, provides a catalyst for Gold Star and Business members to upgrade. The more cardholders are spending on their annual membership, the more likely they are to make Costco their first shopping choice. After all, they're going to want to get as much out of their membership fee as possible.
While this may not be the last we hear about exclusive shopping hours for Costco's highest tier of cardholders, it's an undeniably a smart move from a proven growth stock in the retail space.",851,trafilatura,,False

The company said the average hourly pay for its fulfillment and transportation employees will increase to more than $23, excluding benefits; if an employee worked 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they would earn just less than $48,000 if their wage was $23 an hour. Inclusive of benefits, the company estimates that the average employee earns more than $30 an hour.
Amazon said it has also changed its step plan—which sees employees’ pay increasing for each additional year they spend with Amazon—so that the company can issue larger pay increases between years than it previously had. It did not specify the exact changes it made to that plan.
In September 2024, the company said it had increased compensation to average out at $22 an hour excluding benefits and $29 an hour including benefits, so its latest announcement represents a $1 per hour change year over year. In 2024, the company said it had allocated $2.2 billion to those wage increases. In 2023, Amazon said its $1.3 billion investment in pay increases brought the average hourly pay to $20.50 per hour.
The federal minimum wage stands at $7.25, though 34 U.S. states, territories and districts have put minimum wages higher than the federal level into effect, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In addition to its straight-up wage increase promises, Amazon has further invested in providing lower-cost benefits to its employees, it said. For its entry-level healthcare package, Amazon employees will see $5 per week deducted from their pay; the company also said that, for standard visits, employees will pay a $5 copay. Those changes will take effect in 2026, and the e-tail giant said the new plan will see a 34 percent reduction in employees’ weekly contributions to health plans and an 87 percent reduction in the copays they dole out for primary care, mental health and non-specialist visits.
Udit Madan, senior vice president, Amazon Worldwide Operations, said the company’s attention to benefits helps it stand out as an employer in the e-commerce realm.
“We know that things like health care, education and retirement contributions play a critical role in employees’ and their families’ long-term wellbeing,” Madan wrote in the blog announcing the updates. “Benefits like that are still too rare in our industry, but we strongly believe that investing in them is the right thing to do for our teammates. And we’ve continued to invest through the years to make them even better.”
The e-tail giant’s announcement comes ahead of the holidays, which it said remain “a time when we’re reminded just how much the work that our teams do matters.”
Madan said the company’s yearly practice of upgrading employee pay is an example of its commitment to “constantly listening and working to keep getting better, every day, together.”
“These investments are part of our ongoing commitment to making Amazon a place where people can thrive, and I look forward to delivering the future together,” he wrote.",509,trafilatura,,False

Over the past couple of decades, the old studio system has fallen apart and the carcasses of those legendary film giants picked clean or outcompeted by well-funded, high-tech interlopers like Amazon.com (AMZN 1.01%) and Netflix (NFLX 1.38%).
Right now, what a Hollywood studio needs to survive -- and perhaps even thrive -- is oodles of cash and access to new technologies.
That's why an investment today of just $1,000 in Paramount Skydance (PSKY -0.38%) might pay off handsomely down the road.
A wealthy new owner
You may have heard that Larry Ellison, the CEO and co-founder of software giant Oracle (ORCL 0.71%), briefly became the wealthiest human on the planet earlier this month. The price of his company's stock surged on great earnings news and sent him ahead of Tesla (TSLA 0.02%) CEO Elon Musk for a while.
Skydance Media, a movie production and media company owned by the Ellison family, acquired Paramount last month for $8 billion, creating a new media conglomerate called Paramount Skydance. That deal suddenly gives the aging movie and television production firm a new lease on life -- and a massive injection of cash it can use to compete better.
Paramount is a Hollywood legend. It was one of the original ""Big Five"" studios in Los Angeles. It produced legendary films such as The Godfather, Chinatown, Titanic, and the Mission: Impossible, Indiana Jones, and Star Trek franchises, among many, many other recognizable films and television shows.
Paramount's current portfolio includes:
- Paramount Pictures and Television
- CBS and CBS News
- Nickelodeon, MTV, and BET
- Comedy Central
- Showtime
- Paramount+ streaming
Investors burned
Despite those assets, Paramount stock languished for years before the recent merger. The company struggled to compete in a fast-evolving media industry that needed to adapt to new technologies and changing viewer behaviors.
The stock burned none other than the Oracle of Omaha (different Oracle). Beginning in 2022, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.06%) (BRK.B 0.18%) accumulated 63 million shares of Paramount, but the stock fell 44% in 2022 and another 12% in 2023. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett sold the entire Paramount stake in 2024 for a loss.
But with the recent merger, Paramount now has an influx of essentially endless money from one of the world's richest families. It also has a close connection to a major tech firm (Oracle). That's likely to come in handy as new technologies -- from streaming to virtual reality and 3D pictures to artificial intelligence and machine learning -- continue to transform the entertainment industry.
Bold moves
David Ellison, Larry's son and CEO of the new conglomerate, is already using his father's fortune to make bold moves. Those include a recent $7.7 billion deal for rights to Ultimate Fighting Championship content and the acquisition of the rights to South Park.
Ellison is also working on an acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. movie and television studio.
In an Aug. 7 letter to shareholders and employees, Ellison promised to use cutting-edge technologies ""to transform Paramount into a tech-forward company that blends the creative heart of Hollywood with the innovative spirit of Silicon Valley.""
Trading at just under 13 times future earnings, Paramount Skydance is a bargain at the moment. The company has a market cap of just under $20 million, about 77% of which is owned by the Ellison family.
If you think technology and money can move an aging movie studio into the future (as I do), and that good things are in store for Paramount Skydance and its shareholders, you should consider an investment today before the shares become expensive.",608,trafilatura,,False

As of 11:22 a.m. ET, Lyft stock was up 12.2% on the news.
Lyft scores a win
The stakes are getting higher in the autonomous ride-sharing race, as Tesla has started an autonomous vehicle service in Austin and is looking to expand it to other cities. Amazon, meanwhile, launched its Zoox autonomous shuttle in Las Vegas. However, Waymo remains the clear leader in the category.
On Wednesday, Lyft announced a new partnership to bring Waymo's full autonomous ride-sharing service to Nashville in 2026. The new collaboration will take advantage of Lyft's integrated fleet management services through its Flexdrive subsidiary, which handles fleet management services, such as vehicle maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations.
According to the terms of the deal, Waymo's vehicles will first be available on the Waymo app and then added to the Lyft app later in the year.
CEO David Risher said in a press release: ""Waymo has proven that its autonomous technology works at scale. When combined with Lyft's customer obsession and world-class fleet management capabilities, it's two great tastes that go great together.""
What it means for Lyft
It's unclear where this partnership goes from here, and it likely depends on how the Nashville rollout goes. However, it's clearly a win to form a partnership with the leading autonomous vehicle company, and the market response was strong enough that Uber, which has also teamed up with Waymo, fell several points on the news.
It's the latest evidence that Lyft is a much stronger business than it was a year or two ago.",284,trafilatura,,False
company,1758129229,Amazon Upgrades Seller Assistant By Adding Agentic Capabilities,136791496,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AMZN,Yahoo,"The e-tail giant announced the upgraded capabilities at Amazon Accelerate, its annual seller conference, in Seattle.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1d31480ea15bd7b8ef15987819e4f1113def237365f44123b828161e2eb8967a,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/technology/amazon-artificial-intelligence-seller-experience-agentic-ai-1234779700/,ok,200.0,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/technology/amazon-artificial-intelligence-seller-experience-agentic-ai-1234779700/,sourcingjournal.com,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/technology/amazon-artificial-intelligence-seller-experience-agentic-ai-1234779700/,200.0,"Amazon’s accelerating its agentic AI strategy.
The company announced at its annual seller conference, Amazon Accelerate, that it has upgraded its Seller Assistant with agentic capabilities. The assistant tool was previously powered by generative AI and could answer sellers’ questions about their inventory, Amazon’s policies and more. That project, codenamed Project Amelia, launched during Accelerate last year.
The latest update goes beyond mere question-and-answer discussion and instead sees the assistant able to “reason, plan and help take action with a seller’s permission.”
The promise of agentic AI is that it can draw on information and data sources to act autonomously, rooting out mundane tasks for the user that would otherwise manually handle those same duties.
Mary Beth Westmoreland, vice president, worldwide selling partner experience at Amazon, said in a blog post announcing Seller Assistant’s changes that agentic AI has the power to significantly influence the way sellers handle their businesses.
“Our agentic AI capabilities are designed to work seamlessly throughout the entire selling experience, which means sellers can go from handling every task themselves to collaborating with an intelligent assistant that works proactively on their behalf around the clock, while always keeping sellers in control,” Westmoreland wrote in the blog.
The agentic functions behind Seller Assistant will be powered by Amazon Bedrock, which gives users the ability to access foundation models from Amazon itself and from other large AI players, like Anthropic, OpenAI and Perplexity AI.
Amazon said it currently plans to make the agentic capabilities of Seller Assistant freely available to sellers. Many of those sellers already shell out funds to Amazon to leverage the company’s fulfillment arm, Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA). The agentic upgrades have already launched in the U.S., and the company plans to roll them out to other regions in the months to follow.
Seller Assistant will soon be able to analyze inventory data to alert sellers to slow-moving SKUs, suggest courses of action related to projected demand and recommend discount rates in line with major sales events or holidays. The agent will use sellers’ own data, paired with a repository of Amazon’s own insights, to help third-party players determine the best future course for specific items in their catalog.
The tool can also analyze the type of products a seller’s customers have interest in, then recommend that the seller expand or change their product line to meet demand. Westmoreland said the agent can “proactively develop comprehensive growth plans for sellers to review and take action for sellers when they want it to.”
Seller Assistant’s expertise will extend beyond routine business functions, as well. Amazon said the tool will aid sellers in ensuring their compliance mechanisms are up to date for each market they sell in. That’s inclusive of safety considerations and certifications needed to sell in certain geographies. If Seller Assistant flags an inconsistency or compliance issue, it will alert the seller to the problem and recommend the necessary additions or changes to a listing.
Amazon has already launched a variety of other seller-facing tools, like Enhance My Listing, which leverages generative AI to provide content suggestions for sellers’ product pages, and its A+ Content offering, which helps to add supplementary imagery and text to a product page to entice consumers based on their interests. The newly announced agentic capabilities also include an upgrade to Amazon’s seller ad studio; Seller Assistant can recommend ad concepts to sellers, targeted for their audience or for specific shopping occasions, like Father’s Day.
Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, said at Accelerate that the synergy created by tools like these could help propel sellers forward. Jassy has long been bullish about the potential for AI to significantly impact the e-commerce industry and the workforce behind it.
“I think what we’re doing together is very unusual,” Jassy told sellers at the conference. “I think the transformation that we’re seeing with AI is going to make it even easier and more compelling for you all to be able to sell and for us to collectively be successful together, and I’m really appreciative that we’re on this adventure together. I still think it’s very early days.”
To that end, Westmoreland said that Amazon is far from finished iterating on the ways agentic AI can impact the seller experience. She noted that the enhancements Amazon announced Wednesday build on previous innovation from the company.
“This evolution will help sellers spend more time focusing on product innovation and customer relationships while Seller Assistant handles complex and time-consuming operational tasks, making selling in Amazon’s store more efficient, strategic, and successful. And Seller Assistant will get even more capable over time, as we learn more about what sellers want and how we can help them,” she wrote.",779,trafilatura,,False

Here's what investors need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Holding Steady as Investors Await Fed Rate Decision
Stock futures are little changed ahead of today’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq, which hit fresh all-time highs yesterday morning before finishing the day slightly lower, were down less than 0.1% this morning. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, ticked lower to 4.01%, near its lowest level since April. Gold futures were down slightly at around $3,700 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday, while bitcoin edged lower to $116,300.
2. Investors Expect Rate Cut, Looking for Signals That Further Easing Likely
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates today, with the announcement coming at 2 p.m. ET today. While most investors believe the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point, some are betting that a half-point cut is possible amid signs of weakness in the labor market. The Fed will also release its quarterly projections on the direction of the economy and interest rates. At 2:30 p.m. ET, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference to discuss the decision and speak on general economic conditions. Investors will be looking for signals that the Fed believes economic conditions warrant more rate cuts in the coming months.
3. China Orders Companies to Stop Buying Nvidia Chips, Report Says
China’s internet regulator has ordered companies to stop buying Nvidia (NVDA) chips in order to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, according to a report in The Financial Times. The Cyberspace Administration of China told companies including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba to terminate their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s latest chip designed for the Chinese market, the report said. The new ban is stronger than prior restrictions from regulators that focused on the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip. The ban comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in recent premarket trading.
4. Meta Event to Focus on AI Glasses
Meta Platforms (META) is expected to show off its AI-powered smart glasses and other new technology at its developer conference that begins today. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at 8 p.m. ET, is expected to showcase the company's ""Hypernova"" glasses. The launch of new Meta AI glasses comes as competitors Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions of AI glasses. Meta shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Meta’s Connect conference will extend into Thursday.

The San Jose, California-based payments technology pioneer, which also owns the peer-to-peer business Venmo, had no such business before last year, but spotted an opportunity to use its transaction data to pitch clients on placing ads across its own portals, and those of other companies.
To get started, the company hired Mark Grether as a senior vice president and general manager of its new PayPal ads division in May 2024, bringing on board an executive who previously developed ad businesses at retail giant Amazon and ride-share titan Uber Technologies.
“I'm the guy who basically comes in and builds advertising businesses from the ground up in the context of a larger organization,” Grether said in an interview last week.
Now, he’s leading long-time PayPal customers, as well as new clients, to place their advertising on PayPal and Venmo screens. In addition, his unit is assisting those customers in posting the same targeted ads on other publishing properties.
PayPal has expanded the new business from the U.S. to the U.K. and Germany. And on Wednesday, the company said in a press release that it extended the off-site display and video ad options to those European countries as well.
Car-maker Mercedes-Benz, Uber, delivery firm DoorDash and retailer Walmart are among the company’s ad clients.
One innovation that Grether touts is the ability for advertisers to place a button on the ad that lets consumers almost instantly have the option to purchase a product if they’re a PayPal user.
PayPal is luring corporate clients as well as new customers to the ad proposition by highlighting the data the payments technology company has collected from handling consumer transactions, Grether said. PayPal’s trove of data is larger than that of retail behemoths Walmart or Amazon, he contended.
“We have access to transaction data from 30 million merchants, 400 million consumers globally,” he said, explaining how that information helps the company win over chief financial officers attracted to the notion of placing ad dollars behind more tailored campaigns.
For product makers, such as Nike, the chief financial officer wants to understand how products are being sold across retail outlets, whether that’s Dick’s Sporting Goods or Zappos, to understand what amount of ad dollars might increase the market share, Grether explained.
“We can answer this question because we’re sitting across all the merchants where Nike products get sold,” Grether said.
As far as PayPal’s revenue goals for the new ad business, Grether declined to comment, but he pointed to his past experience building billion-dollar ad businesses for Amazon and Uber. Those companies were similarly able to persuade retailers and other merchants of the power of placing ads on their uniquely placed display screens.
Grether contends that the profit margin for the new PayPal business is high, mainly carrying only the expense of a sales force. He declined to say how many employees are on his team now, but said it’s expanding with the business.",512,trafilatura,,False

Amazon Ads and Netflix recently announced a partnership that will make Netflix's ad-supported inventory available programmatically through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP) in more than a dozen major markets, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, and Brazil. For advertisers, this means one of the most premium sources of connected TV (CTV) inventory is now tied directly into Amazon's advertising ecosystem.
For The Trade Desk (TTD 2.60%), the independent DSP that has long positioned itself as the alternative to walled gardens like Google and Meta Platforms, the move raises both risks and opportunities.
Why Netflix Chose Amazon
Netflix has quickly grown its ad-supported tier, reaching more than 90 million global monthly active users across all ad-tier households. To fully monetize that audience, Netflix needs scale, targeting, and attribution tools that resonate with global advertisers.
Amazon brings exactly that strength. Its DSP is one of the largest in the world, fueled by first-party shopping and streaming data from Amazon.com, Prime Video, and Fire TV. For brands, that means they can target Netflix viewers with the same precision they already use across Amazon's ecosystem, while tying exposure directly to purchase behavior.
Operationally, Amazon gives Netflix plug-and-play infrastructure. It also leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to help advertisers run impactful digital ads campaigns with minimal effort, thanks to the automation of campaign planning, buying, and measurement. So, advertisers already allocating billions through Amazon Ads can now extend those campaigns onto Netflix inventory with minimal friction.
In short, partnering with Amazon should help Netflix quickly scale its advertising business.
What it means for The Trade Desk
Here's where the tension lies. The Trade Desk has also promoted partnerships with Netflix, Walt Disney, and Roku on curated supply access. Its pitch to advertisers is neutrality: unlike Amazon, it doesn't own content or compete in streaming, which helps ensure cross-platform transparency and measurement.
But Amazon's new Netflix deal strengthens its hand. With Netflix, Roku, and Disney inventory increasingly accessible through Amazon's DSP, The Trade Desk risks losing some of the premium authenticated CTV supply that has been central to its growth story.
Besides, Amazon has a closed-loop ecosystem that includes e-commerce, CTV hardware, and Prime Video, providing it with unmatched data for precise audience targeting. Combined with the consumer data from Netflix, it could deliver excellent return on advertising capital, rivaling (if not surpassing) that of The Trade Desk's platform.
The silver lining is that advertisers wary of Amazon's dominance may lean harder on The Trade Desk as a balancing force. Many global brands prefer to diversify demand across independent platforms rather than concentrate entirely inside one ecosystem. That gives the tech company a continued role, even if Amazon is now the more dominant gatekeeper for premium inventory.
The bigger picture
This partnership isn't just about Netflix. Amazon has been steadily expanding its CTV footprint:
- Roku: Earlier this year, Amazon Ads struck a deal to make Roku's authenticated inventory available on its DSP, covering more than 80 million U.S. households.
- Disney: Amazon has also partnered with Walt Disney's DRAX exchange, giving buyers access to premium Disney streaming content.
Together, these moves show Amazon's ambition to consolidate premium CTV supply into its advertising stack. For advertisers, this provides an additional option beyond existing DSPs for capital allocation. For publishers, it offers additional demand for their advertising industry. But for independent players like The Trade Desk, it raises the bar for them to remain competitive over the long term.
What does it mean for investors?
For investors, the Amazon-Netflix tie-up highlights a clear industry trend: Premium streaming inventory is becoming increasingly tied to large ecosystems with first-party data advantages. The Trade Desk still has unique strengths in neutrality, transparency, and cross-channel reach, but the competitive bar just moved higher.
If advertisers increasingly default to Amazon for CTV, The Trade Desk could face headwinds in maintaining its share of wallet. On the other hand, if buyers push back against platform dependency, The Trade Desk's neutrality could prove more valuable than ever.
Either way, the stakes in CTV just got higher. For investors in The Trade Desk, this isn't a reason to panic -- but it is a reason to keep a closer eye on how the competitive dynamics evolve.",706,trafilatura,,False

The California-based startup announced Monday that it has secured $120 million in Series A funding.
Robostrategy, CRB and First Round Capital led the round, with further participation from Salesforce Ventures, the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, Samsung Next, LG Technology Ventures and NVentures, which is Nvidia’s venture capital arm.
Dyna creates robotic foundation models, which it inputs into general-purpose robots. Foundation models are typically trained on mass amounts of data and information, but lack the training for a specific use case; that in mind, Dyna’s robots use the knowledge the foundation model has been trained on to adapt to real-world scenarios.
Jason Ma, co-founder of Dyna and former DeepMind research scientist, said that flexibility gives Dyna the opportunity to enter many industries without having to train robots to handle each and every task a customer wishes to deploy them for.
“Our first principle is to design robot foundation models that attain both generalization and performance,” Ma said in a statement. “Scalable real-world robot learning systems need to master and generalize many manipulation skills. To achieve the best performance on complex tasks, Dyna’s foundation models are developed to enable general world understanding while learning from the models’ own experience for rapid online learning.”
The company plans to use its Series A capital to add heads to its research and engineering teams and to fasttrack the further refinement of its foundation model as it adds commercial clients to its roster.
Lindon Gao, co-founder and CEO of Dyna, said that kind of improvement will be key to proving that autonomous robots are a high-fidelity use case for industries that have previously struggled to find the promised value associated with autonomous solutions.
“A strong foundation model is key to scalable distribution,” Gao said in a statement. “Our models continuously improve with each customer deployment, generating high-quality data. We are observing true generalization as our robot enters new environments; it simply works out of the box, with no additional data.”
About a month after securing a $23.5 million seed round in the spring, Dyna announced that it had launched Dynamism v1 (DYNA-1), which is the foundation model that currently powers its stationary robotic arms. Because the robots leverage DYNA-1, they’re considered general-purpose robots and can learn new skills as they go.
In early tests with customers, Dyna’s robots have focused on high-dexterity tasks, like folding napkins. The company said in April that DYNA-1 has a 99.4 percent success rate without human intervention when operating at 60 percent of a typical human’s throughput for the same task.
For Dyna, which said its robots can operate for more than 24 hours at a time, that means the machines can operate autonomously while humans are off the clock. So, while the robots may take more time to handle a task than their human counterparts, they can operate while humans are away from a facility.
York Yang, co-founder of Dyna, said that capability bodes well in industries seeing labor shortages.
“Right now, three forces are colliding at once: AI breakthroughs are maturing, hardware is accelerating and the demand for labor has never been higher. That convergence has created a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” said co-founder York Yang. “Dyna has made rapid progress over 12 months and we believe our ultimate goal, achieving physical AGI [artificial general intelligence], is not far off.”
According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (QSPC), 20.4 percent of industry-agnostic U.S. manufacturers attributed the gap between actual operations and full production capacity to insufficient supply of labor. And, according to Manpower’s annual U.S. Talent Shortage Report, 74 percent of U.S. transportation and logistics employers said they struggle to find skilled talent; that figure has increased by 6 percentage points since 2024’s survey, and the sector’s rate comes in 3 percentage points higher than the industry-agnostic U.S. average.
Experts have attributed some supply chain players’ increasing interest in robotics to their labor shortage problems. Deloitte research shows that autonomous robots can decrease labor costs while growing productivity rates, primarily because they can work constantly without needing breaks in the way humans do. Investors seem to agree; Andrew Kang, CEO of RoboStrategy, said Dyna’s vision for changing multiple industries propelled its continued investment in the startup.
“Dyna’s team and mission bridges research excellence and real world commercial applications. The demand for robotic automation spans almost every industry, and we believe Dyna will be at the forefront in meeting it with their state of the art general-purpose robot foundation model,” Kang said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to co-lead this Series A and support the team’s ambitious roadmap of driving mass adoption of general-purpose robots.”",775,trafilatura,,False

Target is expanding its next-day delivery reach to stay competitive with Amazon and other rivals.
The Minneapolis-based company Tuesday announced plans to provide the faster service in 35 additional U.S. metro areas by the end of October. Some of the new locations include Charlotte, North Carolina; Cleveland; Kansas City, Missouri; Orlando, Florida; Pittsburgh; San Diego; St. Louis; and Tampa, Florida.
The company said it plans to add 20 more metro areas to its next-day delivery roster in 2026.
Target already provides same-delivery to 80% of the U.S. population, and two-day shipping to 99% of the country, according to the company. The retail chain also offers free store pickup and drive-up services for online purchases.
Amazon, by comparison, expanded its number of same-day delivery sites for Amazon Prime members by more than 60% in 2024, and serves more than 140 metro areas.
Walmart told AP News that it has delivered 7.1 billion units via same-day delivery or next-day delivery in the last 12 months, though it declined to offer the percentage. It also announced last month that it's expanding next-day delivery across top U.S. cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles, for its third-party marketplace items to customers. Walmart said it reaches 95% of the U.S. population with next-day or two-day shipping.
Target's decision to extend its services for speedier deliveries comes at a critical time for the retailers, which operates more than 1,900 stores. In the quarter that ended on Aug. 2., it reported a 21% drop in net income. The company has also seen flat or declining comparable sales in eight out of the past 10 quarters.
In an effort to reenergize the company and turn around its weak sales, Target in August announced that its Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year company veteran, will succeed CEO Brian Cornell, when step down on Feb. 1, 2026.
""Mike was the right candidate to lead our business back to growth,"" Cornell told reporters at the time.
Gretchen McCarthy, Target's chief supply chain and logistics officer, told The Associated Press that Target is using stores more precisely and leaning more into fulfillment centers when and where that can help with increasing speed without hurting profits.

The real question isn't whether AI is worth investing in -- it's which companies navigating this fast-paced landscape are durable enough to hold for the long haul.
Below, I'll highlight three of my top AI stocks to buy and hold forever and explain why they deserve a permanent spot in your portfolio today.
1. The semiconductor king: Nvidia
Throughout the AI revolution, Nvidia (NVDA 1.68%) has emerged as arguably the most influential player. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone for training and deploying generative AI models. Layered on top of that hardware is CUDA, Nvidia's software architecture that enables programmers to develop applications on top of its chips.
This combination of hardware and software has created a powerful technological moat for Nvidia -- one that competitors have struggled to replicate despite their best efforts.
As AI models become more complex and expand into use cases across robotics, quantum computing, and autonomous systems, the demand for greater inference power will accelerate. Nvidia's long track record of innovation positions it well to address these challenges and scale up alongside its big tech counterparts as they introduce more sophisticated AI applications down the road.
With hyperscalers showing no signs of slowing their infrastructure investment, there's good reason to remain confident that Nvidia's best days are still ahead.
2. The underrated ecosystem: Alphabet
Back in 2015, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai outlined his vision to transform Google and its many businesses into an AI-first platform. Nearly a decade later, investors can clearly see how those early ambitions have materialized.
Alphabet has embedded AI across virtually every layer of its ecosystem, in advertising, search tools, cloud services, consumer applications, and cybersecurity. Two of the most underrated assets within this ecosystem are DeepMind, Google's AI research lab, and its custom tensor processing units (TPUs).
These chips are the computational backbone for training and running large language models (LLMs), giving Alphabet a unique structural advantage as it tests and scales up its own AI capabilities across Gemini and physical infrastructure.
Some on Wall Street even suggest that Google's TPU division could be worth $900 billion -- underscoring just how significant this hardware could be in unlocking future value for Alphabet as well as providing a path to compete more directly with Nvidia.
3. The bridge connecting software and physical infrastructure: Amazon
Amazon's AI story is unique because it bridges the gap between digital and physical infrastructure. On the software side, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has forged a strategic partnership with OpenAI rival Anthropic, a leading AI start-up now valued at $183 billion.
Anthropic is deeply integrated into AWS -- developing its models on Amazon's custom Trainium and Inferentia chips while also expanding the capabilities of Amazon Bedrock. Through this alliance, AWS customers gain access to Claude, Anthropic's highly capable alternative to ChatGPT.
On the e-commerce side, Amazon has been vocal about its ambitions to outfit warehouses with AI-powered robotics. While the up-front cost will be high, the long-term payoff could be transformative -- potentially expanding operating profits by billions of dollars thanks to unprecedented labor efficiencies.
The common thread stitching these monster AI stocks together
Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon each demonstrate how deliberate capital allocation can create a compounding effect that extends far beyond the initial investment. These tech titans aren't just building proprietary systems, they are developing platforms through which technological breakthroughs reinforce and integrate with one another more deeply.
The result is accelerated revenue growth across various end markets paired with widening profit margins and durable, resilient cash flow generation.
In a fiercely competitive and evolving AI landscape, this ability to turn investments into lucrative feedback loops is precisely what sets these businesses apart and why I view them as compelling long-term buys.",639,trafilatura,,False
company,1758027900,Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days event returns in October,136773109,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,AMZN,Yahoo,"The sale, which marks the company’s kickoff to the holiday shopping season, is scheduled for Oct. 7 and Oct. 8.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=77fbd01c09f95ec4db653867affe7f4ea27551632aad881a3398e012371609c2,https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazons-prime-big-deal-days-october-sales-event-returns/760222/,ok,200.0,https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazons-prime-big-deal-days-october-sales-event-returns/760222/,retaildive.com,https://www.retaildive.com/news/amazons-prime-big-deal-days-october-sales-event-returns/760222/,200.0,"Prime Big Deal Days is set to return — this time on Oct. 7 and Oct. 8.
The event is Amazon’s kickoff to the holiday shopping season. Some promotions are already underway, including early sales on a curated list of holiday gifts, Amazon private brands, Amazon devices, Kindle books and grocery savings, according to the company.
Other deals include the new Amazon Essentials denim collection starting at $15, 40% off festive decor, fall fashion starting at $10 and Halloween costumes and accessories from $5.
Prime Big Deal Days’ discounts can also be found on popular brands such as Samsung, Dyson, Clinique, Beats, KitchenAid and Milk Makeup.
""We're excited to help Prime members save money this year with some of Amazon's best deals of the season so far, including amazing deals on an expanded selection of Holiday Amazon Exclusive items,” Carmen Nestares, vice president of North America marketing and Prime tech, said in a statement. “With Prime Big Deal Days, members can check off their holiday lists early and make the most of their holiday budget.""
The shopping event follows Amazon’s July Prime Day, which was expanded to four days for the first time this year. The summer event resulted in record sales and more items sold compared to any previous four-day period that included a Prime Day event, according to the company. Amazon previously declined to provide Retail Dive with specific numbers related to those results.

The concern is straightforward: As consumers increasingly turn to chatbots to answer queries, Alphabet's long-standing dominance in Google Search could face disruption.
Since the bulk of the company's revenue comes from advertising fees tied to search, any erosion in Google's market share seemingly poses an existential threat to Alphabet's financial engine. On the surface, this bearish narrative is compelling. But the reality is far more nuanced.
Alphabet's financial resilience, strategic partnerships, and product evolution suggests that the company is not only prepared to defend its turf but may also emerge stronger in the face of rising competition.
Analyzing Alphabet's financial fortress
In the table below, I've summarized Alphabet's advertising revenue from Google Search over the past year:
| Category | Q3 2024 | Q4 2024 | Q1 2025 | Q2 2025 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Google Search revenue (in billions) | $49.4 | $54.0 | $50.7 | $54.2 |
| Growth (YOY) | 12% | 12% | 10% | 12% |
Given the profile above, there is little evidence that ChatGPT or other large language models (LLMs) represent material headwinds for Google's dominance across the internet. The figures above suggest that advertisers continue to view Google as one of the most effective channels for capturing engagement and attention online.
What's even more critical to recognize is that Alphabet's advertising business operates at exceptionally high profit margins. This profitability provides the company with a powerful buffer. What I mean by that is if LLMs eventually chip away at Google's market share, Alphabet is still well-positioned to absorb the impact by reinvesting this cash flow into next-generation products -- a strategy the company is already executing today.
In recent years, Alphabet has poured significant resources into expanding its cloud infrastructure platform to better compete with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the heart of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is its custom-built hardware, Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These are specialized chips designed to handle advanced artificial intelligence (AI) workloads such as machine learning and deep learning.
In a striking development, OpenAI signed on as a major GCP client. The irony here is hard to dismiss: Even if ChatGPT diverts some internet traffic that might otherwise flow to Google, Alphabet still benefits financially on the back end by powering the very company allegedly threatening its leadership position.
Turning Google into an LLM
Alphabet's defensive posture extends well beyond monetization. The company has also integrated its own AI model, Gemini, across its ecosystem.
Within Google Search, users can now toggle into ""AI Mode"" -- effectively transforming the search experience into an LLM-powered interface. By embedding a ChatGPT-like experience natively into Google, the company layers its own generative AI capabilities into the familiar query box.
This approach delivers two major advantages. First, it preserves ingrained user habits -- making switching to other platforms less appealing. Second, it allows Alphabet to maintain robust advertising economics -- albeit in a reimagined format.
Together, these moves underscore a dual positioning: defending the core search business while simultaneously profiting from the very companies seeking disruption. Put differently, Alphabet isn't treating LLMs as a binary threat. Instead, the company has created a hedge that few can match -- making money whether users type a query into Google or send a prompt to ChatGPT.
Is now a good time to buy Alphabet stock?
While OpenAI currently commands much of the cultural and technological AI spotlight, Alphabet's response is more than simple defensive insulation. The company is actively reshaping its narrative -- repositioning itself as a business woven together by AI-powered services.
The valuation expansion outlined above suggests that investors are now just beginning to recognize the breadth of Alphabet's AI story. Yet, based on forward earnings, the market has not assigned the same premium to Alphabet as other beneficiaries of the AI revolution.
Alphabet may not have declared a ""checkmate"" against OpenAI, but it has clearly moved past a stalemate. With its shares trading at a steep discount to its peers, I see Alphabet stock as a compelling opportunity as the company's AI investments continue to bear fruit.",703,trafilatura,,False

The company's trapped ion technology and deep integrations with major cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) have earned IonQ a loyal following.
Over the past year, its stock price has soared an eye-popping 812% -- propelling its market capitalization to roughly $22 billion. While IonQ will likely continue to grab headlines, investors seeking the next breakthrough opportunity may want to look elsewhere.
That brings us to Quantinuum -- a rising star in the space that recently secured $600 million in funding from an impressive roster of backers including Honeywell (HON -0.02%), JPMorgan Chase, Amgen, Mitsui, and, most notably, Nvidia (NVDA 1.68%). Following its recent capital raise, Quantinuum is now valued at $10.6 billion.
Let's explore why Quantinuum could become the next monster company defining the quantum artificial intelligence (AI) market -- and how investors can gain exposure today.
Quantum computing has trillion-dollar potential
Quantinuum's lineup of investors underscores the broad reach of quantum computing. Honeywell contributes industrial scale, JPMorgan represents financial services, Amgen highlights breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals, and Nvidia provides the bridge between accelerated computing and quantum AI. Together, these partners illustrate how quantum technology impacts nearly every major economic sector.
The potential applications are vast -- spanning fraud detection, risk modeling, logistics optimization, energy efficiency, drug discovery, molecular simulation, AI model training, and generative application design.
With such transformative use cases on the horizon, it's no surprise that McKinsey & Company projects quantum computing could generate trillions of dollars in economic value over the coming decades.
How to invest in Quantinuum
Since Quantinuum remains a private company, investors cannot buy its stock directly. However, there is still a practical way to gain exposure: by investing in the publicly traded companies that already own equity stakes in Quantinuum.
This approach not only provides passive, insulated access to quantum computing's growth potential, but it also delivers diversified exposure through established blue chip stocks.
By owning shares of companies like Nvidia, Amgen, JPMorgan, and Honeywell, investors can participate in multiple industries that stand to benefit as quantum AI moves from research labs to tangible commercialization at scale. In other words, this strategy offers a balanced path to profit from the next computing evolution while staying anchored in some of the market's most durable, resilient, and profitable industry leaders.
Why quantum AI is such an important opportunity
AI has already transformed global computing demand. In just a few years, companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have ascended into the exclusive trillion-dollar market cap club. In fact, Nvidia's meteoric rise during the AI revolution has even made it the most valuable company in the world.
Now, quantum technology is positioned to extend this digital transformation by tackling problems that even today's most advanced supercomputers have trouble solving. When paired with AI, quantum computing has the potential to unlock unprecedented efficiencies and reshape industries that will define the next technological frontier.
Quantinuum's rise to a $10 billion valuation, backed by some of the biggest names across multiple industries, underscores that the shift to quantum applications is not merely hypothetical or experimental -- it is real and already under way.
For investors, the message is clear: You don't need to wait for Quantinuum's initial public offering (IPO) to participate in its upside. By building a basket of quantum-adjacent stocks -- established blue chips investing beyond their core platforms -- you can ride the near-term wave of AI upside while securing long-term tailwinds fueling the quantum era.",600,trafilatura,,False

Alphabet's many AI strengths
Alphabet's business escaped relatively unscathed from legal penalties related to its Google search engine being declared an illegal monopoly. After the presiding judge delivered the verdict this month, the tech giant's appeal as an AI stock has taken off, and it's understandable why.
The company's AI enhancements to its search engine resulted in increased consumer usage, enabling the company's second-quarter sales to soar 14% year over year to $96.4 billion. More importantly, the additions demonstrate Google's ability to maintain its users in the face of stiff competition from AI rivals such as OpenAI and Perplexity. Alphabet is just getting started. Its AI-powered robotaxi service, Waymo, is quickly expanding across the U.S. thanks to partnerships with businesses such as Uber and Lyft. Waymo has logged over 100 million miles on public roads as of Q2.
Alphabet stock maintains a reasonable valuation despite its share price increase. This is evident when comparing its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio against AI superstar Nvidia, and AI competitor Microsoft, which also challenges Google in search, cloud computing, and digital advertising.
Alphabet's P/E multiple remains well below the others', indicating a better value for investors. With an attractive valuation, and its AI investments yielding rising revenue, Alphabet stands out as a strong AI stock.",281,trafilatura,,False

The stock is up over 75% since hitting a 52-week low in April, but it still trades at a reasonable valuation. With 2 billion users and one of the best enterprise cloud services available, Alphabet is well-positioned to help investors outperform the market.
How Google is benefiting from AI
Earlier in the year, some investors were concerned about Google's competitive position as more people started using ChatGPT and other models to look up information. This overlooked the power of Google's Gemini AI model, which has emerged as one of the best models out there.
Gemini powers all the company's consumer services, like Search, and it is making a difference in the company's financial performance. Revenue from Search -- the company's largest business -- grew 12% year over year in the second quarter. This momentum reflects increasing search queries with AI Overviews.
Google is also competitively positioned in cloud services. The number of new customers using Google Cloud jumped 28% quarter over quarter in Q2. Management credits this momentum to its global base of AI-optimized data centers, custom AI chips, storage, and software offerings.
It can't be emphasized enough that Google's AI capabilities are only possible because of the company's substantial free cash flow. It generated $67 billion in free cash flow over the last year, while spending $67 billion in capital expenditures for technology and AI infrastructure.
Google has the resources to deliver the best AI experiences for its users, yet Alphabet stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 25. That's a reasonable multiple to pay for a company that just reported a 22% year-over-year increase in earnings last quarter.",304,trafilatura,,False

Both blockchains provide faster, cheaper, and more secure financial transactions than traditional SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) transfers, and they both support cross-border transfers, automated payments, integrations with third-party digital wallets, and tokenized assets.
That announcement might alarm Ripple's users and XRP's investors, but is Google really trying to kill XRP? Let's review the key similarities and differences to find out.
The similarities and differences between GCUL and XRPL
GCUL and XRPL are both designed to facilitate faster financial transactions, but there are three key differences.
First, GCUL is a centralized private platform that is only open to vetted and approved institutions. It's geared toward regulatory compliance, stability, and institutional control, with Google Cloud initially managing its governance and infrastructure services.
XRPL is a decentralized public platform that anyone can access. Its validators are spread out across the world instead of being corralled within a single company. That can be a double-edged sword: It can be more freely accessed than GCUL, but the lack of a vetting and approval process exposes it to more illegal transactions.
Second, GCUL doesn't have its own native token. XRPL has a native token, XRP, which is mainly used to satisfy its settlements, fees, and reserve requirements. XRPL's fees are low, but its fees rise as its network activity increases. GCUL charges predictable monthly fees instead of relying on volatile fees driven by the blockchain system's ""tokenomics.""
XRPL also has its own native stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD 0.02%), which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Both Ripple USD and XRP are frequently used for bridge currency transfers -- in which two volatile or illiquid currencies are directly converted to the native token as a ""bridge"" instead of being converted to a third fiat currency (like the U.S. dollar) in a slower and pricier transaction. Without its own tokens, GCUL will likely underperform XRPL in those bridge currency transfers.
Lastly, GCUL natively supports smart contracts, which are used in the development of blockchain-based applications. XRPL only natively supports lightweight ""hooks"" for developing simpler programs, but it's reportedly been mulling the development of ""sidechains"" to integrate more Ethereum (ETH -2.69%)-based smart contracts into its ledger.
Is GCUL a threat to XRPL?
Google's GCUL could be an appealing option for larger banks, clearinghouses, and asset managers who prefer a tightly regulated platform with predictable fees. It could also be a natural fit for large enterprise customers that are already locked into Google's cloud-based services.
However, XRPL's decentralized approach, resistance to regulators, and lower fees should make it more appealing to individual users and smaller financial institutions who don't want to lock themselves into Google's ecosystem. Google is also approving GCUL's customers on a strict case-by-case basis, which could drive more customers to XRPL due to the sluggish process.
Moreover, Google doesn't plan to officially launch GCUL until 2026. Before that happens, a few major catalysts could spark XRPL's near-term expansion: the increased adoption of Ripple USD as an alternative to the U.S. dollar; the approvals of XRP's first spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in October and November, and the rollout of more sidechains to support the development of decentralized apps (dApps) and other crypto assets.
XRPL has already partnered with more than 300 banks worldwide, so there could plenty of room for both of these blockchains to flourish without trampling each other. XRPL and GCUL certainly have plenty of overlapping interests, but it's premature to call the latter -- or any other newcomer -- an ""XRP killer"" before it even launches.",613,trafilatura,,False
company,1758365100,Best Quantum Computing Stock to Buy Now: IonQ or Alphabet?,136828122,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,GOOGL,Yahoo,IonQ and Alphabet represent two opposite ends of the quantum computing investment spectrum.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=093f0c8f3d02b6cc3510fae1c4357ab80579accdc57ee3d9227e246bf3e36535,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/best-quantum-computing-stock-to-buy-now-ionq-or-al/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/best-quantum-computing-stock-to-buy-now-ionq-or-al/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/best-quantum-computing-stock-to-buy-now-ionq-or-al/,200.0,"Quantum computing is emerging as the next big investment trend, although we're still a few years out from seeing commercially viable quantum computing. As a result, investors are wondering what the best approach to quantum computing is.
There are publicly traded quantum computing investments, like IonQ (IONQ -3.56%), that have massive upside if they work out. However, they also come with big risks if their technology isn't adopted. Multiple big tech companies are also involved in the quantum computing arms race, like Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) (GOOGL -0.15%). These companies have nearly unlimited resources compared to the start-ups, but don't have near the upside. This makes them safer picks, but investors might be worried they're leaving too much potential on the table by not taking some risk.
So, between the two, which is the best quantum computing investment right now?
Investors must pay a premium for IonQ
There is a significant size difference between the two companies. Alphabet is a tech behemoth with a market cap of $2.9 trillion, while IonQ is a comparatively small $17 billion company. However, despite Alphabet's size, the stock is far cheaper than IonQ. Let me explain.
Currently, IonQ isn't making a ton of money. It's relying on various research partnerships and contracts that it has signed to generate revenue. In Q2, it recognized revenue of $21 million, which is a rounding error compared to Alphabet's results. Alphabet generated $96.4 billion in revenue during Q2, making IonQ's revenue 0.0218% of Alphabet's total. That's a huge difference.
With Alphabet, you're paying about 8 times sales for the stock, or for every dollar of sales over 12 months, you're paying $8. IonQ trades for 242 times sales, so it's quite a bit more expensive.
This mismatch is because the market is far more excited about IonQ's future than Alphabet's. Should both companies develop commercially relevant quantum computing systems, the effect it will have on each company's growth is quite different. For Alphabet, it will likely contribute a few extra percentage points each quarter. For IonQ, a major system sale could cause its revenue to double or triple year over year. That explosive growth is what excites investors the most with IonQ, although it's far from guaranteed.
Buying both stocks allows investors to balance risk
There's no guarantee that the approach Alphabet or IonQ is taking will be a winning one. There may be a hidden flaw in each company's design that doesn't appear for a few years, which could eliminate them from contention in the quantum computing arms race.
While this would be disappointing for Alphabet, it wouldn't be the end of the world. It would continue down its path of AI dominance and also thrive on the advertising revenue generated by the Google search engine.
Unfortunately, if this happens to IonQ, the stock would likely go to $0, losing investors a ton of money. This scenario is probably more likely for IonQ than quantum computing success, and investors must be aware of this risk.
So, which one is the better buy? I'd say if you're afraid of a stock going to zero, then IonQ is one to avoid, and Alphabet is more attractive. However, I think there's a better approach. By devoting no more than 1% of your portfolio positioning to a quantum computing long shot like IonQ, you can capture some of the upside if it makes it big while limiting downside risk. Additionally, by purchasing shares of Alphabet to balance this risk out, investors can get two impressive quantum computing plays. This basket approach is a smart way to invest in an emerging field like quantum computing, as it balances out risk by investing in multiple companies.",612,trafilatura,,False

PayPal and Google plan to collaborate on
""All banks will need to look at how they support this emerging channel for payments,"" Zachary Aron, principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP, told American Banker.
Big payment moves
PayPal and Google's partnership covers several areas, including agentic shopping and commerce, embedding PayPal technology in Google's platforms, expanded payment processing and collaborating on cloud-delivered technology.
Google and PayPal will cooperate on AI-supported shopping experiences and standards for agentic AI that the two companies hope will be adopted by the broader payments industry. PayPal will contribute its payment processing systems, data-driven personalization and identity technology.
Google will add its own AI tech,
In an unrelated project, Mastercard is also pushing agentic commerce and plans to dramatically scale availability of the technology. By Nov. 28 (Black Friday), all Mastercard cardholders will be enabled for Mastercard Agent Pay in the U.S., with global deployment coming shortly after.
Mastercard additionally released Agent Sign-Up, which lets the card network's Agent Toolkit users identify AI agents and access AI-enabled Mastercard products. Other products are Insight Tokens, which enable security for agentic commerce, and agentic consulting services. Citi and U.S. Bank are the first announced bank partners for Mastercard's expanded AI shopping tools, which will lead to new services for the banks' Mastercard cardholders.
The announcements from PayPal, Google and Mastercard are about building the infrastructure for agentic commerce when it arrives, Aaron McPherson, principal at AFM Consulting LLC, told American Banker, noting there is not a lot of consumer demand for agentic commerce at this point, but there are ""numerous problems to be solved.""
This includes who is responsible when an agent buys the wrong thing, how merchants make their catalogs readable by agents and the possibility of an agent being hijacked by a malicious website and being instructed to do things that violate a user's intent or privacy.
""Remember, AI can't tell a sketchy website from a legitimate one, so there is a lot of opportunity for shenanigans,"" McPherson said.
Big work for banks
While using agentic AI is
""Commerce is the best example of how a bank is present in the everyday life of its customers through embedded payments,""
For banks, agentic AI can lower operational costs by 20%, McKinsey senior partners Pradip Patiath and Ido Segev wrote in
The McKinsey partners also said banks will need to upgrade their technology, operating models and fraud prevention, adding expense to technology budgets. ""If that's not enough, agentic AI could also cut into revenues and profit margins,"" Patiath and Segav wrote. ""For example, AI agents could autonomously open new savings accounts and move money on consumers' behalf to find them the best rates. Or agents could optimize credit card lending balances and take advantage of zero balance-transfer offers, threatening margins.""
As payments and technology companies adopt agentic AI, banks will need to determine a strategy based on developing their own solution, partnering or integrating their products with a solution provided by a merchant or nonbank, Deloitte's Aron said, adding considerations include the degree to which banks can capture wallet share for the transaction, and insight that can help them better serve their customers or strengthen their pitch to merchants.
""While we believe the technology will evolve rapidly and customer-facing solutions will be introduced quickly into the market, a big determinant of whether the solutions are widely adopted and scale will be determined by merchant adoption,"" Aron said. ""Solutions which make it easier for merchants to offer their goods and services through an agentic solution or create a personalized, contextual experience for the customer will drive greater adoption.""
Complicated processing
Agentic commerce creates a number of challenges across the payment value chain, including banks, merchants, and consumers, Aaron Press, research director for worldwide payment strategies for IDC, told American Banker.
""Understanding the data that will be needed and the implications of this data is in the early stages, though it is encouraging that concepts like fraud and security are being considered from the beginning,"" Press said. ""The mechanisms and data management process for all of this, however, are in the early stages.""
Banks will need the ability to confirm that the agent is owned and controlled by the account holder, and that the account holder intended for the transaction to take place.
""The process will also look different depending on the payment type, with card-based payments requiring a different model than DDA-based [demand deposit account] payments,"" Press said. ""This becomes even more complex as you move around the world and try to incorporate the huge number of local and regional payment schemes.
""It's also likely that tokenized credentials and digital wallets will be critical to this process, according to Press.

Quantum computers are the next innovation in computing. While the foundation of computers is bits, the most basic unit of information, quantum computers use qubits, which can process data with more complexity and therefore solve much more complex calculations in a much more efficient manner.
According to Google's quantum team, quantum computers have the potential to help create more effective drug treatments and the ability to provide key insights that could be used to identify and develop new sources of clean energy.
One company that has benefited from the quantum trade is Rigetti Computing (RGTI -0.61%). In July, the company announced that its 36-qubit system had achieved 99.5% median two-qubit gate fidelity, which is a measure of accuracy. Rigetti also hopes to achieve the same accuracy with its 100-plus-qubit system before year's end -- more qubits means a more powerful system.
If you'd invested $1,500 last year
If quantum computers can be commercialized and do what researchers believe is possible, then the sector has the same kind of unlimited potential as AI. The AI trade likely opened investors' eyes, which is why some quantum stocks like Rigetti have been over 20-baggers in the past year.
As of this writing on September 16, if you'd invested $1,500 one year ago, you'd have a whopping $36,500 today! Returns over the past year have been phenomenal, but keep in mind that Rigetti is still losing money, generates very little revenue, and now trades at a nearly $6.5 billion market cap anyway. Investors should understand that Rigetti is a very risky investment. The commercialization of quantum computing could still be far away, and it's hard to know just how advanced these machines will actually be.",321,trafilatura,,False

company,1758280020,2 Bargain Stocks For Investors on a Budget,136818107,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,GOOGL,Yahoo,There's more to a bargain stock than just a low price.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=efb73694d04ec15d7be7dc6411783679a9d01709adf965886dacec6b2a9abf80,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-bargain-stocks-for-investors-on-a-budget/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-bargain-stocks-for-investors-on-a-budget/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-bargain-stocks-for-investors-on-a-budget/,200.0,"$8,000.
That's what the typical American has in the bank, according to the Federal Reserve. Most people need to use the money in their bank accounts to cover everyday expenses. However, some people, particularly those with more than $8,000 in the bank, may be able to invest a portion of their savings as a way to grow their money.
Let's examine two stocks that investors on a budget may want to consider.
AT&T
First, there's AT&T (T -0.21%).
The telecommunications giant fits the bill as a bargain stock for several reasons. Let's start with the most obvious: Its stock recently cost less than $30 -- meaning most investors can afford to own a decent number of AT&T shares.
However, it's not just AT&T's low stock price that makes it appealing for investors looking for a bargain. There's also the fact that AT&T's valuation is affordable. AT&T's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares its stock price to its earnings per share, is around 17x.
In comparison, the S&P 500 market index has a P/E ratio of about 30x. Moreover, many high-flying tech stocks sport P/E ratios north of 100x. Media-streaming veteran Spotify, for example, has a P/E ratio of 164x, as of this writing.
Finally, AT&T is a bargain buy for another reason: Its business model is solid, if not all that exciting. The company has refocused its efforts on delivering wireless and fiber service. It divested its media assets, spun off its WarnerMedia holdings, and sold its stake in DirecTV.
As a result, the company is better positioned to pay down debt -- it still has more than $141 billion in net debt on its balance sheet -- and return value to shareholders through dividend payments. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.2775, which works out to an annual dividend amount of $1.11 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 3.75%.
AT&T offers a solid value, making it a name that investors on a budget should consider.
Alphabet
Next, there's Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) (GOOGL -0.15%).
At first blush, Alphabet might seem like a strange stock for bargain-seeking investors to consider. After all, shares of Alphabet recently were trading at around $249 each.
However, bargains aren't only found in low-priced stocks. Indeed, with the widespread availability of fractional share trading, the market price of a stock no longer matters the way it did in the past.
What makes Alphabet a stock for bargain-seeking investors is its wonderful mix of business segments. Alphabet is no one-trick pony.
Let's start with its most profitable and best-known operation: Google Search. The company's search business is its crown jewel. It generates more than $200 billion in annual revenue. What's more, this online behemoth is still growing like a weed. Search revenue increased 12% year over year in the recent second-quarter report, despite concerns that ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatbots would eat away at Google's search engine dominance.
In addition to its powerful search segment, Alphabet has other powerful divisions. Its Google Cloud segment, the third-largest player in the red-hot field of cloud services, racked up $13.6 billion in revenue last quarter (the three months ended June 30, 2025). That's a year-over-year growth rate of 32%. The company also recorded more than $17 billion in quarterly ad revenue from its YouTube division and its Google network (Gmail, etc.).
All in all, Alphabet's mix of business segments and solid growth make it a stock that investors on a budget should strongly consider.",576,trafilatura,,False

Here's What It Means for Investors,136797523,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,GOOGL,Yahoo,"Alphabet is embracing generative AI, even if it means Google Search may no longer be as dominant as it once was.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8f3d68c3f99259075f33fa32f3192dc8bf0d8dc2072474d2f6c1ae274aac354d,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/alphabet-walt-disney-big-tech-buy-stocks/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/alphabet-walt-disney-big-tech-buy-stocks/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/alphabet-walt-disney-big-tech-buy-stocks/,200.0,"Alphabet (GOOG -0.32%) (GOOGL -0.34%) has been one of the most fascinating megacap growth stocks this year. In June, it was badly underperforming the S&P 500 and many of its peers. But the stock has rallied nearly 50% since that point, and is up over 18% in the last month -- closing in on $3 trillion in market cap.
Alphabet's rally showcases the power of changes in investor sentiment. The investment thesis didn't change; rather, the perception of Alphabet's role in the age of artificial intelligence (AI) shifted from negative to positive.
Here's why Alphabet's bold push into AI is somewhat similar to what Walt Disney (DIS -0.06%) is doing in the entertainment industry, and what that means for investors interested in either stock.
Out with the old, in with the new
One of the hardest adjustments a company must make is realizing that a former cash cow simply isn't what it used to be. Businesses evolve and industries change. Companies that pivot can use their financial muscle to make inroads in new markets; others that are slow to adjust may see their seemingly impenetrable moats vanish.
Walt Disney's history is riddled with change. The company began as an innovator -- releasing the first feature-length animated film, Snow White, in 1937. It was a huge gamble, but it paid off. Other risks included opening Disneyland in 1955 and Walt Disney World in 1971; providing DVDs for home entertainment in the late 1990s; and acquiring Pixar in 2006, Marvel Entertainment in 2009, and Lucasfilm in 2012. Those gambles paid off.
But Disney's last decade hasn't gone as well -- the stock is up just 11% over the past decade, compared to a 236% return for the S&P 500. Its acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox in 2019 was costly and leveraged its balance sheet. Then came the pandemic in 2020, which disrupted the parks and movie business.
The company released Disney+ in 2019, which got off to a great start but took a while to become profitable. Today, Disney+ is performing much better, but Disney's traditional cable business (linear networks) is suffering major declines. However, the parks business is booming, and so is Disney's growing cruise fleet.
The history of Disney is chock-full of moments where it realized it couldn't rely on what was working and focused instead on what would work in the future. The company is cannibalizing its linear networks business because it realizes that streaming is here to stay.
That's even more true lately with its launch of an ESPN streaming app, which will unlock revenue but also further erode its cable business. Disney is investing heavily in what's working, such as doubling its earlier forecast for its experiences segment to $60 billion in capital expenditures over the next decade.
So while Disney isn't a pure-play, high-margin cash-cow streaming giant like Netflix, it's far more innovative and diversified than other traditional media companies such as Comcast. In this vein, Disney shares many similarities with Alphabet.
Alphabet has become a leader in AI
In an age when technology changes quickly, it's amazing to look back at the resiliency of Google Search, which has held a virtual monopoly on internet search for at least the last 15 years. Now, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are transforming the way people search for and interact with information.
Alphabet has a lot of moving parts, from Google Search to YouTube, Google Cloud, Google One, Android, Google Pixel, Google Play, and ""other bets"" like Waymo and Google Fiber. But despite the diversification, there's no denying that the company still depends heavily on Google Search -- this segment provided a staggering 56% of revenue in Alphabet's latest quarter. It's like how Disney used to heavily depend on blockbuster animated and live-action films before its parks business and linear networks took off.
Alphabet isn't looking at generative AI as a passing fad, it's embracing it. Gemini, powered by the research lab Google DeepMind, has become one of the most advanced multimodal generative AI models. That means it can process text, audio, images, video, and code. Google has embedded Gemini into its regular search function, offering ""AI Overviews"" for Google Search, which provide a summarized answer to a query rather than requiring the user to rely on webpage-based answers.
The Gemini app takes it a step further by allowing users to engage with information in a completely different way; it includes a basic free version (Gemini 2.0 Flash), more advanced versions, and even AI tools for businesses. Adoption of the app is surging, and there are even reports that Gemini could power the next version of Apple's Siri.
Gemini may be Alphabet's most innovative breakthrough in years, but it remains to be seen whether Alphabet can monetize it as effectively as Google Search, which relies heavily on ads. Google could offer native ads for Gemini in the future, which could be a clever way to use an existing business model for a new platform. But unlike Google Search, which is free, Gemini has far better pathways toward subscription revenue from users and enterprises.
There's a similar transition for Disney in the streaming space. Disney realizes that having its complete library of intellectual property available for a low monthly fee is cannibalizing its at-home entertainment and linear networks. But building a powerhouse streaming segment is the right long-term move, even if it takes time to pay off.
Two balanced buys for long-term investors
Disney and Alphabet are legacy companies that are both doing a good job of embracing change rather than resisting it. That's a quality that investors seeking a balance of growth and value are likely to appreciate.
Alphabet isn't as cheap as it used to be, but it's still the least expensive of the ""Ten Titans"" stocks. Despite a major slowdown in many consumer discretionary companies, Disney has held up well and is growing earnings; the stock is a great value at under 20 times forward earnings.
All told, Disney and Alphabet stand out as balanced buys for long-term investors, especially those looking for companies that aren't just betting on one theme or idea to pay off.",1024,trafilatura,,False
company,1758190500,Does Alphabet's New Blockchain Bet Spell Doom for XRP?,136797525,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,GOOGL,Yahoo,"If all goes right for Alphabet's new blockchain, it could eventually eat XRP's lunch.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8633a11c09715ab03bcf190637d56924c5f9e4f76bae1eb962b1b4eefccc1123,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/does-alphabets-new-blockchain-bet-spell-doom-for-x/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/does-alphabets-new-blockchain-bet-spell-doom-for-x/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/does-alphabets-new-blockchain-bet-spell-doom-for-x/,200.0,"Alphabet's (GOOGL -0.15%) (GOOG -0.32%) Google Cloud unit just announced that it's in the process of developing the Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL), a new Layer-1 (L1) blockchain intended for financial institutions. Pilot programs have begun with capital markets players, and broader trials are slated ahead of its planned 2026 launch.
Given the niche being targeted by Google with the GCUL, the immediate question is whether holders of XRP (XRP -1.26%) should worry. Let's take a closer look at what the plans are and how they compare to what Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL) is trying to do.
What Google's going to launch
GCUL's stated mission is to be institutional-grade financial plumbing for tokenized assets and transaction settlement, with interoperability for various legacy systems and smart contract support in the Python programming language. That ambition immediately suggests that it will be a direct competitor to XRP, but there's still a long journey from today to the new chain having durable liquidity and functioning features that the target market wants.
Historically, Google Cloud's crypto work has been infrastructure and tooling for other chains, such as its managed Blockchain Node Engine. That's very different from operating a blockchain and corralling users to develop on it, but it indicates that there is a base of experience in the sector to build on rather than starting from a blank slate. In other words, GCUL aims to move Google from being a niche crypto vendor to a mainstream blockchain provider.
Whereas Google Cloud already serves financial institutions with computing, enterprise storage, and regulatory compliance frameworks, it is not itself a regulated financial services provider. At this juncture, it's unclear whether it will seek that designation. Institutions will thus, at least for now, still need their usual roster of custodians, banks, and other services to make GCUL production-grade.
It's also not yet known if the GCUL will launch with a native token. If it does, that token will likely be used to pay the equivalent of the chain's gas (user) fees, and it will also likely sap capital from elsewhere in the crypto sector. But it's also entirely possible that Google will opt to make fees payable in stablecoins, which would abrogate the need for a native token. Taking such a route would additionally make the chain look more like a professional piece of financial infrastructure rather than a platform for speculation, so with all things considered, it's fairly probable that investors won't be able to invest in the GCUL directly.
One potential issue is that Alphabet's sketchy reputation for sunsetting products could chill mission-critical adoption at the margin. Simply put, many users and developers feel that Alphabet has a long-standing habit of launching ambitious new services only to abandon them a couple of years later after a sub-maximal effort to make them succeed. Financial institutions do not want to have to switch over key pieces of their infrastructure because their provider got bored.
None of this means GCUL will fail. It means investors should calibrate their expectations about its competitive impact. New venues can take years to earn trust and scale.
XRP's moat isn't going anywhere
As things stand today, the GCUL is not an existential threat to XRP, though it could slow its growth somewhat.
XRP's investment thesis has always hinged on being useful plumbing for cross-border money transfers, payments, and managing tokenized assets with institution-friendly compliance controls. And Ripple is currently seeking a national bank charter in the U.S., which could give it key legal capabilities to expand and market the XRPL as a platform -- so it's ahead of the game relative to GCUL on that front. That matters because it lowers the integration friction for banks, brokers, and asset issuers that have specific reporting requirements.
Could GCUL contest XRP's market share as the value of the payments, transfers, and asset tokenization markets grow? Yes, especially if Google pairs the ledger with incentives, seamless on-ramps for its cloud customers, and interoperability that reduces switching costs. Even if its experience in fintech is minimal, and even if app developers have many quibbles about its product strategy, the Google brand is globally known, far more so than XRP and Ripple combined.
In practice, incumbents often keep winning while newcomers try to find their footing, even when they're backed with vast resources. XRP is positioned to keep courting asset issuers that want tight, protocol-level controls and cheap, fast transaction settlement. It also has a highly committed investor base, and a clear roadmap for how to develop its financial infrastructure value chain further to capture more value over time.
In contrast, GCUL must first prove staying power, recruit and retain real capital, and survive procurement committees that remember Google's limited patience with non-core products. Until those boxes are checked, XRP's long-run thesis is intact, and near-term disruption from a new competitor preparing to enter the scene looks to be limited.",813,trafilatura,,False

The momentum began last December, when Alphabet unveiled its Willow quantum chip, which it said could do a calculation in less than five minutes that would have taken a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years. This year, quantum computing stocks have moved higher, as the technology has been endorsed by the likes of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and some pure-play quantum computing stocks seem to be delivering real progress, and as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has primed demand for the next big technology breakthrough.
Of the four pure-play quantum computing stocks, Quantum Computing (QUBT -3.07%) is the smallest. In the second quarter, revenue came in at $61,000, which was down from $183,000 in the second quarter a year ago. Quantum Computing differentiates itself from other quantum companies by using integrated photonics and quantum optics to create machines for quantum computing and related applications.
Quantum Computing now has a market cap of $2.7 billion, but as you can see from its revenue, that valuation is based almost entirely on hopes for the future, even though it's likely to take years for the company to deliver material revenue. At that valuation, some smaller stocks are better bets than Quantum Computing. Let's take a look at two that look primed to outperform Quantum Computing over the next three years.
1. Sweetgreen
Sweetgreen (SG 0.13%) might be a restaurant chain, but the fast-casual salad-focused operator is also making its own effort to tap into technology through its Infinite Kitchen. The Infinite Kitchen is an automated system that preps, measures, and dispenses ingredients for its salad bowls, and the company is rolling them out to new locations and retrofitting existing ones to include them.
Sweetgreen also looks like a good buy right now because the stock has plunged this year on what seems to be primarily short-term challenges. Comparable sales have fallen through the first half of the year due to difficult comparisons, a change in its loyalty program, and broader headwinds on discretionary spending.
However, Sweetgreen still has a long runway ahead of it, as the company only has about 250 locations currently and aims to open more than 1,000 over time. Sweetgreen's restaurants are also popular, as it has an average unit volume, or average sales per restaurant, of $2.8 million, which is close to what Chipotle restaurants, the industry standard-bearer, bring in.
Currently, Sweetgreen is valued at a market cap of just $1 billion, and the stock is trading down 74% this year. If it can recoup just part of those losses over the next three years, the company will top Quantum Computing's current market cap of $2.7 billion.
2. Innodata
Investors have been hungry for AI stocks, but small-cap AI opportunities are hard to find. Innodata (INOD 4.21%) is one of the rare ones. The company provides data labeling services, helping companies organize their AI data and best deploy it, making it a competitor of Scale AI, a start-up that was valued at $29 billion in a deal with Meta Platforms. That shows the market for data labeling is substantial.
Innodata currently has a market cap of $2 billion and is growing quickly. Revenue in the second quarter was up 79% year over year to $58.4 million, and it's profitable, with a net income of $7.2 million, up from breakeven in the quarter a year ago.
Innodata stock has broken out in the last few weeks, a sign that investors may be starting to recognize the opportunity in this investment. From its current market cap of $2 billion, topping Quantum Computing in the next few years looks achievable.",620,trafilatura,,False

The move signals a tactical shift by Beijing, redirecting regulatory focus to Nvidia as leverage in the U.S.-China trade talks and sending a message of flexibility to Washington by ending the probe into Google, the newspaper said.
China's State Administration for Market Regulation, which opened the investigation against Google in February, has now decided to drop it, the report said citing two people briefed on the decision.
Google declined to comment to the FT. The company, China's State Administration for Market Regulation and China's State Council did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The regulator had earlier said that Google was suspected of violating the country's anti-monopoly law, without providing further details on the investigation or on what it alleged Google had done to breach the law.
Google has not been formally notified of the decision to drop the probe, the FT report said.
Earlier this week, China accused Nvidia of violating its anti-monopoly law, following a preliminary investigation into the California-based firm's business practices.
The two countries have traded barbs over the past six months since U.S. President Donald Trump hit China with massive tariffs, before lowering them to 30%, and threatened to shut down popular social media app TikTok.
China responded with 10% tariffs and antitrust probes against the likes of Alphabet's Google, signalling more regulatory scrutiny on U.S. firms.

Analysts from McKinsey & Company are projecting that quantum applications could unlock trillions in economic value in the long run.
Naturally, investors are curious: Which of today's AI titans are positioning themselves to lead the quantum era? In my eyes, two companies stick out as particularly well positioned to dominate the next wave of the AI narrative.
Nvidia: Building the hardware + software quantum stack
It wasn't long ago that Nvidia (NVDA 1.68%) was perceived as a niche hardware designer that primarily catered to online gamers. That narrow view dramatically underestimated the foresight of Nvidia's visionary CEO, Jensen Huang. Nearly two decades ago, Huang recognized that GPUs had the potential to impact industries far beyond gaming.
Today, these same chipsets serve as the foundation for deploying generative AI models like ChatGPT. But what truly sets Nvidia apart from the competition is its comprehensive ecosystem that extends beyond hardware expertise.
At the core is CUDA, Nvidia's software architecture that layers on top of its GPUs. This end-to-end integration has helped Nvidia build a powerful lock-in effect with developers -- essentially turning the company into a full-spectrum backbone for building AI systems.
While these dynamics have helped Nvidia form a technological moat, the company is quietly working to extend its dominance even further. CUDA is now becoming a bridge connecting conventional (classical) GPU programming with quantum workloads, helping position Nvidia at the center of emerging frontiers in the AI landscape.
The combination of hardware and software stack has helped Nvidia create a platform with durable competitive advantages. This flywheel effect not only reinforces its leadership in the AI industry but also positions the company to benefit from new tailwinds such as quantum computing.
Alphabet: Purpose-built for the quantum era
When most investors think of Alphabet, their minds go straight to Google search or YouTube. Advertising still fuels the majority of Alphabet's cash flow, but beneath the surface, the company has quietly built one of the most advanced AI ecosystems on the market. And a particularly important -- albeit overlooked -- pillar of that strategy is quantum computing.
On the hardware side, Alphabet developed a quantum processor called Willow. In benchmark tests, Willow solved an equation in minutes that would take today's most powerful supercomputers an estimated 10 septillion years to complete.
On the research side, one of Alphabet's lesser-known subsidiaries is a research lab called DeepMind. The advantage of DeepMind is that Alphabet can quickly and constantly test and refine new chip architectures and AI applications -- making them readily available for the company's enterprise and consumer product suites.
Lastly, on the infrastructure side are Alphabet's tensor processing units (TPUs) and its open-source software framework, Cirq. This combination has the potential to usher in a new wave of AI workloads into Alphabet's budding cloud computing network, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In the long run, this could prove to be an interesting differentiator for GCP over larger incumbents like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The key takeaway is that Alphabet's ambitions in quantum computing are far from a theoretical exercise. By deliberately building a vertically integrated stack across chips, research, software, and infrastructure, Alphabet underscores its AI-first identity well beyond search and advertising.
This breadth not only augments the core business, but more importantly, it provides some needed optionality -- ultimately ensuring that Alphabet remains nimble and adaptive in a fast-changing technology landscape.",642,trafilatura,,False

Groq, founded by a former Alphabet engineer, is among a long list of new chip players looking to capitalize on hundreds of millions of dollars in investments on AI infrastructure.
Its last funding round was in August last year, when it raised $640 million that brought its valuation to $2.8 billion.
The round announced on Wednesday was led by Disruptive, with significant investments from Blackrock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners and a large U.S.-based West Coast mutual fund manager, Groq said.
Disruptive, a Dallas-based growth investment firm that has backed companies such as Palantir and Spotify, has invested nearly $350 million in Groq, the startup said.
The round also included Samsung, Cisco, D1, Altimeter, 1789 Capital and Infinitum.
Groq is known for producing AI inference chips that optimize pre-trained models.
The industry is increasingly shifting focus to hardware designed for inference, from the training-centric chips that characterized the early period of AI development.
Leading AI chipmaker Nvidia, as well as smaller rival AMD, are both gearing up to offer more inference focused chips.
""Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost,"" Jonathan Ross, Groq founder and CEO, said.
Groq also secured a $1.5 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia in February to expand the delivery of its advanced AI chips to the country.
The startup has told investors that the contracts in Saudi Arabia will help bring in about $500 million in revenue this year, according to earlier media reports.

- The Oracle cofounder's net worth exceeds Bank of America's $385 billion market value.
- Ellison's fortune has grown thanks to Oracle stock jumping 97% this year on AI optimism.
Larry Ellison is about twice as rich now than at the start of the year, and is personally worth more than Bank of America.
The Oracle cofounder's fortune grew by an unmatched $195 billion in 2025, reaching $388 billion at Monday's close, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
That figure exceeds the $385 billion market value of Bank of America, which generated over $100 billion of revenue and $27 billion of net income last year, and ranks among the world's 30 most valuable public companies.
Ellison, Oracle's chairman and tech chief, is the world's second-wealthiest person after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who's worth $452 billion.
Ellison is more than $100 billion richer than Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos, who rank third and fourth on the rich list with fortunes of $269 billion and $250 billion, respectively.
Ellison owns about 41% of Oracle's stock, which has soared 97% this year to record highs. Investors expect Oracle to play a critical role in building the infrastructure needed to power the AI boom.
Oracle's contract backlog grew by over 350% year on year last quarter to $455 billion, as it struck huge deals with AI giants such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI.
CEO Safra Catz projected the company's cloud infrastructure revenue would rise 14-fold from around $10 billion last financial year to $144 billion in the year ending May 2030 — a sum that's about 2.5 times Oracle's total revenue of $57 billion last financial year.
Ellison's net worth has roughly quintupled within the past three years, as Oracle's shares have climbed from under $70 to $328 at Monday's close.
The billionaire, who lives on a Hawaiian island, also bought about 1.6% of Tesla before joining the board of Musk's EV maker in December 2018. The holding is worth over $20 billion today if he still has it.

- Uber Freight and Tesla have joined forces to introduce a Dedicated EV Fleet Accelerator Program that offers subsidies for fleets to buy Tesla Semi electric trucks, according to a Sept. 16 press release.
- Participating carriers are required to enter into a contract with Uber Freight where they “must dedicate their Tesla Semis and associated drivers exclusively to Uber Freight for the length of the contract,” according to the brokerage firm's frequently asked questions.
- The program aims to address the price gap that exists between electric trucks and traditional diesel trucks.
Dive Insight:
Before embarking on the buyers program with Tesla, Uber Freight worked with a group of carriers to pilot the Dedicated EV Fleet Accelerator Program.
The two-month pilot program covered over 394 hours of drive time and 12,377 miles.
“With an average net energy consumption of just 1.72 kWh per mile and only 60 hours of total charge time, these results highlight the operational viability of Tesla Semis on demanding freight lanes,” per the release.
There are still gaps left to make widespread adoption of EVs for freight possible, such as significantly increasing the amount of charging infrastructure.
With the buyers program, fleets are advised to operate within routes supported by Tesla’s public charging network. “Operations are permitted outside of Tesla’s public charging network but finding options to charge may be difficult,” per the company’s website.
Uber Freight has also taken action to address the logistical complexities associated with EV freight transportation. In 2023, it announced its first electric truck pilot with WattEV and CHEP. Under the agreement, WattEV provided its trucks to Uber Freight shippers, beginning with CHEP, and trucks charged using WattEV’s infrastructure.
During the same year, the broker announced a collaboration with Greenlane to accelerate the development and installation of public charging infrastructure for heavy duty battery electric vehicles. Uber Freight was tasked to augment Greenlane’s data to determine corridors that are prime candidates for early HD BEV deployment.

company,1758625200,Better EV Stock: Rivian vs. Tesla,136850261,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,TSLA,Yahoo,"As Tesla stumbles, Rivian is expanding its lineup and improving its manufacturing efficiencies.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f9b6556837625f0a03915e710c6bac460c2c5ffaad7e03f7d212ebe0a84036bd,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/better-ev-stock-rivian-vs-tesla/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/better-ev-stock-rivian-vs-tesla/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/better-ev-stock-rivian-vs-tesla/,200.0,"The electric vehicle (EV) market is facing an uphill battle right now with rising costs across the industry, growing concerns about the economy, and the loss of federal EV tax credits.
That has put both Rivian Automotive (RIVN -0.53%) and Tesla (TSLA 0.02%) in a tough spot, but one company appears to be on a better track than the other at the moment. Here's what investors need to know.
Rivian's potential is coming into view
Rivian proved its potential earlier this year with two straight quarters of gross profit, meeting a goal management had set. The company slipped back to a loss recently as tariff costs weighed on results, but investors still got a glimpse of how Rivian can achieve its financial targets while keeping profitability in focus.
What's more, Rivian is on the verge of launching new vehicles that should appeal to a wider customer base. The company's smaller SUV, the R2, is slated to go on sale in early 2026 at a price tag of around $45,000. That's far cheaper than its cheapest models and significantly lower than the average EV price of about $57,000. The R2 will be the first of a handful of cheaper vehicles in Rivian's pipeline, with a smaller R3 and R3X also eventually on the way, with an estimated starting price of about $37,000.
Investors will have to wait to see how customers respond to Rivian's new vehicles, but they're certainly a step in the right direction for expanding Rivian's customer base and spreading the cost of production across multiple vehicles. Production efficiency has been a goal of the company lately, with Rivian reengineering portions of its manufacturing process last year -- saving 35% in material costs.
Another check mark in the pro column for Rivian is the fact that it's building strong partnerships and developing solid sources of funding. The most recent is a partnership with Volkswagen, in which Rivian supplies some of its technology to the automaker in return for $2 billion in funding. Rivian could receive up to $5.8 billion if the company continues meeting agreed-upon goals.
Tesla has a rough road ahead
Tesla was once a dominant force in the EV industry, but its fortunes have taken a turn as of late. For one, the company's operating income plunged 42% in the most recent quarter to $923 million, and its free cash flow fell 89% to just $146 million. Tesla said the decline came, in part, because of dwindling regulatory credit sales, lower vehicle deliveries, and higher operating expenses.
Tesla's net income tumbled 16% in the quarter to $1.1 billion, and operating margin fell to 4.1%, down from 6.2% in the year-ago quarter. Rising competition, higher costs, and a bruised brand thanks to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement are all putting pressure on the company.
Some investors are hopeful for a turnaround. Tesla's stock recently got a bump after Musk purchased $1 billion worth of shares. The purchase was likely a way for Musk to signal to Tesla's board that he's committed to the company as he seeks a pay package that's worth up to an eye-popping $975 billion, if certain goals are met.
But Tesla faces serious challenges. Declining profits and shrinking cash reserves limit its ability to reinvest just as Musk is pushing the company to expand into new growth areas, including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Without the profits and cash to do so, it's a big question whether the company will be able to pivot to these new industries -- or even if it should.
Rivian is the better EV stock, but success isn't guaranteed
I'm optimistic about Rivian because I think the company is building a strong EV lineup, and I've been impressed with how management has adapted to an increasingly difficult EV environment.
While Rivian's success is nowhere near guaranteed -- especially given the difficult EV environment -- I think it's the better EV stock right now. Tesla's falling profits and shrinking cash availability put it in a tough spot as it tries to transition to robotics and AVs. Investors will still need to be patient with Rivian, though, as the company navigates a challenging period for the EV industry.",697,trafilatura,,False

Its EV sales have declined, as have its profit margins and its share of a market it almost single-handedly established. The company also arguably misstepped by focusing on releasing a higher-priced refreshed model Y when the market appears to be moving toward more budget-friendly options. Still, Tesla remains the best-positioned company in the EV automaker landscape.
Two reasons why Tesla is the pick of the EV sector
There are two key differences between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV markets. First, the former is characterized by a relatively low upfront cost/high maintenance and fuel costs, while the EV market is the opposite, with high upfront cost/low maintenance & fuel costs. Therefore, reducing the upfront cost of an EV has a higher impact on its economic value than the same reduction on an ICE vehicle.
The second is that traditionally, automakers sold cars and struggled to generate significant after-sales revenue. In comparison, recurring revenue is a vital component of Tesla's business strategy.
Tesla can win out
Lowering costs in EV production requires building scale, which in turn lowers the price of vehicles and increases sales volumes. While Tesla's sales have declined this year, it remains the dominant market player, and the introduction of lower-cost models, starting later this year, is likely to boost its sales growth in 2026.
As for after-sales revenue, the company has a huge opportunity to generate a recurring stream of income through selling full self-driving (FSD) subscriptions. This is likely to increase markedly if and when Tesla releases unsupervised FSD, not least because it can be used to transform Teslas into robotaxis. On top of that, Tesla's robotaxi concept in general (including dedicated Cybercab vehicles) offers a massive opportunity to generate revenue sharing from robotaxi rides.",299,trafilatura,,False

That discount is due to the company's lackluster growth rates in recent quarters. But looking ahead to 2026, Rivian's growth rates should skyrocket. And there's one major reason for this impending growth spurt.
Why does Rivian trade at a discount to Lucid Group and Tesla?
According to many valuation metrics, Rivian trades at a sizable discount to other electric vehicle (EV) makers like Tesla and Lucid. Rivian, for example, trades at a price-to-sales ratio of around 3. Lucid shares, meanwhile, trade at around 7 times sales, with Tesla stock trading at an astounding 15 times sales.
Why does Rivian trade at such a steep discount? There are two primary reasons.
First, Rivian's historical and projected growth rates leave a lot to be desired. Since 2025 began, Rivian has grown revenues by just 3%. Lucid, meanwhile, has grown sales by around 15%. Looking ahead, Rivian is expected to grow sales by just 6% this fiscal year. Lucid, meanwhile, is projected to grow sales by around 61% this fiscal year.
Based on these growth statistics, it seems reasonable for Rivian to trade at a discount to Lucid. But here's where things get a little weird. Since 2025, Tesla has actually seen its sales decline by 5.1%. This fiscal year, Tesla is expected to experience a total sales decline of around 4.9%. Why then are Tesla shares trading at such a premium?
This brings us to the second reason why Rivian trades at a discount to competitors like Lucid and Tesla. The company doesn't have a clear path toward competing in the global autonomous robotaxi market. Experts like Cathie Wood believe the global robotaxi market could eventually be worth $10 trillion. Tesla has a clear path toward participating through its robotaxi division, which launched in Austin, Texas earlier this year. Lucid, meanwhile, recently partnered with Uber Technologies to supply its robotaxi division.
What about Rivian? So far, we haven't heard much about the company's aspirations in this category, potentially leading the market to undervalue the stock. But I predict that Rivian's growth rates should pick up aggressively next year regardless of the company's current lackluster growth rates or its inability to get involved in the robotaxi hype over the short term.
Rivian should see sales explode higher in 2026 and 2027
One of the biggest challenges for an EV maker is getting affordable models to market. And by affordable, we're talking about a starting price of under $50,000. Nearly 70% of all U.S. car buyers are looking for a vehicle under this price threshold for their next purchase. Lucid doesn't currently have any models priced under $50,000, severely limiting its growth potential. Tesla, meanwhile, has only two affordable models: the Model 3 and Model Y. Amazingly, these two models account for more than 90% of its total vehicle sales!
As Tesla has proven, getting affordable models to market is critical for achieving mass scale. Lucid is still a couple of years away from this milestone. But Rivian should get its first affordable model to market by early 2026, with two additional affordable models to follow. This has the potential to transform the business. Again, more than 90% of Tesla's sales comes from its two affordable models, and Rivian expects to launch three over the next 18 months.

While shares have soared recently due to founder and CEO Elon Musk's $1 billion stock purchase, this remains a very polarizing business. There are valid arguments coming from both bulls and bears as to Tesla's merits as an investment.
Is this top electric vehicle (EV) stock a buy, sell, or hold right now?
Concerns around valuation
In the past decade, Tesla shares have climbed 2,300% (as of Sept. 18). This phenomenal gain is a direct result of the company's success disrupting the global auto industry with its innovative and tech-forward EV fleet. Sales have trended higher over time, and the brand is now widely recognized.
However, the stock has overreached. Investors who wish to buy the stock must pay a hefty price tag with shares boasting a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in nosebleed territory at 246. This valuation is a convincing enough reason alone for many Tesla shareholders to sell out of their position -- such a high valuation introduces a major headwind to achieving solid future returns.
Tesla's (possible) future
To make matters worse, Tesla's automotive revenue declined 16% year over year in the second quarter, and its operating income tanked 42%. A growing backlash against Musk's public profile and increased competition have led to struggles for the EV segment.
That said, many investors believe that Tesla will look totally different five or 10 years down the road. They're betting that the company's newly launched Robotaxi business and other technologies like humanoid robots could eventually lead Tesla to higher sales and earnings. The success of those ventures is anything but certain, however, despite how much they may be propping up the current valuation.
For much of Tesla's existence as a publicly-traded company, the stock has been highly speculative, and that remains the case now -- the risk-reward profile simply doesn't make sense at these levels.",316,trafilatura,,False

As the race to develop artificial intelligence that rivals human cognition heats up across China, Europe and the U.S., a similar competition is unfolding in the electric vehicle industry.
Automakers like Tesla, BYD and Volkswagen are competing for consumers in the growing global transportation market with features like double-laminated glass, sustainable materials, tray tables and a frunk — a front trunk.
Each region brings its own approach. China's top EV models blend affordability with tech, European EVs blend sustainability and refinement, and the U.S. emphasizes performance and luxury at scale.
Chinese EV standouts
While not available for purchase in the U.S. due to trade restrictions, Chinese electric automakers emphasize the latest technology while maintaining affordability.
BYD Dolphin
The electric hatchback prioritizes affordability, with the European market price starting at €22,900, or $26,701, for the 200-mile range batteries. The cost is €26,207, or $29,138, for vehicles with 315-mile range.
The EV’s design mimics “ocean aesthetics,"" with front and rear lights inspired by dolphins breaching, according to the company website.
Inside, the Dolphin offers a floating center console, a large center display with integrated voice command and four colors with corresponding interiors.
The EV can reach 100km/h, or 62.14 mph, in seven seconds.
Xiaomi YU7
Launching in June, the Xiaomi YU7 is a high-performance luxury SUV that emphasizes advanced design, technology, driving experience and safety.
It comes in three versions:
- Standard, ¥253,500 or $35,447
- Pro, ¥279,900 or $39,138
- Max, ¥329,900 or $46,130
The YU7 boasts “industry-leading airtightness” to reduce outside noise. The Max version adds double-laminated glass to cut wind and other noise by two to three decibels.
All vehicles are equipped with a Xiaomi HyperEngine V6 Plus. The Max version reaches 253 km/h, or 157.21 mph, per hour and accelerates to 100km/h in 3.23 seconds.
Notable European EVs
While some European models like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV are produced and sold in the U.S., these models are only sold overseas:
BMW iX1 eDrive20
Unlike its gas-powered counterpart, the X1, the iX1 eDrive20 is not available in the U.S., and BMW has no plans for a North American rollout.
Though EU law prohibits fixed pricing, the recommended retail price during its launch was €47,900, or $55,756.
Additionally, the iX1 can accelerate from zero to 100 km/h in 8.6 seconds and its top speed is electronically capped to 170km/h, or 105 mph.
On the interior of the vehicle, the model offers a navigational system, two-zone automatic air conditioning, a parking assistant, a back-up camera and an upgraded curved screen.
Škoda Elroq
Fashioned by its chrome-accented bumper logo, Škoda, Volkswagen’s Czech subsidiary, offers a modern driving experience serving Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its award-winning SUV, the Elroq, features fast-charging technology, enabling drivers to recharge from 10% to 80% of its battery in 28 minutes.
Available models include:
- SE L: £33,560, or $45,201
- Edition: £34,460, or $46,413
- SportLine: £37,410, or $50,387
- RS: £46,560, or $62,711
Not only does Škoda eliminate carbon emissions, the company also incorporates sustainable materials into its interior. In 5.4 seconds, the RS model can reach 100 km/hr.
The RS model accelerates to 100km/h in 5.4 seconds. Škoda also incorporates sustainable materials into its interior.
US EV favorites
While EVs like the Cadillac Lyriq and the Ford Mustang Mach-E offer strong value and luxury, these two brands represent cutting-edge technology.
Tesla Model Y
A global EV staple, the Model Y held the top-selling E spot in 2023 and 2024, according to Edmunds.
The latest Model Y, announced in April, sports upgraded cabin quietness, battery range and speed.
- Road noise reduced by 22%
- Impact noise by 20%
- Wind noise by 20%
“This ride quietness is achieved not only through vehicle systems and engineering innovation, but also with the help of materials like acoustic glass incorporated throughout the vehicle,” the website stated.
Additionally, the new Model Y leverages a 5% higher-rated range than previous models but still operates with the same battery. The vehicle also sports a 4.1 second zero-to-60 mph time.
After the $7,500 federal tax incentive, the Model Y’s starting price is $37,490.
Lucid Gravity
A company with actor Timothée Chalamet as its brand ambassador emerged into the EV industry in recent months after it announced a partnership with Uber and Nuro to deploy more than 20,000 autonomous Gravity SUVs for the robotaxi space.
The Lucid Gravity, an SUV that boasts a range up to 450 miles per charge, can carry up to seven adults.

In fact, that hysteria is likely why the vehicle maker went public, so it could cash in on the hype around electric vehicles (EVs) at the time. When the excitement wore off, Rivian's share price plunged.
Is the story starting to, very slowly, change for the better again?
Wall Street likes a hot story
It wasn't too long ago that Wall Street believed that electric cars were going to change the world. Tesla, after a long period of building its business, had finally proven that making EVs could be a sustainably profitable business. And, importantly, that the traditional automakers had to start taking EVs seriously. The excitement around Tesla led the stock to rise dramatically.
Wall Street jumped into action, as it usually does in such situations. A slew of electric car companies rushed to go public, attempting to catch Tesla's ""lightning in a bottle."" Many of those companies were too early in their development to justify going public, but you have to strike while the iron's hot in finance if you want to collect the initial public offering (IPO) cash, and the lush investment banking fees that go along with that cash.
That may seem a bit cynical. The truth is probably a bit more complicated, since you could also argue that Wall Street was simply giving investors what they wanted. Regardless, a lot of electric car companies have flamed out, and there is still a material risk that more will do the same. And despite all of this investment drama, Rivian continues to make important progress as a business. So much so that its stock has risen materially off its post-bubble lows.
What's got investors interested in Rivian again?
As the chart above highlights, Rivian's stock is around 85% below its all-time high. But that's an improvement from the 91% nadir, hit in 2024. Since hitting that low, Rivian's shares have risen from $8.40 per share to their current value of around $14, an increase in value of roughly 66%! What's going on?
Simply put, Rivian is slowly building its business, at least partly thanks to the cash it raised when Wall Street was more enthusiastic about the idea that pure-play electric car makers would disrupt the businesses of the traditional automakers. To be fair, Rivian is dealing with far more competition than Tesla was when it broke into the auto industry. In fact, all of the major auto companies are now making their own EVs. But Rivian has continued to make important progress as a business.
For example, the company has twice generated a gross profit. That simply means that it generated enough revenue from selling cars to cover the cost of making those cars. There are other expenses further down the income statement, like research and development and SG&A costs, that will keep Rivian in the red for years to come. But a gross profit is an important first step.
It also counts large and important companies as partners. The list includes Amazon, which has long been a material customer, helping Rivian develop a delivery truck that Rivian now sells to other customers. And the other big one is traditional automaker Volkswagen, which continues to provide cash to Rivian as the upstart reaches new development milestones. The expectation is that Volkswagen will use Rivian technology in its vehicles, thus providing Rivian with another important customer.
Another vital step has been the company's ability to reach production scale. That was actually what allowed it to shift gears to focus on profitability as it fine-tuned its manufacturing efforts. It will use what it has learned to take the next big step, which should happen in 2026, of introducing a new lower-cost vehicle, the R2, for the mass market. That, not incidentally, is the same approach Tesla took, starting at the high end and then bringing out lower-priced vehicles.
Will Rivian make it?
When asking if Rivian is worth buying, the underlying question is really ""Will Rivian make it?"" The answer to that is uncertain, so only the most aggressive investors will probably want to look at Rivian today, even as the stock rises off its lows.
However, if you are an aggressive growth investor, it increasingly looks like Rivian may have what it takes to reach sustainable profitability. And if it does, the current low price could signal a good time to buy. That said, Rivian is still a developing business, so the ride could still be a little rough and, as noted, there's always the risk that Rivian falls short of its ultimate goal.",775,trafilatura,,False

The stock initially rocketed higher, but then sold off intensely, as poor performance in the EV business and the effect of tariffs hit the company hard.
But since April's lows, the stock has rebounded almost 90% and trades close to all-time highs made in late 2024. CEO Elon Musk seems to like what he's seeing and just purchased $1 billion of Tesla stock himself. Is now the time for investors to go all in?
Leaping hurdles from earlier this year
Following Trump's election win last November, Tesla's stock surged. There didn't seem to be any specific reason, other than Musk's ties to Trump and expectations for an easier regulatory landscape for Tesla. But as Musk's work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) proved to be controversial and his relationship with Trump soured, the ""Trump bump"" seemed to fade, especially as Tesla's core EV business struggled as well.
Tesla reported a disappointing 337,000 deliveries in the first quarter of the year, the lowest number in over two years, and second-quarter deliveries of 384,000 were still down 14% year over year. Competition seems to have caught up with Tesla in certain markets. Tariffs and the upcoming elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit also presented challenges for the business.
However, it didn't take investors long to look past the poor results in Tesla's core business. Instead, they chose to focus on the company's burgeoning robotaxi business and future humanoid robots. Tesla has done a soft launch of its robotaxi fleet in Austin and San Francisco, and is hoping to soon launch in Phoenix. It's hard to tell how far along the programs are. Media reports have suggested that most, if not all, of Tesla's robotaxis are geofenced with either remote human monitoring or actual safety monitors in vehicles during trips.
But investors are excited by the progress. They also believe that Tesla will be able to build its robotaxi fleet more cheaply than rivals like Waymo. Musk also said that he thinks Tesla could have over a million robotaxis on the road by the end of 2026. However, he's made big calls like this before, only to miss the timeline.
Additionally, Musk's recent purchase of $1 billion of stock -- which comes after Tesla's board of directors just proposed a nearly $1 trillion pay package to Musk over the next decade -- is a clear indicator to Wall Street analysts that the company is moving in the right direction.
""We are becoming more bullish,"" William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a recent research note. ""This purchase is Musk's first buy since 2020. To us, this sends a strong signal of confidence in the most important part of Tesla's future business, robotaxi.""
Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a recent note that he expects Tesla deliveries to come in at around 465,000 in the third quarter, above consensus estimates of 430,000 and flat year over year.
Should investors go all in?
If Tesla could report deliveries that were flat year over year, that would be a good indicator to the market that the company is shoring up problems it had in the first half of the year. Deliveries in Q1 were down nearly 50% year over year.
However, with the U.S. EV tax credit expiring on Sept. 30, EV makers may see a boost in sales due to people trying to take advantage of the savings before they're gone. So Q3 earnings could be a one-off.
Either way, I still find Tesla's stock to be far too expensive for my taste while it's trading at a forward earnings multiple of roughly 247. In my opinion, investors are baking in too much good news from robotaxis and humanoid robots too fast, making the risk-reward proposition less favorable.",650,trafilatura,,False

The electric vehicle (EV) maker sells premium cars, a growing suite of energy-storage products, and paid software for its vehicles, e.g., Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. The mix of hardware and software, combined with ongoing innovation, makes the story unusually dynamic -- and it's why quarterly updates carry extra weight.
Shares have rebounded from their lows this year, making the bull case now depend less on near-term delivery growth and more on whether Tesla can expand margins through software and energy while investing in autonomy and robotics. After all, these are the things that will really move the needle for Tesla over the long haul. So, that is the frame for the upcoming report: Numbers matter, but the destination matters more.
A rough patch
Financial results at Tesla this year have been disappointing. In its second quarter of 2025, total revenue was $22.5 billion, down 12% year over year. Automotive revenue fell 16% as deliveries slipped and average selling prices declined. Automotive gross margin was 17.2%, down from 18.5% a year ago, with the company citing lower prices and fewer regulatory credits as headwinds. Operating expenses also weighed on results as the company leaned into artificial intelligence (AI) and product road map development spending.
But Tesla's energy generation and storage business were a highlight, with segment gross margin of 30.3% in the quarter and 29.6% for the first half, driven by lower unit costs on Megapack and Powerwall even as average selling prices eased. Deployments totaled 9.6 gigawatt hours (GWh) in Q2, and Tesla says it deployed 20 GWh through the first half of 2025.
Helping the company work through this period of weak demand and high spending is Tesla's strong balance sheet. Through the first half of 2025, net cash from operating activities was $4.7 billion, while cash and cash equivalents stood at $15.6 billion and short-term investments at $21.2 billion as of June 30.
The bigger picture and valuation
Ultimately, though, Tesla stock isn't a story about numbers -- at least not right now. Management has been explicit about where the company is heading: heavier investment in AI, software, autonomous driving, and robotics. Investors will be looking for Tesla to present evidence and arguments that make them believe these aspirations will turn into major business drivers over time.
For now, Tesla's soaring energy business helps ease concerns, as it demonstrates how the company can introduce a new service or business and grow it into something massive. Storage margins in the 30% range are meaningful, and product cadence continues: Tesla introduced new Megapack 3 and Megablock systems in September, underscoring the push to serve utility and data-center demand. At the same time, quarterly energy deployments can be lumpy, so sustained margin quality and backlog detail will be important signals in the next update.
The bull case for Tesla stock, however, can't be entirely dependent on future plans. At roughly $426 per share as of this writing, the market is assigning a premium that assumes continued software monetization and progress on autonomy and robotics today. That premium may be warranted if Tesla shows rising software revenue recognition, firmer automotive margins, and continued energy strength. But if auto pricing pressure persists and software contribution remains modest, today's price could prove unforgiving, especially with shares trading at more than 250 times earnings as of this writing.
For long-term investors weighing a buy before earnings, patience may be the best choice. This doesn't mean the stock is likely to fall after the earnings report. There's no way to know what will happen. There's simply a lot of uncertainty, and the stock's valuation already prices in many of the company's long-term aspirations. More clarity is needed to justify buying the stock at this price.",647,trafilatura,,False

There are multiple levels to the size of this goal, and all of them point to the same outcome a year from now. That's why only the most aggressive investors should be looking at Lucid today.
Lucid is making progress
It would be easy to be negative about Lucid, but the fact is that the upstart electric car company is making important progress as a business. For example, it delivered 38% more vehicles in the second quarter of 2025 than it did a year earlier. It dramatically improved the bottom line of its income statement, as well. But there are negatives in those positives.
For example, the company only delivered 3,309 EVs in the second quarter. That's barely a rounding error for a company like Tesla, which delivered 384,122 vehicles. The legacy automakers, against which Lucid is also competing, have even larger businesses. One year won't fix Lucid's scale problem, even if it continues to grow its production.
Then there's the bottom line. Despite the improvement, Lucid still lost $0.28 a share in Q2 2025. That's better than the $0.34 per-share loss in the same quarter of 2024, but the company continues to bleed red ink onto its financial statements, and badly. Once again, that's not going to change in a year, given that the company is still spending heavily to ramp up its production.
Moving very slowly forward

Or rather, what is the bond market assuming its next move will be? The good news for interest rate doves is that the market, initially at least, is pricing in lower interest rates on the way, which would be great news for interest-rate-sensitive stocks like Whirlpool (WHR 1.66%) and Tesla (TSLA 0.53%).
What the latest moves mean for investors
The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 11-1 in favor of the rate cut, with one dissenting member voting for a more aggressive 0.5-percentage-point cut. The rate cut was accompanied by a decline in bond market benchmark 10-year Treasury yields and a decrease in 30-year mortgage rates.
Moreover, the bond markets are pricing in more near-term rate cuts. This is implied by examining the 10-year, two-year, one-year, and six-month Treasury rates. In normal circumstances, the 10-year rate should be the highest, and the six-month rate the lowest; this reflects the greater risk associated with longer-dated bonds due to a possible increase in interest rates.
Indeed, the 10-year yield is the highest; however, note that the six-month rate is higher than both the one-year and two-year rates. This implies that the market expects rates to go lower within one to two years.
What it means for Whirlpool
Lower mortgage rates tend to help make housing more affordable for borrowers, which can lead to more home sales and new home construction. More housing and sales is a plus for domestic appliance makers like Whirlpool. Individuals often remodel their homes before selling and after buying a new one. As such, the higher-margin discretionary demand for household appliances tends to follow existing home sales.
Whirlpool has struggled this year due to weak discretionary demand, and an improved U.S. housing market would definitely help boost sales. In addition, Asian competitors have preloaded the market ahead of tariff implementation, thereby creating a highly competitive price environment. Lower rates could boost demand and help clear the market's excess appliance inventory.
With the current tariff landscape in place, Whirlpool's competitiveness (the company makes roughly 80% of what it sells in the U.S. within the U.S.) is likely to improve significantly in the future, and it's set to be a big winner from the Trump administration tariffs.
Tesla could also be a winner
Housing is interest rate sensitive, and so is buying a car on credit. Much of the attention on Tesla's falling sales has been focused on CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and/or the automaker's aging vehicle lineup. The reality is that while Tesla's Model Y sales have slumped in 2025, sales of its Model 3 are growing strongly, and it's not a coincidence that the Model 3 is Tesla's lowest-priced vehicle.
It's also not a coincidence that Tesla is losing market share in the SUV (Model Y) market, as affordable competitors like the budget-priced Chevrolet Equinox SUV have aggressively grown their sales. In contrast, Tesla decided to refresh the Model Y in 2025, and in doing so, released a more expensive model.
Still, Tesla is already making plans to react and is set to release a lower-cost model in the near future. The expiration of federal tax credits for EVs at the end of September will hurt the market. Still, lower interest rates would offset the impact and also boost Tesla's release of lower-cost models, including a lower-cost Y model, and possibly a new affordable car (Model 2?) in 2026.
In addition, making EVs more affordable with lower interest rates would boost sales, as the initial cost of an EV tends to be relatively high, but its running costs are relatively low. As such, a lower interest rate environment could boost Tesla's EV sales in 2026 as it continues developing its robotaxi rollout.",643,trafilatura,,False

The Japanese electronics company aims to boost battery capacity by 25%, potentially extending Tesla’s Model Y range by around 90 miles (145 km) with the existing battery size.
Panasonic’s new battery could also enable the company to create “lighter” and potentially more affordable batteries by maintaining the current driving range while reducing battery size, according to the news agency’s report.
Ahead of a presentation by Panasonic Energy’s technology leader Shoichiro Watanabe, a company executive revealed details about anode-free battery technology.
This method involves generating a lithium metal anode inside the battery after its first charge, allowing for the inclusion of more active cathode materials like cobalt, aluminium, and nickel, thereby increasing capacity without expanding the battery’s size.

Since those highs, however, shares have slowly sunk in value. Today, shares trade below $20 per share.
Why is Lucid stock falling? There's one obvious reason.
Lucid stock popped after its $300 million deal with Uber
On July 17, Lucid Group announced a blockbuster deal with Uber Technologies. The deal called for Uber to invest $300 million into Lucid. In return, Lucid would supply Uber with 20,000 SUVs that would power Uber's fledgling robotaxi division.
At first, the market was exuberant about the news. Tesla had recently launched its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with some analysts believing the service could add $1 trillion to Tesla's market cap by the end of 2026. Others have noted that the global robotaxi market could eventually be worth as much as $10 trillion. Armed with a major partner with a global scale, Lucid's deal with Uber suggested that the company would be a major player in this emerging opportunity. The $300 million cash infusion, meanwhile, was a meaningful addition for an unprofitable company struggling to achieve economies of scale.
Lucid's deal with Uber presented a possible game-changer for the company's long-term prospects. Why, then, did shares cede all of the gains over the following weeks? Perhaps investors had time to digest the true details of the partnership, learning in the process that there are several reasons for concern.
Lucid's deal with Uber isn't as promising as it sounds
Let's look at the financial implications first. On Sept. 4, Lucid announced the closing of Uber's $300 million investment. ""The strategic investment was made as part of the next-generation premium global robotaxi program announced in July,"" the company noted. ""The robotaxi, which will utilize Lucid's electric vehicle technology platform, is planned to be built at Lucid's manufacturing facility in Arizona and will operate exclusively on Uber's ride-hailing platform. The funding supports the partnership between the two companies and contributes to development costs associated with the autonomous robotaxi initiative.""
Here's the problem: Last quarter, Lucid posted a net loss of $539 million. Over the past five years, Lucid has never posted a positive quarterly profit. That's a reasonable situation to be in for a growth company trying to achieve critical scale. But it also puts Uber's $300 million investment into context. That is, Uber's investment won't even cover what Lucid typically loses in a single quarter.
The second area of concern is the timing of the robotaxi business. The deal calls for Lucid to supply 20,000 vehicles to Uber over the next six years. The robotaxi service, meanwhile, isn't supposed to begin until ""late next year."" Put simply, this is not a near-term opportunity for Lucid. Given the company's ongoing net losses, that's a problem. For years, the company has been selling more and more stock to cover its losses, diluting shareholders in the process. The deal's long-term nature does provide upside opportunity. But as the market has shown in recent months, it's reasonable to be skeptical of the timeline. Technology could change in the coming years, prompting Uber to add competing partners. Plus, there's no guarantee that Lucid will maintain the capital power necessary to deliver on its end of the deal.
The final concern is that Lucid itself won't be operating the robotaxi division. That will be wholly owned by Uber. So, while Lucid does have direct exposure to the market, it will act as a supplier, not a primary beneficiary.
In all, Lucid's deal with Uber is undoubtedly exciting, with the potential to change the company's long-term trajectory. But there are many reasons for caution, a reality that forced shares to give up the short-term gains that were realized after the initial announcement.",628,trafilatura,,False

The price of Oracle stock has since retreated a bit, putting Ellison back in second place. But it's worth asking: Where does Ellison have his roughly $384 billion of net worth invested?
As you can imagine, a person that wealthy would own many assets. And Ellison, now 81, certainly does. They range from planes, yachts and a sailing team to real estate and houses spread around the world. He also owns 98% of Lana'i, the sixth-largest Hawaiian island.
But the bulk of Ellison's fortune is in three publicly traded companies -- software giant Oracle, electric car maker Tesla, and movie-media conglomerate Paramount Skydance (PSKY -0.38%).
Which of those three companies should less wealthy investors (that's everyone on the planet other than Musk) consider investing in?
Let's look at them a bit more closely.
1. Oracle surges
Ellison founded Oracle with two other engineers in 1977, though they first named it Software Development Laboratories. They adopted the Oracle name five years later and the company went public in 1986.
Over ensuing decades, Ellison accumulated enormous numbers of Oracle shares and today owns some 1.16 billion (about 41% of total outstanding). At today's share price of $301, that amounts to stake of about $349 billion.
The reason Oracle's share price surged last week (and briefly made Ellison the world's richest person) was that it reported quarterly results and, with them, the news that its remaining performance obligations -- expected future revenue from signed contracts that has not yet been collected -- surged during the quarter to $455 billion, a jump of 359%.
Multicloud-based revenue from Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon soared more than 1,500% in the quarter.
If you believe that cloud and data centers are going to continue to surge as revenue streams for big tech, Oracle is a great way to play it. The stock isn't exactly cheap relative to earnings -- the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 44 -- but that enormous backlog of business means lots of additional revenue and earnings coming down the pike, so an investment in Oracle at the current price could easily be justified.
2. Tesla fluctuates
Ellison is estimated to own about 45 million shares of Tesla, or 1.4% of the electric vehicle giant, which makes his stake worth about $19.1 billion at today's share price.
Tesla has certainly been a good investment over the years for those investors who bought in early and held on. Six years ago, the stock was at $16 and today, a share goes for more than $425.
But it's also been a roller coaster, as the share price is often closely associated with the company's flamboyant and unpredictable CEO. Thus it has fluctuated wildly in recent years as Musk has been distracted from day-to-day Tesla management by many other interests, from space exploration to buying Twitter to cutting government costs for President Donald Trump. The stock hit a peak in December and then plummeted more than 50% in the following months.
If you want to sleep well at night, you might limit your investment here.
3. Paramount's potential
Finally, Ellison and his family own about 77% of Paramount Skydance, a media conglomerate that was formed in August when Skydance Media, a media firm run by Ellison's son David, acquired Paramount, the legendary Hollywood studio and owner of CBS, among many other properties.
Paramount Skydance has a market cap of about $20 billion, which puts the Ellison family stake at around $16 billion.
Paramount stock languished for years before the merger as the company struggled to compete in a fast-evolving and cutthroat media industry and adapt to new technologies and changing consumer behaviors.
But with the recent merger, Paramount now has an influx of nearly endless money from one of the world's richest families. It also has a close connection to a major tech firm, which is likely to come in handy as technology continues to transform the entertainment industry.
David Ellison is already using his father's fortune to make some bold moves, from a recent $7.7 billion deal for rights to Ultimate Fighting Championship content, to a pending acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. movie and television studio.
Trading at just 12 times future earnings, Paramount Skydance is a bargain at the moment.

The electric-vehicle pioneer also sells energy storage systems and runs a global charging network, but the story dominating the stock is Tesla's push to commercialize self-driving. Indeed, shares trade around $420 as of this writing, following a sharp rebound in recent sessions that was fueled by renewed optimism around Robotaxis and AI.
The next 12 months won't be decided by a neat model or a single datapoint. If an autonomous ride-sharing network takes hold, it could spark a wave of new orders and a higher-margin services business layered on top of the installed base, justifying Wall Street's recent optimism for the stock. If it doesn't, investors are left with a cyclical auto company investing heavily in ambitious and costly projects. Therefore, the honest answer to ""Where will Tesla be in a year?"" is that the range of outcomes is unusually wide.
Recent results show mixed momentum
Results through June highlight the push-and-pull across Tesla's businesses. In the second quarter of 2025, total revenue fell 12% year over year to $22.5 billion as automotive sales cooled, even as energy storage remained a bright spot.
Margins tell a similar story. Tesla's combined gross margin for its automotive and ""services and other"" segments fell to 15.4% from 17.1% a year ago, reflecting lower prices and less regulatory credit revenue, while energy generation and storage gross margin rose meaningfully to 30.3% from 24.6% on lower unit costs. Operating lines continue to absorb stepped-up spending. Research and development expenses rose sharply as management invests in artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, and an expanded product roadmap, with research and development expenses reaching about 7% of revenue in the quarter versus roughly 4% a year ago.
Helping balance this high spending, liquidity remains a strength. Tesla ended the quarter with $36.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, supported by $4.7 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of 2025. This robust balance sheet gives the company room to invest even when demand is weak.
A wildcard
The swing factor is autonomy. In Tesla's second-quarter 10-Q, management notes, ""the launch of our Robotaxi service in June 2025 will unlock significant business growth to advance a service-driven business model."" Additionally, Tesla says it is building the supporting infrastructure as it scales. A paid pilot program is already running in Austin, and Tesla has publicly framed its upcoming ""Cybercab"" as the purpose-built vehicle for future fleet expansion. Execution here could be transformative -- both by creating a high-margin network service and by pulling through new vehicle demand from customers who want cars that can earn money while they sleep.
But there are material risks over the next 12 months. First, autonomy depends on software progress and regulatory approvals; timelines have slipped before across the industry, and rivals like Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox are also pushing forward, adding competitive pressure and shaping public perception. Second, Tesla's core auto profitability is under strain, so heavy investment in autonomy, new vehicle programs, and humanoid robotics could keep near-term margins soft if demand does not reaccelerate. Notably, deferred revenue tied primarily to Full Self-Driving features rose to $3.75 billion at quarter-end -- a reminder that a portion of the value investors expect still sits in obligations to deliver future capability.
Valuation magnifies the uncertainty. On trailing revenue of roughly $93 billion, the company's market value implies a rich price-to-sales multiple (about 15) for a manufacturer with compressing auto margins -- unless autonomy inflects. If Robotaxi usage expands beyond a limited pilot, Tesla could look more like a networked platform with high incremental margins on software and rides, and the current price may prove reasonable. If Robotaxi traction stalls, investors may reassess how much to pay for a slower-growing auto and energy business -- even with solid cash and a growing energy storage segment.
Stepping back, the most useful way to frame the next year is as a spectrum. At the high end, a scaled autonomous network plus stronger vehicle orders could send earnings and the stock sharply higher. In the middle, modest autonomy progress and a return to moderate growth in vehicle sales could keep shares range-bound as profits recover gradually. At the low end, limited autonomy progress and lingering weak demand could leave margins thin and the stock vulnerable. That is precisely why Tesla remains a speculative bet best suited for investors with large risk appetites: the upside is massive if autonomy works -- and the downside is meaningful if it does not.",763,trafilatura,,False

But CEO Elon Musk sees physical artificial intelligence (AI) products like autonomous cars and robots as a tremendous growth opportunity.
He argues Optimus, a humanoid robot, could add as much as $25 trillion to the company's market value. And when autonomous driving technology is factored into the equation, Musk thinks Tesla could be a $30 trillion company at some point in the future.
That may surprise some readers because the largest company in the world is currently worth about $4 trillion. But if Musk is correct, the implied upside for Tesla shareholders is more than 2,000%. That means $50,000 invested in the stock today would eventually be worth more than $1 million.
Here's what investors should know about Tesla.
Tesla's electric vehicle business is stalling
Global electric vehicle sales jumped 35% this year through July, but Tesla reported a decline in automotive revenue during the last three quarters. Dwindling demand is partly due to CEO Elon Musk involving himself in politics, which backfired spectacularly, and partly due to competition. Tesla has an expensive lineup of electric vehicles, and more automakers are bringing appealing alternatives to market.
Those dynamics have caused Tesla to lose substantial market share across China, Europe, and the United States. The company accounted for only 12% of global electric vehicle sales through July, down from 17% in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Chinese automakers BYD and Geely have gained market share, and now rank as the top two electric carmakers worldwide in terms of vehicle volume.
Tesla's autonomous ride-sharing and robotics businesses are ramping up
Tesla recently introduced its first commercial autonomous ride-sharing service in Austin, Texas. The company is also testing robotaxis in the San Francisco Bay Area, and recently received approval to start testing in Nevada. While Tesla trails the market leader Alphabet's Waymo, which already operates in five U.S. markets, it theoretically has an advantage.
Tesla's autonomous driving platform relies solely on computer vision. That strategy is not only less costly that the sensor suite (cameras, lidar, radar) used by Waymo and other autonomous driving companies, but also more scalable. Whereas Waymo maps cities in meticulous detail before opening its ride-sharing service to the public, Tesla's vision-only approach makes city maps unnecessary.
Musk says Tesla will eventually hold at least 90% market share in autonomous ride-sharing because its robotaxis are more cost efficient and can be introduced in new cities with more quickly. He said on the second-quarter earnings call that autonomous ride-sharing could have a ""material impact on our financials around the end of next year.""
Sizing the opportunity is challenging, but most analysts see a large market in the making. Straits Research estimates global ride-sharing sales will surpass $900 billion by 2033. Uber CEO Dana Khosrowshahi says autonomy will unlock a $1 trillion opportunity in the U.S. alone. And Ark Invest says robotaxi revenue will reach $2.6 trillion per year by 2030.
Meanwhile, Tesla is also developing an autonomous humanoid robot called Optimus, which Musk says will eventually be its most valuable product. The company plans to scale production next year and hopes to build at least a million units annually within five years. However, Tesla faces a great deal of competition in that market, especially from Chinese companies.
""China has a commanding lead in physical AI,"" writes Morgan Stanley analysts. But the humanoid market will be large enough to support multiple winners. Global wages total approximately $30 trillion annually, and humanoid robots could curb some of that spending through automation. Morgan Stanley estimates humanoid robot sales will increase at 34% annually to reach $4.7 trillion by 2050.
Tesla is one of the most expensive stocks in the S&P 500
Valuing Tesla is difficult because the electric car business, which currently accounts for three-quarters of total revenue, has lost momentum. The company has pivoted toward AI products, but neither autonomous ride-sharing nor humanoid robots are a material source of revenue today. That means earnings are likely to grow slowly in the near term, but could accelerate a few years out.
Nevertheless, investors should be aware of the current facts and figures. Tesla shares trade at 169 times 2026 earnings, which makes it the third-most expensive stock in the S&P 500. That valuation multiple is particularly pricey for a company whose earnings are forecast to grow at just 19% annually in the next three years.
Here's the bottom line: Tesla's current valuation is unsustainable if the company fails to capitalize on opportunities in robotaxis and robotics. Investors who lack confidence in those endeavors should avoid the stock. But investors who think Tesla can disrupt the mobility and labor markets should own the stock, though I would keep my position small.",796,trafilatura,,False
company,1758142804,xStocks Issuer Chose Switzerland to Avoid Whitelisting Tokenized Tesla Shares: CEO,136794048,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,TSLA,Yahoo,"Some assets deserve to be permissionless, according to Adam Levi.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6e1a2d305151cbaf20e4e9d164570465178f4dca54f6a2a7275835951c362ca4,https://decrypt.co/340067/backed-chose-switzerland-xstocks-avoid-whitelisting-tokenized-tesla-shares-ceo,ok,200.0,https://decrypt.co/340067/backed-chose-switzerland-xstocks-avoid-whitelisting-tokenized-tesla-shares-ceo,decrypt.co,https://decrypt.co/340067/backed-chose-switzerland-xstocks-avoid-whitelisting-tokenized-tesla-shares-ceo,200.0,"In brief
- Switzerland allowed Backed to avoid whitelisting xStocks.
- Tokenized Tesla shares have the largest supply.
- xStocks have roughly 30,000 unique holders.
Balancing compliance needs against the open and accessible nature of decentralized finance ultimately brought Backed Finance to Switzerland, according to co-founder Adam Levi.
The company was registered in the European nation because it allowed them to issue digital representations of stocks like Tesla and Nvidia, called xStocks, that are freely transferable, as opposed to those constrained by a so-called whitelist, he told Decrypt.
“We were looking into five jurisdictions, and lawyers told me, ‘Yes, you can do it. It will be permissioned with a whitelist,’” Levi recalled. “And I said, ‘No, I’m not interested. I don't want to build it because I will not use it.”
In crypto, whitelists are typically used to grant individuals approval to participate in a specific event, whether that’s minting an NFT or investing in a cryptocurrency’s debut. Within the context of tokenized equities, one could dictate who’s allowed to hold the digital representations of stock.
Backed began issuing tokenized stocks under its xStocks brand in June, and as the company competes with similar offerings from retail brokerage Robinhood and tokenization platform Securitize, Levi argued that a permissionless approach is best for adoption.
“Think about a stablecoin being permissioned,” he said. “No one would use that.”
As of Wednesday, xStocks currently had 30,300 total unique holders, according to a Dune dashboard. Tesla’s associated token was the most popular, with 43,000 tokens tied to $18 million in Tesla shares—which serve as its backing.
That distinction is key. Some forms of tokenized stock are “native,” meaning that they carry the same entitlements that investors receive when purchasing stock through traditional means, but xStocks are essentially a wrapper for tokens that are held off-chain.
It’s similar to how most stablecoins function as an IOU for $1, Levi said. They are not issued by a central bank or government, so they are not dollars themselves. And xStocks can be redeemed for actual shares in a company for a fee.
“Were creating wrappers on top of stocks,” he said. “You’re not holding Tesla—that’s important—but you basically have a right to the economic value of Tesla.”
XStocks aren’t available in the U.S., and the tokens are issued under sweeping legislation passed by the Swiss Parliament in 2020. The legal framework is explicitly “innovation-friendly,” according to a fact sheet published by a Swiss government agency in 2023.
Regulators in the U.S. have raised eyebrows in relation to tokenization this year, with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce saying in July that tokenization doesn’t trump existing securities laws. Companies like OpenAI have also denounced tokens tied to them as unauthorized.
Still, Levi thinks xStocks could see real adoption outside of the country, for similar reasons that have pushed people toward products from stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether.
“People around the world started using stablecoins as a way to run from inflation, and I think the same will [happen] for xStocks,” he said. “Bitcoin is very volatile, but if you want to have something that is safe and growing, the S&P 500 is a very good product.”",526,trafilatura,,False

It's been manufacturing vehicles in China for more than 20 years. Its first new energy vehicle -- a plug-in hybrid -- was introduced in 2008. BYD then launched a fully battery-powered electric car the next year.
BYD can arguably be called the global EV leader even over Tesla. The Chinese company generates more revenue than Tesla, and it is still growing. One chart may convince investors that its stock is the better buy, too.
BYD's growth is accelerating
BYD has dominated EV sales in China, but it is now seeing growth in Europe. Registrations for BYD vehicles in Europe soared 225% year over year in July, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Much of that is at Tesla's expense, with Tesla registrations down 40% year over year.
BYD is increasing profits, too. In the first half of 2025, net profit grew nearly 14% as revenue climbed 23%. Like Tesla, BYD is facing strong competition globally, and profit margins are under pressure. Unlike Tesla, however, BYD's new energy vehicle sales hit a record high.
It's impressive that revenue is growing so strongly from an already high base.
Trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue has surpassed that of Tesla, and the gap is growing. BYD's revenue growth rate has far outpaced Tesla, too. It soared nearly 500% in the last five years, compared to Tesla's 230% growth.
It's impressive to see the growth rate accelerating for a company with over $100 billion in annual revenue. BYD shares have retreated 20% from record highs over the last three months. That drop created a good opportunity to invest in this global EV leader.",278,trafilatura,,False

Elon Musk-led Tesla issued a default notice in July after Syrah allegedly failed to deliver conforming active anode material samples from its Louisiana processing facility for Tesla's EV batteries. The original September 16 deadline has now been pushed to November 15.
""While Syrah does not accept it is in default under the offtake agreement, the parties have extended the cure date to 15 November 2025,"" the company stated, adding that both sides are collaborating to resolve the dispute.
The 2021 Tesla contract, worth 8,000 tonnes annually for a four-year period, underpins Syrah's Louisiana Vidalia facility and its broader strategy to become America's first major non-Chinese graphite supplier.
The facility represents the only vertically integrated, large-scale anode material producer outside China, helping reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese supplies that currently dominate the market.
The extension offers temporary relief as Syrah battles to establish itself in the strategic battery materials sector amid intensifying U.S.-China trade tensions.
Tesla may terminate the deal if Syrah's Vidalia facility fails to achieve final qualification of its anode material by February 9, 2026.

Musk further emphasized his focus on Tesla while responding to community speculation on X on Tuesday.
Dogecoin derivatives markets also priced in the potential impacts of Elon Musk’s attention shifting towards Tesla, at the expense of projects like Dogecoin.
According to Coinglass, Dogecoin futures trading volume plunged 26.39% to $9.41 billion, while open interest fell 3.85% to $5.35 billion. This represents over $200 million in liquidated open positions despite 1% spot price gains within the last 24 hours.
This signals that while some Dogecoin traders are front-running potential ETF approval with spot purchases, short-term speculators trimmed leverage exposure in response to Musk’s latest pivot towards Tesla and the looming Fed rate decision.
Dogecoin Price Forecast: Can Bulls Reclaim the $0.29 Peak?
Dogecoin price remains in neutral territory, having retraced from the local high of $0.29 last week to hold the $0.26 support line on Tuesday.
If declining open interest triggers sell-offs in spot markets, the Keltner Channel midline near $0.246 offers initial support against downswings. However, a close below that level could see Dogecoin price fall toward the lower boundary at $0.21.
The MACD remains positive but shows flattening momentum, suggesting bulls may be losing ground. For DOGE to retest $0.29, buyers must reclaim the $0.28 resistance zone with volume support.
If the ETF verdict lands favorably, this breakout could validate a run toward $0.32, marking a fresh high for Dogecoin price in 2025.
Conversely, failure to defend $0.26 ahead of the Fed decision could see DOGE fall into a consolidation range between $0.21 and $0.24.

Its shares have dropped 45% in 2025, reaching a calendar-year low of $214 in April.
And even though share prices bounced back in recent days/weeks/months, they are still down for the year, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't very optimistic about the short-term outlook.
Tesla has another rough earnings report
In its July 23 Q2 earnings report, Tesla posted a 16% decline in quarterly sales for the second straight quarter. The automaker also saw year-over-year declines in both revenue and vehicle deliveries.
Musk stated back in July that the company could have a few ""rough quarters,"" highlighting tariff-related cost increases and the expiration of the tax credit as contributing factors. The company plans to limit vehicle inventory for Q3, and is uncertain whether it will be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed after August.
Musk, who was an advisor to President Donald Trump until May, when he resigned, stated in April that he believes lower tariff rates are beneficial for ""prosperity."" While Tesla is a U.S. manufacturer, it imports various car parts from multiple foreign countries that are currently impacted by tariffs, including battery cells from China.
The end of the EV tax credit
First introduced in 2009, the federal EV tax credits were implemented as incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase electric vehicles. The current credit for a new EV purchase is $7,500, while used car purchases can receive $4,000.
However, now that Congress has passed President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" those credit incentives will expire on Sept. 30. Consumers who have their car delivered after Sept. 30 will still receive the credit, provided the purchase occurs before the deadline.
In 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS reported that the government spent more than $2 billion in federal tax credits for more than 300,000 electric vehicle purchases. There's a strong chance that consumers will capitalize on the expiring credits, causing EV sales to spike briefly in September and then drop.
A study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research in October 2024 predicts that if the credits are eliminated, EV sales in the U.S. will fall by nearly 30%.
Tesla's share price increased in August
The EV company's stock price climbed 9% in August, marking a second consecutive month of price increases. But it has a lot of catching up to do, as share prices are currently down by 16% in 2025 in the first week of September. It's been over eight months since Tesla stock reached an all-time high, peaking at $488 on Dec. 2, 2024.
Competitors such as Ford Motor Company and General Motors will also be impacted by the tax credit elimination, but have their gas vehicle production to fall back on. Ford's share price was up by 18% in 2025, as of early September, while GM's increased 17%.
Is Tesla stock a buy right now?
While Tesla stock has been trending upward in recent months, macroeconomic factors like ongoing tariff disputes and a presidential administration that is actively rolling back EV initiatives make the stock a potentially volatile investment.
Once investors understand how Tesla plans to manage production after tax credits expire, they'll be able to make a more informed decision about the stock's long-term value within their portfolio. And there's a strong chance the stock will bounce back once President Trump is out of office. But for now, investors should wait for the next earnings report before purchasing shares.",601,trafilatura,,False

Last year, Meta announced that it was working with the U.S. Army on various AI use cases, including:
“Fine-tuning Llama to support specific national security team missions, such as planning operations and identifying adversaries’ vulnerabilities.”
Which sounds concerning, right? I mean, AI tools still regularly make simple mistakes, and confuse contexts and/or meanings in basic usage. But Meta’s looking to work with the military to use AI to identify targets in combat.
Seems like a concern, while Meta is also working with Anduril to develop VR and XR helmets for military use, further engraining Meta technologies into the broader war machine.
I don’t know, it just feels like we’ve gone from “Facebook is a dangerous vector for foreign manipulation” to “let’s use Facebook to power our army” a little too fast.
And now, that usage is expanding to more foreign military uses.
Today, Meta has announced that it’s now made its Llama models available for national security use cases among U.S. security partners, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.K., as well as their private sector suppliers, and it’s also further expanding that same access to more regions.
As per Meta:
“We are now expanding this access to a number of key U.S. democratic allies in Europe and Asia: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea, as well as NATO and European Union institutions.”
To be clear, this doesn’t mean that the military are going to be loading up Meta’s AI chatbot and asking “who should we kill next?” Instead, the focus here is on enabling foreign military groups to utilize Meta’s AI tools to build their own solutions.
“Llama has been used to help develop advanced AI tools for the U.S. military and national security agencies, enhancing decision-making, mission-specific capabilities, and operational efficiency. For example, Meta is working with the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command on a pilot project to demonstrate how AI and technologies like augmented and virtual reality can help to speed routine repairs and help the Army get equipment back into the field more quickly.”
So, in the majority, this will see Meta’s AI tools used for training and simulations, not for mission planning and live combat. But again, that could be a part of an expanded use case for these tools.
Which feels like a concern, but such usage is relative to how each group utilizes these tools, and Meta’s largely taking a hands-off approach in this respect.
“In a world where geopolitical power and national security are deeply intertwined with economic output, innovation, and growth, the widespread adoption of open source models like Llama will be essential to maintaining US and allied AI leadership and ensuring our shared values underpin the systems and standards adopted elsewhere. This is recognized by the U.S. government in its AI Action Plan for America, which Meta endorses.”
So Meta’s essentially looking to democratize the use of AI tools to ensure greater capacity among all allied nations. While also strengthening its own position as a key provider of such, which will solidify Meta’s AI business plan, and ensure ongoing investment and growth.
From that perspective, it’s a smart business move, but it just feels not quite right to have a company that was under fire, just a few years back, for facilitating foreign election interference, now overseeing direct connection with the global military machine.
But Meta wants to be the leader in AI development, and all industries are looking at how they can use technologies like this to gain an advantage.",617,trafilatura,,False

Through its various social media apps, it counts a whopping 3.48 billion daily active users. There might be no other business that has this kind of reach, impacting so many people each and every day.
This ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has been a huge winner, more than tripling in the past five years. But can Meta shares turn a $10,000 investment into $50,000 by 2030?
Lower expectations
If an investment rose five-fold in a five-year period, it implies a compound annual gain of 38%. This is an unbelievable result that might typically only come from hyper-growth companies or from struggling businesses trading at dirt cheap valuations that start reporting improving financials as they successfully turn things around.
To be clear, Meta isn't going to put up a 400% total return between now and the end of the decade. This is a more mature company. However, if the stock price and valuation tank for whatever reason, like they did in 2022, there might be huge upside in the years that follow.
Should you buy Meta stock now?
While Meta won't climb five-fold by the end of the decade, turning $10,000 into $50,000, it still looks like a smart investment. Revenue and earnings per share are soaring at impressive rates. And leadership is fully focused on developing artificial intelligence capabilities.

The global AI market will soar from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033 -- a 25-fold increase in a decade -- according to an estimate by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%), the leading supplier of AI chips and related technology, has been garnering rockstar-like attention for its phenomenal stock performance. It deserves its accolades and I remain very bullish on the stock.
But there's a large-cap AI stock that's walloped Nvidia stock in 2025 to date, over the last year, over 3 years, and even over 5 years: electronic manufacturing services (EMS) provider Celestica (CLS 4.86%).
Celestica -- which is well-established and profitable -- deserves much more attention. I believe that the U.S. financial press doesn't give it much coverage largely because it is based in Canada -- Toronto, to be exact -- rather than in the U.S. But Celestica stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the Toronto Stock Exchange, so it can be easily bought by U.S. investors.
If you're an AI stock or tech stock investor, Celestica is worth considering buying.
Celestica stock's performance
| Stock | YTD 2025 Return | 1-Year Return | 3-Year Return | 5-Year Return | 10-Year Return |

| S&P 500 Index | 14.4% | 18.2% | 78.7% | 116% | 306% |
Celestica stock has trounced Nvidia stock in every period up to 5 years. Nvidia is the big winner over the 10-year period. Both Nvidia and Celestica have crushed the S&P 500 index (a proxy for the overall market) in every period shown.
Celestica has also beaten another AI darling -- Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.34%) -- over every period the AI-powered software-as-a-service (SaaS) company has traded.
Celestica's business: Good corporate DNA
Celestica is a leading electronic manufacturing services (EMS) provider. It provides design, manufacturing, hardware platform, and supply chain solutions for many of the world's largest companies across technology and other sectors. It has over 40 manufacturing and design centers worldwide.
I described Celestica as having good corporate DNA because it's essentially a spin-off from tech giant IBM. In 1996, Big Blue sold Celestica to an investors group, and in 1998, Celestica held its initial public offering (IPO).
The company's financial performance -- and hence, its stock performance -- started soaring in 2023, driven by powerful demand for its services and hardware platform solutions from companies heavily involved in AI.
Celestica has two reportable segments: advanced technology solutions (ATS) and connectivity & cloud solutions (CCS). ATS includes its aerospace and defense, industrial, health tech, and capital equipment businesses. CCS consists of its communications and enterprise (servers and storage) markets.
Notably, the company ""does business with the top five hyperscalers,"" CFO Mandeep Chawla said in January on Celestica's Q4 2024 earnings call. These are generally considered to be Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and likely Apple. Hyperscalers are companies that operate massive AI-focused data centers, often (but not always) to support their cloud computing services.
Celestica's key financial and stock stats
| Company | Market Cap | Forward P/E | Wall Street's Estimated Annualized 5-Year EPS Growth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Celestica | $29.1 billion | 37.6 | 27.3% |
In the first half of 2025, Celestica's revenue rose 20% year over year to $5.54 billion. On an adjusted basis, its net income surged 46% to $301.3 million, which translated to earnings per share (EPS) soaring 50% to $2.59. Cash flows were solid, and debt load is reasonable with a 0.55 long-term-debt-to-equity ratio.
The company's connectivity & cloud solutions (CCS) segment is driving its growth. In the second quarter, total revenue rose 21% year over year to $2.89 billion. CCS revenue jumped 28% to $2.07 billion, while the ATS segment's revenue increased 7%. Within the CCS segment, hardware platform solutions revenue rocketed 82% year over year to $1.2 billion.
In July, citing the ""strengthening demand outlook from our CCS customers,"" management raised its full-year 2025 guidance as follows:
- Revenue of $11.55 billion, up from $10.85 billion. This equates to annual growth of 20%.
- Adjusted EPS of $5.50, up from $5.00. This equates to annual growth of 42%.
- Free cash flow of $400 million, up from $350 million. This equates to annual growth of 31%.
Moving to the stock's valuation. Celestica stock is priced at 37.6 times Wall Street's estimated one-year forward EPS growth. This is a little pricey for a stock of a company that's expected to grow EPS at an average annual pace of 27.3% over the next 5 years.
However, investors should expect to pay up for quality. Moreover, the stock will turn out to be less highly valued than it now seems if Celestica continues to beat Wall Street's earnings estimates. Over the last four quarters, the company has exceeded the analyst consensus estimate in every quarter and by an average of 9.1%.
In addition, using the same valuation metrics, Celestica's valuation is much, much more reasonable than Palantir's. And it's anywhere from slightly to significantly more reasonably valued than every ""Magnificent Seven"" stock except for Nvidia. (That includes Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Apple, and Tesla.)
Celestica expects no material impact on 2025 earnings from tariffs
When it raised its 2025 guidance, Celestica addressed tariffs: ""Substantially all tariffs paid by Celestica are expected to be recovered from our customers, and are not expected to materially impact our ... [adjusted] net earnings dollars.""
In short, if you're a growth stock investor, Celestica stock is worth considering buying -- or at least putting on your watchlist.

Its fleet of nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar energy assets has the capacity to generate 32.4 gigawatts (GW) of power annually, sufficient to meet the needs of over 20 million homes and businesses.
That fleet, especially its industry-leading nuclear energy plants, is becoming increasingly important given the country's surging power needs. Rising electricity demand from AI data centers, new factories, and electric vehicle (EV) charging should support robust earnings growth for Constellation over the next five years. Here's a look at where the company expects to be by 2030.
Cashing in on growing demand for clean power
Constellation Energy is the nation's leading nuclear power producer by a wide margin. It currently has 22.1 GW of competitive generation capacity, three times more than its closest peer (Vistra at 6.3 GW).
It also produces more carbon-free energy than leading utility NextEra Energy (178.2 GW to 110.5 GW). The company primarily sells the power it produces to commercial and industrial customers, for an industry-leading 21% market share.
The power company's business model generates fairly stable and visible revenue from regulated rate structures and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). It has been signing more PPAs with large technology companies to support their growing power needs.
For example, last September, the utility signed a 20-year PPA with Microsoft to support the launch of the Crane Clean Energy Center. Microsoft is buying 100% of the power from the former Three Mile Island Unit 1 (over 800 megawatts) to help support its data center options.
Constellation had shut down the nuclear reactor several years ago for economic reasons. It will now restart that unit, which should be back on line by 2028.
Meta Platforms also signed a 20-year PPA with the company. It will purchase all the power generated from the 1.1 GW Clinton Clean Energy Center, starting in 2027. Constellation nearly had to shut down the center several years ago due to poor economics.
However, the Future Energy Jobs Act prevented its premature retirement by providing financial support through mid-2027. Meta will begin purchasing power from that plant after the support program ends to help meet its power needs.
These deals and similar revenue frameworks give Constellation Energy strong visibility into its earnings growth potential over the next several years. The company expects its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow at more than a 10% compound annual rate through 2028.
A growth accelerator is coming
Its current growth forecast doesn't include any impact from its pending acquisition of Calpine. The company agreed to buy the power producer in a $26.6 billion deal in January. It's hoping to close the transaction within a year of signing the merger agreement.
The merger will create the country's largest clean power producer. It will combine Constellation's nuclear- and renewables-focused portfolio with Calpine's leading natural gas and geothermal plants. The combined company will have over 60 GW of capacity for zero- and low-carbon power production.
The company expects the deal to boost its EPS by more than 20% next year. And it sees the merger adding at least $2 per share to its future earnings and $2 billion to its annual free cash flow. That will help support double-digit EPS growth through the decade.
A much bigger and more profitable company
Constellation Energy expects to become a significantly larger company once it closes its acquisition of Calpine. It also expects to continue capitalizing on surging power demand, which should provide a meaningful earnings boost over the next few years. By 2030, it expects to be a much larger and more profitable company, which should enable it to create substantial value for shareholders in the years to come.",619,trafilatura,,False

Many companies exceeded the consensus analyst estimates for revenue, profitability, or both. Often these beaters were raisers too, lifting certain guidance items on the back of better-than-anticipated performance in their reported quarters.
Some quarterlies were particularly impressive. I'm thinking of those posted by drone manufacturer AeroVironment (AVAV 1.60%) and social media king Meta Platforms (META 0.71%). As with any earnings season, however, there were also some busts along with the beats, so for balance I'll also take a look at the disappointing quarter from satellite radio specialist SiriusXM (SIRI -0.17%).
1. AeroVironment
The first of our trio to unveil its results during the summer earnings season, AeroVironment is a specialty defense company that specializes in combat drones and associated products.
That's a solid business these days, given enduring conflicts in the world (such as Ukraine) and flash points that might spark in the wrong circumstances (Taiwan). Governments of the world want to feel secure and combat-ready, and for modern militaries, that increasingly means operating fleets of drones.
Near the end of June, AeroVironment published its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 numbers. The company booked an all-time record for revenue in that frame; this was a superb 40% higher year-over-year at slightly over $275 million. Another historical high was recorded for bookings, which climbed to $1.2 billion. Non-GAAP (adjusted) net income per share nearly quadrupled, to $1.61.
Analysts tracking the stock were expecting a good quarter from AeroVironment, but this one was outstanding. Those pundits, on average, were modeling only $242 million on the top line, and $1.38 per share for adjusted net profitability.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta, owner and operator of the hard-to-avoid Facebook and Instagram sites (plus the less ubiquitous messaging service WhatsApp) took its turn on stage at the end of July. Ubiquity has its advantages in the social media world, not least that it draws a huge audience and (by extension) advertisers willing to precisely target likely customers among that audience using Meta's cutting-edge tools.
So as ever, Meta put up double-digit growth figures for its second quarter. Revenue advanced by 22% to $47.5 billion. Operationally speaking, the company's family daily active people (DAP; its current user engagement metric of choice) bumped 6% higher to 3.48 billion. All this filtered down into a headline net income figure that was 36% fatter at $18.3 billion ($7.14 per share).
""Crushing"" would be an appropriate word to describe actual performance versus the consensus analyst estimates; those professionals tracking Meta stock were collectively estimating $44.7 billion for revenue and $5.85 per share for net income.
3. SiriusXM
At the risk of ending this article on a negative note, we have the dispiriting quarter put up by SiriusXM. On paper, the company has a supreme competitive advantage, as it's the one and only provider of satellite radio services in North America.
However, in this age of 5G telephony that allows smartphone users to stream basically any kind of entertainment they want, that isn't a slam-bang advantage for the company. Over the past few years, its eroding fundamentals have reflected this, and its second quarter results disseminated on July 31 didn't provide much relief.
For the period, revenue slipped by almost 2% year over year to $2.1 billion. That isn't surprising, giving the 1% dip in subscriber count (to under 33 million). Those dynamics weren't helped by slightly higher operating expenses. The company's attributable GAAP net income fell by almost 33% to $205 million.
SiriusXM broadly met the consensus analyst estimate for revenue, but at $0.57, its earnings per share (EPS) fell well short of the $0.75 collective prognosticator forecast.",614,trafilatura,,False

Its strong growth has been fueled by robust advertising demand and an engaged user base across its social media apps. The company, which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, is making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative ad formats -- all while revenue and earnings are soaring. No wonder the Street has been buying up the stock.
Meta Platforms remains one of the world's largest digital ad sellers -- an advertising-led business that can grow quickly when marketers spend and pull back just as fast when they don't. That mix of strength and fragility, however, is the point here. While Meta's execution in core ads has been impressive lately, two structural realities make its earnings power more volatile than peers in the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"": exposure to advertising cycles and reliance on distribution largely controlled by Apple and Alphabet. Add in credible competition for user attention, and it's reasonable that Meta's price-to-earnings multiple sits in the 20s while others command richer premiums.
Ad-driven momentum -- and its limits
Meta's recent numbers are strong. In the second quarter of 2025, revenue rose 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, while income from operations increased 38% and operating margin expanded to 43% as ad demand stayed healthy. Management also noted in the company's follow-up second-quarter earnings call that demand was broad-based across verticals and geographies, with smaller advertisers contributing to growth.
Why wouldn't a business growing like this command a price-to-earnings multiple in the thirties? The catch is concentration. Substantially all of Meta's revenue is generated from advertising, and those results fluctuate with marketers' budgets. Advertising tends to behave like a cyclical expense: when growth fears rise, many brands and direct-response advertisers trim spend quickly. That dynamic can compress both Meta's top line and operating leverage more suddenly than businesses with more recurring, contracted, or diversified revenue.
Platform dependence
Meta's second structural risk is distribution. Meta's products ride on mobile operating systems and app stores it does not control. In its annual filing, the company warns that changes by Apple or Alphabet can limit its ability to target and measure ads, degrade product functionality, or even make access to its apps more difficult -- and that Apple's iOS changes beginning in 2021 have negatively impacted ad performance and revenue. Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework formalized user opt-in for cross-app tracking, illustrating how a single platform policy can ripple through Meta's ad systems. These aren't theoretical worries; they're documented factors that have already affected results and could again.
A battle for younger generations
Competition for attention also remains real. TikTok's rapid ascent showed that new social platforms can win share fast, and Snap's Snapchat remains deeply popular among U.S. teens alongside Instagram. Meta has responded well with Reels and recommendation improvements -- and the recent quarter reflected that -- but the battle for time and attention is more competitive than ever.
While Snap may not initially seem like a threat to Meta, it's worth noting that the company's daily active users are growing rapidly. In Q2, Snap's daily active users rose 9% year over year. In addition, the company's monthly active user count is approaching 1 billion.
What this means for valuation
A business that is (1) tied to discretionary ad budgets, (2) dependent on external platforms for distribution and some of its key data signals, and (3) facing credible attention from rivals deserves a lower valuation than platform owners or companies with more diversified, contracted, or utility-like cash flows. Today, Meta's price-to-earnings multiple sits roughly in the high-20s on a forward basis, below Microsoft and Amazon (both in the low-to-mid 30s recently) and slightly above Alphabet, with a price-to-earnings ratio of about 27. That spread mostly makes sense. Microsoft and Amazon lean more on subscription, enterprise, and cloud spending, while Alphabet has an advertising-heavy business. With this said, I believe Alphabet arguably deserves to trade at a higher multiple than Meta. Though its business relies a lot on ads, it benefits from a broader mix, including a fast-growing cloud segment and control of the Android platform.
Yes, Meta stock may continue to compound if engagement holds and ad tools keep improving. Additionally, Meta seems to try to always be prepared for risks by maintaining a healthy balance sheet -- something that may help it during times of economic weakness. But the nature of its revenue and its relationship with gatekeepers mean there's always a chance that macro softness, a new privacy rule, or a policy change dents performance faster than expected. Advertising cyclicality, platform exposure, and intense competition for attention, therefore, argue that a sustained price-to-earnings multiple in the 20s is a prudent place for the market to settle, even as results remain strong.",801,trafilatura,,False

Here's what investors need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Point to Record Highs for Major Indexes
Stock futures are soaring as investors digest the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to cut its benchmark rate and the economic projections of Fed officials. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up more than 1% this morning, while those linked to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also solidly higher. The major indexes are on track to open at all-time highs, after turning in a mixed performance yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was down slightly at 4.06%. Bitcoin is at $117,200, trading at its highest levels in a month, while gold futures fell slightly to $3,700 an ounce.
2. Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates, But Outlook Unclear for Additional Cuts
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered the quarter percentage point interest rate cut that investors expected, but Chair Jerome Powell couldn’t guarantee that more were on the way. Fed officials on average expect two more rate cuts in the Fed's remaining two meetings of the year, but Powell said those projections were dependent on upcoming economic data releases. Meanwhile, the Fed’s economic outlook projected moderate growth, stable unemployment, and slowing inflation, with officials split on how aggressively to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings.
3. Intel Stock Soars as Nvidia Announces $5 Billion Investment
Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in embattled rival Intel (INTC) as the two tech firms agreed to jointly develop chips for personal computers and data centers. As part of the agreement, Intel will build custom processing units that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure, while it will also integrate Nvidia chips into its personal computers. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The move comes after the federal government took a 10% stake in Intel. Shares of Intel were up about 30% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia shares added 3%.
4. Meta Showcases New AI-Powered Glasses
Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday unveiled new AI-powered glasses as part of its developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which the company said “takes microphones, speakers, cameras, and a full-color display backed with compute and AI — and puts it all together in a single device that’s stylish and comfortable.” The device also comes with the Meta Neural Band wrist monitor that tracks movements to help control the glasses. The glasses will be priced at $799, the company said. Meta shares were little change in premarket trading.
5. StubHub Falls in First Trading Session
Ticket reseller StubHub (STUB) shares fell in their first session of trading yesterday after its initial public offering. StubHub priced shares at $23.50, and the stock climbed to above $26 during the session before closing at $22. StubHub sold 34 million shares and raised $800 million in the IPO. The money will go toward paying down debt, CEO Eric Baker said on CNBC. StubHub shares were down 2% ahead of the bell on Thursday.",596,trafilatura,,False

Despite that strength, I still think it's an excellent stock to buy now. I've got five reasons why Meta is a no-brainer buy, although there are probably many more when you really dig into the stock.
1. Dominant platforms
Meta Platforms' social media sites include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Threads. Those are collectively the most widely used social media apps in the world.
In Q2, Meta's advertising revenue rose by an impressive 22%. In Q3, Meta expects its revenue to rise by 20%, indicating further strength. Although Meta has had a dominant run, that run is far from over.
2. AI ads
One of the reasons Meta's revenue is growing so quickly is that it's starting to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) features into its ad platform. Management noted that its ad conversions have improved since it implemented some of its tools, and users are spending more time on its platforms.
We're just in the early innings of advertising tools with integrated AI, and further advancements could drive significant revenue growth for Meta if they lead to dramatically improved conversion rates.
3. All-star AI team
Meta has attracted some of the brightest minds in AI with nine-figure signing bonuses. With Meta's top-notch talent divided up to work on several AI projects at once, it may be a few years before we see the fruits of their labor. And while there are no guarantees, some major innovations could very well come from this talent pool.
4. Inexpensive growth
Moving to the stock, Meta isn't dramatically overvalued despite its business being at the forefront of the AI investing movement.
The stock trades for just a bit over 27 times trailing earnings, which isn't very expensive relative to the broader market. The S&P 500 trades for 24.8 times earnings although it tends not to grow nearly as quickly as Meta is. This bodes well for Meta's future, as it shows the company can deliver outsize returns with a reasonable price tag and strong growth rates.
5. Revenue potential
Meta Platforms may be focused on integrating AI with its social media platforms, but it is also developing several other exciting technologies. One of them is its AI glasses, which could be a must-have item if Meta can get the price, form factor, and abilities correct.
Its uses could be quite varied. According to one news report, users might be able to look at a sign and automatically translate it into another language. Or it might coach users on how to cook. The possibilities could be endless.
All the projections for Meta's growth and performance over the next few years essentially exclude any contributions from its Reality Labs division. Should one of these products become a must-have device, a massive new revenue stream could emerge and push Meta's stock higher.
Although this is far from certain, start-up-like upside within Meta would be the cherry on top for a solid company, and I think it makes for an excellent stock to buy right now.",518,trafilatura,,False
company,1758109500,Can Buying Meta Platforms Stock Today Set You Up for Life?,136787393,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,META,Yahoo,The company's work in artificial intelligence could usher in a new stage of hypergrowth for the social media giant.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=28e830cc6fd426e5082ece50c0cf496500bd945bd6c9e50762e868f689850e22,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/can-buying-meta-platforms-stock-today-set-you-up/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/can-buying-meta-platforms-stock-today-set-you-up/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/can-buying-meta-platforms-stock-today-set-you-up/,200.0,"Meta Platforms (META 0.71%), one of the leading social media companies, went public in 2012. Since then, the stock has performed exceptionally well. Its returns over this period are well above those of broader equities. However, some might argue that it's too late to get in on the bandwagon.
Meta Platforms is now worth almost $2 trillion. Can the stock still generate life-changing returns? Let's find out.
The bullish case for Meta Platforms
Meta's bread and butter is advertising. The company boasts a portfolio of social media brands that includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. It has more than 3 billion daily active users across these platforms as of the end of the second quarter of 2025. The sheer volume of Meta's ecosystem makes it an attractive place to run ads, but the company goes even further.
It has access to a considerable amount of data from its users, including basic demographic information, interests, favorite celebrities, and much more. This enables the company to assist businesses in crafting ads that are carefully targeted toward specific audiences, making them highly cost-effective.
Meta Platforms' strategy has been successful, as evidenced by its financial results. Second-quarter revenue increased 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, while earnings per share came in at $7.14, 38% higher than the year-ago period.
The company's core advertising business will remain central to its results for the foreseeable future. And here is the good news: Meta is improving its ad business thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). On the one hand, it helps improve the ad launch process with AI-powered tools that assist businesses in crafting ads, including by generating relevant messages and images and further enhancing targeting. On the other hand, AI-powered algorithms are boosting engagement on the company's websites and apps.
The result: Time spent on Facebook and Instagram has increased lately. And according to a study the company ran, AI-powered ad tools improved return on ad spend by 22%.Meta is looking to automate the ad process completely, which should lead to even greater gains. The company could perform well as it moves toward that goal. But what happens beyond advertising?
In my view, Meta Platforms' greatest strength is its ecosystem and culture of innovation. With several billion users, the tech giant can develop various monetization schemes, only a few of which need to take off to have a meaningful impact on its financial results. Meta is gradually expanding into other avenues, including paid messaging on WhatsApp. The company is investing in AI glasses, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes will become the norm within the next decade.
Thanks to its core business, its vast ecosystem, and various other initiatives, Meta could still deliver market-beating returns over the next 20 years.
Some risks to consider
Meta Platforms may encounter some obstacles. For instance, the company is spending a small fortune on AI infrastructure. That could be a problem if its AI initiatives don't have the impact it hopes they will, especially if we enter an economic recession. Consumers spend less -- and so do businesses, including on advertising -- when the economy is struggling. The combination of slower revenue growth (if ad spending decreases) and increased expenses due to Meta's investments in AI could harm the company's financial results.
Antitrust lawsuits could present another potential threat to Meta Platforms. Regulators in the U.S. have argued that Meta has a monopoly in the social networking space. These lawsuits are still ongoing. In the worst-case scenario, Meta may be forced to divest some of its assets. Do these potential challenges justify avoiding the stock? Not in my view. Meta proved it could navigate economic challenges a couple of years ago.
Amid growing expenses, declining user growth, and slower revenue increases, the company regrouped, cut costs, and emerged from the ordeal stronger than ever. Meta's AI plans are, so far, yielding tangible results, and we haven't seen all that the company can do in this area yet.
Regarding the company's legal problems, while it's worth keeping an eye on those, a potential and uncertain worst-case scenario shouldn't deter investors from this robust, well-run business that is firing on all cylinders. It might be worth revisiting the question if Meta loses its antitrust case, but the stock's prospects remain highly attractive as things stand.
Lastly, Meta is now a dividend stock -- a fairly new development -- and reinvesting the payout will boost what should already be superior returns over the long run. So can Meta Platforms set investors up for life? I think it can.",754,trafilatura,,False
company,1758103800,Why This Biotech Company Could Be a Growth Stock Powerhouse,136787395,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,META,Yahoo,The stock has soared in the triple-digits over the past decade.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=da330da9b06ead923b398ae1a233e0e3f152aaf31a2371ec66180ebe3b3fb3b1,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/why-this-biotech-may-be-growth-powerhouse/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/why-this-biotech-may-be-growth-powerhouse/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/why-this-biotech-may-be-growth-powerhouse/,200.0,"When you think of adding growth to your portfolio, you may immediately envision technology stocks. After all, names like Nvidia and Meta Platforms have driven stock market gains over the past couple of years. Technology stocks are fantastic growth players, but it's important to remember that they aren't the only option for growth-oriented investors.
Another industry that offers you a chance to supercharge your portfolio is biotech. Here, you'll find the potential security of healthcare -- people need their medicines, and this supports drugmakers' revenue -- along with incredible innovation. Biotech players are known for transforming the lives of patients with game-changing treatments, and this may lead to soaring revenue over time.
A great example of this is a company that's revolutionized the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), meaningfully extending patients' lives and delivering revenue growth quarter after quarter. And this company also has proven its innovation strengths in recent years by diversifying into other treatment areas. All of this could make this player a growth stock powerhouse over the long run. Let's check it out.
Vertex's earnings take off
The biotech company I'm referring to is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 1.36%), the world's leading maker of CF treatments. Vertex first introduced its CFTR modulators back in 2012, and this prompted the company's earnings to take off -- and revenue has been climbing ever since. (Vertex also has rewarded long-term investors, as the stock has climbed about 190% over the past decade.)
VRTX Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
In CF, symptoms are caused by a malfunctioning protein produced by the CFTR gene. CFTR modulators aim to fix the faulty protein. The challenge is different genetic mutations in the disease result in different flaws in the protein -- so one particular medication won't work for every patient. But, back in 2019, Vertex won approval for Trikafta, a treatment that may be used for up to 90% of CF patients. The company's latest CF drug, approved late last year and called Alyftrek, handles an additional 31 mutations and has resulted in even greater efficacy than Trikafta.
Blockbuster Trikafta continues to drive CF revenue, as patients doing particularly well on that drug may stick with it, but Alyftrek is on the road to becoming another significant revenue driver for the company. Vertex is also shepherding other potential CF drugs through the pipeline, so it's logical to expect this company to remain the leader in this field for quite some time.
And, as mentioned, in recent times, Vertex has successfully expanded into other treatment areas. The company launched blood disorders gene editing treatment Casgevy last year, and this year released Journavx in the high-potential area of pain management.
Casgevy's launch
Casgevy, a treatment that involves developing authorized treatment centers and a months-long process of steps such as cell collection and editing, will take some time to generate significant revenue for Vertex -- it's not like launching a simple pill. But Casgevy is on track to become a meaningful part of the Vertex story. In the latest earnings report, Vertex said 115 patients have undergone the cell collection process and 29 have received their Casgevy.
As for Journavx, from its launch in March through mid-July, pharmacists filled more than 110,000 prescriptions for it for acute pain. The company expects this non-opioid pain drug to meet the need for a treatment that's more efficacious than over-the-counter products but isn't linked to addiction like prescription opioid medicines. In the recent earnings call, Vertex said it's in the ""early days of creating another multibillion-dollar franchise.""
Potential new products on the horizon
Finally, Vertex has four programs in pivotal development and is about to start a fifth -- at this stage, these programs are approaching the crucial step of regulatory review. These include candidates for kidney diseases, IgA nephropathy and APOL1-mediated kidney disease, two studies within the pain management program, and a type 1 diabetes candidate.
Of course, anything can happen at any stage in a clinical trial, so it's possible that even during this late phase of development, Vertex could hit a stumbling block. But, even if that happens for one or two candidates, Vertex is still well-positioned to progressively expand its number of commercialized drugs and treatment areas. This, along with the ongoing strength of its CF program, makes me confident about its ability to deliver revenue growth in the years to come -- and that makes Vertex a growth stock powerhouse to buy now.",737,trafilatura,,False
company,1758072900,"The Smartest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $1,000",136787399,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,META,Yahoo,"Investors can start buying shares in several leading artificial intelligence (AI) stocks with a modest sum of just $1,000.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ab7e34a7e33d50cfd15053fe770b2a3a0036c344a2fef70eab77e3b7da52b511,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/the-smartest-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/the-smartest-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/the-smartest-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to/,200.0,"One of the most common misconceptions about investing is that you need a significant sum of money to get started. Too often, would-be investors sit on the sidelines, waiting to accumulate what they perceive is ""enough"" capital before making their first move.
The reality is that even a modest investment can provide ownership in some of the world's most influential businesses. With the right mindset and a commitment to long-term growth, a small stake today can become the foundation for meaningful wealth in the years ahead.
With that in mind, here are six artificial intelligence (AI) stocks you can begin building a position in with just $1,000.
The hardware backbones
AI development is inseparable from infrastructure. As demand for compute and inference continues to accelerate, investors should focus on the companies supplying the hardware backbone that makes this growth possible.
At the top of this list is Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%), the undisputed leader in AI infrastructure. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the gold standard for training AI workloads, while its CUDA software architecture helps form a deep competitive moat -- making it both costly and complex for developers to switch providers.
In practice, rising capital expenditures (capex) from hyperscalers flow directly back to Nvidia. This creates a lucrative feedback loop: More investment in AI infrastructure drives ongoing demand for Nvidia's chips, which in turn fuels the next wave of applications beyond today's large language models (LLMs).
Nebius Group is emerging as a notable player in the evolving cloud infrastructure landscape. The company's business model centers on renting GPUs through a specialized platform designed to help enterprises manage AI workloads with greater efficiency and flexibility.
Positioned as both cost-effective and technologically capable, Nebius is carving out a niche in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) beyond incumbents like CoreWeave. Nebius benefits from strong ties to Nvidia and recently secured a $17.4 billion partnership with Microsoft.
The silent giant enabling the GPU ecosystem is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. While designers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices capture outsize attention, it's TSMC's foundry that brings their chips to life -- producing semiconductors at the most advanced nodes available.
As emerging AI applications in robotics and autonomous systems demand increasingly sophisticated fabrication processes, TSMC's deep footprint in cutting-edge manufacturing is set to expand.
The software superstar
Once dismissed as a niche government contractor, Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.34%) has transformed into one of the most formidable players in the software arena. Throughout the AI revolution, the company has gone toe to toe with enterprise incumbents like Salesforce and SAP, carving out market share across the private sector and proving its platform is indispensable.
What truly differentiates Palantir is the trust it commands at the highest level. While smaller rivals such as C3.ai and BigBear.ai are left chasing deals that are narrow in scope, Palantir is securing $10 billion contracts with the U.S. Army and forging strategic alliances with NATO.
Even more telling is how tech titans like Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle have opted to partner with Palantir rather than compete head-on. This alignment opened new doors in healthcare, energy, and financial services -- where Palantir is winning sticky, long-term contracts that provide durable revenue visibility and expanding unit economics.
In short, Palantir has evolved into a cornerstone of the AI software landscape -- positioned to scale alongside the public and private sectors as AI investments continue to move downstream.
A magnificent duo
While infrastructure and software tend to dominate the headlines, two consumer-facing giants -- Alphabet (GOOG -0.30%) (GOOGL -0.15%) and Meta Platforms (META 0.71%) -- remain underappreciated relative to their ""Magnificent Seven"" peers.
Alphabet's strength lies in the breadth and integration of its ecosystem. Advertising remains a cash cow fueled by dominance in search (Google) and engagement (YouTube). Yet beneath the surface, Alphabet has quietly built a vertically integrated AI empire: Custom Tensor Processing units (TPU) that rival with Nvidia's GPUs, a rapidly expanding cloud computing platform, and DeepMind -- Alphabet's internal research lab driving breakthroughs that flow right into commercially available products.
Meanwhile, Meta commands arguably the most valuable social media network on the planet. With billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, the company is not only monetizing attention through advertising, but also unlocking new avenues of growth through AI-powered personalization. Few companies can deploy new features so broadly and effectively at scale -- positioning Meta as a winner in the next phase of AI's digital transformation.",732,trafilatura,,False

Which also presents significant opportunities for sports-related advertisers, and Meta’s report also explores this aspect, in how marketers can tap into sports communities to boost brand awareness and sales.
You can download Meta’s full, 50-page “Beyond the Highlights” sports report here, but in this post, we’ll take a look at some of the key notes.
First off, the report looks at overall sports engagement, and the role that Meta’s apps play within the broader scope of sports-related discussion.
As you can see from this overview, Meta platforms are a key destination for sports engagement, which makes sense when you consider the overall audience of both Instagram and Facebook, with WhatsApp, Messenger, and now Threads all also playing a part.
In that sense, this does seem like a somewhat unfair comparison, in that Meta’s listing “Meta platforms,” a cumulative grouping of its apps, and pitting that against TikTok and X. But then again, YouTube is there too, and even considering this is a combined figure, 17% is still a lot of sports-related discussion across its apps.
And Meta does break it down more specifically in another section of the report:
This relates to fan engagement specifically, not sports discussion overall, but as you can see, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp ranked higher among survey participants in driving sports engagement. Also Threads. Look at Threads in there taking up its own place in the broader sports landscape.
It’s worth noting too, in this context, sports is a key driving force of social media engagement more broadly.
Back in April, as part of an overview of fashion discussion in the app, X shared this graph:
So as you can see, despite sports engagement on X only accounting for 3% of overall sports discussion, it’s the biggest single topic of focus in the app. That provides some additional insight to color the above charts.
The report also looks at how Facebook and Instagram drive discovery of sports products:
And provides demographic insights for the Meta sports audience:
There’s also an overview of the types of sports content that fans are looking to engage with:
There are also notes on when sports fans are more likely to engage in Meta apps (before, during, and after live events), how sports influencers drive action, as well as platform-by-platform breakdowns of the respective sports audience.
There’s a heap more insight in the full report, which is a must-read for any marketer working in sports or sport-related fields.

company,1758017700,2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,136773136,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,META,Yahoo,These companies can help you grow your savings.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1f283db0f150a1775af3107829635659ef24fd783009ead918a273b78aa1e5fc,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/tech-stocks-buy-hold-next-decade-meta-nflx/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/tech-stocks-buy-hold-next-decade-meta-nflx/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/tech-stocks-buy-hold-next-decade-meta-nflx/,200.0,"Technology is historically where innovation and growth happen in the economy, making it a promising sector to look for long-term winners. Despite a severe drawdown in 2022, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite has doubled in value over the last five years. This shows the value of buying and holding shares of great companies instead of trading in and out.
If you're looking for quality growth stocks to safely grow your money over the long haul, here are two tech companies you almost can't go wrong with.
1. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 0.71%) has been one of the top beneficiaries of artificial intelligence (AI) on the consumer and advertising side in the past few years. With over 3.4 billion people using its social media platforms every day, Meta will benefit tremendously over the next decade as AI proliferates into people's lives.
Meta is integrating AI deeply into its ad business, which drives virtually all the company's $178 billion in trailing revenue. AI-powered advertising leads to more relevant ads, higher conversions, and more engagement from users, which ultimately creates positive returns for advertisers. The company's revenue grew 22% year over year in the second quarter, driven by higher ad impressions and average price per ad.
Meta AI has been a key driver of engagement for the company's family of apps. This AI-powered assistant has over 1 billion active users. Meta AI is helping create more relevant product recommendations and information for users, making it a valuable asset in growing ad revenue.
On the consumer side, Meta is showing great potential with smart glasses. Its Ray-Ban AI glasses have been a hit, and Meta is preparing to launch new sports glasses in partnership with Oakley to drive more growth.
AI glasses have the potential to replace phones one day as technology continues to advance. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted on the company's earnings call, these products could become the main way that people use AI over time. If that happens, Meta Platforms would benefit from having one of the hottest consumer products in the next 10 years.
Meta wouldn't be able to pursue these opportunities without substantial cash resources. Its lucrative ad business helped generate $50 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters, which is funding massive investments in data centers and AI. Meta is one of the few consumer-facing companies making billions off of AI technology right now, making it a compelling investment.
2. Netflix
Netflix (NFLX 1.38%) has grown into a dominant entertainment streaming service over the last decade, which has created tremendous wealth for shareholders. But it's not done. As it expands into advertising and other content like live sports, the stock has real potential to keep climbing in the years to come.
Netflix recently completed the rollout of its proprietary ad-tech platform. The significance of this is that it lessens the dependence on third-party technology and enables the company to push full throttle into serving large advertisers.
It's already showing tremendous potential. Ad revenue is expected to double this year, indicating strong demand for ad-supported subscription plans. This puts Netflix in a strong position to continue growing its already massive subscriber base.
Streaming became significantly more competitive in recent years, but Netflix continues to deliver above-average growth. Revenue has consistently grown around 16% year over year in recent quarters. While advertising revenue is not disclosed partly because it's still a small part of the business, Netflix's growing content library and entry into live sports streaming could make the platform a digital entertainment juggernaut in the next decade.
Management is only interested in pursuing sports deals where it generates a healthy profit for shareholders. So far, the live events make up a small portion of total content spending, but management indicated that these are high-value engagements. Sports streaming has had a significant impact on subscriber conversion and retention.
Growth in advertising and sports streaming is going to turn Netflix into a more valuable business in the next decade. Over the next several years, analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 23%, which should deliver market-beating returns for shareholders.",684,trafilatura,,False
company,1758016500,The Trade Desk Is Now the Worst-Performing S&P 500 Stock This Year. Is it a Buying Opportunity or a Red Flag?,136773137,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,META,Yahoo,The ad tech stock has faced multiple challenges this year.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b2d750dc441c9996abd4fa85b66ef45251ebc8180d32d34cc7df30ca30157452,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/trade-desk-worst-performing-sp-500-buy-red-flag/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/trade-desk-worst-performing-sp-500-buy-red-flag/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/trade-desk-worst-performing-sp-500-buy-red-flag/,200.0,"For years, The Trade Desk (TTD 2.60%) was a stock market darling, marching steadily higher as it delivered solid growth year in, year out. The company established itself as the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in the rapidly emerging ad tech industry, and capitalized on new platforms like Connected TV and retail media.
However, this year, The Trade Desk has run into some unforeseen challenges. Growth suddenly slowed as the company appears to be facing new challenges from ""walled gardens,"" the tech giants like Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon that operate their own ad ecosystems that can block The Trade Desk. After Netflix and Amazon announced that they had formed a partnership allowing advertisers to purchase Netflix ads through Amazon DSP, The Trade Desk plunged double-digits on Wednesday, becoming the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 this year, trading down 61% year-to-date as of Sept. 11.
The stock also plunged following the release of two out of its three earnings reports this year (see chart below).
Let's review the challenges facing The Trade Desk before discussing whether or not the stock is a buy.
What's ailing The Trade Desk?
When The Trade Desk plunged in February, it was the first time in its publicly traded history that the company had missed its guidance.
CEO Jeff Green admitted that on the earnings call, and explained it wasn't due to competition or new technology, or any significant change like that. The Trade Desk just had a few internal errors, or what Green called ""a series of small execution missteps."" However, he attempted to reassure investors, saying, ""We see a larger and faster-growing market than we originally expected.""
The company's first-quarter earnings report in May reassured investors as revenue growth accelerated again, but the stock then plunged again as the company posted its slowest quarter of growth in its history (just 19%), with the exception of the beginning of the pandemic.
For the third quarter, it called for revenue growth to slow to at least 14%, though it would be 18% adjusting for the decline in political ad spend. This time around, Green cited headwinds from tariffs on some of its biggest customers and downplayed the threat from Amazon, which has made more investments in its DSP.
The stock received several analyst downgrades on the report as its growth is decelerating even as digitial advertising growth is strong at industry leaders like Meta Platforms, key verticals like Connected TV (CTV) are maturing, and increasing competition from alternatives like Amazon.
Is The Trade Desk a buy?
Following the earnings report, Walmart ended its exclusivity deal with The Trade Desk for advertisers using its shopper data, according to The Information, and it was later hit by the news of the Amazon-Netflix partnership, allowing Netflix ad inventory to be purchased through Amazon's DSP.
Despite Green's efforts to reassure investors, there's not much reason to be positive about The Trade Desk right now. Its growth rate seems to have fallen below 20% for good, and its underperformance relative to the rest of the digital advertising market is notable.
It's not fully clear what's pressuring the company, though competition appears to be a factor, as does the dominance of walled gardens, which are continuing to perform well.
The Trade Desk has become more attractive on a valuation basis as the stock has fallen, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 26 based on adjusted earnings per share.
However, The Trade Desk stock could head lower if its growth continues to decelerate. The company has a long history of delivering results, and it should eventually be able to recoup some of its recent losses, but patience seems like the best approach at this point for would-be buyers.",618,trafilatura,,False

Meta launched ads in WhatsApp Status back in June, which enables advertisers to display their promotions between full-screen WhatsApp Status updates from friends.
Meta also offers Click-to-Message ads from Facebook and Instagram, which enable brands to initiate a direct chat with potential customers from their in-stream promotions.
And now, Meta’s also offering some advertisers the option to combine the two.
As per Meta:
“You can create ads that click to WhatsApp and use the WhatsApp Status placement. Ads in WhatsApp Status will only appear in the Updates tab, which is the home of Status and Channels and is separate from personal chats and calls. When people click on your ad, they’re sent directly into a chat with your business on WhatsApp.”
So it’s essentially the same as the above WhatsApp Status ads, but users will be able to click through to these promotions from Facebook or IG, which will give you a larger, full-screen presentation for your promotions, with a chat CTA.
That could be another way to drive engagement on WhatsApp, which is becoming a bigger home for discussion in more regions. Indeed, WhatsApp is now up to 100 million U.S. users, and with click-to-message ads driving better performance, and gaining popularity among brands, it could be another consideration for your broader Meta connection strategy.
Meta says that WhatsApp Status ads are not available in all regions as yet, so you may not have access. But for those that do, you’ll soon have more ways to gain attention, and drive response with your DM-aligned promotions.",288,trafilatura,,False
company,1757931060,"Prediction: This ""Ten Titans"" Growth Stock Will Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Broadcom, and Meta Platforms in the $2 Trillion Club by 2030",136749421,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,META,Yahoo,Oracle is getting rewarded for growing its cloud the hard way.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e632989f7bd86d3be7d932d0b492357a8a592cb289947eaa9323ea1c606c967b,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/prediction-ten-titans-oracle-2-trillion-2030/,ok,200.0,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/prediction-ten-titans-oracle-2-trillion-2030/,fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/prediction-ten-titans-oracle-2-trillion-2030/,200.0,"Oracle (ORCL 0.71%) surged a mind-numbing 36% on Wednesday to close the session at a market cap of $922 billion. Five years ago, Oracle's market cap was under $200 billion. Now, there's reason to believe it can surpass $2 trillion by 2030.
If that prediction comes true, Oracle could be well on its way to joining Nvidia (NVDA 1.80%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.22%), Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL -0.15%) (GOOG -0.30%), Amazon (AMZN 1.01%), Broadcom (AVGO 1.36%), and Meta Platforms in the $2 trillion club. Broadcom and Meta Platforms are currently under $2 trillion but would surpass the threshold with gains of 16% or less.
The ""Ten Titans"" -- which are these companies plus Tesla and Netflix -- now make up a staggering 39% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.52%) and have proven to be a formidable group of market-moving stocks.
Here's why Oracle deserves to be in the conversation of market-leading growth stocks and why the company could more than double from here in less than five years.
Oracle's offering is ideally suited for existing database and enterprise services customers
In its first quarter fiscal 2026 earnings release from Sept. 9, Oracle projected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue to grow from $18 billion in its current fiscal year to $144 billion by fiscal 2030. Oracle also provided revenue guidance by fiscal year for the next four years.
To understand the gravity of Oracle's projections, consider that, in 2024, Google Cloud generated $33.1 billion in revenue, Microsoft's entire Intelligent Cloud segment notched $105.4 billion in revenue, and Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world by market share, generated $108 billion in revenue.
Of course, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are all projecting solid cloud growth. But Oracle's forecast suggests that OCI, in terms of cloud infrastructure revenue, will be bigger than the current size of AWS in less than four years, which is probably the single most aggressive prediction any tech company has made this year.
As you can see in the graph, OCI is projected to reach an inflection point in fiscal 2027 as data centers come online to fulfill Oracle's massive order backlog. In its latest earnings release, Oracle announced plans to deliver an additional 37 multi-cloud data centers to its three major hyperscaler partners -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- to bring its total to 71. In June, Oracle said that it had 23 multi-cloud data centers with 47 more being built in the next 12 months -- meaning it added 10 in the latest quarter. But these are just its multi-cloud data centers. Oracle is also building standalone data centers designed strictly for running OCI services, such as AI workloads and its Exadata Database service, which is optimized using specific infrastructure.
Next-generation data centers
Oracle is in an enviable position because it offers customers competitively priced bundles that combine cloud services with other offerings, and because it is expanding its business through partnerships with multiple cloud providers. A big part of this pricing advantage comes from the way Oracle's data centers are built. According to Oracle, ""OCI bare metal instances, not available from other cloud providers, coupled with microsecond-latency RDMA [Remote Direct Memory Access] cluster networking provide 50% better price-performance and 3.5X time savings for HPC [high performance computing] workloads compared with previous-generation compute."" RDMA is an Oracle network fabric that reduces latency.
In sum, Oracle's data centers are brand-new and hyper-efficient, allowing it to achieve better performance and offer attractive pricing to gain market share. In some ways, Oracle is like the Broadcom of the data center world. Broadcom is winning a lot of business from hyperscalers thanks to its XPU custom AI chips, which are advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that can be an effective alternative to graphics processing units in some (but not all) applications. Just as Broadcom is essentially working with Nvidia in the data center, so too is Oracle working with the established cloud giants -- forming a partly competitive, partly symbiotic relationship. It's a peculiar dynamic, but one where Oracle and Broadcom have a compelling advantage.
Oracle's road to $2 trillion is defined, but the path is riddled with uncertainty
If Oracle comes close to its fiscal 2030 OCI revenue target, it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock at least double from here. Based on Amazon's market cap of $2.46 trillion, you could argue that AWS is worth about $1.5 trillion on its own. With that logic, OCI alone could be worth $2 trillion if it eclipses AWS's current size in five years. So it's not unreasonable to expect Oracle to surpass $2 trillion in market cap by 2030 -- again if it delivers on expectations. And that's a big if.
Oracle is spending heavily to build out its infrastructure, so it's best not to look too deeply into its earnings. However, once its infrastructure is more established, Oracle could pull back on spending, which will boost its margins and allow the company to transition back to high-margin free cash flow.
Oracle stock is worth buying and holding if you believe its disruption of the cloud computing industry is built to last. But the stock's valuation is heavily dependent on its ability to fulfill and profit from its order backlog. So some investors may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach to the Ten Titans stock right now.",888,trafilatura,,False
