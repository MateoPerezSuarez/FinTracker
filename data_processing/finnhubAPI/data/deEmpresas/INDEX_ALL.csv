finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-25T12:16:03,Amazon's grocery ambitions stumble in Britain,"LONDON (Reuters) -When Amazon opened its first grocery store outside the United States in 2021, its choice of a site in west London for a cashier-free store was seen as the start of a major assault on Britain’s $290 billion food market.  That store closed in 2023 and this week the group said it planned to shut its remaining 19 Amazon Fresh stores - a failure that highlights the brutal economics of UK food retail, and how one of the most powerful retailers in the world may still be feeling its way on how to compete globally in groceries.  Amazon, which also runs Amazon Fresh stores in the United States as well as the upmarket Whole Foods Market chain, never confirmed UK store targets, but 2021 media reports suggested plans for over 260 Fresh outlets by end-2024.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ce26e9bc136cbb3250340d474b52adee66a3dcdd78b3ac72d8c249c718aee103,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo
