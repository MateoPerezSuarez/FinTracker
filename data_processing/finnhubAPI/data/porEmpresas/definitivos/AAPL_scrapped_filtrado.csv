The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), released on Tuesday, showed that annual wage growth excluding bonuses in the three months to August was 4.7%, down slightly from 4.8% between May and July.
The unemployment rate came in at 4.8% for the period, slightly higher than the 4.7% recorded for the previous three months.
The number of employees on the payroll in the year to August was estimated to have fallen by 93,000, though it increased by 10,000 between July and August.
Early estimates for the number of payrolled employees in September suggested a fall of 100,000 on the year and 10,000 on a monthly basis, though the ONS said this was likely to be revised when more data is received next month.
The estimated number of job vacancies fell by 9,000 from the previous three months to 717,000 in July to September.

Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""After a long period of weak hiring activity, there are signs that the falls we have seen in both payroll numbers and vacancies are now levelling off.
""We see different patterns across the age ranges with record numbers of over-65s in work, while the increase in unemployment was driven mostly by younger people.""
The figures come ahead of the government's autumn budget, which chancellor Rachel Reeves is due to deliver on 26 November, with speculation ramping up as to what policy changes she could announce to raise funds to support public finances.
Professor Joe Nellis, an economic adviser at accountancy and advisory firm MHA, said that the labour market ""continues to show signs of strain"".
""Hiring momentum has slowed across most sectors, with many employers holding off on new recruitment or scaling back hours instead of making redundancies,"" he said. ""While this suggests a degree of resilience, it also signals that businesses are operating with caution amid fragile demand, elevated borrowing costs, and uncertainty ahead of the autumn budget."""
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-14T05:00:06,Rising pension age hits women hardest,"Enabling people to work for longer can spell good news for people’s retirement planning – but there are significant challenges, especially for women.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c15b8eb813e3ef3ca96144204f78889a70449255ea885d33187c59821e89f1f6,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-pension-age-women-050006550.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-pension-age-women-050006550.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-pension-age-women-050006550.html,yahoo.com,200,,"New data from the Department from Work and Pensions on the working patterns of people aged 50 and above showed that our working lives are getting ever longer, as the average age of leaving work rises.
This trend isn’t just down to people’s enthusiasm for work; it’s primarily caused by increases to the state pension age – a change that has particularly impacted the working lives of women.
With state pension age soon to start its rise to 67, it will be interesting to see whether people will work even later in life. Enabling people to work for longer can spell good news for people’s retirement planning, giving them longer to build their pensions or vary their working patterns by going part-time.
However, there are significant challenges, most notably healthy life expectancy.
Not everyone is physically able to keep on working. Poor health can also strike much earlier than you think. According to the data, 44.7% of people who are classed as economically inactive between the age of 50-64 say it’s because they are sick, injured or disabled.
Read more: What you need to think about before taking a tax-free pension lump sum
The other major challenge is caring responsibilities. This can cover not just looking after your own children but also grandchildren and parents. It’s something that can take you out of the workforce at any time. It also disproportionately affects women and is a key component of the burgeoning gender pension gap. More than 18% of women said it’s a reason why they can’t look for work, compared with 7.7% of men.
These issues have enormous consequences for those who need to leave the workforce in their 50s. Shorter working lives mean less time to build up a workplace pension — and more time when people need to rely on the assets they have been able to build up so far.
The rise in state pension age makes it even more challenging. If you were to leave the workforce at, say 55, you’ve got more than decade before you’ll get your state pension, so how do you fill that gap? It’s an issue that will no doubt be an important part of thinking around the ongoing review into state pension age.
In the interim, it also means everyone needs to consider their own position if they were forced to finish work earlier, and whether there’s anything they can do to protect themselves. This can include anything from taking steps to build a bigger pension to investing in an ISA they can access if they need to before their personal pension is available.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-14T05:00:00,How to ask for changes at work if you are neurodivergent,Advocating for yourself can help create a culture where others feel able to do the same and will create fair and equal conditions for everyone at work.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=96a2e7b9c93285db40190c528b28630e5aadc83055fb2713cd00e3e1ae986728,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/neurodivergent-workplace-changes-050000638.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/neurodivergent-workplace-changes-050000638.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/neurodivergent-workplace-changes-050000638.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Asking for workplace accommodations is often easier said than done. Many people worry about being seen as “needy” or “incompetent,” and as a result, continue to struggle in environments that simply don’t meet their needs. On top of that, the fear of discrimination can be a powerful deterrent, discouraging many neurodivergent individuals from disclosing their diagnosis.
As many as one in seven people are neurodiverse, with conditions including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia and dyspraxia. Yet, two-thirds of neurodivergent workers don’t feel able to tell their employers about their diagnoses – let alone ask for accommodations to make working easier.
Natalie Mackenzie, a cognitive strategist and founder of BIS Services, which provides cognitive rehabilitation services, adds that people may worry that disclosing their needs will lead to being seen as less capable, or mean they’re passed over for promotions. “This is often compounded by past negative experiences in other environments, such as school or previous jobs,” she says.
“Individuals may also struggle to articulate exactly what they need. If you have spent your life developing complex masking or coping mechanisms, it can be difficult to pinpoint the specific adjustments that would make a tangible difference. There is also the internalised pressure to ‘just cope’ which can make asking for help feel like an admission of failure rather than a proactive step towards having their needs met.”
And even if individuals do tell their employers, it doesn’t automatically mean their needs will be met, says Professor Binna Kandola, co-founder of the business psychology firm Pearn Kandola.

“Our research shows that only 60% receive the adjustments they need, and 63% feel they have to ‘mask’ their true selves at work-often leading to stress, exhaustion and poorer mental health,” he explains.
“This isn’t about individual reluctance – it’s about organisations still lacking the psychological safety that makes open conversations possible.”
How to ask for accommodations at work
Think about what adjustments may be helpful beforehand
Everyone is different, but some common requests include greater flexibility around hours and location to avoid commuting at busy times, or so you can work during your peak focus hours. Others include quiet, sensory-friendly workspaces or access to noise-cancelling headphones, extra time for certain tasks and regular breaks to manage focus and energy.
Another simple adjustment is asking for clear written communication to avoid anxiety, frustration or unintentional mistakes. For those who use language literally, being asked to “read between the lines” can mean a constant struggle to understand the intended meaning of an instruction. A reasonable change may be to ask for instructions to be given via email or instant messaging instead of spontaneous phone calls, or to have agendas provided before meetings."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-14T03:38:44,Apple announces major expansion of renewables investment across Europe,The tech giant has increased its involvement in clean energy projects as part of efforts to match the amount used by customers to power their devices.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c1d9f815fe2dfba0569501b05ba693d0079a1035ee3508e4ddb2bf37f89847aa,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-announces-major-expansion-renewables-030000641.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-announces-major-expansion-renewables-030000641.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-announces-major-expansion-renewables-030000641.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Apple has announced a major expansion of its renewables investment in Europe as part of efforts to cut the carbon footprint caused by customers powering and charging its devices.
The tech giant is supporting several large-scale solar and wind farms that are currently in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Romania and Poland.
This builds on its previously announced investment in the Castano solar farm outside the Spanish city of Segovia, which started operating earlier this year and can power around 76,500 households.
While these projects will provide electricity directly to grids in their respective countries, Apple said the amount they generate will contribute towards its corporate climate goals.
With the help of this new clean power capacity, the company aims to match 100% of the electricity used by its customers in Europe, including the UK, to power or charge their devices by 2030.
It comes as part of Apple’s wider target to become carbon neutral across its entire value chain – its operations, supply chains and the products it sells – by the end of the decade.
Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said: “By 2030, we want our users to know that all the energy it takes to charge their iPhone or power their Mac is matched with clean electricity.
“Our new projects in Europe will help us achieve our ambitious Apple 2030 goal, while contributing to healthy communities, thriving economies and secure energy sources across the continent.”
The energy used to charge devices accounted for about 29% of Apple’s overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2024, according to the firm’s own calculations.
This does not include the electricity required for its data centres, which the company said are already powered by renewable electricity.
To reach its 2030 ambitions in Europe, Apple estimates that it will need to bring online 3,000 GWh of renewable energy a year to match the electricity customers use for charging.
The projects announced on Tuesday will meet a third of this by generating more than 1,000 GWh a year, Apple said, adding that it will continue to expand its renewable investment in Europe ahead of 2030.
The tech giant has recently come under scrutiny for its environmental claims amid concerns over some of the nature-based projects in which it invested to offset emissions.
A German court in August ruled that adverts describing the Apple Watch as carbon neutral were misleading, and the firm is currently fighting a class action over a similar issue in the US.
Asked about the legal cases, Ms Jackson told the PA news agency: “We welcome the scrutiny of what we’re doing and we’re trying to be as transparent as possible about how we’re doing it."

Don't take my word for it: The world's five most valuable companies -- each with market caps of more than $2 trillion -- are leading innovators in the field of AI.
AI chipmaker Nvidia recently became the world's largest publicly traded company, valued at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the industry standard for AI workloads. Enterprise and cloud provider Microsoft provides a growing suite of AI tools, whikch has driven its value to $3.9 trillion. With more than 1 billion iPhones in the wild, Apple has a captive audience for its Apple Intelligence (AI) ambitions, pushing its market cap to $3.8 trillion. Cloud and AI leaders Alphabet and Amazon round out the top five, boasting values of $2.9 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.
With a market cap of roughly $1.5 trillion (as of this writing), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.26%), often referred to as TSMC, is on the fast track to join this elite fraternity. The adoption of AI continues at a hectic pace, fueling blistering demand for its most advanced chips. As the world's largest and most renowned semiconductor foundry, TSMC is on the fast track to meet the requirements for membership in this exclusive club -- and it might happen sooner than investors realize.
Want chips with that?
TMSC has worked behind the scenes for years, fabricating the most advanced processors, but recently found itself in the spotlight. Management bills the company as the ""world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry,"" making it a critical provider in the supply chain for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI.
And make no mistake, no foundry is as well-regarded as TSMC. Its customer list reads like the Who's-Who of tech glitterati, and includes Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others.
With the surge in demand for AI-centric processors, TSMC is no longer dependent merely on smartphone chips. In fact, the lion's share of the company's revenue now comes from the advanced processors needed for HPC and AI, recently responsible for 60% of sales.
TSMC's growth continues to accelerate. In the second quarter, revenue of $30 billion grew 44% in U.S. dollars, while earnings per ADR soared 67% to $2.47. Management expects this trend to continue. TSMC is calling for third-quarter revenue of $32.4 billion in USD at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 38%, and the company has been known to underpromise and overdeliver.
The path to $1 trillion
TSMC is in an enviable position as the world scrambles to adopt this groundbreaking technology. The company is well positioned to benefit from advances in generative AI, counting the biggest names in technology as its customers. Furthermore, TSMC's rapid revenue growth is the clearest sign yet that it is poised to profit from this opportunity. As such, TSMC should soon be joining the company of multi-trillionaires.
According to Wall Street, TSMC is on track to generate revenue of $123.3 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 12.8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSMC would have to generate revenue of roughly $156 billion annually to justify a $2 trillion market cap.
It's telling that Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 16% and 18% in 2026 and 2027, respectively. If the company achieves those relatively low hurdles, it will likely achieve a $2 trillion market cap sometime in 2027. That said, given the company's accelerating growth in recent years, it will likely make the grade even sooner.
Estimates regarding the market potential of AI continue to rachet higher. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the coming decade. That could be conservative, as new use cases for AI are continually being developed.
Finally, at roughly 30 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors a practical way to invest in a once-in-a-generation opportunity."

Total UK retail sales increased by 2.3% year on year in September, against growth of 2% in September 2024 and above the 12-month average growth of 2.1%, according to British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG data.
Food sales were up 4.3% year on year, driven largely by inflation rather than volume growth.
Non-food sales growth slowed to 0.7% against growth of 1.7% last September and below the 12-month average growth of 0.9%.
Online non-food sales increased by just 1% against last September’s growth of 3.4% and below the 12-month average growth of 1.8%.
Milder weather meant shoppers delayed refreshing autumn and winter wardrobes, but electrical sales saw a boost due to the release of Apple’s latest iPhone and watch.
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: “With the Budget looming large, and households facing higher bills, retail spending rose more slowly than in recent months.
“Rising inflation and a potentially taxing Budget is weighing on the minds of many households planning their Christmas spending.
“Retailers also face difficult decisions about investment and hiring over the golden quarter given uncertainty over business rates bills arriving in April.
“The future of many large anchor stores and thousands of jobs remains in jeopardy while the Treasury keeps the risk of a new business rates surtax on the table.
“By exempting these shops when the Budget announcements are made, the Chancellor can reduce the inflationary pressures hammering businesses and households alike.”
Linda Ellett, UK head of consumer retail and leisure markets at KPMG, said: “Overall sales grew in September, driven largely by household goods and increased mobile phone sales, as prominent brands launched new models.
“However, non-food sales are only growing by around 1.2% on average, indicating that spending continues to be very targeted as consumers remain cautious.
“As we enter the ‘golden quarter’ for the sector, retailers are planning product ranges and promotions to try and increase that rate of sales growth.
“They are also mindful that the Budget is beginning to move into view, with related detail about business rates reform and a general need for a boost to consumer confidence.”
Separate figures from Barclays show consumer card spending was down by 0.7% year on year in September, a significant drop from the 0.5% growth recorded in August.
Clothing, furniture and beauty all had strong months, however, as consumers prioritised affordable “pick-me-up” purchases amid wider cutbacks."

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ticks higher even as Jefferies warns margins are at risk from the iPhone 17 mix and shifting tariff exposure, trimming its price target to $203.07 from $205.16 and keeping Underperform.
Analysts led by Edison Lee argue smartphone tariff exemptions may change. They flag uncertainty around the U.S.-India and U.S.-China frameworks, note an additional 100% now 30% tariff on Chinese imports, and estimate a 5% FY26 EPS hit if Apple must pay a 130% tariff on iPhone 17 units imported from China. A 20% tariff on Vietnam adds more complexity. They also say Apple's $600 billion U.S. investment does not guarantee exemptions and could invite pressure to assemble more iPhones in the U.S., which would weigh on margin.
Momentum is cooling at the high end. Lead times for 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max have shortened across most tracked markets, with zero wait in the U.K. and Germany. The 17 base model looks strongest, with an estimated 36% FY26 mix versus 32% for the 16 base. The 17 Air remains the weakest with zero lead time in all six markets.
a base heavy mix can compress ASPs just as tariff risk rises. Investors will watch holiday demand, lead time trends, and any policy signals that clarify the tariff path."

Today's Featured Research Reports
Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past year (+7.2% vs. +6.6%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. AAPL now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. Both paid accounts and paid subscriptions grew double digits year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025.
Apple TV+ viewership soared double-digit year over year. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2025) net sales to grow mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. AAPL expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter.
However, gross margin is expected to be 46-47% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, including a tariff impact of $1.1 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern for investors.

Shares of Eli Lilly have gained +7.8% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +8.5%. Demand for the company’s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company’s key top-line drivers. Launches of these drugs in new international markets and improved U.S. supply from ramped-up production led to strong sales in the first half of 2025. Lilly’s other new drugs, like Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca, are also contributing to its top-line growth.
However, data from phase III studies on its weight-loss pill, orforglipron, was mixed. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have declined slightly ahead of Q3 results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.

Visa’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the year-to-date period (+10.2% vs. -6%). The company’s strong market position is underpinned by consistent volume-driven growth, acquisitions and technological leadership in digital payments. Expansion in cross-border volumes, rising transactions and investments in AI and stablecoin infrastructure enhance its future prospects.
A robust financial position with ample liquidity and shareholder returns further supports long-term growth. However, it faces rising client incentives and expenses, which can weigh on margins. Regulatory pressures and potential legislative changes pose additional risks to its fee structure.
While declining cash volumes align with its digital strategy, regional softness warrants monitoring. Moreover, Visa’s premium valuation suggests limited near-term upside. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

For instance, Susquehanna raised their price target to $400 from $300 last week after TSM reported a 31.4% increase in September sales (vs. Sep'24). And the Jan-Sep run-rate compares at +36.4% yoy.
Taiwan Semiconductor, aka TSMC, is the premier chip fabrication company for the world's most advanced digital technologies, from Apple smartphones to NVIDIA GPUs.
In less than five years, TSMC's trailing 12-month revenue has more than doubled to hit nearly $105 billion as of the June quarter. Clearly, this is on the back of NVIDIA's (NVDA) explosive growth which saw sales grow by ten times in the same period to $165 billion as of the July quarter, on its way to cross $205 billion this fiscal year (ends January).
Of course, demand for NVIDIA GPU systems didn't turn into a hockey stick until its ""ChatGPT moment"" in the spring of 2023.
I mark that moment in late May at Computex in Taipei City, Taiwan when Jensen Huang unveiled the DGX Grace Hopper 200 system and said that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms (META) were already in line.
To me, this meant that the other 996 corporations in the Fortune 1,000 would want (or need) to build their own LLMs too. I then published this article and video to explain what was coming...
Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion
And that $2 trillion market cap came quickly. That's when the ""AI bubble"" talk started. You can imagine how astonished the bubble breathers are now that NVDA is approaching a $5 trillion market cap.
""Honey, I Shrunk the Chips!""
While Apple's business has been significant for TSMC (as much as 25% of revenues), the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in the low single digits.
What still makes Apple very important though is how they help drive innovation at TSMC by always demanding the latest and greatest architectures for their ecosystem of devices.
TSMC supplies chips for flagship smartphones and 5G infrastructure, where efficiency and miniaturization are crucial. The company’s 5nm and 3nm transistor nodes are widely adopted in high-end mobile devices and 5G equipment, supporting the global rollout of next-generation connectivity.
Transistor nodes refer to the specific manufacturing processes used to produce integrated circuits, where the ""nm"" (nanometer = 1 billionth of a meter) like 7nm or 5nm, historically represented a physical dimension of the transistor, specifically the gate length. For reference, the coronavirus is about 50nm.
Now it's more of a marketing term that signifies a new generation of chip technology with improved performance, power efficiency, and transistor density.
But generally, a smaller node number means...
Smaller transistors: More transistors can be packed into the same area on a chip.
Faster switching: Electrons have a shorter distance to travel, leading to higher clock speeds.
Lower power consumption: Less voltage is needed to operate the smaller transistors.
Why the AI Economy is Not a Bubble
Which brings us back to NVIDIA as they now pack 208 billion transistors into the Grace Blackwell ""superchip"" with further density on the horizon in the Rubin and Feynman series of GPUs expected in 2026 and 2027, following Jensen's nearly annual cadence of development.
I mentioned the early demand for NVIDIA systems in 2023 and have recently seen similar projections from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Marvell (MRVL) at their Custom AI Investor Event that total datacenter capex by the big ""hyperscalers"" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) plus Meta, Tesla (TSLA), OpenAI, Apple, and xAI, will grow from nearly $600 billion this year to over $1 trillion in 2028.
This demand is not slowing down because all these companies realize that the transition to an ""AI economy"" is built on the infrastructure of NVIDIA GPU systems. I am on record late last year saying that this megatrend would lead to over $500 billion in revenues for NVIDIA by 2030. That's only ~35% CAGR from when the TTM topline crossed $100 billion.
And Citi just updated their industry outlook in their ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Energy"" report. The bank forecasts global AI infra capex at $5.5 trillion cumulative through 2029 (56% CAGR), hitting $2.16T in 2029 alone. So that's a double from 2028's $1 trillion.
And that's the infrastructure to power not just generative and agentic AI systems (i.e., LLMs), but a whole new world of ""physical AI"" for autonomous machines, including self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and many other types of 3D automation requiring ""embodied"" or edge intelligence and vision/spatial perception.
And of course my favorite use cases for these technologies are science and medicine, where researchers can plumb the depths of our existence and come back with wondrous and life-changing knowledge.
The training alone for these worlds requires enormous datasets and compute, using simulation and synthetic models. In this way, Jensen is forging a new universe of possibilities that keep TSMC ""fabs"" humming.
TSMC is the Backbone of the AI Economy
TSMC holds about 67% of the global foundry market and nearly 90% of advanced chip production, making it the preferred manufacturer for high-performance, custom AI accelerators and GPUs.
While NVIDIA designs the magical GPUs and systems that power the innovations of the AI Economy, it all starts with Taiwan Semi's advanced silicon fabrication. This is the epitome of high-tech manufacturing using lithographic etching to create circuits smaller than the eye can see.
And what's better for crafting new chips than brand new ""fabs"" as TSMC just broke ground on their 3rd facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In late June, Softbank's Masayoshi Son announced new plans to invest in a $1 trillion industrial complex in Arizona that will build robots and AI technologies.
Son is seeking to create a version of China's vast manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, which concentrates high-tech companies for proximity of resources, logistics, R&D, collaboration, and talent. TSMC was named as a key partner in Son's plans.
Currently for TSMC, the 5nm and 3nm nodes are the backbone for state-of-the-art AI accelerators, powering chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple that are used in generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.
In Q1 2025, 58% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from 3nm and 5nm nodes, with 73% from 7nm and below, underscoring the centrality of these advanced processes in TSMC's business and the broader tech ecosystem.
But TSMC wouldn't be itself if it wasn't planning to go deeper. The company plans to begin production of its 2nm node by late 2025, promising significant gains in power efficiency and performance. Looking further ahead, mass production of the 1.4nm (14 angstroms) process is slated for 2028, offering 10–15% higher speeds or 25–30% lower energy use compared to 2nm."

Former Apple CEO John Sculley said tech companies making great strides in AI have upset the apple cart for the Cupertino, Calif.–based giant.
Speaking to Fortune’s Diane Brady at the Zeta Live conference in New York on Thursday, he warned Apple was facing its “first real competitor” in “many decades” in OpenAI.
“AI has not been a particular strength for them,” Sculley said of Apple.
Wall Street has mounted pressure on Apple as it struggles to make the same inroads in AI as its Magnificent Seven and private company counterparts. Over the past decade, Apple appeared to make savvy moves in building momentum in AI, launching Siri in 2011 and poaching John Giannandrea from Google in 2018 to be its head of AI.
But the company was caught flat-footed after OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in 2022, and when it finally announced its “Apple Intelligence” AI strategy in June 2024, results fell short. Apple said in June it was delaying its AI upgrades to Siri until 2026, and Giannandrea was sidelined from the project. The company was even considering using Anthropic’s or OpenAI’s AI technology to power Siri over its own in-house models, Bloomberg reported in June.
Even its most recent blowout earnings failed to assuage investors of concerns around not only AI adoption, but also the impact of higher tariffs costing the company $800 million in the previous quarter.
For his part, Cook told investors on Apple’s most recent earnings call that the company is taking steps to both restructure staff internally and acquire other companies to catch up in the AI race.
“We have a great team, and we’re putting all of our energy behind it,” he said.
Meanwhile, Apple stock is down about 1% so far this year, while AI chip leader Nvidia is up nearly 40%, and AI hyperscaler Microsoft, which is also a top OpenAI investor, is up 22%.
Despite Apple’s market cap increasing from $300 billion to $3.2 trillion under Cook’s watch, some have called for the CEO to step aside amid lackluster AI results.
Sculley, who served as CEO of Apple from 1983 to 1993, acknowledged the possibility of Cook’s tenure coming to an end, saying on Thursday that whoever succeeds him should help transition the company from an orientation around apps to agentic AI.
OpenAI takes a bite out of the Apple
It is this push toward agentic AI that has Sculley believing OpenAI presents a real threat to Apple’s competitive prowess. Apps are no longer as effective as a subscription model, he said, which is how OpenAI operates ChatGPT.
“When we had apps at the center of everything, it was selling tools, selling products,” Sculley said. “When you think of subscription, it’s about people paying for something as long as they need it.”"

The brokerage trimmed its price target to $203.07 from $205.16, as President Donald Trump plans to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports from Nov. 1 would put pressure on Apple, which relies heavily on China for iPhone assembly.
Jefferies estimated Apple could see a 5% cut to its fiscal 2026 earnings per share if it had to pay a 130% tariff on about 9 million iPhone 17 units imported from China into the United States. Other products could also be affected if exemptions are removed, the note said.
Apple is unlikely to meet all U.S. demand from its Indian production base in the near term, making it more exposed if tariffs are enforced.
While investors may expect Apple to secure exemptions given its U.S. investment commitments, Jefferies cautioned that the company could face political pressure to shift more production onshore if tensions with China escalate.
Even without tariff, Apple’s latest iPhone lineup carries weaker margins due to product mix and higher costs.
It estimated the iPhone 17’s blended gross margin is 1.7 percentage points below the iPhone 16, with the base model making up a larger share of sales and the premium 17 Pro Max carrying higher bills of materials.
The iPhone 17 Air has the highest margin but is the weakest seller, muting its impact.
Jefferies’ fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue and operating profit forecasts are about 4% below consensus. It expects Apple’s results to show little excitement, citing flat product revenue outside iPhones.
Shares of Apple are up 0.8% at $247.29 on Monday.

The Premium Price for Loyalty
In a capitalistic landscape, brand loyalty is king. However, it is not easy to maintain and remains one of the few sustainable sources of competitive advantage in an ever-growing tech industry. Apple has perfected the art of building a brand that fosters intense loyalty, often at the cost of the consumer’s wallet.
For instance, Apple products tend to be priced at a premium when compared to similar devices from competitors. The iPhone, for example, is known for its high starting prices — prices that continue to rise with each new release. Even after several years, the cost of a new iPhone model can be upward of $1,000 or even $1,500, far more than many Android alternatives that offer similar specifications. This is known as the “Apple tax.”
With rising tariffs and import taxes on tech products, the prices of Apple devices could continue to climb, making your brand loyalty even more expensive than before. Apple’s $500 billion push to expand U.S. manufacturing is meant to counter tariffs and potentially reduce some of the costs in the long term.
However, experts suggest that any savings from these efforts are unlikely to be passed on to consumers. Instead, Apple’s high profit margins and loyal customer base might continue to bear the brunt of rising costs. So, even if Apple succeeds in shifting its supply chain, you could still end up paying more for your favorite products.

The Power of the Apple Ecosystem
One of the key reasons Apple has such a loyal customer base is its unique ecosystem, where products work seamlessly together. The integration between iPhones, Macs, Apple Watches and iPads creates an almost unparalleled user experience. The “it just works” philosophy is a strong pull for many customers, who find it hard to leave the ecosystem once they’ve invested in several Apple devices."

The chief executives of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple and OpenAI treated the US President to a show of fealty worthy of a royal entourage.
The highlight of the trip, on the 18th September, saw Trump and UK Prime Minister Starmer announce the UK US Tech Prosperity Deal, an historic accord for deeper cooperation between the two countries’ technology innovation efforts and a much-needed boost for a UK Labour government failing to deliver on its promise of economic growth.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
The deal aims to give the UK’s tech ecosystem access to US datasets, infrastructure and compute power, as well as collaborative R&D and shared research funding opportunities on quantum, nuclear and AI. It also signals greater collaboration on regulation, national security and the skills needed to advance the UK’s technology sector, according to the official memorandum of understanding.
The deal was accompanied by a raft of US Big Tech investment announcements in the UK’s AI infrastructure. These included a $30bn investment by Microsoft which includes includes building the country’s largest supercomputer in partnership with British company Nscale, a $5bn investment by Google including the opening of a data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, a $1.5bn investment by US datacentre company CoreWeave in Scotland and the establishment of Stargate UK in a collaboration between Nscale, OpenAI and US chipmaker Nvidia.
While policy makers and tech titans alike touted the deal’s mutual benefits there was some scepticism that the US may have more to gain the UK’s cheap land and labour – some even likening the agreement to a Western multinational exploiting developing world resources (with the view that the UK has been much relegated by its economic misfortunes to low value investment location).
Most of the investment focuses on data centre buildouts, with the majority of jobs created during the construction and build out phase as data centre management is not job intensive. The huge infrastructure investment also raises the question of UK energy and water supply being diverted away from local populations in order to facilitate such levels of compute power.

Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataBut above all, these private investments by private companies with global market dominance raise questions around data sovereignty, geopolitical tensions and UK tech increasing becoming a satellite arm of the US rather than a sovereign tech power in its own right.
Across the channel European Union law makers have made a concerted effort to distance their own business ecosystems from the auspices of US Big Tech companies. France and Norway are developing their own sovereign clouds and are involving local partners in the endeavour.
Indeed, some of the Tech Prosperity Deal’s raft of US digital infrastructure investment did include a local partner Nscale, a company seemly sprung from nowhere in 2024. Little is known about this relatively recent newcomer. Nscale chief commercial officer, Karl Havard, has publicly stated that the company is the the UK’s only full-stack, sovereign AI infrastructure provider, telling Capacity in July 2025 that: “This reflects our belief that control over local AI infrastructure and compute is essential to national resilience, economic growth, and global competitiveness.”
Digital sovereignty becomes a business priority
Sovereignty has become an increasingly important issue within the digital economy evinced by the then Conservative UK government’s decision to classify data centres as critical national infrastructure in September 2024. However, economic imperatives mean that the UK government welcomes foreign direct investment in UK digital infrastructure. But are UK businesses concerned whether their data is being stored, processed and managed over US run infrastructure?
Claudio Corbetta, CEO of team.blue says it “absolutely makes a difference” for SMEs. The company’s own research found that nearly three-quarters (73%) of SMEs across the UK and Ireland are concerned about their data being stored in the US. This is also happening in Europe, with 72% of SMEs worried about their data being stored in the US. This anxiety is tied to frameworks like the US Cloud Act and continuing debates over the adequacy of the EU–US and UK–US data transfer arrangements, explains Corbetta. The US Cloud Act gives US law enforcement the power to demand electronic data stored overseas by US companies.
“The sovereignty question for SMEs goes beyond infrastructure capacity. It is about whether they trust that the data falls under either EU and/or UK jurisdiction, or not. What we’re hearing from customers across Europe is that this distinction has direct implications on their ability to adhere to regulations, as well as maintaining and building on consumer trust,” says Corbetta.
Corbetta says that SMEs increasingly see confidence in data sovereignty as a business differentiator, as it’s shaping procurement decisions and customer relationships. “If we take a step back and look at the wider European context, while Big Tech plays a huge role in AI and cloud infrastructure, we’re seeing a shift that provides opportunities for European tech companies. Europe-based providers can compete on capability while offering the certainty that data remains protected under local laws. For many SMEs, that combination of sovereignty and trust is now just as important as performance or price,” says Corbetta.
“From what we’re hearing, company directors and customers are increasingly raising questions about data location, and that pressure is shaping real business decisions.
“For tech leaders, the takeaway is that digital sovereignty is not just a compliance topic, it’s a strategic one. Providers that can combine transparency, guidance, and local hosting solutions are increasingly seen as true partners. Sovereignty isn’t an add-on, but the foundation for sustainable digital growth,” he adds.
UK opportunity for sovereign AI infrastructure
Many British business leaders like Mahdi Yahya, founder and CEO at UK AI specialist data centre provider Ori, sees a clear opportunity arising from the fact that digital sovereignty is increasingly becoming a boardroom priority for UK businesses.
The infrastructure funding announcements in the UK [US UK Prosperity Deal] mark an exciting time for the space, says Yahya, though it’s still a niche market to some extent. And the market potential for a largely UK owned and run AI infrastructure does exist. While the incumbent Big Tech cloud providers dominate, the price point, the fact that Ori’s infrastructure is built ground up specifically for AI and the data sovereignty proposition of using a UK company is what has allowed the company and other players in the space to build successful UK businesses on the back of this demand for specialist AI infrastructure.
Yahya doesn’t see the demand opportunity decreasing any time soon. “The big buying factor for a lot of enterprises, especially in Europe and Middle East, is around the sovereignty of infrastructure,” he says.
“AI will have access to and will be interacting with all the data that you have. And so, whether you’re a government entity, or an enterprise in a regulated sector, or operating in compliance heavy sector, it becomes extremely important to know where the infrastructure is and what control there is over the infrastructure.
“And many governments in Europe, specifically, and enterprises in Europe now have mandates that they need to be working with cloud providers that are local or sovereign for this precise reasons,” adds Yahya.
How would a smaller UK industry compete with big US cloud players on AI infrastructure? “It’s impossible for them to overcome the sovereignty issue, because obviously they’re US controlled,” he says.
“Some customers we talk to are adamant that they don’t want to be working with a provider that is subject to the US cloud act, for example, and the US cloud players are still subject to that. So that removes that portion of the market for them,” he explains.
And then the other big differentiator, or opportunity, is around performance specialisation of a company like Ori that was built from the ground up with AI in mind. “Like any industry, you have incumbents, and then a new technology that comes to light, and along with that come new players with a more differentiated offering, with a more performant offering, a more cost-effective offering, and that’s where we are at the moment,” he says.
Build British Big Tech
British veteran entrepreneur and CEO of AI research engine Corpora.ai, Mel Morris, sees the UK’s massive investment focus on AI infrastructure as “a wakeup call in terms of what we spend our money on”.
In Morris’s view, UK investment patterns are simply following prevailing trends and lack innovative foresight. “The money is following the fashion. The fashion says, get Jensen Huang over here, let’s put $5bn to get some GPUs in place and build a big data centre. Meanwhile, we’re seeing small entrepreneurial startups, with game changing technology that potentially could double the gross domestic product of this country, struggling to get heard and to get financed.”
Morris’s call to action is to reframe the UK’s focus on AI infrastructure to encompass a wider, more innovation first approach.
“Forget the amount of GPUs. In three years they’ll be worth nothing, because you’ll need them to be ten times faster and a tenth of the price. Let’s focus on what are small amounts of money, relatively speaking, that we could spend to build sovereignty, to build the technologies that allow us to compete, because at the moment, we’re [the UK] a net importer of AI tech, and I think that’s a dangerous place to be.”"

Prompt’s leadership informed staff of the pending transaction at an all‑hands meeting on 9 October 2025, and advised employees to keep the situation confidential while they seek other roles or inform friends and family, the audio indicates.
Managers said staff who do not join Apple will be paid a reduced salary and were encouraged to apply for open positions at Prompt during the transition, the recording shows.
Executives said investors will receive some payment from the transaction but “won’t be made whole,” according to the meeting.
Attendees reported that other suitors, including Elon Musk’s xAI and Neuralink, had approached Prompt about possible deals.
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataFounded in 2023, Prompt secured $5m in a seed round held during the same year. This early funding round was led by AIX and Abstract Ventures.
The company is led by co‑founders Tete Xiao, its CEO and a University of California, Berkeley computer science PhD, and Trevor Darrell, its president and a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.
Prompt’s primary product, Seemour is designed to connect to home security cameras. It adds computer vision features that identify specific people, pets and objects, generate text descriptions of activity and send alerts.
Company leaders told staff that while the technology and app worked as intended, the business model had failed.
They plan to retire Seemour and notify users that their data will be deleted and handled in line with privacy commitments, executives said.
Sources familiar with the talks said Prompt’s technology and personnel would likely be folded into Apple’s HomeKit smart home division if the agreement proceeds.
The discussions illustrate a pattern in which large tech firms acquire small AI teams and assets to integrate capability into existing products.
Such transactions have tended to be smaller than recent high‑profile deals in the sector, such as Meta’s $14.3bn investment in Scale AI and Google’s $2.4bn arrangement tied to Windsurf."

The event comes just as concerns are building that Oracle is sacrificing profitability for growth from renting computing power to AI companies like OpenAI. Last week, the Information reported Oracle’s cloud margins are lower than many on Wall Street are modeling, sending Oracle shares down as much as 7.1% on Tuesday. Even though the stock quickly recovered the losses, there are lingering questions about the economics of the business, which Oracle has forecast will see revenue jump 700% in the coming three fiscal years.
“There are absolutely investors who are concerned about margins, or concerned its targets are very aggressive,” said Mark Martiak, senior partner and financial adviser at Prudential Advisors, whose parent company has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management. “This is an opportunity for Oracle to ease concerns, since a lot of skeptics see the valuation as stretched, especially if a mega-deal like the one it has with OpenAI doesn’t deliver sustained revenue.”
Tuesday will feature a keynote address from recently named co-CEO Mike Sicilia, as well as one from founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison, whose stake in Oracle briefly made him the world’s richest person last month. On Thursday, an investor day is expected to bring updated financial targets.
Hopes are high among many on Wall Street. The conference will be “a major catalyst where the company will clarify many of these debates,” Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi wrote in a note last week, referring to questions over margins. Bernstein’s Mark Moerdler expects “additional details which should help put some of these issues to bed.”
Heavy demand for cloud computing has boosted Oracle’s overall sales, but the big investments required to support it have weighed on profitability. Oracle’s revenue growth is projected to jump to 17% in its current fiscal year, from 8% the year before, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. However, gross margin, which excludes operating expenses, is expected to fall more than 2 percentage points to 68.4%. As recently as fiscal 2021, Oracle’s gross margin was above 80%."

TAIPEI (Reuters) -TSMC, the world's largest manufacturer of advanced artificial intelligence chips, is expected to post a 28% jump in third-quarter profit to a record due to the insatiable demand for AI infrastructure, though U.S. tariffs could impact its outlook.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's No. 1 contract chipmaker and a key supplier to Nvidia and Apple, is forecast to report a net profit of T$415.4 billion ($13.55 billion) for the three months through September 30, according to an LSEG SmartEstimate compiled from 20 analysts.
SmartEstimates place greater weight on forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.
TSMC has already flagged a market-forecast-beating rise in third-quarter revenue of 30%. Any profit result above T$398.3 billion would mark the company's highest-ever quarterly net income and its seventh consecutive quarter of profit growth.
Mario Morales, group vice president at research firm IDC, said he expects TSMC's revenue to grow at least 30% to 35% this year.
""I am expecting that TSMC will continue to outperform its peers given the ongoing exponential growth of AI infrastructure investments and that the leading chip suppliers such as Nvidia and AMD have only one place to go - TSMC,"" he said.
Morales said that even as tariffs and trade disputes add uncertainty, AI infrastructure remains a ""strategic land grab"" for cloud-service providers, manufacturers and companies, ensuring investment continues to concentrate in that space.
TSMC, Asia's most valuable listed company with a market capitalisation of around $1.22 trillion - nearly three times that of South Korean rival Samsung Electronics - is due to report on Thursday and will provide fourth-quarter guidance in an earnings call scheduled for 0600 GMT.
It remains unclear how much U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs will affect TSMC. Taiwan's exports to the United States are currently subject to a 20% tariff, but that excludes chips.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick proposed last month that Taiwanese companies split their production of chips 50-50 between Taiwan and the U.S., compared to the current setup where the vast majority of the production is on the island.
Taiwan has rejected that idea, and TSMC is already investing $165 billion building factories in the U.S. in the state of Arizona.
Shares in TSMC have gained 30% so far this year on optimism over AI, largely brushing off tariff concerns. The heavyweight's rise has powered the benchmark Taiwanese index's 16.9% advance over the same period."

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) edged higher at the close of Monday's session in London, but underperformed against other European markets.
On Friday, Trump reignited his trade war in response to Beijing enforcing tighter export controls on rare earth materials, which are vital in the production of everything from cars to solar panels. But on Sunday he signalled he would be open to talks with his counterpart Xi Jinping.
He wrote on Truth Social: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”
Richard Galvin, co-founder of hedge fund DACM, said the rebound was ""driven by a conciliatory message from Trump”.
Goldman Sachs (GS) chief economist Jan Hatzius said he expected that both sides would eventually agree to extend their tariff pause beyond the 10 November deadline amid ""limited concessions from both sides”.

“However, the recent policy moves suggest a wider range of outcomes than was the case ahead of prior US-China talks, with the possibility of greater concessions but also a risk of substantial new export restrictions and higher tariffs, at least temporarily,"" he added.
Defence stocks came under pressure during the session as hopes of an end to hostilities in Gaza grew, with Babcock (BAB.L), BAE Systems (BA.L) and Rolls Royce (RR.L) at the bottom of the UK basket. Fresnillo (FRES.L) was the top gainer on the FTSE 100 after a short squeeze for silver.
The gains on Wall Street came even as Morgan Stanley warned that US stocks could fall sharply if Trump and his Chinese counterpart do not settle their differences. The bank said on Monday that shares could drop as much as 11% if a resolution to the latest trade dispute is not resolved before the 10 November deadline.
Michael Wilson, chief US equity strategist, said: “If associated trade uncertainty/volatility continue into early November, we could see a larger correction than most are expecting.”
He forecast that the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could fall to between 6,027 and 5,800 points, which represents an 8% to 11% sell-off from Friday’s close.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-13T07:15:00,"3 Stocks That Turned $1,000 Into $1 Million (or More)","Coca-Cola, Walmart, and Apple all generated millionaire-making gains for long-term investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=84ac359fdd5ff9b3bdcdb289bd364a6c24fc1e0674cefa74b3353dea46f08b28,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/3-stocks-that-turned-1000-into-1-million-or-more/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/3-stocks-that-turned-1000-into-1-million-or-more/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/3-stocks-that-turned-1000-into-1-million-or-more/,fool.com,200,,"Many investors dream of churning a modest $1,000 investment into $1 million. But only a handful of companies have achieved those millionaire-making gains since their initial public offerings (IPOs).
Companies that deliver those kinds of returns have resilient brands, wide moats, and the scale to dilute their own costs while fending off their competitors.
So today, let's take a closer look at a trio of millionaire-maker stocks that still have those advantages: Coca-Cola (KO -0.21%), Walmart (WMT 1.36%), and Apple (AAPL 0.58%).
1. Coca-Cola
Coca-Cola went public at $40 in 1919. After 11 stock splits, a single IPO share would have blossomed into 9,216 shares worth roughly $610,000 today. A $1,000 investment in its IPO would have grown to $15.2 million and would be generating more than $470,000 in annual dividends.
Coca-Cola established an early mover's advantage in the soda market more than a century ago, and it's now the world's largest beverage maker. It only sells concentrates and syrups, while independent bottling partners actually produce and distribute the finished beverages. That capital-light business model enables it to generate stable profits and reliable dividends. That's why it's a Dividend King that has raised dividends annually for 63 consecutive years.
To counter declining soda consumption rates, Coca-Cola expanded its beverage portfolio with more brands of fruit juices, teas, bottled water, sports drinks, energy drinks, and even alcohol. It now sells more than 200 brands of drinks worldwide, and that scale and diversification reduces its concentration risk and strengthens its defenses against other beverage makers. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Coca-Cola's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11%. It's still reasonably valued at 21 times next year's earnings, and it should remain a safe evergreen stock to buy in both bull and bear markets.
2. Walmart
Walmart went public at $16.50 per share in 1970. It then split its stock 12 times and turned a single share into 6,144 shares -- which are worth about $620,000 today. A $1,000 investment in its IPO would be worth $37.6 million today and paying nearly $338,500 in dividends each year.
Walmart opened its first discount store in 1962, but it's now the world's largest retailer with more than 10,750 stores and warehouse clubs across 19 countries. Its Sam's Club stores compete against Costco Wholesale in the warehouse club market, and it also operates a broad range of e-commerce websites and smaller regional banners.
Walmart initially scaled up its business by focusing on rural markets that were overlooked by larger retailers. By keeping its distribution centers close to its retail stores, it created a hub-and-spoke model that reduced its logistics expenses. As the company opened more stores, it gained more clout to negotiate lower prices with suppliers to support its ""everyday low prices"" strategy. It was also one of the first retailers to use computers to track its sales and inventories in real time. It continues to expand its e-commerce ecosystem and use its stores as fulfillment centers for its online orders.
From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028 (which ends in January 2028), analysts expect Walmart's EPS to grow at a CAGR of 10%. It might not seem like a bargain at 35 times next year's earnings, but its scale, diversification, and resilient growth should all justify that higher valuation.
3. Apple
Apple went public at $22 in 1980. It subsequently split its stock five times, so a single share in its IPO would have grown to 224 shares worth roughly $57,000 today. A $1,000 investment in its IPO would be worth $2.54 million and paying more than $10,000 in annual dividends.
Apple rose to prominence as a maker of personal computers. But after two disappointing product launches (the Lisa and the Macintosh), its board of directors fired its co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs, in 1985. Apple continued to struggle for more than a decade before it brought Jobs back as its interim CEO in 1997.
After returning to Apple, Jobs led the company through its launches of the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which transformed it from a dusty old computer maker into a creator of sleek forward-thinking devices. Apple didn't invent the MP3 player, smartphone, or tablet computer, but it shrewdly disrupted those markets with its user-friendly devices and sticky software ecosystems.
By the time Jobs died in 2011, Apple had evolved from a tech brand into a luxury brand. Jobs' successor, Tim Cook, stuck to that playbook and continued expanding its lineup of high-end gadgets, nurturing its brand appeal, and locking in its users with stickier services.
From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in September 2027), analysts expect Apple's EPS to grow at a CAGR of 13% as it launches new iPhones, expands its services ecosystem, and strengthens the walls of its walled garden with more AI-powered services. It might seem a bit pricey at 32 times next year's earnings, but Apple should continue to expand and evolve with new devices and subscription-based services."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-13T05:01:00,5 reasons why we spend more in the afternoon – and how to keep it under control,"Credit card spending hits a peak every afternoon, according to new data – here are five reasons why and some tips for keeping this spending under control.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=87433e6e29784ab753ab764639b6ad24159ee811f7ceec1f9dba39004d35bd00,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/spend-more-peak-times-keep-under-control-050100929.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/spend-more-peak-times-keep-under-control-050100929.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/spend-more-peak-times-keep-under-control-050100929.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Credit card spending hits a peak every afternoon. The government data boffins have examined the times when most credit card transactions take place, and in most areas, the afternoon was the busiest. In some areas this was swiftly followed by lunchtime, whereas in others the evenings took second place.
This is a useful window into the five reasons we spend more at these peak times of day – and how to keep this spending under control.
1. We spend when we’re tired
Most people have a natural slump in the afternoon, as their body’s natural rhythms demand a nap and our working day insists that we crack on. It’s why we’re at risk of doing the things that give us a pick-me-up, like eating sweet things, or doing a spot of online shopping.
Read more: How Instagram affects our spending
If you know this is a risk for you, try to find more positive solutions – like going for a brisk walk – away from the shops. You can also make changes to your diet, and make sure you are properly hydrated – both of which help keep the peaks and troughs under control.
2. We’re looking for variety
The afternoon energy dip tends to lead us to seek stimulation, which is why we’re more likely to look for variety at this time of day. If you don’t think this applies to you, consider how often you have something different for breakfast compared to lunch and dinner. We’re looking for something new, which can lead to us shopping for it.
If this is a risk for you, and you need to go shopping, plan it for the morning, when you’ll find it much easier to stick to a list.
3. We shop to reward ourselves
Life can be full of little trials, at home and at work, so towards the end of the day, we might feel we deserve a reward. If we don’t stop to think about it, this can easily translate into shopping.
Take the time to consider some alternatives. Can you reward yourself by doing something nice for yourself that doesn’t come with a price tag?
4. We spend when it’s easy
Lunchtime shopping and early evening spending are often the result of proximity. We’re hard-wired to browse as we pass shops, or as we scroll through brands on social media on the bus. It’s often a small step from there to spending.
Read more: Why taxes will rise after the budget, and how to protect yourself
If this is a risk for you, consider routes that take you past shops that aren’t a temptation, and set yourself social media rules. If you’re only allowed to play games on your phone or listen to books or podcasts on your commute, it saves you from shopping.
5. We spend when we’re bored
This lies behind an awful lot of shopping, especially when we’re too tired to do anything meaningful in the afternoon, or when we’re lounging on the sofa in the evening. Now the shops are at our fingertips, it’s easy to spend without thinking about it."

Blow-out quarterly earnings estimates from American software and cloud services specialist Oracle, a $100bn (£75bn) investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI by silicon chip designer Nvidia and, in reverse, the purchase of a 10pc stake by OpenAI in another semiconductor maker, AMD, are all keeping the artificial intelligence (AI) pot boiling, so far as stock markets are concerned.
The magnificent seven of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla now have an aggregate stock market capitalisation of $21tn – or 36pc of the S&P 500 index’s total value. Their spending on AI and their share prices are firing US economic growth, which continues to shrug off tariff turmoil, corporate earnings – and thus, the US stock market.
In theory, where the US goes, the rest are sure to follow. America is the world’s largest economy and home to its biggest stock market, biggest bond market and its reserve currency the dollar, all of which count for rather a lot. Many headline stock indices are cruising to new highs, including our very own FTSE 100.
Yet someone is worried. The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), released last Wednesday, offer warnings of increased risks of a sharp pullback in global share prices. The question now, as one email sent to this column immediately reflected, is whether this is a timely alert or a repeat of Alan Greenspan’s “irrational exuberance” speech of 1996. The then-Federal Reserve chair cautioned about the dangers of a galloping stock market, only for share prices to continue rising, not peaking until 39 months later.
Uncanny echoes
The FPC’s frets about the sky-high valuations of anything AI carry uncomfortable echoes of the technology, media and telecoms (TMT) – or dotcom – bubble that inflated over the 1990s, popped in 2000 and bottomed in 2002. It then took America’s technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index, the poster child for the bubble, until April 2015 to return to its March 2000 high, teaching investors a painful lesson of the perils of choosing narrative over valuation.
Greenspan had, in the eyes of some, tried to calm animal spirits before the bubble even got going – and with good reason. Just eight months after the Fed chair spoke, trouble blew in from an unexpected quarter when Thailand devalued the baht. Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia quickly followed with the rupiah, won and ringgit, and the Asian debt crisis began to roil markets."

U.S. stocks rallied Monday after President Donald Trump said ” it will all be fine,” just days after he sent the market reeling by threatening much higher tariffs on China.
The S&P 500 jumped 1.6% in its best day since May and recovered just over half its drop from Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 587 points, or 1.3%, and the Nasdaq composite leaped 2.2%.
“Don’t worry about China,” Trump said on his social media platform Sunday. He also said that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, “doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”
It was a sharp turnaround from the anger Trump displayed on Friday, when the S&P 500 tumbled to its worst drop since April after he accused China of “ a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.”
Trump pointed to “an extremely hostile letter” from China describing curbs to exports of rare earths, which are materials used in the manufacturing of everything from personal electronics to jet engines. Trump said at the time that he may place an additional 100% tax on imports from China starting on Nov. 1.
For its part, China urged the United States to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats. “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online.
Hours later, Trump posted his less confrontational talk about China on Truth Social. The backtrack in anger, which also came before trading began on Wall Street, raised hopes that the world’s two largest economies could find a way to allow global trade to continue smoothly.
The down-and-up moves for the market echoed its manic swings during April. That’s when Trump shocked investors with his “Liberation Day” announcement of worldwide tariffs, only to eventually relent on many to give time to negotiate trade deals with other countries.
If this time ends up similarly, potentially even after a sharp drop for stock prices, subsiding trade tensions and uncertainty could allow for a rolling recovery to continue into 2026, according to Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson.
To be sure, the U.S. stock market may have been primed for a drop. It was already facing criticism that prices had shot too high following a torrid 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April. The index, which dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts, is still near its all-time high set last week.
Not only did Trump’s backdown from tariffs help stocks soar since April, so did expectations for several cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to help the economy."

The latest product announcements, including AI-powered security tools and deeper partnerships, provide a proof point for Jamf’s strides in maintaining relevance, however, these developments may not significantly move the needle against near-term threats from native Apple solutions or bundled UEM competition.
The unveiling of Jamf’s advanced API ecosystem is especially relevant. This innovation could further strengthen Jamf’s ability to offer differentiated integration and automation for IT and security teams, supporting the company's bid to stay ahead as organizations seek more seamless, unified device management, a key catalyst behind recent enterprise wins.
Yet, on the other hand, investors should be aware that if Apple continues enhancing its native device management tools, the potential for product commoditization could become a bigger issue for Jamf’s long-term revenue prospects...

Daniel Newman, The Futurum Group CEO, said in a recent program on Schwab Network that things are “tough” for Apple because the market might not be excited to invest in the stock despite its new iPhone 17.
“I think the problem with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is that everything that’s showing up today is in fact pretty incremental. Yes, the phone is thinner and yes, it looks great. We haven’t had a big super cycle in four years. We were sort of told that, hey, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) intelligence last year was going to drive this big cycle. It didn’t really accomplish that. Now we’ve got the thinnest phone ever, longest battery, does that drive a super cycle? And of course, we’re waiting for price because we want to know, do these phones slightly longer battery, slightly nicer screen, maybe a bit more durable, are people going to run out and buy them? And if they’re going to charge more, if tariffs are going to start to impact, that may be a problem, too. So, I think it’s a tough position. The announcements have been good, but I think with everything Nvidia is doing and everything Google’s doing right now, it’s hard for that investor to say, ‘I want to put a dollar here into Apple.'”

Early indicators point to a strong consumer response to the latest iPhone 17. However, can this enthusiasm lift the stock in the long term, especially when the company is falling behind in the AI race?
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can only do so much in innovation to revolutionize its iPhone each year. A UBS survey shows that the iPhone upgrade cycle has reached 35 months in the US. A separate report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners says about 63% of iPhone users keep their smartphones for more than two years. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is losing its pricing edge as it has to put a cap on its price tags to compete in key markets like China. Samsung, Xiaomi and other companies can launch advanced hardware and software features to compete with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and keep the company under pressure in Asia.
Macquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined in the quarter and meaningfully underperformed the S&P 500. The security contributed to relative performance due to our underweighting, approximately 50% lower than the benchmark weight. While Apple continues to have laudable attributes and strong repurchase intent, the company is failing to grow at historical rates given the maturation of many key products.”"

Most of that gain came following big funding news for the rare earth metals producer, which is still in the early stages of its development.
With such a quick and dramatic price advance, there's a good reason to consider locking in profits with a sale. But if you are a long-term investor, there's an equally good reason to hold on to the stock.
What does MP Materials do?
MP Materials mines for and processes rare earth metals. These metals are vital to modern technology, making the cellphones in your pocket work and the missiles that defend your country fly. They are important for everyday life and for those episodes when a nation needs to defend itself. Having a reliable supply of rare earth metals is vital.
This is a problem because China is the world's largest provider of rare earth metals. It has had no qualms leveraging this fact when it deals with other nations. For example, during the recent tensions over tariffs, China has chosen to put limits on rare earth metals. It is not the first time this has happened. That has tech companies and entire countries worried about the safety of their rare earth metals supply.
Perhaps the most notable thing about MP Materials' business is where it is located. Operating largely in the United States, it is in an economically and financially stable region of the world. And as such, it should be a reliable provider to its customers. At the very least, it offers a secondary source of rare earth metals that should avoid the complications of being operated within a country known for using these materials as a bargaining chip.
Why you should hold MP Materials
All of the recent excitement around MP Materials really started when the U.S. government made a large investment in the business. That was quickly followed up with a supply agreement with Apple. And the price advance from these two deals led to the public sale of MP Materials stock, which was in such demand that the sale was upsized. All in all, the company raised around $1.5 billion.
The problem is that much of this money is going to go toward the capital investments needed to grow MP Materials' business. It is, at this point, still a money-losing start-up. It has a huge opportunity ahead, but that opportunity is likely to take years to develop. The price increase on the funding events is pricing in a lot of good news that simply has yet to transpire.
That's why investors who were hoping for quick gains might want to sell the stock. However, if you think in decades and not days, there's a long-term growth opportunity with MP Materials. And that opportunity, as noted, will play out over time because it simply takes time to build the type of mining and processing business that MP Materials is hoping to eventually operate.
The real benefit of all of the fresh capital is on the balance sheet. But most growth investors are likely to focus on the income statement, which will see little near-term benefit. What MP Materials now has is the cash it needs to keep moving its business forward as it looks to take advantage of the long-term demand that exists for rare earth metals. And given that there's really only one major supplier today, it has ample opportunity to take market share as it invests in its operations in the years ahead.
Short-term versus long-term
Whether or not you want to hold on to or sell MP Materials stock is likely to depend on your time frame. The stock is up a lot in a short period of time, but the long-term opportunity could be very large once the company has built out its business. That process will probably take years, and the swift stock advance has priced in at least some of the opportunity.
But it seems highly probable that there's a lot more opportunity here as the world looks to diversify its rare earth metals supply. Only that opportunity won't take shape over three months; it will play out over years and perhaps even decades. And that's a good reason to keep holding onto MP Materials stock, but only if you are a long-term investor."

This includes Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, which are together known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" There are others now part of the trillion-dollar club, but these are among the more notable names.
The list may get even bigger in the years ahead, as many businesses are growing and benefiting from feverish spending on artificial intelligence (AI). There's one unstoppable company that's doing well due to that trend, and which looks set to join the club in the near future: Oracle (ORCL 1.10%). Here's why it may not be too late to invest in this promising tech stock.
Oracle has become a key player in the AI boom
For years, Oracle has been known as a big name in databases and providing companies with the critical backend services and infrastructure they need to manage all their data. It still serves that purpose today, plus it also offers key products and services, which help its customers manage AI workloads.
Its new Oracle AI World, for instance, will allow its customers to use large language models to analyze existing databases. The big advantage with Oracle is that unlike many big tech companies, it's agnostic to the whole chatbot market; it isn't developing one of its own, and it's there to simply provide customers with the AI-powered products and services they need. It also has AI agents that can help to automate tasks and add efficiency.
And its efforts have been paying off. Last month, the company reported its latest quarterly results (for the period ending Aug. 31) and demand remains robust, with CEO Safra Catz noting that it ""signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1."" It expects even more large contracts to be signed in the future. And its contract backlog has skyrocketed by 359% year over year, totaling $455 billion.
Oracle's quarterly revenue totaled $14.9 billion and rose 12% year over year. Its cloud segment led the way, as sales in that business unit came in at $7.2 billion and were up by 28%.
The company also generates terrific profit margins, as its net income during the period was $2.9 billion, which is comparable to what it generated in the prior-year period. The bottom line would have been larger, however, if not for an increase in restructuring expenses, as the company has been reducing its workforce in an effort to improve efficiency.
Why a $1 trillion valuation may be just an inevitability at this point
Oracle's market cap as of the end of Monday was around $820 billion. For it to hit a $1 trillion valuation, it would need to rise by another 22% from that. In just the past year, its shares have soared more than 70%. And with tech companies continuing to invest heavily into AI, Oracle looks poised to benefit from those growth opportunities.
It may not happen soon, and it could take a couple of years, as the stock has already risen so fast. It's currently trading around its all-time highs, and its price-to-earnings multiple of 66 doesn't look cheap at all. As a result, growth investors may be thinking twice about the stock, and that could lead to limited gains, at least in the short term.
But with so much growth still out there, it may truly be an inevitability before Oracle reaches $1 trillion. According to analysts from the MarketsandMarkets, the global cloud AI market is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.4% until 2029. It's a staggering level of growth, with Oracle right in the middle of it all.
Oracle's still a good buy today
Although you may be tempted to pass on Oracle's stock because its valuation is a bit rich, over the long term, there's still much more runway for it to become more valuable. The important role it plays in tech makes it a solid investment, particularly due to its close relationship with other tech giants.
Oracle's solid fundamentals and AI-powered growth makes it a great investment to add to your portfolio today, especially if you're looking for an AI stock that still has a lot of upside left."

Add this to more items in the lineup, and it's no surprise this business is a consumer favorite.
Without a doubt, hardware is important to Apple's success. But here's a number that every shareholder should keep an eye on.
Apple's services are a critical component of the business
Investors should be paying close attention to revenue trends within Apple's services segment.
During the third quarter, services, which include advertising, cloud, Music, Pay, and TV+ (among others), raked in $27.4 billion in sales, up 13% year over year. This revenue figure was 108% higher than the same period five years ago, a much faster pace of growth than the products division.
Services introduce recurring revenue, allowing the company to lower dependence on less predictable hardware sales. Services are also significantly more profitable, with a gross margin that's above 70%.
""We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform,"" CFO Kevan Parekh said on the Q3 2025 earnings call. Ongoing success in services means that Apple's ecosystem is in strong shape, as users are increasingly interacting with its devices. This supports the company's economic moat."

The Billionaire Legend Dumps $122 Billion of This Key Holding While Buying $4 Billion of These Out-of-Favor Stocks.,Buffett loves these companies with wide moats but beaten-down stock prices.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4c58c9c6dafab922f41db3b5987c7e46dae2ab7437445f465154531aa1de4396,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/does-warren-buffett-know-something-wall-street-doe/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/does-warren-buffett-know-something-wall-street-doe/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/does-warren-buffett-know-something-wall-street-doe/,fool.com,200,,"Warren Buffett has never been afraid to go against the grain. He once summarized Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy as, ""We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.""
That's resulted in some very notable moves from the Oracle of Omaha over the last few years. As many large-cap stocks have seen their valuations climb higher and higher amid unbounded investor optimism, Buffett has been a notable seller. In fact, he's sold more stock than he bought for Berkshire Hathaway in each of the last 11 quarters.
The most notable stock sale in that period is Apple (AAPL 0.41%), which at one point accounted for more than half of Berkshire's marketable equity portfolio. Buffett started selling the stock in late 2023, and he's since sold nearly 70% of Berkshire's stake in the business. In total, those stock sales raised an estimated $122 billion in cash based on the weighted average stock price. The actual sales price for each lot is unknown.
In the meantime, however, Buffett has started piling into two out-of-favor stocks, finding a few opportunities to be greedy where others are fearful.
Buffett's massive stock sale
Buffett's investment in Apple may go down as one of his greatest purchases of all time. He initially bought the stock in 2016, when investors were downbeat on the company's ability to keep growing. As a result, they assigned the stock a dirt cheap single-digit forward earnings multiple, which looked appealing to Buffett.
The stock has soared since then. The company's revenue and operating income continued growing and management has returned hundreds of billions back to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, supporting strong earnings-per-share growth.
But a good chunk of Apple's share price appreciation has come from multiple expansion. The stock now trades for 32 times forward earnings. While Apple has seen its operating margin expand thanks to its fast-growing services segment, and EPS gets an additional boost as it uses its massive free cash flow to buy back shares, that earnings multiple may be a bit of a reach for a value-focused investor like Buffett.
Buffett has a second reason for selling Apple, though. The current tax law requires Berkshire Hathaway to pay just 21% on its capital gains. That's the lowest corporate tax rate since the 1930s. Considering the rising debt level of the U.S. government, Buffett doesn't think that's a sustainable rate for very long, despite new tax legislation extending that rate this year.
So, an expensive stock and a low tax rate makes for an opportune time to lock in gains on a successful investment. While much of the cash raised from Berkshire's Apple sales has gone into short-term Treasury bills, Buffett has found a few stocks to buy in recent quarters. Since late 2024, he's put about $4 billion of Berkshire's cash to work in two stocks the market has beaten down.
Buffett's latest big buy
Last quarter, Buffett took the opportunity to add UnitedHealth (UNH 0.75%) to Berkshire's portfolio, investing about $1.5 billion into the stock by my estimate. Not only is UnitedHealth a member of an industry that hasn't seen stock multiples explode higher over recent years, it's also faced some headwinds that have resulted in many investors punishing the stock.
As with other health insurance companies, United has seen utilization rates increase while medical costs rise, producing a double whammy for its earnings results. The company's net margin fell to 3.1% last quarter, down from 4.3% a year ago. Moreover, management withdrew its financial outlook earlier this year before revising it down. It now expects full-year earnings per share of $16, down from $27.66 in 2024.
UnitedHealth also suffers from an overhang of an ongoing investigation into its Medicare Advantage program. If the courts rule against United, it could be on the hook to repay billions in premiums plus face additional fines.
Despite those headwinds, the company still holds considerable long-term competitive advantages in the industry thanks to the size of its network and the cost advantages of scale. With an aging population, the managed health services industry should experience strong growth over the coming years, and UnitedHealth is well positioned to take advantage of that trend.
A new position brewing in Berkshire's portfolio
Another big purchase for Buffett and his team over the last few quarters comes from an industry that's not necessarily great for your health. Since the fourth quarter last year, Berkshire's put an estimated $2.6 billion to work buying beer brewer Constellation Brands (STZ -2.63%).
Constellation owns the rights to distribute top Mexican beer brands, Modelo, Corona, and Pacifico in the United States. Thanks in part to its national advertising campaigns to position those brands as premium beers, it absolutely dominates the market for imported beers.
Unfortunately, the entire industry faces several headwinds that are weighing on Constellation's earnings. 2025 has brought with it growing macroeconomic and sociopolitical uncertainty, especially among the Hispanic population that accounts for a huge portion of Constellation's sales. On top of that, younger Americans aren't as interested in drinking beer, favoring ready-to-drink cocktails and nonalcoholic beverages.
While Constellation was able to fend off those headwinds over the last few years, growing its market share while raising prices, the trends have caught up to it in 2025. Sales volume for its beer segment declined 7% last quarter, and management expects full year sales to fall 2% to 4%. Overall, management expects adjusted EPS to fall roughly 17% this year.
The strength of Constellation's brands and improvements in the macroeconomic environment should enable it to return to earnings growth over the long run. In the meantime, it's another opportunity for Buffett to add to a growing position.
It's worth noting Constellation Brands' stock remains below Berkshire's initial purchase price. UnitedHealth shares, meanwhile, have rallied higher since Berkshire's disclosure in August. As such, Constellation may present a better opportunity for investors looking to follow in Buffett's footsteps."

This is a high-quality company, so much so that it remains Warren Buffett's choice as Berkshire Hathaway's largest position.
The stock has been a big winner, which should surprise absolutely no one. It's up 124% since early October 2020 (as of Oct. 8, 2025). But, past results aren't indicative of forward returns. So where will Apple shares be five years from now?
Apple might trail the market the rest of the decade
There are two key factors that could get in the way of Apple's stock continuing its winning ways and generating a market-beating return between now and the fall of 2030.
The first headwind is slower growth prospects. In the last three years, sales have increased by just 13%. It's hard to convince consumers to keep upgrading to the latest devices, especially with the lack of revolutionary new features.
Another headwind comes down to valuation. It's not controversial at all to say that Apple shares aren't cheap. They trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39.2, which is near a 10-year peak. The previously mentioned favorable qualities might mean the company is deserving of this valuation, but there's a good chance that the multiple contracts in the years ahead.

Since then, it's been joined by other companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Of course, the list also includes the current market-cap leader, Nvidia.
It's becoming increasingly normal for a new company to join the $1 trillion club. But it remains an impressive feat nevertheless. At this pace, these tech titans could be joined by brick-and-mortar giant Walmart (WMT 1.30%) in 2026.
Over the past 15 years, Walmart stock has risen by 470%. The company has also been a steady dividend payer over this time. For investors who bought, held, and reinvested the dividends along the way, returns were even better with a 680% gain.
Stocks that post strong long-term gains, as Walmart stock has, often decide to undergo stock splits, bringing the price per share down due to a higher number of shares overall. Walmart has done this many times in its history, including a 3-for-1 stock split in 2024.
As of this writing, Walmart has a market cap of $820 billion. Therefore, to reach $1 trillion in 2026, it would need to appreciate by about 22% in less than 15 months. Is this really possible? It's not a sure thing, but it may be easier than some investors think.
How Walmart can reach $1 trillion
At a high level, stocks tend to go up when profit potential goes up. Perhaps profit potential goes up because a business is about to reach a new scale thanks to new locations or an acquisition. Or perhaps profit potential goes up because management is about to unlock some operating leverage. But either way, for Walmart stock to go up another 22%, one would expect improvement to its operating income over the next year or so.
Walmart is known for selling millions of products. But retail sales aren't driving growth for the company's operating income. In the earnings call to discuss financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2026, CFO John Rainey said: ""Contributions to operating income are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of interrelated drivers, including improved e-commerce, economics, and business mix, most notably from higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees.""
Rainey attributes much of Walmart's operating income growth to e-commerce, an area of the business that's absolutely booming. In Q2, e-commerce revenue was up a strong 25% year over year globally, far outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of about 5%. If e-commerce continues to boom in 2026, it could drive operating income, and the stock price, higher.
Walmart's e-commerce growth provides it with another opportunity: Digital advertising. The company has troves of consumer shopping data and strong relationships with top consumer brands. With more customers transacting digitally, it gives the retailer an opportunity to generate high-margin digital advertising revenue.
Additionally, Walmart recently completed its acquisition of connected-TV company Vizio. This is another channel with which the company can leverage its data and scale to advertise to consumers, which again drives operating income growth.
For what it's worth, Walmart's Q2 advertising revenue was up 46%. Granted, some of the growth was inorganic from the recent addition of Vizio. But the company is growing this revenue stream nonetheless.
In other words, Walmart's fastest-growing revenue streams also happen to be the ones that are driving growth in operating profit. Assuming these trends continue, which I do, Walmart's profits should continue to climb in 2026, providing a boost for the stock price.
To be clear, Walmart might not grow enough over the next 15 months to warrant a $1 trillion valuation before the end of 2026. But directionally, the business appears to be headed for the trillion-dollar club. It doesn't seem to be a matter of if, but rather of when."

And I could see why some investors would gravitate toward Berkshire Hathaway, which is like an ETF bundled within a single stock.
But I have my sights set on a stock that has quietly delivered a 58,000% return since it began trading in 1991. The business isn't flashy, but it's indispensable. It's a cash cow in good times and bad. And the company's share-buyback program can only be described as relentless.
I'm talking about AutoZone (AZO -0.53%).
You know the jingle
AutoZone is an auto parts retailer that likely needs no introduction, because that ubiquitous jingle -- ""Get in the zone, AutoZone!"" -- is probably living rent-free in your head. But if you've never peeked under the hood of AutoZone's business, you might be surprised by how strong the engine is.
Founded in 1979, AutoZone has grown from a single store in Forrest City, Arkansas, to more than 6,600 stores in the United States. AutoZone also is expanding internationally, with 883 stores in Mexico and nearly 150 in Brazil.
For the company's fiscal year 2025, which ended Aug. 30, AutoZone reported net sales of $18.9 billion, a 4.5% increase over the previous year on a 52-week basis. U.S. same-store sales -- also known as comparable-store sales -- were up 3.2%, while international same-store sales were up 9.3%, adjusting for the negative effects of currency exchange rates.
Tariff-driven cost inflation, a stronger U.S. dollar, and AutoZone's aggressive expansion efforts have put pressure on earnings. Net income dipped 6.2% to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2025, and diluted earnings per share fell 3.1% to $144.87.
In fact, AutoZone's fiscal 2025 Q4 results marked the fifth consecutive quarter that the company has fallen short of analysts' earnings estimates. Yet the stock is up 24% this year, as of Oct. 9, which tells me that investors are focusing on the big picture. Here's why you might consider doing the same.
A huge total addressable market
One way to assess a company's growth prospects is to look at its total addressable market. AutoZone is one of the leading retailers in the automotive aftermarket. Industry associations expect the total value of the U.S. automotive aftermarket to reach $576 billion in 2025, and globally, it's valued at $2.3 trillion. . With the number of vehicles on the road and the average age of vehicles at an all-time high, demand for replacement parts should continue to be strong.
AutoZone has been investing heavily in its sales and distribution footprint to capture more market share. In fiscal 2025, AutoZone's capital expenditures rose 27% to nearly $1.4 billion. The company opened 304 new stores -- the most since 1996 -- and two new distribution centers. Management expects fiscal 2026 capex spending to be in the same ballpark, with most of it focused on ""accelerated store growth.""
Some of those new stores are larger stores that function like mini distribution centers. ""Megahubs,"" for example, are supersized AutoZone stores carrying more than 100,000 SKUs (individual products). Megahubs have been outperforming traditional stores, and they're helping smaller stores in their area fulfill orders faster. AutoZone's ultimate goal is to have 300 megahubs.
In fiscal 2025, AutoZone generated nearly $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, so it's in a strong position to keep investing in the business. Given the sheer size of the automotive aftermarket, the payoff could be massive. But there's another reason I'm such a huge fan of this stock.
AutoZone knows how to treat shareholders
Since fiscal 1998, AutoZone has scooped up $38.5 billion worth of its own shares. Over the past 10 years, AutoZone reduced its outstanding share count by 45% -- and it's still buying more shares.
Share buybacks are a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders, and they signal management's confidence in the business. By reducing the supply of shares available in the market, share buybacks can enhance earnings per share and increase demand for the remaining shares -- both of which can drive the stock price higher.
You can see the inverse relationship in this chart:
Inelastic demand
There's something else that makes AutoZone a strong candidate for this ""what-if"" hypothetical.
The automotive aftermarket benefits from a concept known as inelastic demand -- meaning consumers will make essential repairs to their vehicles regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. In fact, auto parts retailers often shine in tough times, because consumers tend to pull back on buying new vehicles. As a leader in this space, AutoZone might be the ultimate recession-resistant stock, well-positioned for growth in boom times and busts."

Between its Quest VR headset and its new line of Ray-Ban artificial intelligence (AI) glasses, Meta's wearables not only dominate the market -- in some cases, they are the market.
But last week, a new report emerged that Apple (AAPL 0.41%) might be planning to bring Meta's dominance in wearables to an end. Here's why this could be very bad for Meta.
Headsets are so 2023
The Meta Quest (formerly Oculus Quest) line of headsets is by far the top-selling VR headset, and it's not even close. The Quest dominates with 77% of market share. Its nearest competitors, Sony's PlayStation VR, Apple's Vision Pro, and Chinese entrant PICO, each have market shares in the single digits.
In spite of Meta's headset dominance, though, the Reality Labs unit -- which makes the Quest -- has been losing money as Meta pours resources into it as part of its long-term vision for building a metaverse. In the company's most recent quarter, Reality Labs brought in just $370 million in revenue (0.8% of Meta's total $47.5 billion in quarterly revenue), but reported a $4.5 billion net loss.
Meanwhile, VR headsets just aren't catching on the way Meta hoped. Although the company hasn't provided specific sales figures for the Quest 3 and Quest 3S, estimates indicate that right now, about two years after the Quest 3's release, somewhere between 1 million to 2 million are currently in use. By contrast, Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch 2 was released on June 5 of this year, and by June 30 had already sold 5.8 million units.
Still, that doesn't mean that wearables are dead. What about replacing that clunky headset with a simple pair of glasses?
The specs of the specs
The first-ever foray into eyeglasses as wearable technology, Alphabet's Google Glass, was a total disaster. With its front-mounted camera, anyone the wearer looked at worried they were unknowingly being filmed. Alphabet began selling a prototype in April 2014 and discontinued it just nine months later over concerns it could violate privacy laws.
However, we seem to have turned a corner from the time when Google Glass was deemed ""creepy"" and ""invasive."" Although Meta's AI glasses, like Google Glass, look like chunky plastic-framed glasses with front-mounted cameras, and although they have a $400-plus price tag (not including prescription lenses), sales have been rapidly expanding.
This could be a much larger and more promising market than the one for VR headsets, given that eyeglass wearers are used to having frames on their faces, and everyone is used to seeing people walk around with glasses on, unlike a clunky VR headset. Plus, new prescription glasses cost hundreds of dollars anyway. Why not shell out a few extra for AI enhancement?
Meta has a big early lead with this technology. But even that might not withstand a challenge from Apple.
Why Meta should worry
Apple's incredibly advanced VR/augmented reality (AR) Vision Pro headset drew rave reviews when it came out in 2024, although its $3,499 price tag meant it was never destined for mass-market sales. So, given the apparent growing market for AI glasses and the shrinking market for VR headsets, it's no surprise that Apple would follow Meta into the wearables field. In fact, over the past year, a number of industry watchers have questioned why Apple wasn't already in the smart eyeglasses market to begin with.
Not only does Apple clearly have some expertise with the technology, as evidenced by the Vision Pro, it has a lot of things Meta doesn't have: robust supply chains, existing manufacturing partners, and decades of experience mass-producing and mass-marketing technological devices, including wearables like the Apple Watch.
Furthermore, Apple has storefronts across the country and around the world where it can display wearable products and demonstrate how they work. Meta doesn't, and has to rely on Ray-Ban, LensCrafters, and Best Buy stores to demo its latest wearables.
Millions of people around the world own an iPhone -- an AI-ready device that could easily be configured to control and power AI glasses from Apple. That's not true for Meta, and the lack of integration with phone apps -- even Meta's own apps like Facebook and Instagram -- is one of the big complaints about the new Meta Ray-Ban Display.
True, if Apple scraps its Vision Pro headset, Meta loses a competitor in the VR headset space, but that's where its products are already dominant. The potential for Apple to disrupt Meta's monopoly in the fast-growing AI glasses market is much more concerning. Worse, if Apple eats Meta's lunch in the AI glasses market, Meta doesn't really have an apparent fallback product for its metaverse plans. That's what's probably keeping Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg up at night."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-12T08:09:00,Mark Zuckerberg Just Got Some Powerful New Competition for AI-Enhanced Wearables,Here's why his dominance in this niche might come to an abrupt end.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=35f430d60059ad67cd6bdbdad6b75462c94ec7bbb728b12672619fc15166d237,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/mark-zuckerberg-just-got-some-powerful-new-competi/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/mark-zuckerberg-just-got-some-powerful-new-competi/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/mark-zuckerberg-just-got-some-powerful-new-competi/,fool.com,200,,"Mark Zuckerberg should probably be shaking in his designer sneakers.
Although his company Meta Platforms (META 0.71%) has a trillion-dollar valuation, and its social media platforms are essentially a money-printing machine, he sees virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) as the future, and VR/AR wearables as key to dominating the future's metaverse.
But a powerful new competitor is entering the AR wearables arena, and it's probably the one company Zuckerberg was hoping not to face. Here's why Apple (AAPL 0.41%) might just eat his VR lunch.
Why wearables
Most of Meta Platforms' money comes from its popular suite of social media platforms, which includes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Ads on these platforms brought in $88 billion in the first half of this year alone.
Wearables, not so much. Meta's Reality Labs unit, which makes the company's wearables, lost $4.5 billion in the most recent quarter.
However, Zuckerberg wants to ensure his trillion-dollar company stays relevant in the future, and so he's willing to keep pouring money into Reality Labs and his vision of the metaverse: a virtual world where people can meet, talk, shop, attend events, make financial transactions -- you name it.
Despite his big investments, though, Reality Labs' VR headsets like the Quest 3 are still niche products, primarily used for gaming. Even there, they haven't gained much traction. Meta's release of the $300 Quest 3S boosted headset holiday sales in 2024, but overall VR headset purchases declined again in 2024.
A new type of wearable
This stagnation in the headset market may be why Meta has introduced a new wearable product: AI-enhanced glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban. These smart devices look like chunky plastic-framed glasses featuring small front-mounted cameras. The first two generations offer video recording and small speakers above the ear that can respond to voice commands.
Last month, however, Zuckerberg introduced the latest device in the lineup: the Meta Ray-Ban Display, billed as ""the most advanced AI glasses we've ever sold with a full-color, high-resolution display that's there when you want it and gone when you don't."" The glasses come with a Meta Neural Band electromyographic (EMG) wristband that translates finger movements into commands for the glasses.
Although the Display is currently on sale at select Ray-Ban, Best Buy, and LensCrafters stores, there are only a handful of locations actually selling it. For example, there are none within 50 miles of Cincinnati, just two near Chicago, and one in greater Boston.
The Display also requires a 20-minute demo -- booked in advance -- plus the $799 purchase price (or more if you need prescription lenses). Recent reports indicate it's so popular that it's already sold out at many locations.
Right now, Meta has this fast-growing field all to itself. But all that could be about to change.
The giant slayer
According to Bloomberg News, Apple has shifted employees who were working on a cheaper, lighter version of the Vision Pro to working on wearable glasses. Supposedly, there are two versions of these glasses in development: one that pairs with the iPhone but has no display -- similar to most of Meta's Ray-Ban products -- and one that will have an on-lens screen like the newly unveiled Meta Ray-Ban Display. The former could be unveiled next year and go on sale in 2027, with the latter following in 2028.
Apple has a history of introducing its own version of existing devices and turning them into cash cows for its company. The MP3 player, the smartphone, and the tablet had all been available for years before Apple introduced its iPod, iPhone, and iPad, all of which turned into smash hits (and turned those existing products into has-beens). So even though Apple is late to the AI glasses party, that hasn't stopped it from dominating a product niche in the past.
Why Zuckerberg should worry
Zuckerberg has already poured a lot of money into VR/AR wearables and has plenty more money to invest in this area in the future. But ultimately, Meta is a social media company, not a device company. Prior to its acquisition of Oculus, and its marketing of the Quest headset, it had no experience developing or marketing any devices of any kind.
Apple, on the other hand, is arguably the most successful device maker in history, with a huge global network of parts suppliers, supply chains, retail outlets, and expertise in mass-manufacturing and mass-marketing the latest tech gadgets. Meta has none of these advantages.
And that's why Mark Zuckerberg should be very, very worried right now."

Six years ago, with one of her clients struggling to find older talent, she successfully asked 400 people whether they might ‘un-retire’ and return to the workplace.
It sparked the idea for her company, 55/Redefined, which has seen some of the world’s largest organisations attract workers and consumers aged over 50.
Simpson’s aim was to inspire this generation and end ageism in the workplace. Further, she persuaded corporations that focusing on over-50s talent would not only future-proof their businesses but create a competitive edge by valuing experience.

It currently delivers age strategy services in 44 countries for more than 95 of the world's largest companies, including Amazon, Barclays and Warner Bros. Next year will mark the London startup’s fifth anniversary.
“We are a global organisation that helps everyone, everywhere to feel inspired and not retired, solving challenges around our ageing population,” says Simpson.
The idea was formed when Simpson was CEO and co-founder of an HR and recruitment outsource business. The firm had received a call from Natwest bank which needed to bring in over-50s talent for a regulated project of work harking back to the 1990s.
Her clients had to unpick the advice the bank was then giving to businesses, but found that all the people in their required demographic were in their 60s and retired.
As a former banker at Barclays, she started networking and phoned up ex colleagues with the same number she's had since the 1990s to see if they would return as contractors.
It didn't take long for Simpson to pick up on a recurring theme; dejected by a lack of purpose, retiring was the worst decision they had made. In eight weeks, she had 400 people placed back into the banking sector. Six years on, 250 are still working full-time.
So, why did they want to return? “It wasn’t about the money,” says Simpson. “They could all afford to be retired, they were career bankers on final salary pension schemes. They were targeting retiring in their late 50s or early 60s and being competitive about it.

“Most people who go into retirement underestimate their own life expectancy by about 15 to 20 years. What nobody spends any time doing is what they will do 24 hours a day for decades if they take work out of the equation.""
Since leaving Barclays in 2007, where her roles included head of corporate development, Simpson has been an entrepreneur in the consultancy and restaurant sectors."

What’s driving all this excitement? MP Materials sits at the crossroads of shifting market dynamics as rare earth materials become even more crucial to clean tech and defense industries. While headlines about supply chains and resource strategies have brought the sector into the spotlight, MP Materials has benefited from growing recognition of how important these metals are now and in the future. The long-term returns, up a remarkable 464.4% over the last five years, underscore just how strongly the market has responded to this evolving story.
But here’s where things get interesting: when we look at traditional valuation checks, MP Materials gets a value score of 0 out of 6 for being undervalued. That means, by the numbers, it isn’t undervalued in any of the six key categories analysts usually consider. So, how do we square rapid price gains against a discouraging valuation score? To answer that, we’ll dive into the standard valuation methods, and I’ll share an even better way to think about MP Materials’ worth at the end of the article.
MP Materials scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: MP Materials Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company’s value by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today’s dollars. This method aims to capture the present value of what a business is expected to generate over time.
For MP Materials, the most recent Free Cash Flow (FCF) is negative, at $-260.5 Million, showing that the business spent more cash than it generated over the past year. Analysts provide estimates up to 2027, expecting FCF to turn positive and reach $24.5 Million by then. Beyond that, projections are extrapolated, with FCF anticipated to slowly grow until 2035, though still remaining in the tens of millions of dollars each year according to various analyst and internal estimates.
Based on these projections, Simply Wall Street calculates an intrinsic value per share of just $2.33. With the stock trading far above this estimate, the DCF model implies MP Materials is not just overvalued but significantly so, with a discount of -3260.7%. This means the current market price is multiple times higher than what the DCF model suggests the business is fundamentally worth right now."

As you can see in the table, the iShares Semiconductor ETF holds meaningful positions in companies that are underrepresented in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF. And while Nvidia and Broadcom make up just shy of 20% of the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF, the other eight semiconductor stocks in the table, including AMD, are absent from the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF.
A common issue with growth ETFs is that they tend to concentrate heavily on a handful of industry-leading names. The iShares Semiconductor ETF doesn't have that issue. It's an ideal choice for investors looking for exposure to the entire semiconductor value chain. Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a lot of attention, but it's just one use case of semiconductors.
For example, Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors are used in many Android devices that run Alphabet's software. AI is Micron's fastest-growing segment, but PC and mobile devices are still the primary use cases for its memory chips. Texas Instruments makes analog and embedded semiconductors that are used in consumer electronics, automotive, healthcare applications, and more.
Fabrication plants operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing include equipment made by companies like Lam Research, Applied Materials, ASML Holding, and KLA. Combined, these five companies make up 22.6% of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. But Taiwan Semi and ASML are absent from the iShares U.S. Technology ETF because they aren't U.S. companies. And Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA combined only make up less than 4% of the iShares U.S. Technology ETF.
In sum, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a great buy for investors looking for an ETF with exposure to the integrated semiconductor value chain rather than just a few popular names.
Even chip lovers should think twice in this economy
Anders Bylund: Buying the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a bold bet on a very specific high-growth industry. I'm usually all for that type of targeted investment. Things are different in the fall of 2025, though.
I still think of the AI boom as a positive market force. It's not a bubble, and the chip stocks that have soared due to great AI-related sales in the last three years have earned their lofty valuations. At the same time, even legendary bull runs usually have a couple of sharp price corrections along the way. That's particularly true when the bulls are racing in the middle of a shaky global economy.
On that note, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is too narrowly focused for my taste in this economy. I mean, even the classic S&P 500 funds look too concentrated since 27.8% of their total value comes from the top five holdings (including semiconductor king Nvidia in the top spot, of course). The iShares Semiconductor ETF takes this focus one step further. It holds just 30 stocks, and the top five names add up to 33.6% of the portfolio's assets under management (AUM).
Again, I'm usually fine with sector-specific ETFs. This just doesn't look like a good time to load up on this richly valued ETF. The ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 37 with a meager 0.7% dividend yield and a lofty beta value of 1.6. In other words, it's both expensive and volatile. I'd much rather put my investable cash to work in a tried-and-true market-wide tracker like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now.
I will surely consider hyper-targeted ETFs like the iShares Semiconductor ETF again someday. The same AI boom will probably still be in full force when I do. I just need the economy to calm down before I can commit to a swaggering AI-chip fund again. For now, I'm more interested in risk management."

The Magnificent Seven refers to some of the most prominent growth stocks in the world: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Investing in these companies has yielded strong returns for investors over the years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 makes for a more balanced investment overall, as it gives investors broader exposure to the market while still growing over the long term. By having a position in the 500 best stocks rather than just the top seven, there's much more diversification.
Which option should you go with today, if your focus is on long-term growth?
The Magnificent Seven are magnificent, but they could be overdue for a decline
One way you can gain exposure to the Magnificent Seven is by investing in the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS 0.74%). The fund invests in just the Magnificent Seven and, thus, can be an easier option than investing in each stock individually. Since its launch in April 2023, the fund has soundly outperformed the S&P 500, rising by more than 165% while the broader index has achieved gains of around 64%.
Many of the Magnificent Seven have benefited from an uptick in demand due to artificial intelligence (AI) and have been investing heavily in next-gen technologies. However, many investors worry that a bubble has already formed around AI stocks and that spending could slow down, especially if there's a recession on the horizon. If that happens, then these stocks could be susceptible to significant declines.
While these stocks have been flying high of late, back in 2022, when the market was in turmoil due to rising inflation and as investor sentiment was souring on growth stocks, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks fell by more than 26%. The worst-performing stocks were Meta and Tesla, which lost around 65% of their value. That year, the S&P 500 also fell, but at 19%, it was a more modest decline.
The S&P 500 is more diverse, but that doesn't mean it's risk-free
If you want to have exposure to the S&P 500, you can accomplish that by investing in an S&P 500 index fund, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 0.27%). Its low expense ratio of 0.09% makes it a low-cost, no-nonsense way of tracking the S&P 500. Its focus is to simply mirror the index, and it does a great job of that.
The problem, however, is that while the S&P 500 will give you exposure to more stocks than just the seven best stocks in the world, how those leading stocks do will still have a significant impact on the overall stock market. And the Magnificent Seven, because they are so valuable, are also among the SPDR ETF's largest holdings.
But even if you were to go with a more balanced exchange-traded fund, such as the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which has an equal position in all S&P 500 stocks, that may only offer modest protection from a wide-scale sell-off. In 2022, the ETF declined by 13%.
You're always going to face some risk when investing in the stock market, especially if your focus is on growth stocks, which can be particularly volatile.
What's the better strategy for growth investors?
If your priority is growth, then going with the Magnificent Seven can still be the best option moving forward. These stocks will undoubtedly have bad years, but that's the risk that comes with growth stocks. However, given their dominance in tech and AI, the Magnificent Seven still have the potential to vastly outperform the S&P 500 in the long run, and their gains are likely to far outweigh their losses."

“I’m not a lawyer, doctor or scientist, but I was an obsessive and I was a consumer,” says the founder of Goodrays, the British functional wellness brand.
“I thought CBD and the mental wellbeing benefits could disrupt soft drinks, alcohol and nicotine in the right types of format and ultimately the future would be in beverages.”
Keenan has been an early industry leader since 2013 when he studied at Trinity College Dublin, suffered with stress and anxiety and became an insomniac.

Having been offered prescription medications, Keenan was also recommended to take CBD as a natural solution and purchased some hemp leaves ground up in olive oil from a Dublin apothecary. He kept a journal, took it for 30 days and by then was sleeping eight hours a night.
In his last year he completed a dissertation on CBD policy before heading straight to the US and Canada. He planned to stay for two months, purchased a car in San Francisco, made a makeshift bed in the back and drove to Humboldt County, California, a major hub for cannabis growth.
Keenan, who met his now wife in the US, ended up staying for two years running hemp farms with different families and learning from the cultivators providing the consumer goods business.
By now he knew his career would involve CBD. In 2017, he moved back to the UK and helped set up a regulatory advisory firm, Prohibition Partners, which helped to get CBD and medical cannabis legalised in the UK a year later.
Two years on and Keenan was scouring the supermarket drinks aisles and realised only water would make him feel better. The Goodrays concept was born. “The drink format was number one for me,” says Keenan. “It had the potential to truly take CBD mainstream.
“It feels like the category is now exploding but actually consumers were crying out for healthy drinks before it was disrupted. It is long overdue.”
Human studies on the efficacy of CBD show positive effects on stress, sleep and anxiety when consumed in doses above 25mg. The Irish businessman went through around 20 iterations working with ex-Diageo developers, with a science-backed 30mg in Goodrays' products.
Keenan said last year that “people are nervous about CBD and think it will get them 'high' – it doesn't.” Six months ago, Goodrays took off its CBD ‘does not get you high’ strapline from its cans as consumers tune further into the benefits."

Investors are shuddering on concerns of renewed trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
Stocks fell sharply on Friday, with the S&P 500 shedding 183 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,553 in what was the index's worst day since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 879 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6%.
The selloff affected a wide range of stocks, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade.
""Investors still think the tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China these last few days is mostly posturing (the consensus view is that tariffs won't go up, and that Trump and Xi will still meet in South Korea), but trade-related risks have certainly risen after being dormant for the last several weeks,"" Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.
Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering ""a massive increase of tariffs"" on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.
""We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!""
Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.
""Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table,"" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.
Primed for a slide?
The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April to record heights.
Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise.
Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are anxious about the economy.
The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index, released Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.
""Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,"" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.
The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher."

Nine global Wall Street banking giants have announced plans to develop a jointly backed stablecoin focused on G7 currencies.
The consortium includes Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, MUFG Bank, TD Bank Group, and UBS, according to a Bloomberg report published Friday.
Banks said they will explore issuing a reserve-backed digital payment asset available on public blockchains, with each unit pegged one-to-one against traditional fiat currency.
The coalition has confirmed it is already in contact with regulators and supervisors across relevant markets as it evaluates whether the initiative could enhance competition in the digital payments space.
Banks Target $50 Trillion Payment Opportunity
Traditional financial institutions are accelerating blockchain experimentation following clearer regulatory frameworks in the United States and the European Union.
Stablecoins have emerged as a faster and cheaper alternative to legacy payment rails, with Bloomberg Intelligence projecting that the technology could process more than $50 trillion in annual payments by 2030.
The business model has proven extraordinarily lucrative for existing issuers, who earn substantial yields on the Treasury securities and cash equivalents backing their tokens.
Tether Holdings, which operates the largest stablecoin by circulation, generates billions of dollars annually from reserve assets and is currently raising as much as $20 billion in a funding round that could rank it among the world’s most valuable private companies.
The banking consortium’s entry follows several parallel blockchain payment initiatives across the industry, including Bank of New York Mellon’s exploration of tokenized deposits and JPMorgan’s June pilot of JPMD, a token representing dollar deposits at the institution.
HSBC also launched a tokenized deposit service for corporate clients in late September, allowing secure cross-border currency transfers through blockchain infrastructure.
Financial firms view these blockchain-based payment systems as essential infrastructure for their broader ambitions to tokenize traditional assets, including stocks, bonds, and investment funds.
Earlier this year, several major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, reportedly held exploratory discussions about a potential shared stablecoin venture, though those talks remained conceptual.
Traditional Banks Race to Capture Digital Dollar Migration
Standard Chartered warned earlier this month that stablecoin adoption could drain more than $1 trillion from emerging market banks by 2028, as users in high-inflation economies increasingly treat tokens like Tether’s USDT as de facto dollar bank accounts.
The threat has prompted regulatory responses across major financial centers, with British regulators initially proposing ownership caps between £10,000 and £20,000 for retail customers to slow potential deposit flight.
However, recent reports have confirmed that the Bank of England is preparing to allow exemptions to these limits for firms such as crypto exchanges that require large stablecoin holdings for liquidity and settlement.
In recent weeks, Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also argued that stablecoins will inevitably force banks to offer competitive deposit yields, noting that U.S. savings accounts currently pay just 0.40% while banks earn $176 billion annually by parking reserves at the Federal Reserve.
Competition is intensifying beyond traditional banking circles, with major technology companies exploring stablecoin integration, with Apple, Airbnb, Uber, and X reportedly holding preliminary discussions about incorporating the tokens into their payment systems.
SWIFT, a global banking giant, has also begun testing stablecoin-like settlement on Ethereum’s Linea Layer 2 network with over a dozen global banks, including BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon.
European banks have moved aggressively into the space, with nine major lenders, including ING, UniCredit, and Deutsche Bank, forming a separate consortium to launch a MiCA-regulated euro stablecoin by mid-2026.
In a recently released report, Coinbase forecast that the stablecoin market could reach $1.2 trillion by 2028, and published research has challenged the banking industry’s claims that stablecoins threaten traditional financial stability.
As it stands now, the global banking industry faces a strategic choice between partnering with established stablecoin issuers, like the recent backing from Citi to BVNK, building proprietary tokens, or watching payment revenues migrate entirely to crypto-native competitors and technology giants.

A look at Wall Street amid Trump tariff talks on China
The stock market plunged Oct. 10 after President Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on China in response to new restrictions on natural resources.
The Nasdaq Composite was down as much as 2.6% early in the afternoon, according to CNBC, while the S&P 500 fell 1.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3%. Those numbers had rebounded slightly but returned to approximately the same levels as of 2 p.m.
Among other popular stocks Vanguard was down 1.73%, Nividia 2.43%, Amazon 3.64%, Tesla 3.85%, Apple 2.6% and Invesco QQQ 2.28%.
The shift was apparently the result of a Truth Social post by Trump in which he alleged that China was ""becoming very hostile"" in restricting rare earth metals, which are key components in producing a variety of technological items.
""Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,"" Trump wrote. ""I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive,' but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time.""
Trump noted that he was scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks, but now ""there seems to be no reason to do so."" The administration is considering a ""massive increase"" on tariffs among other countermeasures, he said.
""I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,"" Trump wrote. ""Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.""
The stocks had been considerably higher before Trump's post. According to CNBC, the Nasdaq reached a new all-time high within the day prior to the president's comments."

Third quarter earning season is underway with the biggest tech names slated to report later in the month. It'll of course give us the latest read on just how much companies are spending and making on artificial intelligence, which has driven markets to repeated record highs. Here with more on what to watch is Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and Global Head of Technology Research. Dan, it's great to see you, as always. Um, so we're going into earning season for this company for these companies at a time where there is this debate of valuations. There is this debate about the so-called circular economy, how much they're all sort of spending on each other. Um, what are you going to zero in on in the in these earnings reports?
Yeah, I look, Julia, I'd say, I mean, the street's still massively underestimating what this tech cycle is going to look like. I think it's an AI super cycle. And I think this 3Q earnings is going to be much more of a validation moment in terms of not just for chips but for software. And I think the broader build out. Look, it continue the bears in hibernation mode. They've missed the last two and a half years. and they'll continue to miss this bull market that I think has another two years ahead of it.
You know, it's interesting because I haven't talked to that many bears, right? The bears, the straight up bears are hard to find on this stuff. It's more the message that maybe you should start to diversify a little bit. It's not that you should sell necessarily, maybe take a little bit of profits and put it in some of the smaller companies in the space, put them outside of AI entirely because maybe we're in a little bit of a a breathing period here. What do you think of that argument, Dan?
Look, I get it. I mean, but my view is we're in the second inning of a nine- inning cycle. So, I mean, to to peel away from an AI perspective, talk about people have peeled away from AMD over the last, you know, a month ago, or Oracle six months ago, or Nvidia a year ago. See my whole point is like, the street's under estimating what this cycle is going to look like. And I think ultimately in the next one, two years, numbers are maybe 20, 30% underestimated. And I think that's why three Q earnings is just going to be more validation showing the use cases are exploded."

In a statement, SAMR said Qualcomm’s acquisition is suspected of violating the country’s anti-monopoly laws, though it didn’t provide any further details on what element of the deal broke monopoly laws or how.
In a statement, a Qualcomm spokesperson said, “We are fully cooperating with SAMR in this matter. Qualcomm is committed to supporting the development and growth of our customers and partners.” Qualcomm stock was down more than 4% in midday trade.
The announcement comes the same day President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that the Chinese government is seeking to tighten its control over rare earth minerals. Trump went on to threaten a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese goods.
Trump also said there’s no longer any reason for him to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping as the two leaders initially planned at the APEC Summit in South Korea.
Like Qualcomm, SAMR has also accused AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) of violating China’s anti-monopoly laws. In September, the regulator announced that it would conduct further investigations into the deal. Nvidia has denied any wrongdoing.
China has also called on companies to avoid using Nvidia’s products, and in 2024, a state agency called for an investigation into Intel’s chips for what China’s Cyberspace Security Association claimed were ""frequent vulnerabilities and high failure rates.""
The US and China are locked in a months-long trade fight that has seen the countries raise tariffs on shipments of their respective goods by more than 120% before lowering them again.

Technology and rare earth minerals are just two of the biggest pawns in the back-and-forth struggle between the two nations. Tech companies have had to maneuver their relationships with the countries, placating them to ensure they can continue to sell their products into both markets.
In the US, companies like Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM) have committed to building new facilities or otherwise sourcing components from American factories in an effort to win Trump’s approval and avoid potentially onerous tariffs.
Qualcomm relies on TSMC to build its chips, some of which come from the company’s manufacturing plants in Arizona."

The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables, hearables and PCs is another major growth driver for industry participants. However, industry players are suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Heightened geopolitical challenges post-U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to levy tariffs on trade partners are expected to hurt industry participants. Weak demand in China has been a headwind.
Industry Description
The Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based on either iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung. Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.
3 Micro Computer Industry Trends to Watch
Enterprise Adoption Remains Healthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.
Impressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.
AI-enabled PCs to Boost Demand: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be they Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based ones, are expected to benefit from AI infusion. The addition of neural processing units (NPUs), which are dedicated units to manage AI-related tasks, in PCs is a driving demand for AI-enabled devices. AMD, Qualcomm and Intel offer NPU chips with OEMs such as ASUS, Acer, Lenovo, Microsoft, HP and others building these AI-enabled devices. Canalys expects AI-capable PC shipments to surpass 100 million in 2025, representing 40% of all PC shipments. This offers significant growth opportunities for industry participants."

Citigroup Inc.’s basket of 46 stocks most favored by non-professional investors, which includes companies like SoFi Technologies Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc., is up 30% since the start of September, beating the S&P 500 Index’s 4.3% gain. Meanwhile, retail trading volume has increased to an all-time-high, the bank’s equity trading desk wrote in a research note Tuesday.
“It’s been our contention for quite some time that the stock market gains have been largely propelled by a combination of FOMO and MOMO,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “At this point, every dip is perceived as a buying opportunity, and uptrends are something to be chased.”
Citigroup’s figures on trading activity defied weak October seasonality, with volume rising to the highest since the bank started tracking the data in 2018.
Data from other banks shows a big jump in volume as well. From Oct. 2 through the close of trading on Oct. 8, retail investors accelerated their weekly purchases of stocks to $7 billion, an increase from the of $5.3 billion per week over the past two months, JPMorgan equity and quant strategist Arun Jain wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.
The buying spree coincided with renewed optimism around artificial intelligence stocks, fueled by a series of corporate deals, bets on interest-rate cuts and expectations for resilient earnings. Indeed, AI-linked names remain the epicenter of retail enthusiasm. Dell Technologies Inc. drew its largest inflow in nearly five months, while members of the Magnificent Seven such as Tesla Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., but excluding Apple Inc., saw sizable buying, Jain wrote.
Risk-on sentiment is present in the options market as well. Over the last seven trading sessions, retail gamma supply — a gauge of how much investors are selling options and collecting premiums on short-dated calls and puts — jumped to an all-time high of $93 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The surge was led by growth-oriented names, with technology and communications stocks seeing the steepest pickup."

Dublin, Oct. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""2025 Connected TV Platform Expansion in the U.S.: Gaming, Fitness, Smart Home"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
This study draws from the analyst's Q1 2025 survey of 8,000 US internet households. The survey is demographically representative of US internet households, with quotas for age, income, gender, and educational attainment.
TV operating system (TV OS) platform vendors and TV OEMs are looking for new use cases and applications to drive TV sales, advertising revenue, and uptake of related services. With widespread adoption of large-screen TVs, 4K and HDR, relatively little interest in 8K and a business model transitioning away from a high volume, low margin hardware model to a high margin advertising model, CTV platform vendors and TV OEMs benefit from expanding beyond the traditional feature set. With smart TVs now reaching 68% of US internet households, this creates new possibilities for commerce, gaming, fitness, and smart home applications, among others.
This study investigates new differentiators and points of interest for US CTV buyers. It examines demand for smart home hub capabilities, health and fitness services and integrations, advanced gaming functions and features, artistic display capabilities, telehealth, content creation, interactive shopping, and more. It identifies consumer openness towards technologies such as optical content recognition, embedded cameras and microphones, AI and AI assistants, among others.

“It’s both the AI trade and the reshoring of manufacturing in this country trade. We like it as a backdoor AI play. They’re a manufact they’re a supplier, sorry, of outsourced assembly and test. Think about advanced packaging that’s needed for these very sophisticated chips and these servers and the data centers. What’s particularly interesting about Amkor Technology Inc (NASDAQ:AMKR) is they’re building a big facility in the United States in Arizona. They’re partnered both with Apple as well as with Taiwan Semiconductor. It’s the only outsource assembly and test manufacturing with a significant presence in the United States while also having presence overseas. So, we think they’ve got a number of tailwinds. And I would remind everybody that semiconductors are the backbone of technology. We can’t have any of the advances we’re excited about, whether it’s quantum, space, robotics, AI, without semiconductors to drive those advances.”

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Erik Woodring, Morgan Stanley's head of US technology hardware research, said in a recent program on CNBC that initial data on iPhone 17 pointed to a cycle that is better than expected, but not “robust.”
“I mean, I don’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves because we’re, you know, 10 days post pre-order period. But the early data points, when you piece them together, whether it’s from carriers, whether it’s from lead times, whether it’s from some of the supply chain, is all pointing to what I would call a cycle that is better than we expected. I wouldn’t call it robust. I think it’s too early to call it robust, but early indications are positive for the iPhone 17 across the entire family of devices.”
ben-collins-wWwEM-fx618-unsplash Early indicators point to a strong consumer response to the latest iPhone 17. However, can this enthusiasm lift the stock in the long term, especially when the company is falling behind in the AI race? Apple can only do so much in innovation to revolutionize its iPhone each year. A UBS survey shows that the iPhone upgrade cycle has reached 35 months in the US. A separate report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners says about 63% of iPhone users keep their smartphones for more than two years. Apple is losing its pricing edge as it has to put a cap on its price tags to compete in key markets like China. Samsung, Xiaomi and other companies can launch advanced hardware and software features to compete with Apple and keep the company under pressure in Asia.
Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Finally, shares of technology bellwether Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) underperformed the market and lost value as the company faced a classic innovator’s dilemma, which appeared all the more egregious as competitors embraced the AI opportunity. Apple has had a dominant market position in smartphones and services, but now more than ever, investors are questioning the future outlook for the company. Despite posting a negative absolute strategy return during the quarter, which weighed on absolute strategy returns, relative to Apple’s the company’s large position in the benchmark our underweight position proved to be a tailwind to relative results during the quarter.”

Apple (AAPL, Financials) is changing the way it runs things since Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams is going to leave later this year. Apple's health and fitness sections will now be controlled by Eddy Cue, who is in charge of the company's Services division. This is in line with Apple's impending Health+ program.
In 2026, Health+ will come out. It will feature an AI health coach that informs you exactly how to eat, sleep, and work out. The trial indicates that Apple is still attempting to make more money from its services and improve how its hardware and digital platforms operate together.
Craig Federighi is the head of Apple's software. He is now also in charge of Siri, watchOS, and visionOS. John Ternus is in charge of making hardware for Apple Watch presently.. Sabih Khan will be in charge of operations after Williams leaves.
On Friday, Apple shares fell by 1.56%. AAPL has a Moderate Buy consensus among analysts, with an average price target of $255.57, which means it might go up by 0.6%.
Investors will look to the release of Health+ and subsequent improvements to the Apple Watch as short-term events that could move the market."

It's a staggering return, and one that's hard to conceptualize. Investing $10,000 into this stock a decade ago would have made you a multimillionaire. That size of an investment would now be worth around $2.85 million.
Today, it's far and away the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $4.5 trillion. The next largest stocks, Microsoft and Apple, are each worth around $3.8 trillion. Given Nvidia's dominance in the tech sector and the importance that its chips play in artificial intelligence (AI) and its future growth, could this stock that has already grown in value so much still be a potential 10-bagger investment if you add it to your portfolio today?
Why Nvidia might still grow its value tenfold
For Nvidia to generate 10x returns from its current value, you would need to believe that it can eventually reach a market cap of more than $45 trillion. That's a huge valuation, but in 20-plus years, it may be plausible for top tech companies to be worth that much. If Nvidia were to grow by a little over 12% per year on average, after 20 years, it will have risen to roughly 10 times what it is worth today.
When taking the long-term view, it may not seem all that outlandish to expect that the leading AI chipmaker could become worth so much, given how much potential there is for AI to revolutionize virtually every industry. Analysts at Grand View Research believe that there's considerable growth ahead for the global AI chip market and that it will expand at a compound annual rate of about 28.9% between now and the end of the decade. Even if that growth slows in the years afterward, there may still be considerable potential for Nvidia and other AI companies to tap into down the road.
What could get in Nvidia's way?
While there is potential for Nvidia to be a 10-bagger investment, that doesn't mean that it will be a smooth path ahead. There are risks to consider. The glaring one is that stocks may be in a bubble right now, and a crash could be coming in the near future.
Nvidia is a highly successful business, and it generates impressive margins, but it's also trading at more than 50 times its trailing earnings. At such a premium, the stock has a lot of growth already priced into its valuation, which could result in limited returns in the future.
Another risk to consider is the potential for a pullback in AI spending, particularly if there is a recession in the near future. Meanwhile, a recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study found that 95% of businesses aren't seeing a payoff from their generative AI projects. While AI chatbots are helpful assistants and can improve efficiency for users, that may not be nearly enough to warrant companies' significant investments into making their own AI models or buying AI-powered products and services.
Nvidia's growth has been slowing, and if there's a more drastic decline ahead, that could significantly affect how much growth investors are willing to pay for the stock in the future.
Is it too late to invest in Nvidia?
Nvidia is a top AI stock, but I'm not convinced that it will still yield tenfold returns from where it is today. A lot would have to go right for the company, given how highly valued it is today. Although it is a leading chipmaker today, in 20 years, that may not be the case. Technologies may change drastically -- and so, too, could demand for AI chips.
That being said, it can still prove to be a good long-term investment even if it doesn't generate 10-bagger returns. With strong fundamentals, Nvidia can be a good tech stock to buy and hold for years to come. But with its high valuation, it's important not to set your expectations too high."

US dollar has largest weekly gain in a year
Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at investing and trading platform IG, said:
A new KPMG and REC report has a few key takeaways on the UK jobs market:
Companies are recruiting for fewer permanent positions
Wages are stagnating
Candidate supply has risen rapidly
Jon Holt, group chief executive and UK senior partner at KPMG, said:
“The jobs market has not yet turned a corner and remains tough, but we saw stabilisation in some of the numbers last month. While the public finances provide little room for manoeuvre in November, some clear signals from the Chancellor that build on business confidence will hopefully support renewed hiring as we head into 2026.”

US stock futures tread water
US stock futures trod water on Friday in the wake of a retreat from record highs, as data-starved investors waited for a reprieve from the government shutdown and for earnings season to provide inspiration.
Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the benchmark S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) all hovered just above the flat line.
The shutdown entered its ninth day on Thursday, with lawmakers still unable to agree on a funding bill. The Senate failed for a seventh time to advance stopgap measures. However, change may be coming as some Republican lawmakers signalled willingness to negotiate on the healthcare subsidies Democrats insist on saving as a condition of reopening the government.
Looking ahead, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment reading is due Friday morning at 3pm UK time.

UK retail footfall dips in September: BRC
Low consumer confidence ahead of a potential tax-rising Budget kept many shoppers away from retail locations in September, according to latest figures.
Tube strikes in London, heavy rainfall in the first half of September and Storm Amy towards the end of the month exacerbated the decline, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.
Total UK footfall was down by 1.8% in September on a year ago, significantly more than the 0.4% decline registered in August, BRC-Sensormatic data shows.
High street footfall decreased by 2.5% year on year in September while visits to retail parks and shopping centres were down 0.8% and 2% respectively.
Footfall fell year on year across all nations again, down 0.5% in Northern Ireland, 1.8% in England, 2.3% in Scotland and the largest decrease of 2.5% in Wales."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-10T07:35:00,Prediction: These 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Worth More Than $7 Trillion by 2030,Today's biggest AI stocks will likely be much bigger by the end of the decade.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a6da66140edc20ec72f721d631a3345c75d294e49c33058fc79536db3df79a14,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/prediction-these-4-ai-stocks-will-be-worth-more-th/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/prediction-these-4-ai-stocks-will-be-worth-more-th/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/prediction-these-4-ai-stocks-will-be-worth-more-th/,fool.com,200,,"Imagine a stack of $1 bills that reached from the Earth's surface to the moon and almost all the way back to the Earth. That's how incredibly large $7 trillion is. No company on the planet has a market cap that big.
However, I think that will change in the not-too-distant future. In fact, I predict that at least four artificial intelligence (AI) stocks will be worth more than $7 trillion by 2030.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA 0.20%) is the easiest pick. The giant GPU maker is already the world's highest-valued company with a market cap of $4.5 trillion. To make it to $7 trillion within the next five years, Nvidia would only have to grow by a little over 9% annually.
While there are no guarantees in investing, I don't think that will be a problem. Over the last five years, Nvidia's market cap and share price have soared roughly 1,250%. To be sure, I don't expect the stock will deliver that kind of jaw-dropping performance through the rest of the decade. However, I feel good about Nvidia's chances of generating double-digit percentage annual growth.
Despite the remarkably robust adoption of AI in recent years, I suspect we're only at the beginning of the AI revolution. Advances in agentic AI and perhaps even artificial general intelligence (AGI) should provide a huge tailwind for Nvidia over the next few years.
Could Nvidia's edge in the AI chip market slip? Maybe, but I don't anticipate that happening. The company has a big competitive advantage already and continues to roll out new, more powerful GPUs every year. My hunch is that Nvidia will still be the king of the AI chip mountain in 2030 with a market cap in the ballpark of $10 trillion.
2. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT 0.20%) also seems to be an almost shoo-in to join the $7 trillion club by the end of the decade. The software behemoth currently sports a market cap of $3.9 trillion. It needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of less than 13% to hit the target threshold.
Wall Street thinks Microsoft will make pretty good progress over the next 12 months. The consensus price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of roughly 18.5%. That's enough to propel Microsoft to a market cap of around $4.6 trillion.
How can the company grow enough to cover the rest of the gap? One obvious way is for its Microsoft Azure platform to continue attracting customers interested in harnessing the power of generative AI. Another is for the integration between Microsoft's productivity applications and OpenAI's GPT-5 to help the company capture additional market share.
I wouldn't rule out quantum computing as a potential growth driver, either. Microsoft is a leader in the field. Its topoconductor architecture could pave the way to pack a whopping 1 million or more qubits on a single chip.
3. Alphabet
Don't be surprised if Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 1.38%) (GOOGL 1.27%) isn't too far behind Nvidia and Microsoft in size by 2030. It might even vault past both of them.
Granted, Alphabet has a steeper climb. Its market currently hovers around $3 trillion. The company would need to grow by around 18.5% annually over the next five years to reach $7 trillion. However, it easily beat that mark over the past five years.
In several respects, the outlook for Alphabet is better now than it has been in recent years. Worries that generative AI would present an existential threat to Google Search were overblown. Concerns that antitrust regulators would crush the company seem to have largely evaporated, too.
Like Microsoft, Alphabet is a contender in quantum computing. Its Waymo unit is also a leader in the potentially huge robotaxi market.
4. Apple
Apple's (AAPL 0.41%) luster has faded quite a bit. The iPhone maker is widely perceived as a laggard in generative AI. Its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset hasn't been a big commercial success. Apple's growth has slowed significantly as well.
Despite all of that, I still believe that Apple could be worth at least $7 trillion by 2030. The company's market cap currently stands at around $3.8 trillion. It doesn't have to grow much more quickly than Microsoft to become a member of the $7 trillion club.
I think Apple needs to do three things to make this happen. First, it must beef up its generative AI capabilities. A smart acquisition could do the trick. Second, the company must ignite another iPhone supercycle. A rumored folding version could help, along with more impressive AI functionality. Third, Apple needs to be a strong player in the smart-glasses market. I expect it will."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-10T05:00:28,Is Wall Street ready to venture beyond bitcoin and into altcoins?,"Institutional investors are showing strong interest in cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, but the adoption of smaller altcoins has been slow.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c2c59f6be0c3300c37f525076b9133d1f433c4fe47b519ca8c0d518a301fd329,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-crypto-bitcoin-altcoins-050028250.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-crypto-bitcoin-altcoins-050028250.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-crypto-bitcoin-altcoins-050028250.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Institutional investors are showing strong interest in cryptocurrencies, but their focus remains firmly on the market leaders, bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD). While smaller altcoins continue to capture headlines in the retail space, their adoption by large investment managers has been slow.
On Yahoo Finance Future Focus, James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, explained why most institutional portfolios are still dominated by bitcoin and ethereum, also known as ether, and what might change in the years ahead.
Bitcoin and ethereum take centre stage
“Not yet, I’d say,” Butterfill told Yahoo Finance UK when asked about institutional exposure to altcoins.
He explained that bitcoin accounts for roughly 90% of all exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and assets, with ether taking most of the remainder. Altcoins, by contrast, represent only 2 or 3%
Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC-USD), including solana (SOL-USD) and XRP (XRP-GBP), and thousands of smaller digital tokens that serve various purposes across the crypto ecosystem.

""At the moment, I think it's a big ask for many institutional investors to start looking at many of these much smaller altcoins,"" Butterfill said. ""They're only just getting used to bitcoin as a store of value and its position in the portfolio, and now they're just starting to divert gaze towards ethereum (ETH-USD), which has been incredibly popular this year.""
This popularity is reflected in inflows — ethereum (ETH-USD) has attracted $12bn so far this year, compared to $5bn last year, Butterfill noted.
The surge in ethereum interest is partly due to its technical evolution. ""There was some scepticism of ethereum about three or four years ago, when we had the merge,"" Butterfill said, referring to the Ethereum blockchain’s shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake validation.
Investors initially questioned whether the transition would succeed, and concerns over staking yields and transaction speed lingered for years. But with recent upgrades and clearer roadmaps, Butterfill said confidence is growing.
""The roadmap for Ethereum upgrades is a lot better now, and they're much better at marketing, like solana (SOL-USD),"" he explained.
""Plus, you have that backing of the stablecoin and the GENIUS Act in the US now; most of stablecoins operate around 60% or 70% on Ethereum. That's why we've seen all this hype and the price appreciation.""
When asked about solana, Butterfill acknowledged its strong price performance but questioned its sustainability."

From an apartment in a former fortress to a national monument, we’ve picked the best on the market.
1. Netley Castle, Southampton, Hampshire, £800,000
Once part of Henry VIII’s coastal defences, Netley Castle was built in the middle of the 16th century and given a Victorian gothic-style makeover in the 1880s when castellated wings and towers were added.
About 25 years ago it was converted into 10 luxury apartments, which all have use of the original Great Hall. The one on the ground floor comprises two ensuite bedrooms, a shower room, a family room that doubles as a study or third bedroom, a kitchen/breakfast room and an elegant living room with doors out to a balcony overlooking Southampton water. By Savills.
2. Tawstock Castle, Tawstock, Barnstaple, Devon, £1.35m
This 18th century castle is perched on a hilltop, spanning nearly eight and a half acres of land, and enjoys 360-degree views over the north Devon countryside.
With a floor area of around 2,250 square feet, it’s a manageable size and has been meticulously restored. It includes a grand reception hall complete with an ornate ceiling and a Traitors-style round table, a circular kitchen, four bedrooms, a study and a roof terrace. Find out more via Knight Frank.

3. Uzerche, Correze, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, France, €1.6m (£1.39m)
Conveniently located for the A20 motorway, this romantic chateau sits in 30 acres of grounds containing woodland, meadows and a lake.
The ground floor features a kitchen, dining room, library, music room and an ensuite bedroom, and there are seven generously-sized bedrooms and eight bathrooms on the first floor. Six more bedrooms are on the second floor, though they do need some cosmetic improvements. Find out more from Leggett International Real Estate.
4.The Gyrn Castle Estate, Llanasa, Holywell, Flintshire, £2m
Gyrn Castle dates from the late 17th century and in 1857 was acquired by ship owner Sir Edward Bates, who subsequently passed it to his son Sir Percy Bates, chairman of the Cunard shipping line that built the great transatlantic liners, The Queen Mary and The Queen Elizabeth.
As well as being a private home with 12 bedrooms, numerous reception rooms, outbuildings, 67 acres of land and lakes, this well-maintained castle offers plenty of potential to operate as a profitable business.

The bank's analysis, published on Friday, compared average monthly rental costs with typical first-time mortgage payments in 11 cities across the UK. In nine of these cities, it found owning a home could work out cheaper than renting on a monthly basis. Lloyds (LLOY.L) said that it excluded London from the analysis due to higher property prices and different affordability dynamics.
The research focused on affordability with a 5% deposit, using the average first-time buyer house price across each city, with calculations for mortgage costs based on a five-year fixed interest rate of 4.78% over a 30-year repayment term. Average rent figures and the price that first-time buyers typically paid for a property were taken from data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in September.
The lender highlighted that these scenarios were illustrative examples of only the monthly mortgage repayment amount and said that the research did not include additional costs, such as legal fees or any other ongoing costs associated with homeownership.
Lloyds (LLOY.L) found that the average 5% deposit would be £11,412 based on a typical first-time buyer property price of £228,233 across Britain.
According to the bank's calculations, first-time buyers could save the most in Glasgow, finding that mortgage payments could be around 32% cheaper than rent. Lloyds (LLOY.L) said that this could mean buyers save £396 a month, or £4,752 a year. In Glasgow, the research showed that the average first-time buyer property cost £172,000, meaning a 5% deposit would be £8,600.
The research found that Newcastle potentially offered the second biggest difference between the monthly cost of renting and buying. Lloyds (LLOY.L) said that a difference of 19.5% could mean first-time buyers save £217 per month or £2,604 a year. On average, first-time buyers in the city paid £180,000 for a property, making a 5% deposit £9,000.
In Edinburgh, the analysis showed that mortgage repayments could potentially be 13.2% cheaper than renting – working out to a monthly saving of £184 and an annual saving of £2,208. On average, first-time buyers paid £243,000 for a property in Edinburgh, so a 5% deposit would be £12,150.
While the research showed that renting could work out slightly cheaper in the short-term in Cardiff and Sheffield, Lloyds said the that longer-term benefit of building up equity in the property could outweigh the difference."

The company’s recent partnerships with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and Apple AAPL underscore its strategic significance and long-term growth potential.
On July 10, the company secured a multibillion-dollar investment and long-term commitments from DoD. The funding will support the construction of its second domestic magnet manufacturing facility (the 10X Facility). Slated to begin commissioning in 2028, it will take MP Materials’ total U.S. rare earth magnet manufacturing capacity to an estimated 10,000 metric tons. Under the 10-year agreement, DoD has established a price floor commitment of $110 per kilogram for MP Materials’ products stockpiled or sold, protecting them from market volatility. Also, DoD has committed that 100% of the magnets produced at the 10X Facility will be purchased by defense and commercial customers for 10 years, ensuring stable and predictable cash flow.
Complementing this, MP’s July 15 agreement with Apple marks a transformative milestone in the clean-tech value chain. Under this deal, MP will supply Apple with rare earth magnets made entirely from recycled materials, leveraging five years of joint R&D to meet Apple’s sustainability and quality standards.
Together, these partnerships highlight MP’s unique role as the only fully integrated rare earth producer in North America, spanning mining, separation and magnet manufacturing. Backed by these, MP Materials’ shares have gained 135.1% since July, outperforming the industry’s 9.8% growth, the Zacks Basic Materials sector’s 6.8% rise and the S&P 500’s gain of 8.7%.

But nearly two decades later, the once renegade crypto industry has become increasingly intertwined with Wall Street. On the latest episode of Fortune’s Crypto Playbook (which you can find on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube), Citi’s head of enterprise digital assets, Artem Korenyuk, says that there’s increasing “synergy” between the two sectors.
After the Wild West early days of crypto, Wall Street became increasingly interested in digital assets as Bitcoin’s price rose into the hundreds and then thousands of dollars, and as other blockchains like Ethereum offered the promise of decentralized financial applications such as lending and payments that could reduce the frictions of legacy systems. But many early pilots, such as the R3 blockchain consortium formed in 2015 among financial firms such as Goldman Sachs and Santander, never gained any traction amid regulatory uncertainty and the ups and downs of the volatile industry.
But with the Trump administration’s embrace of crypto and the passage of the Genius Act in July, which established regulation for stablecoins, Korenyuk says this time is different. “Blockchain is here to stay,” he tells Fortune. The question, he added, is how it will be used.
Citi has long been a pioneer in the space, including through its Citi Token Services program, which uses a private blockchain to facilitate 24/7 payments between institutional Citi customers. While this is a more limited use case, especially because it doesn’t utilize the permissionless and decentralized innovations of Bitcoin, Korenyuk says it proves that crypto’s distributed ledger technology can change payment rails through programmability. For example, financial markets have separate systems for different types of assets, such as cash, securities, and debt, while tokens and smart contracts on blockchains “follow the same architecture, creating economies of scale and efficiencies,” Korenyuk says.
Whether banks like Citi will start using blockchain in more widespread ways that impact everyday customers is another matter. Some have begun experimenting with tokenizing different types of financial instruments such as money-market funds, or issuing them on blockchains, and institutions have also explored launching their own stablecoins in the wake of the Genius Act. Korenyuk says that work by the Securities and Exchange Commission to create new regulatory frameworks for crypto has allowed Wall Street to explore new types of applications, especially around tokenized stocks. “We’re certainly paying close attention to it,” Korenyuk says.

The chip is also the first processor to be manufactured at Intel's newly opened Fab 52 plant in Arizona. Intel said its 18A process is the world's most advanced process technology researched, developed, and built in America.
Core Ultra series 3 chips will go into high-volume production this year and begin shipping before the end of the year.
The announcement is a win for Intel on two fronts. The first is that the company is finally shipping a product using 18A, which has faced delays due to the introduction of the new RibbonFET gate-all-around transistors with PowerVia, designed to improve performance and energy efficiency.
Producing the new chips in Arizona also helps solidify Intel's commitment to US manufacturing at a time when the Trump administration is focusing on onshoring semiconductor fabrication.
Intel said its Core Ultra series 3 processors will come in three main flavors: an 8-core CPU variant with up to 4Xe GPU cores, a 16-core CPU option with up to 4Xe GPU cores, and a 16-core CPU with up to 12Xe GPU cores.
The chip can also support up to 96GB of memory and offers up to 180 trillion operations per second (TOPS), a common measure of AI performance.
According to Intel, Core Ultra series 3 chips should see up to a 50% increase in multi-thread performance and 10% increase in single-thread performance versus the company's previous-generation Lunar Lake- and Arrow Lake-based processors.
GPU performance is expected to increase by as much as 50%.
Intel will need to prove that its latest chip is powerful while also maintaining long-lasting battery life in laptops. The company has been struggling to maintain its lead in the PC market, with rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gaining ground, thanks to advances in chip performance and energy efficiency.
Apple's (AAPL) MacBooks, which run on the company's own custom Arm-based chips, have set the standard for powerful laptops that can easily last an entire workday on a single charge.
Qualcomm (QCOM) has also introduced its own Arm-based chips for Windows PCs, which marry performance and efficiency, adding to Intel's need for a competing offering.
In addition to the Core Ultra series 3, Intel showed off its Xeon 6+ data center processor based on its 18A tech.
If the chip giant is successful and its 18A-based chips are everything the company believes they are, they could provide the kind of boost it needs to convince future customers to build their own chips on Intel's process technology."

FCA reveals details of payout scheme,"Payouts relating to the car financing scandal are expected to be £700 on average per agreement, the FCA said",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5b2198fddb525f6bdbeb778f248eb1806270b87c7c9d13409a02a56aeda6ffb6,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/car-finance-claimants-compensation-what-to-know-160837788.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/car-finance-claimants-compensation-what-to-know-160837788.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/car-finance-claimants-compensation-what-to-know-160837788.html,yahoo.com,200,,"The City regulator has released fresh details about its compensation scheme for motorists affected by the car financing scandal.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently announced that those who were owed money could expect to receive an average of £700 per agreement.
In addition, Lloyds banking group (LLOY.L) said it may need to set aside a “material” sum of extra money to cover the cost of the FCA's scheme. The bank already has a provision of £1.2bn reserved to compensate claimants. However, after considering the FCA's updated guidance, it doesn't believe the reserves will be sufficient.
The long-running saga has weighed heavily on the stocks of the most exposed players. Another impacted lender is Close Brothers (CBG.L), which had previously said it would set aside up to £165m for motor commission costs in the first half of its financial year.
The FCA is still consulting on the scheme, but it is due to open in early 2026.
The car financing scandal involved the mis-selling of financing agreements to customers. It is estimated that 44% of all agreements made since 2007 would be considered unfair, allowing those affected to claim compensation.
""Many firms were not complying with the law or our disclosure rules that were in force when they sold loans to consumers,"" the FCA said at the time.

Several weeks ago, the FCA launched a £1m campaign to raise awareness about compensation. It had previously said that collective payouts relating to the scandal could reach £18bn. However, an average payout of £700 means that the collective total may now be lower than previously thought.
The FCA's campaign aimed to make people aware that they didn't need to use a claims management company (CMC) or law firm to access the scheme.
As part of the campaign, which features radio and online advertising, the FCA said it was teaming up with influencers to get the message to consumers.
Research commissioned by the regulator found that 79% of motor finance customers are aware that they may be entitled to compensation, and 61% are aware of a potential compensation scheme. However, 41% of those aware they may be eligible for a payout didn’t know they wouldn't need to use a claims management company or law firm if a redress scheme is introduced.
The FCA said that using a CMC or law firm to make a motor finance claim could cost consumers around 30% of any compensation paid.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -When Tesla's board of directors offered Elon Musk the biggest executive pay package in corporate history in September, it reassured investors that he would have to achieve the equivalent of “Mars-shot milestones” to earn $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years.
The board’s proposal said Musk would have to “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” in robotics and autonomous driving as well as stock value and profits. Conversely, Musk would get “zero” unless he meets those “incredibly ambitious” goals.
Yet Musk could reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of those targets, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance goals and more than a dozen experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends including autonomous driving.
He could collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the board’s easier goals that won’t necessarily revolutionize Tesla’s products or business, the Reuters review found.
Even hitting just two of the easiest targets, along with modest stock growth, would net Musk $26 billion, more than the lifetime pay of the next eight best-paid CEOs combined, a group that includes Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Apple's Tim Cook, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, according to an analysis for Reuters by research firm Equilar.
Musk’s vehicle sales goals are exceptionally easy to achieve, according to four automotive experts. If Musk sells 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, on average, he earns $8.2 billion in stock if Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion in 2035, well under long-term market-average growth. That’s a half-million fewer cars per year than Tesla sold in 2024.
On Tuesday, Tesla unveiled lower-cost versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan to reverse falling sales.
Three other product-development goals are written in vague language that could provide Musk hefty payouts without significantly boosting profit, according to six robotics or autonomous-driving industry experts who reviewed Musk’s goals for Reuters.
Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Tesla board said: ""The proposed pay package is actually worth zero to our CEO unless and until the shareholders see the value of the company nearly double and an operational milestone is met.""
The board’s pay proposal requires Musk to remain a Tesla executive for at least seven-and-a-half years to collect any stock compensation. Musk, however, would get the voting rights associated with the share awards as soon as he earns them."

""It is perhaps counterintuitive that in order to create an environment conducive to growth, monetary policy must remain restrictive for longer,"" Mann said at an event organised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank.
""But this is necessary to bring inflation sustainably back to our 2% target in the medium term.""
Mann cautioned that despite headline inflation easing and real incomes beginning to recover, the psychological and financial impact of the sharp price increases over recent years has left deep scars on household behaviour.
“The rapid increase in the price level has scarred consumers,” she said. The central bank expects the pace of price rises to peak at 4%, twice its inflation target.

She added that research showed that households that are more uncertain about future inflation become more uncertain about their future incomes. This leads them to save money, rather than spend it, which pulls down consumption.
Mann said the BoE should maintain high interest rates to bring inflation down and reassure consumers that price stability remains intact, rather than lowering borrowing costs to encourage consumption.
The rate-setter referenced her former boss, ex-Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan, saying he had been clear that price stability occurred when households and businesses no longer factored expected price changes into their decisions.
""The evidence from consumer behaviour is that we are not there yet,"" she said.
Mann has taken a hawkish stance on interest rates in recent months. She voted with the majority of the Monetary Policy Committee in September to keep the BoE’s benchmark rate unchanged. However, in August, she was in the minority opposing a cut to 4%.
Last week, Mann said she believed UK inflation had become persistently high, though she stopped short of ruling out future rate cuts entirely.
Her comments suggest she will likely vote against a rate cut at the November meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee.
She also pointed to the scale of the inflation shock that followed the pandemic and energy crisis, arguing it had caused a sharp deviation from the UK’s pre-COVID price path.

""Between the global financial crisis and the pandemic, prices rose by just under our 2% target per year, on average. So, price level shifts and inflation were both modest. (...) If that trajectory had continued, prices would now be around 10% higher than at the end of 2019. But following the inflation surge in 2021-22, prices are now 30% higher – a three-fold increase in the price level relative to their pre-Covid trajectory."""

The Canadian company has played a key role since 2023 in uncovering some of Huawei’s most closely guarded technological secrets, while also exposing its reliance on foreign chips despite years of effort to replace American circuitry. Known for its detailed breakdowns that identify the parts of electronic products, it was first to reveal a number of undisclosed suppliers and components in Chinese hardware. Two years ago, a Bloomberg investigation in partnership with TechInsights found Huawei had developed a made-in-China smartphone processor that could compete with the likes of Qualcomm Inc. and Apple Inc.
TechInsights also confirmed the presence of restricted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. chips in Huawei devices, helping shed light on how the Chinese firm used a third party to circumvent US sanctions and get the components it needed. And last week, the company was able to establish that key parts from TSMC, Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. were present in Huawei’s most advanced AI semiconductors.
“Foreign entities such as Dedrone by Axon and TechInsights and their affiliates have defied China’s strong objections to engage in activities such as so-called military-technical cooperation with Taiwan, made malicious remarks concerning China and assisted foreign governments in suppressing Chinese companies,” the ministry said in a separate statement.
TechInsights declined to comment. Its Japanese, Korean and European entities, along with subsidiary Strategy Analytics, were all placed on the entity list. London-based BAE Systems Plc., one of the major names associated with Europe’s defense industry upgrades in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is the most notable other company among the latest set of additions.

Despite bitcoin's gains over the past 24 hours, and hitting an all-time high above $126,000 at the start of the week, investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown has taken a hard line against the cryptocurrency sector. Speaking to the Financial Times on Thursday the company warned against investors having digital assets as part of client’s portfolios.
“We do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn’t be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals,” the firm said in a statement to the FT. It added that “bitcoin is not an asset class”.
The statement came just as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year ban on allowing British retail investors to hold regulated crypto products.
However, Hargreaves Lansdown said it would conduct additional risk assessments before deciding whether to enable access to cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on its platform.
Fed minutes hint at policy shift
The assessment of the cryptocurrency market from Hargreaves Lansdown comes amid a broader rally across digital assets, fuelled by dovish signals from the US Federal Reserve and strong inflows into spot bitcoin and ether ETFs.
On Wednesday, minutes from the Fed’s September meeting revealed that around half of policymakers expect two more rate cuts by the end of the year, marking a more dovish stance from the central bank.
Markets reacted with gains across equities, crypto, and commodities. On Wednesday, spot bitcoin ETFs saw $441m in net inflows, their eighth consecutive day of gains. Meanwhile, ether ETFs added another $69m, reflecting renewed investor appetite for digital assets.
Meanwhile, gold surged above $4,050 per ounce for the first time, up 11.7% this month and an astonishing 55% year-to-date, as fears over fiat currency debasement pushed investors toward hard assets.

Some of the metal’s recent haven-driven momentum cooled following comments from US president Donald Trump, who said a peace agreement in the Middle East was “very close”. His remarks came after Israeli and Hamas officials expressed cautious optimism over Egyptian-brokered talks that could bring an end to the two-year conflict in Gaza.

Matthew Piggott, director of gold and silver at consultancy Metals Focus, attributed the metal’s strength to continued macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility.
“With these factors likely to persist through 2026, we see no significant catalysts that would cause gold (GC=F) prices to decline meaningfully,” Piggott said. “Therefore, we expect gold to continue rising throughout the year, testing $5,000 per ounce.”
“Gold (GC=F) is at record high prices and in a strongly overbought territory. Yet, fundamentals remain supportive of the bull run,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said.
“Previous bullish cycles suggest that the rally has room to extend further. A rally to $5,000 per ounce is not ruled out.”

Oil prices were little changed on Thursday as investors balanced news of a potential ceasefire in Gaza, which could ease Middle East tensions, against stalled peace efforts in Ukraine, which continue to underpin sanctions on Russian exports.
Brent (BZ=F) crude futures rose 0.1% to trade at $66.32 per barrel at the time of writing, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures gained 0.2% to $62.65 a barrel.
Trump announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a long-awaited deal involving a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, part of a broader plan to end the two-year war in the Palestinian enclave. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would convene his government to approve the agreement.
The conflict in Gaza has provided upward pressure on oil prices this year, with investors wary of the risk that the violence could spiral into a broader regional conflict and disrupt energy supplies."

Elsewhere, traders are watching updates surrounding Israel and Hamas agreeing to pause fighting in Gaza so that the remaining hostages there can be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
Of the 251 people taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023, there are believed to be 48 hostages still being held in Gaza — 20 of whom are thought to be alive.
The Israeli government will meet on Thursday to approve the deal. If approved, the ceasefire will go into effect immediately.
Negotiations for the deal were held in Egypt, and aside from the Egyptian government, Qatar, the US and Turkey also helped broker the talks.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen commended the diplomatic efforts to reach a deal, saying she is ""encouraged"" by the support given by the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. ""Now, all parties must fully uphold the terms of the agreement,"" she said.
Canadian prime minister Mark Carney said he is ""relieved that the hostages will soon be reunited with their families. After years of intense suffering, peace finally feels attainable.""

Silver price rises over $50 per ounce
The price of silver has hit its highest level in over 40 years as the surge of money into precious metals continues.
Spot silver rose over $50 per ounce today for the first time in decades. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that it was the highest level since 1980 when the billionaire Hunt brothers attempted to corner the silver market — with disastrous results.
Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herber Hunt inflated the price of silver by more than 700% after hoarding physical silver and purchasing silver futures contracts, using money accrued from the family oil business, and then borrowing more.
Eventually, they owned a third of all the silver in the world. But the trade turned sour after authorities restricted buying commodities with borrowed money, prompting the silver price to collapse.

Copper hits 16-month high
Copper prices have hit a 16-month high today, to $11,000 per metric ton, amid fears of a shortage.
Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 3.1% to hit the $11,000 mark, near to its all-time peak of $11,104.50, set in May 2024.
It comes after a series of disruptions to mine supply.
Last month, producer Freeport-McMoRan declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, after a large flow of wet material blocked access to parts of its underground mine, restricting evacuation routes for seven workers.

Interest rates must stay higher for longer, warns BoE's Mann
A senior Bank of England rate setter has warned that interest rates in the UK must remain elevated for an extended period, as inflation expectations remain stubbornly high and the damage from the recent price surge continues to weigh on consumer sentiment.
""It is perhaps counterintuitive that in order to create an environment conducive to growth, monetary policy must remain restrictive for longer,"" Mann said at an event organised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank.
""But this is necessary to bring inflation sustainably back to our 2% target in the medium term.""
Mann cautioned that despite headline inflation easing and real incomes beginning to recover, the psychological and financial impact of the sharp price increases over recent years has left deep scars on household behaviour.
“The rapid increase in the price level has scarred consumers,” she said. The central bank expects the pace of price rises to peak at 4%, twice its inflation target.
She added that research showed that households that are more uncertain about future inflation become more uncertain about their future incomes. This leads them to save money, rather than spend it, which pulls down consumption.
Mann said the BoE should maintain high interest rates to bring inflation down and reassure consumers that price stability remains intact, rather than lowering borrowing costs to encourage consumption.
The rate-setter referenced her former boss, ex-Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan, saying he had been clear that price stability occurred when households and businesses no longer factored expected price changes into their decisions.
""The evidence from consumer behaviour is that we are not there yet,"" she said.

French bonds rally as Macron looks to appoint new PM
The cost of French government borrowing fell on Thursday amid hopes that Europe’s second largest economy will avoid a snap election.
It comes as Emmanuel Macron said yesterday that he would name a new prime minister within 48 hours.
The French president said his outgoing prime minister Sébastien Lecornu, who resigned on Monday, had established that most parties were against fresh elections after talks with rival factions.
France’s 10-year bond yield edged down by one basis point to 3.5%, outperforming European peers and showing signs of recovery after recent sharp moves.

What to do if a lack of career confidence is holding you back
Sometimes making a decision about your career is easy, like when you’ve been offered a job you really want. But at other times, making a big change can be more complicated – especially if you struggle with confidence.
In a survey of 5,000 UK adults, a third (32%) of women cited a lack of career confidence and perceived opportunities. While 65% of men felt positive about their career to date, only 57% of women shared this view. Optimism about future career prospects was similarly lower for women (50%) than for men (59%). Furthermore, low confidence is a common barrier to career progression, fair pay, and leadership opportunities.
“When you lack career confidence, you can become the biggest block to your professional success,” says Life Coach Directory member Robert Sanders. “Limitations to progress can often be because you have a belief about yourself that doesn’t support your success.”
These negative beliefs can be subtle. For example, Sanders explains, you may worry that the salary attached to the next step in your career is too much and avoid applying for jobs.
“The belief might be ‘I can never do the job well enough to be paid that much money’ – or it could be a belief about your knowledge, skills or experience,” he says. “You may think you don’t know enough, or have the right connections, or you haven’t worked in the area long enough. Notice that it is not the facts of the situation that prevent success, but your view of those facts.”
So how can we feel more self-assured in our abilities, skills and decisions?

Staff return to production after JLR cyber-attack
Range Rover production lines in Solihull have resumed, while around 1,000 employees also started work in the car maker's Wolverhampton engine plant on Wednesday.
The news marks a ""significant moment"" on JLR's journey back to full vehicle production after it was hit by a cyber attack.
""Wolverhampton is one of the first sites to restart production because it's where we build all of the engines for JLR vehicles ahead of vehicle production taking place,"" the said.
On Monday, it revealed that it had suffered a sharp drop in sales, adding that it had been a ""challenging quarter"" as it also dealt with the impact of higher US tariffs.
There was a ""strong sense of unity and momentum"" as the company welcomed back staff, said global manufacturing director Luis Vara.

Starmer and Modi meet on second day of India trade mission
Keir Starmer is meeting Narendra Modi for face-to-face talks on the second and final day of his trade mission to India.
The prime minister and his Indian counterpart are meeting at Raj Bhavan, the official residence of the governor of Maharashtra, the state of which Mumbai is the capital.
Alongside the new trade deal between the two nations, the two prime ministers are expected to discuss the Indian leader’s relationship with Russia and the long-term detention of a British citizen.
Starmer has so far declined to answer questions about Modi’s close relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and India’s continued purchase of Russian fossil fuels during his visit to Mumbai.
Western nations who back Ukraine are attempting to tighten the screw of sanctions on Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet” of ships, which it uses to illicitly sell oil and gas.
Starmer has insisted the UK remains among Kyiv’s biggest supporters, but suggested Britain’s relationship with India is also stronger than ever.

Lloyds warns of ‘material’ extra provision needed for car finance payouts
Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) has warned it may need to set aside a “material” sum of extra money to cover the cost of the UK watchdog’s proposed motor finance compensation scheme.
Lloyds already has a provision of £1.2bn reserved for the mis-selling issue.
But it said it was likely this will not be enough, having read through the proposals published by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Tuesday.
Lloyds has significant exposure to the car finance industry through its Black Horse business.
The bank told investors:
Some 14 million car finance agreements are due compensation under the FCA’s proposed scheme.
This is because motor firms broke the law and its rules when they sold loans to people between 2007 and 2024, by not properly disclosing information to customers about commission arrangements.
This meant people were treated unfairly and potentially not given a fair deal.
The regulator estimated that the industry could foot a bill totalling £8.2bn worth of payouts, based on around 85% of eligible customers taking part in its scheme.
This rises to £11bn once the cost of implementing the scheme and doing the work is taken into account.

Gold price could hit $5,000, analysts say
Gold prices eased slightly on Thursday morning but remained firmly above the $4,000 threshold, as lingering geopolitical and economic uncertainty continued to bolster demand for the traditional safe-haven asset.
At the time of writing, gold (GC=F) futures slipped 0.6%, to $4,045.10 per ounce, while the spot price retreated by 0.2% to $4,030.54 per troy ounce.
Some of the metal’s recent haven-driven momentum cooled following comments from US president Donald Trump, who said a peace agreement in the Middle East was “very close.” His remarks came after Israeli and Hamas officials expressed cautious optimism over Egyptian-brokered talks that could bring an end to the two-year conflict in Gaza.
On Wednesday, it hit $4,049.56 per ounce for its 40th record high this year. The metal has now doubled in value from the $2,000 level it held just two years ago. Since 2000, gold (GC=F) has outperformed global equities, delivering a return of more than 1,200%.
Matthew Piggott, director of gold and silver at consultancy Metals Focus, attributed the metal’s strength to continued macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility.
“With these factors likely to persist through 2026, we see no significant catalysts that would cause gold (GC=F) prices to decline meaningfully,” Piggott said. “Therefore, we expect gold to continue rising throughout the year, testing $5,000 per ounce.”
“Gold (GC=F) is at record high prices and in a strongly overbought territory. Yet, fundamentals remain supportive of the bull run,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said.
“Previous bullish cycles suggest that the rally has room to extend further. A rally to $5,000 per ounce is not ruled out.”

UK business confidence hits three-year low

ICAEW’s business sentiment dropped to -7.3 for the third quarter of 2025, down from -4.2 in the April to June period.
It was the fifth consecutive quarterly fall, and the lowest level since the last three months of 2022.

Water bills to rise further for millions
Millions of households in England are set to be hit with even higher water bill increases than previously planned, after the UK's competition regulator agreed to let five water companies increase charges.
The Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) decided to approve around a fifth of spending hikes proposed by water companies, on top of existing plans signed off by water regulator Ofwat, which will be funded by increases in bills.
While it has “largely rejected” companies’ funding requests for new activities and projects, it is provisionally allowing 21% of the total £2.7bn requested by Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, South East Water, Southern Water, and Wessex Water.
This means they can seek an extra £556m in revenue, which is expected to mean an average increase of 3% in bills for customers of the disputing companies.
That is on top of the 24% increase in bills for customers of these companies under Ofwat’s original determination.
The CMA said this extra money will fund more resilient supply, reduce pollution and also reflect increased financing costs.

Where are first-time buyer house prices rising the most?
Zoopla found that first-time buyer house prices had risen faster than the overall market in nine out of 11 UK regions.
This faster pace of growth was found to be most pronounced in the North East, where first-time buyers were looking at homes that are 10.2% more expensive than a year ago, with prices having risen to an average £134,800. That compared to a rise of 2.4% for the wider market to 146,600.
Scotland came in second place, with the cost of a first home rising by an average 6.4% over the past year to £146,600, compared a 2.1% increase in the wider market to £170,000.
In Yorkshire and Humber, the price of a typical first home rose by an average 6% to £167,700, compared to a 1.9% rise in the broader market to £192,500.
In London, where property is much more expensive, Zoopla found that first-time buyers were looking at home that are 2.4% cheaper than a year ago, though the average price was still £420,600.
Zoopla said that first-time buyers typically to target homes that are 15% cheaper than the average price within the local area. The property website said that they tend to target house prices that are 21% below the average in London and the South East and 17% in Wales.
Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, said that despite the recent boost to mortgage affordability more broadly, first-time buyers in London and southern England are still looking for cheaper homes than a year ago.

First-time buyers look at higher-priced homes after mortgage shakeup
First-time buyers in the UK have been looking at higher-value homes as mortgage affordability has improved, according to Zoopla.
The property website found that, as of July, first-time buyers were looking at homes that were 2.4% more expensive than a year earlier, at an average price of £229,000.
The findings, published on Thursday, were based on an analysis by Zoopla of the asking prices that were most popular among first-time buyers.
Its analysis showed that house prices overall had grown by 1.3% on average, and while this pace of growth was slower, the typical cost of a home across the wider market was still higher at £268,449.
Zoopla explained that mortgage affordability had improved over the past six months, giving all buyers using a mortgage 20% more borrowing power. It said that this was one reason behind a 30% increase in first-time buyer mortgages and also explained why were now targeting higher value homes in more affordable regions.
First-time buyers account for around two-fifths (39%) of all house sales every year and half (49%) of all new mortgages for home purchases, according to Zoopla. Its data showed that 45% of first-time buyers were focused on buying three-bedroom houses, while interest in flats had decreased to 29%.

Apple Investment Narrative Recap
Owning Apple shares has long meant believing in the enduring power of its brand, robust services ecosystem, and ability to lead consumer technology through innovation and new product launches. With CEO Tim Cook and other top executives linked to a potential departure, and uncertainty about leadership in artificial intelligence, this transition raises questions about innovation direction, but for now, does not materially alter the most important short-term catalyst: adoption of Apple Intelligence and new device features. The single largest risk remains competitive and technological disruption in AI, which could impact Apple’s long-term differentiation and earnings power.
Among the latest announcements, the launch of the iPhone 17 lineup stands out for its relevance as Apple’s core product refresh and key driver for device upgrade cycles. The performance of these new devices will be closely watched, as uneven early demand highlights ongoing challenges in balancing consumer excitement, pricing power, and innovation, all closely linked to near-term revenue momentum and longer-term strategic positioning. However, the coming leadership change brings a potential element of unpredictability that cannot be ignored.
In contrast, investors should be watching closely for signals that regulatory and legal scrutiny around the App Store could...

In 2005, the two largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., when measured by market cap, were energy giant ExxonMobil at $392 billion and industrial bellwether General Electric worth $375 billion. Now, just 20 years later, technology companies spearheading advances in artificial intelligence (AI) rule the roost.
Four household names top the list. AI chipmaker Nvidia is the frontrunner at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), regularly climbing to new heights. Cloud and software provider Microsoft takes up second place, worth $3.9 trillion. iPhone maker Apple is nipping at Microsoft's heels at $3.8 trillion, and search pioneer Alphabet rounds out the top four at $3 trillion.
With a market cap of nearly $2.4 trillion, it seems almost a foregone conclusion that Amazon (AMZN -0.93%) will soon join the fold. The company has numerous growth drivers that continue to defy detractors, and the vast opportunity represented by AI will likely take the company over the finish line into the $3 trillion club.
A rare triple threat
What sets Amazon apart from the competition is its triad of successful businesses. While it's impressive for a company to have even one industry-leading business, Amazon has two and a third that's a strong contender in its field.
First up is Amazon's flagship e-commerce platform. The company made its fortune as a pioneer in the nascent e-commerce space in 1994, before ultimately earning the moniker of ""Everything Store"" and becoming the world's largest online retailer. Amazon is also the world's second-largest retailer, behind just Walmart.
Results from the second quarter help illustrate the overall magnitude of the company's success. Net sales of $167.7 billion increased 13% year over year, with 61% of the topline coming from digital retail or third-party seller services. This fueled net income of $18.2 billion, up 35%.
Amazon's second industry-leading business -- and by far its most important segment -- is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud infrastructure services business. AWS provides on-demand computing solutions, software applications, AI, and more.
The company continues to dominate the space it pioneered in 2002, with an estimated 30% of the market, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, with 20% and 13%, respectively, according to Statista. Furthermore, the cloud segment continues to grow at a respectable clip, up 17% year over year in the second quarter. AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income for the first six months of 2025, helping to fund the company's other growth initiatives.
Last but certainly not least is Amazon's fast-growing advertising business, which is fueled by its valuable product search, as well as Amazon Prime Video, live sports programming, Fire TV, and the company's live-streaming gaming platform, Twitch. Advertising revenue of $15.7 billion increased 23% year-over-year in the second quarter, accounting for 9% of total revenue. These statistics place Amazon third in the race for digital advertising dominance, behind only Google and Meta Platforms.
If that trio of successful businesses wasn't enough, Amazon is also one of the foremost authorities on AI, with more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already available for its cloud customers, and plans to offer many more. ""AI will be a substantial catalyst,"" according to CEO Andy Jassy.
The path to $3 trillion
Amazon has a market cap of roughly $2.35 trillion (as of this writing), so its stock price will only need to increase by roughly 27% to reach $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $902 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.
Wall Street is currently predicting Amazon's growth will clock in at roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. However, given its history of strong execution, that target us likely conservative and I predict the company will make the grade sooner.
Finally, at 34 times earnings, Amazon trades at a premium compared to a multiple of 31 for the S&P 500. That said, the company has delivered stock price gains of 712% over the past decade, far exceeding the 239% gains S&P 500. This helps illustrate why Amazon represents a compelling opportunity as it marches toward $3 trillion."

MP Materials Investment Narrative Recap
For investors considering MP Materials, the core narrative rests on the belief that US-backed rare earth supply chains will outweigh ongoing losses and volatility, with government and tech partnerships smoothing near-term earnings. The recent confirmation of a decade-long Department of Defense magnet purchase agreement strengthens revenue visibility and may mitigate price risk, but does not eliminate the immediate challenges posed by higher production costs and persistent negative cash flow, which remain the main short-term risks.
Among the latest announcements, the $500 million multi-year supply contract with Apple stands out. This deal not only highlights demand certainty from technology giants but, in tandem with government commitments, could offer increased confidence as MP Materials seeks to scale up US-focused rare earth manufacturing, though execution risk and client concentration persist.
But with guaranteed buyers, there are still risks that investors should consider, such as the potential for...

But at other times, making a big change can be more complicated – especially if you struggle with confidence.
In a survey of 5,000 UK adults, a third (32%) of women cited a lack of career confidence and perceived opportunities. While 65% of men felt positive about their career to date, only 57% of women shared this view. Optimism about future career prospects was similarly lower for women (50%) than for men (59%). Furthermore, low confidence is a common barrier to career progression, fair pay, and leadership opportunities.
“When you lack career confidence, you can become the biggest block to your professional success,” says Life Coach Directory member Robert Sanders. “Limitations to progress can often be because you have a belief about yourself that doesn’t support your success.”
These negative beliefs can be subtle. For example, Sanders explains, you may worry that the salary attached to the next step in your career is too much and avoid applying for jobs.

“The belief might be ‘I can never do the job well enough to be paid that much money’ – or it could be a belief about your knowledge, skills or experience,” he says. “You may think you don’t know enough, or have the right connections, or you haven’t worked in the area long enough. Notice that it is not the facts of the situation that prevent success, but your view of those facts.”
So how can we feel more self-assured in our abilities, skills and decisions?
Focus on the facts
Our worries and beliefs aren’t always based on reality, so it can help to keep a clear record of your successes and achievements to refer back to.
“This isn’t for your CV,” says Sanders. “When you are in a negative state you will tend to focus on the low points, the mistakes and the false starts. We need to fight the natural tendency towards self-doubt by having a good stock of memories and achievements to counter-balance them.”
Remember that opportunities are not always limited
Another common habit is to think that there are only a limited number of opportunities in life. For example, believing that missing a promotion is your last chance to progress in your career.
“You need to think in terms of abundance,” says Sanders. “There are plenty of opportunities. Most roles exist in multiple forms, sometimes you can even create them yourself! You have plenty of time available to you.”
Find a mentor
If you’re feeling stuck, it can help to have a sounding board in the form of a mentor or a career coach. They can provide guidance and advice, help you identify your strengths and develop new skills, provide encouragement to take risks and help you work out your goals."

Most Read from Bloomberg
“There’s no notion that Google has to date gained monopoly or market power” in the artificial intelligence market, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein told Judge Amit Mehta. Likewise, “there’s been no finding that Maps is a monopoly product or that YouTube is a monopoly product.”
Mehta, who found that Google has monopolized search and search advertising, is crafting a remedy to resolve the company’s illegal conduct. In a decision last month, he ruled that Google could no longer pay companies to exclusively use its Search, Chrome web browser or Google Play Store, though he declined to bar all payments outright. Mehta’s ruling incorporated aspects of proposals from Google and the Justice Department, which led to Wednesday’s hearing where both sides argued for him to adopt their language in a final order.
During the trial, witnesses testified that Google offers an “all-or-nothing” bundle to device manufactures, effectively requiring they preload nearly a dozen of Google’s apps if they want access to the the Play Store, the largest app store on Google’s Android operating system. That requirement, for example, forced Microsoft Corp. to feature Google search on its Surface Duo touchscreen device instead of its own search engine, Bing.
The Justice Department argued that the same prohibitions that apply to Search, Chrome and Play should also apply to Google’s Gemini, a proposal the company opposes.
Google’s YouTube is the TV service of choice for viewers of all ages, Bloomberg has reported. It now accounts for more than all of Walt Disney Co.’s TV networks and streaming services combined, according to recent data from Nielsen. It also generates more sales from advertising than all four broadcast networks combined, and users collectively watch over 1 billion hours of video on YouTube every day.
Google Maps, meanwhile, dominates the digital mapping and navigation market by a significant margin. Last year, the service surpassed 2 billion monthly users globally, placing it among a handful of Google’s most widely used products. Comparatively, Apple Inc. had “hundreds of millions” of Apple Maps users in 2020, the company has said. More than 5 million other apps and websites also rely on the Google Maps Platform to power location services like navigation and local business data."

That is reflected in the share price, which has risen by just 3% so far in 2025. Investors desperately want some positive news from the management team.
We won't have to wait long for a fresh update. Apple is set to report results for its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (which ended Sept. 27) on Oct. 30. Should you buy this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock before then?
Apple shares still look expensive
At a price-to-earnings ratio of 38.9, Apple shares trade at a rich valuation. This stock doesn't seem like a smart buy today, especially given the company's lack of progress in AI. It also doesn't help that Apple's growth has decelerated over the past three years.
If Apple were to report results and guidance that came in well ahead of Wall Street analysts' estimates, then there's a high likelihood shares would jump in response. However, it's anyone's guess whether this will happen. Correctly forecasting both a company's numbers and the market's reaction to them is an impossible task to perform consistently.
Investors who are considering buying Apple should not feel urgency to get in before Oct. 30. Instead, any decision about a stock purchase should be made based on at least a five-year time horizon for holding the shares."

After all, QUALCOMM has been anything but quiet lately. The stock is up 3.3% over the last month, standing at $165.46 after the most recent close. While it has only moved -0.6% over both the past week and the past year, its three-year performance tells a more energizing story: up 63.2%, and a solid 41.8% gain over five years. Not too shabby for a tech giant navigating one of the most turbulent industries around.
Much of this recent momentum can be traced back to news that QUALCOMM’s chips are now sporting the newest Arm architecture. This sets the company up to better compete in the red-hot AI space and square off against rivals like MediaTek and Apple. The bigger picture, though, is about staying nimble as political winds shift and the U.S. sets its sights on more domestic chip manufacturing. With tariff talk, policy moves, and global supply chain headlines, sentiment around QUALCOMM’s risk and growth potential is seesawing, and the market has been quick to price in every twist and turn.
But what about value? QUALCOMM’s valuation score is 4 out of 6, meaning it checks the box for undervaluation on most but not all metrics. Is that enough to make it a buy or a hold at these levels? Next, we will break down exactly how those valuations stack up using the key methods analysts love. After that, we will explore a smarter, more holistic way to think about QUALCOMM’s true worth.
Why QUALCOMM is lagging behind its peers
Approach 1: QUALCOMM Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model aims to estimate a company’s true value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to their present value. It is widely regarded as one of the best ways to examine a company’s underlying worth based on how much cash it can generate over time.
For QUALCOMM, the starting point is healthy. The company’s latest twelve months Free Cash Flow stands at $11.25 billion. Analyst projections suggest Free Cash Flow will climb to $16.32 billion by 2029. After the next five years, the projections are extrapolated by analysts at Simply Wall St, estimating further steady growth through 2035.
According to the current DCF model, the estimated intrinsic fair value for QUALCOMM comes out to $194.58 per share. With the stock closing at $165.46, that makes the shares about 15 percent undervalued by this method, which could suggest some room for upside if you believe these cash flow projections hold up."

Intel’s turnaround still hinges on fixing its foundry operations, which continue to face execution failures and weak customer traction.
“A TSMC technology deal – which we think is the only one that matters – is unlikely despite potential for future investments,” analysts at HSBC said.
Intel has announced three investment deals in recent months: a $2 billion stake from SoftBank, $11.1 billion from the U.S. government for a 9.9% holding, and a $5 billion investment from NVIDIA for about 4%.
While these helped lift sentiment, HSBC said the optimism is overdone as none address the structural issues in Intel’s foundry business.
There are media reports that Intel is seeking investments from Apple and TSMC. It could bring short-term upside but HSBC reiterated that only a technology-sharing agreement with TSMC could meaningfully improve its manufacturing capabilities.
Analysts see this as a remote possibility given TSMC’s own massive U.S. investments.
Intel has also struck a deal with NVIDIA, where the companies will focus on connecting NVIDIA and Intel architectures to integrate NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Intel’s x86 CPU technology.
HSBC flagged limited visibility on the NVIDIA partnership, noting that the opportunity is hard to quantify since NVIDIA will continue using Arm-based CPUs in its server platforms through 2029.
The analysts cut their rating to Reduce with a $24 price target, citing weak foundry prospects and lack of clarity around client and server demand.

Joseph Terranova from Virtus Investment Partners said in a latest program on CNBC that he believes Apple could make a new all-time high. Here is what the analyst said:

Terranova's call may be right in the short term, but the stock is losing catalysts for the long term. Many analysts are warning that the market should not turn overly bullish on the iPhone 17 cycle. Apple can only do so much in innovation to revolutionize its iPhone each year. A UBS survey shows that the iPhone upgrade cycle has reached 35 months in the US. A separate report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners says about 63% of iPhone users keep their smartphones for more than two years. Apple is losing its pricing edge as it has to put a cap on its price tags to compete in key markets like China. Samsung, Xiaomi and other companies can launch advanced hardware and software features to compete with Apple and keep the company under pressure in Asia.
Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Finally, shares of technology bellwether Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) underperformed the market and lost value as the company faced a classic innovator’s dilemma, which appeared all the more egregious as competitors embraced the AI opportunity. Apple has had a dominant market position in smartphones and services, but now more than ever, investors are questioning the future outlook for the company. Despite posting a negative absolute strategy return during the quarter, which weighed on absolute strategy returns, relative to Apple’s the company’s large position in the benchmark our underweight position proved to be a tailwind to relative results during the quarter.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Threadneedle Street said that share price valuations on US stock markets were similar to those seen near the peak of the dotcom bubble on some measures, noting that US government bonds were also vulnerable to any weakening in the Federal Reserve's credibility.
In its quarterly update, the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) warned of the dangers of an AI-triggered market slump, saying: ""The risk of a sharp market correction has increased.""
It added: “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence.
“This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.”

The BoE highlighted that 30% of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) valuation was made up by the five largest companies, which was the greatest concentration in 50 years.
Share valuations based on past earnings were the most stretched since the dotcom bubble 25 years ago, though looked less so based on investors' expectations for future profits.
“Material bottlenecks to AI progress” including across power, data, or commodity supply chains could also harm valuations, particularly for firms who are expected to benefit from greater AI investment, the FPC said.
It comes as US president Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates and sought to remove governor Lisa Cook over allegations she committed mortgage fraud when purchasing a home in 2021.
But the BoE stressed that central bank independence “underpins monetary and financial stability”.

""A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp repricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility,"" it said.
Thirty-year gilt yields hit their highest since 1998 last month and yields for shorter maturities, where most UK borrowing is concentrated, have risen too. The BoE said this increase pointed to concerns about the difficulty reining in high borrowing across advanced economies, amplified by political uncertainty in France and Japan.
The report also found that risk managers remained more confident in the stability of the British financial system than six months ago, and viewed the main dangers coming from cyberattacks and geopolitical factors."

September capped off another eventful quarter for investors, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 14.5% year-to-date and the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gained 16% in that time, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) advanced 13%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) is up more than 34% so far this year, while Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) has risen more than 20%.
Zara Nokes, global market analyst at JPMorgan Asset Management (JPM), said: ""The third quarter of 2025 saw positive returns across most major asset classes as trade tensions subsided, AI euphoria continued, and expectations for near-term rate cuts from the Federal Reserve ... ramped up.""
She said that growth-style stocks outperformed their value peers ""as excitement around the tech sector ratcheted higher"". Regionally, Nokes pointed out that emerging market stocks outperformed those in developed markets, led by the Chinese market, ""buoyed by the extension of the US-China trade truce and AI optimism"".
Another major focus for investors last month was the Fed's September meeting, after which the US central back announced a 0.25% interest rate cut. This lowered its benchmark interest rate to a range of 4% to 4.25% and was the Fed's first cut of 2025.
September also marked US president Donald Trump's state visit to the UK, during which £250bn of investment was pledged between companies from both countries.
As the month drew to a close, speculation ramped up in the UK as to what chancellor Rachel Reeves could announce in the autumn budget, following interviews and her speech at the Labour party conference.
Most popular stocks in September
Major FTSE 100 (^FTSE) companies were popular across each of AJ Bell (AJB.L), Bestinvest and Interactive Investor's lists last month.
This ranged from companies in the financial sector, to mining and housebuilding stocks.
Here's more detail on some of the stocks that proved most popular in August, according to investment platform data.
Financial services firm Legal & General (LGEN.L) featured across each of AJ Bell (AJB.L), Bestinvest and Interactive Investor's most popular stocks lists in September.
Shares in L&G are trading just over 3% year-to-date, with the stock having fallen sharply in late August, suggesting investors were keen to buy the dip.
That's despite the company reporting 9% growth in its core operating earnings per share (EPS) at 10.94p for the first half of the year. In its first half results, published in August, L&G posted a 28% rise in pre-tax profit to £406m
At the time, L&G CEO António Simões flagged that the company's operating profit for its institutional retirement business was up double digits, along with ""material progress"" in the firm's asset management business.
Another name that featured across all three platforms' lists was aero-engineer Rolls-Royce (RR.L), as government pledges to spend more on defence have buoyed stocks with exposure to the sector this year.
Shares ended the month on a fresh high, with the stock up 104% since the start of 2025.
Rolls-Royce shares rallied after the company posted strong half-year results at the end of July. The company reported an underlying operating profit of £1.76bn ($2.38bn) in the first half of the year, compared to £1.15bn a year ago. Underlying revenue of £9.06bn was also up on the £8.18bn Rolls-Royce reported in the first half of last year.
Insurance firm Phoenix Group (PHNX.L) was another popular UK blue-chip stock across all three platforms in September.
Shares are up more than 30% year-to-date, despite the stock falling following the release of the company's interim results early last month.
Phoenix reported a 25% increase in adjusted operating profit to £451m, while loss after shrunk 76% to £156m in the first six months of its fiscal year.
In addition, the company said it rebranding from Phoenix Group Holdings to Standard Life in March 2026.
Oil major BP (BP.L) appeared on both AJ Bell and Bestinvest's stock lists in September, with shares currently up nearly 10% so far this year.
That's despite continued volatility in oil prices, as developments in geopolitical conflicts drive the commodity higher, while concerns about oversupply and declining demand have led to a longer-term decline.
Like fellow FTSE 100-listed (^FTSE) oil major Shell, which also featured on AJ Bell's list, one appeal of BP to investors is its dividend yield, which sits at 5.6%, according to Hargreaves Lansdown.
In terms of US stocks, chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) remained one of the most popular stocks for investors using the Bestinvest and Interactive Investor platforms.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said that the company's shares ""enjoyed another strong month, despite growing concerns about the dizzy heights reached by valuations in the sector"".
Nvidia shares are trading more than 38% in the green year-to-date, buoyed by investor enthusiasm for AI.
In addition to announcing investment in the UK, during Trump's state visit, Nvidia (NVDA) also unveiled $100bn investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.
The most popular funds in September
Passive exposure to the world's largest companies, including the major tech firms, continued to be a key theme in August's most popular funds list.
Kyle Caldwell, funds and investment education editor at Interactive Investor, said that a key trend on the platform's September most bought funds list was increased demand for precious metals.
The iShares Physical Gold (SGLN.L) exchange traded commodity (ETC) jumped to the top of Interactive Investor's list last month, while iShares Physical Silver (SSLN.L) also appeared on the list.
""As well as geopolitical tensions and concerns over US tariffs leading investors to seek out safe-haven assets, other drivers of both gold and silver include weakness in the US dollar, higher government debts, and fears that inflation will remain sticky,"" Caldwell said.
""For gold, another element has been high amounts of central bank buying to diversify away from fiat currencies and US government bonds.""
Due to its wider industrial use, Caldwell said silver prices have had a bumpier ride over the long-term than gold, meaning it has greater cyclical characteristics.
In terms of active funds, Artemis Global Income (0P0000W36K.L) once again featured on each of the platform's lists. The fund aims to grow both income and capital over a five-year period, having generated a return of 158.9% over that time and has a historic yield of 2.63%.
Over one year, the fund has generated a return of 39%, beating an average return of 9.3% for the Investment Association Global Equity Income fund sector.
Top holdings include real estate investment trust Simon Property Group (SPG) and energy company Chevron (CVX)."

- Amkor Technology has broken ground on a new semiconductor packaging and testing campus in Peoria, Arizona, the company announced Monday. Construction is expected to be finished in mid-2027, and production is slated to begin in early 2028.
- The company expanded its total investment to $7 billion across two phases. The Arizona campus will include packaging and testing facilities along with 750,000 square feet of cleanroom space.
- Amkor will collaborate with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to supply chips to customers such as Apple and Nvidia.
Dive Insight:
Amkor described the Arizona site as the “first U.S. based high volume advanced packaging facility.” This week’s announcement marks a $5 billion increase from original plans to build a $2 billion facility.
Its campus will complement TSMC’s nearby wafer fabrication site. The testing and packaging campus, combined with TSMC’s fabs, create “an end-to-end silicon supply chain in America,” Apple COO Sabih Khan said in a statement. TSMC produces Apple silicon, and Amkor’s new facilities will package and test the chips, Khan said.
Apple has been a key partner to Amkor. The two companies collaborated on the chip packaging facility, and Apple will be Amkor’s first and largest customer once the campus opens. Amkor will also supply chips to Nvidia.
“Together, we are rebuilding the supply chain — onshoring the AI technology stack that turns energy into intelligence,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement.
Amkor’s investment boosts domestic semiconductor supply chains in an industry that has relied heavily on imports. Last year, the U.S. imported $22.6 billion of semiconductors, with more than $5.6 billion coming from Vietnam and more than $3 billion each imported from Thailand and Malaysia.
The company previously disclosed its Arizona project would receive $407 million in funding from the Chips and Science Act. Its latest release also noted financial support from an advanced manufacturing investment tax credit, as well as from state and local governments.
President Donald Trump has spoken multiple times about imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports, but the timeline remains unclear. The U.S. Department of Commerce launched a Section 232 investigation in August.
It’s still an open question if tariff threats or incentives such as tax credits or Chips for America – part of the Chips and Science Act signed into law during the Biden administration – will bring a wave of manufacturing to the U.S.
Chip manufacturers are scaling up capacity as tech companies are hungry for the semiconductors needed to power their artificial intelligence plans. Amkor said its factory technology and production lines will “meet evolving market demands for AI, high performance computing, mobile communications, and automotive applications.”
Arizona, specifically, has become a hotbed for semiconductor manufacturing, with TSMC building two sites in the state as part of a $40 billion investment. Amkor CEO Giel Rutten said the state “offers the right mix of talent, infrastructure, and industry presence.”
Amkor’s facility is expected to create 3,000 jobs. In the past, semiconductor manufacturers have struggled to fill the jobs they touted would come along with their new facilities. In 2023, TSMC disclosed that it was sending workers from Taiwan to Arizona to help with labor needs at its fabs."

In my book, I praise sticking with… individual stocks like Apple because they can deliver big wins, life-changing wins, but only if you let the gains compound year after year. You shouldn’t touch the stock unless something goes severely wrong. That’s the way to go. If you still have the itch to trade… be my guest.

Beijing-based Xiaomi launched its 17-series smartphones last month, two weeks after Apple introduced its iPhone 17 models.
In a separate Weibo post on Tuesday, Xiaomi's smartphone business president, Lu Weibing, apologised for the ""insufficient stock"" of the company's new flagship handset in the market, which has inconvenienced buyers. On October 2, Lu said more than 1 million units of the Xiaomi 17 had been sold a week after it was released, which surpassed the previous series' performance.

The latest posts from Xiaomi's senior executives reflected the company's confidence in its sharpened focus to compete in premium-priced smartphones, handsets that cost more than US$600, against rivals Apple and Huawei Technologies.
At last month's product launch, Lei touted that the Xiaomi 17 series already ""surpassed the iPhone 17 series in many areas"". That included the latest models' thin design and a new imaging system, suitable for backlight photography, that was developed through a partnership with German optical giant Leica.

The senior Xiaomi executives lauded the promotional and marketing efforts behind the 17 series in spite of some analysts' negative sales projections.
Total Xiaomi 17 shipments were expected to be more than 20 per cent lower than the firm's original plan of 10 million units, falling below the previous Xiaomi 15 series shipments of 8 million units, according to a research note last week from TF International Securities analyst Kuo Ming-chi.
Kuo said the lower shipment forecast was because of ""weaker-than-expected"" demand for the basic Xiaomi 17 model, compared with the stronger performance of the standard iPhone 17 model.
In an unconventional move, Xiaomi jumped straight to the 17 series after its 15 series was launched in October last year, which signalled its direct challenge to Apple's latest flagship model."

These combined factors are driving strong growth in Saudi Arabia's wireless headphones market.
Key Market Drivers: Rising Remote Work Culture Across the Region
The rising remote work culture across Saudi Arabia is a significant driver for the wireless headphones market in the region. According to a recent study, as of 2024, 51% of employees work remotely for at least half of their time. As businesses increasingly adopt flexible work-from-home policies, professionals require reliable and high-quality audio devices to enhance communication and productivity during virtual meetings and calls.
Wireless headphones offer the convenience of mobility without the hassle of tangled wires, enabling users to move freely while maintaining clear audio connections. Also, the shift to remote learning and virtual classrooms has boosted demand among students who need effective audio solutions for online education. This cultural shift has also encouraged the adoption of noise-canceling features, allowing users to work or study in busy home environments without distractions. Coupled with advancements in Bluetooth technology and longer battery life, the remote work trend has accelerated the penetration of wireless headphones across Saudi Arabia, supporting sustained market growth."

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) and European stocks also gained on the day, shrugging off comments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which warned that the US economy is slowing.
Wednesday's release of the minutes of the Fed's September meeting, due at 7pm UK time, will be assessed for further clues as to the likelihood of the US central bank lowering interest rates throughout the rest of the year.
As the federal government shutdown has extended into its eighth day, there have been no releases of official economic figures, leaving investors scrambling for hints from other sources on the rate outlook.
Meanwhile, Kristalina Georgieva, head of the IMF, said it was imperative for the US to work on cutting its large federal deficit. Speaking at an event hosted by the Milken Institute, she added that countries everywhere needed both the agility of the private sector, and good government data and strong institutions to ensure a level playing field.
It came as the price of gold climbed above $4,000 an ounce for the first time. The precious metal extended its recent rally as traders remain concerned about political crises in France, Japan and the US.

Spot gold rose by 1.4% to $4,058.90 an ounce, another record high, and is up more than 50% so far this year. That follows increases of 27% last year and 13% the year before.
Gold (GC=F) is seen as a safe haven in times of turmoil, and is also used as a hedge against rising inflation.
Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, said: ""Gold has staged a historic rally, doubling in less than two years, spurred by central bank buying as it diversifies away from the US dollar, president Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policy and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.
""Looking ahead, central banks are still buying – the People’s Bank of China extended its gold buying streak in September for an 11th consecutive month despite record high prices – Trump’s trade war is still pressing on, geopolitical risks remain elevated, and ETF holdings continue to expand while expectations of more Fed rate cuts intensify. All of this suggests that gold has still further room to run.""
The US remains the world’s largest holder of gold with 8,133 tonnes, now valued at $1.04tn (£776bn). It is the first time any nation’s reserves have surpassed the one trillion US dollar threshold.

US economy slowing says IMF
The US economy is slowing according to new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Speaking at an event hosted by the Milken Institute, Kristalina Georgieva, head of the IMF, said it was imperative for the US to work on cutting its large federal deficit, adding that countries everywhere needed both the agility of the private sector, and good government data and strong institutions to ensure a level playing field.

Germany economy forecast to grow just 0.2% next year
The German economy is forecast to grow just 0.2% this year, according to revised estimates from the German government.
Forecasts show that growth in Europe's largest economy is likely to pick up in 2026, with growth of 1.3%, as the government provides billions in fiscal stimulus to boost business and household sentiment.
It comes as chancellor Friedrich Merz’s coalition, which took office in May, attempts to spur growth in Germany.
Katherina Reiche, the economy minister, said that while a large portion of growth will come from a rise in government spending, it will only be effective “if investments are implemented quickly”.

The most popular stocks and funds investors bought in September
Major stock markets continued to climb in September, despite lingering concerns around geopolitics, tariffs and the economy.
September capped off another eventful quarter for investors, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) up 14.5% year-to-date and the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gained 16% in that time, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) advanced 13%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) is up more than 34% so far this year, while Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) has risen more than 20%.
Zara Nokes, global market analyst at JPMorgan Asset Management (JPM), said: ""The third quarter of 2025 saw positive returns across most major asset classes as trade tensions subsided, AI euphoria continued, and expectations for near-term rate cuts from the Federal Reserve ... ramped up.""
She said that growth-style stocks outperformed their value peers ""as excitement around the tech sector ratcheted higher"". Regionally, Nokes pointed out that emerging market stocks outperformed those in developed markets, led by the Chinese market, ""buoyed by the extension of the US-China trade truce and AI optimism"".
Another major focus for investors last month was the Fed's September meeting, after which the US central back announced a 0.25% interest rate cut. This lowered its benchmark interest rate to a range of 4% to 4.25% and was the Fed's first cut of 2025.

Bank of England warns of AI-driven stock market bubble
The Bank of England (BoE) warned on Wednesday that global financial markets could face trouble ahead if investor appetite for AI sours.
Threadneedle Street said that share price valuations on US stock markets were similar to those seen near the peak of the dotcom bubble on some measures, noting that US government bonds were also vulnerable to any weakening in the Federal Reserve's credibility.
In its quarterly update, the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) warned on the dangers of an AI-triggered market slump, saying: ""The risk of a sharp market correction has increased.""
It added: “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence.
“This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.”
The BoE highlighted that 30% of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) valuation was made up by the five largest companies, which was the greatest concentration in 50 years.
Share valuations based on past earnings were the most stretched since the dotcom bubble 25 years ago, though looked less so based on investors' expectations for future profits.
“Material bottlenecks to AI progress” including across power, data, or commodity supply chains could also harm valuations, particularly for firms who are expected to benefit from greater AI investment, the FPC said.
It comes as US president Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, as well as seeking to remove governor Lisa Cook over allegations she committed mortgage fraud when purchasing a home in 2021.
But the BoE stressed that central bank independence “underpins monetary and financial stability”.

New-build demand dips in third quarter
The latest market analysis from Property Inspect has found that fewer than one in five new homes are currently securing a buyer, with homebuyer demand for new-build properties falling on both a quarterly and annual basis.
Property Inspect analysed current market listings looking at what proportion of new-build properties are already marked as sold subject to contract to reveal how homebuyer appetites for new homes have shifted on a quarterly basis.
The research shows that across Great Britain, new-build buyer demand was muted in Q3, with just 17.7% of all new homes listed for sale having found a buyer. This marked a 0.5% reduction on the previous quarter, with demand also down 1.1% year on year.
Demand was at its weakest in Newcastle in Q3, where just 4.5% of new-build stock had found a buyer. Liverpool sits only marginally higher at 4.8%, while Aberdeen (6.0%), Swansea (6.4%) and Leeds (9.3%) also rank amongst the coldest spots for new-build homebuyer demand.
When compared to Q2, Portsmouth saw the sharpest quarterly decline, with demand falling by 6.3% in Q3, while Glasgow was down 2.7%, Newcastle by 2.0%, and Edinburgh by 1.5%. London has also cooled slightly, slipping by 0.5%.
However, there remain pockets of resilience in the market. Southampton leads the way with 40.3% of new-build homes already under offer, followed by Sheffield at 33.1%, Bournemouth at 22.6%, Bristol at 21.8%, and Portsmouth at 21.7% despite its recent quarterly fall.
Sheffield also tops the table for quarterly growth, up 12.5%, while Bournemouth climbed by 7.7%, Plymouth by 6.1%, Swansea by 5.3%, and Southampton by 5.0%.

Victims of car finance misselling may now get less compensation
Millions of victims of car finance misselling could receive less compensation than previously estimated, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Wednesday.
The regulator previously suggested motorists could receive less than £950 per deal, but it now believes the average will be about £700 per agreement. Lenders could pay out £8.2bn in compensation.
The payouts are over commission arrangements between lenders and dealers, unfair contracts, and inaccurate information given to car buyers.
Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said:
The scheme would be free to access for consumers, although the interest they receive on redress will be much lower than that paid following the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal.

UK lowers borrowing estimates by £3bn after tax data error
The UK statistics office said on Wednesday that government borrowing in the previous and current fiscal years was a combined £3bn ($4.02bn) lower than previously reported after a value added tax receipt data error was found.
Reuters has the details:
""Correcting for the error reduces public sector net borrowing by between £200m and £500m per month within the period affected, resulting in a reduction in borrowing of £1bn for the financial year ending March 2025 and a reduction of £2bn for the financial year to date,"" the Office for National Statistics said.
Britain's borrowing in the 2024/25 financial year stood at just over £146bn and totalled almost £84bn in the first five months of the current one.
Finance minister Rachel Reeves is expected to raise taxes in her budget on November in order to remain on course to hit her target to fix the public finances.

German industrial production falls
German industrial production plunged 4.3% month-on-month in August, taking output to the lowest level since 2020, and following a 1.3% rise in July.
The slump raises the risk of another quarter of economic contraction, which would put Germany into recession. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are defined as a technical recession.
It comes as the economy shrank 0.3% between April and June.
Compared with August last year, industrial production slipped 3.9%, driven by weak manufacturing, particularly in the car industry, where output slumped by 18.5%.

Vertu Motors issues profit warning from JLR shutdown
Car dealership group Vertu Motors (VTU.L) has warned it could face a hit to its yearly profits of up to £5.5m as a result of “major disruption” to its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) showrooms, after the luxury carmaker was targeted by hackers.
It was “disappointing for the industry” to experience issues during September, a key month for vehicle number plates being changed, Vertu’s boss said.
JLR was forced to halt production at its factories across the UK after a serious cyber attack which has been damaging for the carmaker and its supply chain.
It is set to resume some manufacturing operations on Wednesday.
Vertu, which is one of the UK’s biggest car retailers, said it was expecting a one-off hit of up to £5.5m to its adjusted pre-tax profit for the year, depending on when JLR’s systems and trading are restored.
Its trading performance in September was impacted by £2m due to the disruption.
Adjusted pre-tax profits came in at £20m for the six months to the end of August, a 10th lower than the same period last year.
Meanwhile, Vertu reported record-high half-year sales amounting to £2.51bn, up from £2.47bn the prior year.
The volume of battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales soared by 82.4%, compared like-for-like with last year.
Vertu said this was partly due to the cars becoming more affordable, with over 40 models now available under £30,000, and some options under £20,000.

UK's soaring wealth gap entrenched by property ownership and pensions
Moving from the middle to the top of the wealth distribution scale in Britain would take 52 years' worth of typical earnings, according to the Resolution Foundation.
That's equal to about £1.3m in total and is 12 years above the 40-year working lifespan of the average Briton.
A new report that delves into the distribution of household wealth in Britain shows how absolute wealth gaps between rich and poor families have grown sharply over the past five years. The analysis used the latest data from the ONS Wealth and Assets Survey.
“Wealth gaps in Britain are now so large that a typical full-time employee saving all their earnings across their entire working life would still not be able to reach the top of the wealth ladder,"" said Molly Broome, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. ""These gaps are doubly concerning as wealth mobility in Britain is low – people that start life wealthy tend to stay wealthy, and vice versa.""
The report found that it took 38 years’ worth of median full-time earnings to move from the fifth to the 10th decile in the wealth distribution in 2006-08. By 2020-22 it had grown to 52 years’ worth. A typical full-time employee, miraculously able to save all their earnings across their entire working life, would still not be able to reach the top of the wealth ladder.

Asia and US overnight
Stocks in Asia were lower overnight, with the Nikkei (^N225) slipping 0.5% on the day in Japan, after a run of 4 consecutive gains, after Sanae Takaichi’s election as LDP leader this week.
The 10-year Japanese government bond yield (+1.4bps) reached a post-2008 high of 1.69%, whilst the yen (-0.30%) weakened to 152.36 per dollar, its lowest level since February.
That came as data showed wage growth was softer than expected in August, with nominal wages up 1.5% year-on-year in August (compared to 2.7% expected). In real terms, wage growth remains negative as it has throughout 2025, at -1.4% (verses -0.5% expected).
The Hang Seng (^HSI) fell 0.6% in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) and Kospi (^KS11) were still closed for holidays.
Elsewhere, the main surprise has come from New Zealand overnight, where the Reserve Bank of New Zealand delivered a surprise 50bp cut, larger than the 25bp move expected, which takes their Official Cash rate down to 2.5%.
That has led to a depreciation in the New Zealand dollar, which has weakened 0.96% against the US greenback overnight, making it the worst-performing G10 currency.
The statement said that the committee “remains open to further reductions”, and New Zealand’s 10yr yield (-4.6bps) has fallen to a 12-month low in response.
Across the pond on Wall Street, US equities fell back after a run of seven consecutive gains. In part, that was driven by a decline for Oracle (ORCL) (-2.52%), after a report from The Information said that their profit margins for cloud computing were lower than analysts’ estimates. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 0.7% lower. The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.2%.
The outperformers were among the more defensive sectors, with consumer staples (+0.86%) and utilities (+0.42%) both advancing.

The report details technical advancements, market forecasts, regional analysis, and profiles of leading companies like Apple, Huawei, and Nokia.
Dublin, Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Global 6G Market 2026-2036"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The global 6G market represents the next transformational phase in wireless communications, projected to grow from nascent pre-commercial activity valued at $500M-1B in 2026 to a comprehensive ecosystem potentially worth $150B-300B annually by 2036. This explosive growth reflects 6G's evolution from laboratory research to commercial deployment, fundamentally reshaping telecommunications infrastructure, devices, applications, and business models across the decade.
The 6G market encompasses four primary segments with distinct growth trajectories and value propositions:
-
Infrastructure including base stations, core networks, and edge computing platforms represents the largest segment a
-
Devices and terminals spanning smartphones, IoT sensors, industrial equipment, and vehicles
-
Semiconductors and components enabling 6G - including GaN and InP power amplifiers, advanced transceivers, massive MIMO beamformers, and ultra-low-power processors
-
Services and applications leveraging 6G capabilities including holographic communications, digital twins, autonomous systems coordination, and immersive extended reality
Several converging technology trends enable 6G's commercial viability and differentiated value proposition.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) continues to hold its position as a leader in smartphone chip technology, staying ahead of the curve with new processors that now include built-in AI capabilities. Its supply deal with Apple runs through March 2027, which should help sustain sales in the near term. The company also maintains a strong foothold in premium smartphones powered by Alphabet’s Android software. With signs of another smartphone upgrade cycle emerging, investors who have waited patiently may finally see better returns.
So far in fiscal 2025, which ended on June 29, smartphone chips have accounted for about 63% of QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s total revenue. However, the company is working to lessen its dependence on this segment. It’s placing more focus on its IoT and automotive businesses, both of which are seen as promising growth engines that could help offset any decline in Apple-related revenue.
QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s dividend growth streak of 21 consecutive years also makes it a prominent investment in the eyes of income investors. With a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share, QCOM has a dividend yield of 2.11%.
While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Amkor Technology Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder in Amkor Technology, you need confidence in continued high demand for advanced semiconductor packaging, particularly as AI adoption accelerates and U.S. chip manufacturing reshoring initiatives expand. The recent US$7 billion Arizona campus announcement supports Amkor’s ambitions to capture growth in this market, but the scale and timing of this investment do not immediately offset the short-term risk of underutilized legacy capacity, which continues to pressure margins and profitability.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-08T00:00:00,Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be the Nvidia of Quantum Computing by 2035,"Nvidia currently dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but another big-tech peer could be better positioned for the rise of quantum applications.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=90faba3f5000f4b075f9f6ec9e8944335a3570cd6f0c66542059fc63fd451974,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,fool.com,200,,"Every major technology wave has produced its defining infrastructure giant. The internet had Cisco. The smartphone era was molded by Apple. And today's artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is dominated by Nvidia. But as AI begins shifting toward more advanced frontiers -- most notably quantum computing -- another contender may rise to the forefront: Alphabet (GOOG 1.38%) (GOOGL 1.52%).
Alphabet stands out with unmatched depth across research, hardware, and software. The company is deliberately weaving these assets together to build a powerful ecosystem designed not just for today's AI race, but for the quantum era that lies ahead.
DeepMind: Alphabet's research powerhouse
One of Alphabet's clearest strengths in the AI race is DeepMind. More than just a research and development (R&D) project, DeepMind has become Alphabet's intellectual engine. Its work has produced breakthroughs across reinforcement learning, computing simulations, and optimization -- advancements that flow directly into Google's products.
TPUs: Alphabet's hardware advantage
Nvidia cemented its dominance by making GPUs and its CUDA software indispensable for machine learning. Alphabet has followed a similar playbook with its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- custom-built accelerators designed specifically for deep learning and neural networks.
Integrated directly into Google Cloud, TPUs provide more than just raw processing power; they give Alphabet a structural edge over rivals like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
This hardware-software integration has attracted high-profile customers including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Safe Superintelligence, all of which rely on Google's TPU network. Alphabet isn't positioning itself as just another cloud provider -- it is strategically building an end-to-end tool chain designed for the future of more sophisticated AI workloads.
Cirq: Alphabet's quantum developer toolkit
The final piece of the puzzle is Cirq, Alphabet's open-source framework for quantum programming. Much like Nvidia's CUDA architecture, Cirq equips developers with the tools to experiment with quantum applications today while quietly binding them into Alphabet's broader ecosystem for tomorrow.
While quantum computing may still be in its infancy, Cirq ensures that researchers and enterprises can get ahead of the curve by starting to build algorithms now. As quantum AI matures, these early adopters will already be embedded within Alphabet's framework. In this way, the company is methodically transforming what was once a speculative pocket of the AI realm into the foundation for mainstream infrastructure.
Valuation implications: Alphabet's quantum AI future
For investors, the central question is whether Alphabet's vision will translate into measurable financial results. Over the next decade, the company's AI and quantum initiatives could reshape its revenue mix and profitability profile in some powerful ways:
- Cloud upside: Google Cloud is already operating at an annual revenue run rate of $54 billion -- but this runway is far from peaking. As more enterprises look to diversify beyond Nvidia's ecosystem, Alphabet's TPUs provide a scalable, enterprise-grade alternative. This dynamic could push Google Cloud's revenue well past $100 billion annually by next decade.
- Ecosystem lock-in: Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson recently valued the combined potential of DeepMind and TPUs at nearly $900 billion. When Cirq is layered on top of this stack, Alphabet gains a first-mover advantage in quantum AI applications -- similar to how CUDA secured Nvidia's leadership position. The result is higher switching costs for businesses and a formidable technological moat built to last for the long term.
If Alphabet executes on this vision, it will successfully reframe itself in the eyes of the market -- no longer seen primarily as an ad-tech company vulnerable to cyclical budgets. Instead, the company could be valued like an AI infrastructure leader. Against this backdrop, the company's valuation multiples could expand to reflect its role as a ubiquitous technology platform rather than just an advertising behemoth.
Over the next 10 years, Alphabet could emerge as the backbone of quantum-powered infrastructure -- a strategy with the potential to add trillions in market capitalization and redefine the company not just as a search powerhouse, but as the default platform on which the next era of AI is built."

Even though the “Oracle of Omaha” normally doesn’t touch tech stocks, his Berkshire Hathaway company made a notable exception for Apple — with a stake currently worth about $70 billion. While Apple remains Berkshire’s largest stock holding, its weighting in the portfolio has recently decreased.
Regardless, it begs the question: What key details did Buffett see in Apple that you could apply to your future investments? Here are four things to consider.
Consider Customer Loyalty
Apple is one of the best brands at maintaining customer loyalty. This advantage gives Apple more pricing power, as consumers will rush to upgrade their iPhones at high prices. Steve Jobs helped position the company as an innovator that thinks differently. This perception elevated Apple into a luxury products brand instead of just a company that sells phones and computers.
This customer loyalty helped Buffett view Apple as a consumer goods company instead of a tech company. This distinction, combined with Apple’s pricing power, convinced Buffett to load up on shares.

Consult With Other Investing Experts
Although Buffett quickly turned Apple into his largest holding after discovering the opportunity, he wasn’t the one who spotted it in the beginning. He only bought Apple with the help of Todd Combs, one of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio managers.
Buffett established criteria and wanted Combs to find a stock that checked all of his boxes. Combs came back to Buffett with Apple stock and the buying began.
Even the pros like Buffett consult other investors and experts to determine the best way to grow their money. It’s okay not to have all of the answers, and it’s natural not to have all of the answers. The people you surround yourself with will influence the quality of the answers and solutions you receive. Buffett did well in putting Combs on the team, and it resulted in one of his most lucrative investments.
Find a Cheap P/E Ratio
Buffett’s portfolio manager picked a stock that produced tremendous returns for Buffett, but he gave him three criteria to pinpoint a good investment opportunity. The first one was a cheap price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio."

Travis Hoium: Are smart glasses the future of technology hardware? Motley Fool Money starts down.
Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Travis Hoium joined by Lou Whiteman and Emily Flippen. We're going to jump right in today, and the big topic I thought for this week was Apple at least reportedly pulling back on their lighter Vision Pro headset. They're going to be moving in the same direction, it looks like as Meta has with their Ray Ban glasses, this AR technology. Emily, what are your thoughts on this whole space and where Meta and Apple fits into it?
Emily Flippen: I'm incredibly disappointed by Apple here. Look, Apple invested a lot of time and resources into convincing all of us that the future was in these lightweight, daily wearable glasses that were the visionary of spatial computing. Then a year later, just backtracks and it's not clear to me if this is, a desperate pull for them to say, no, me, too, when they see the innovation that Meta is doing and literally the metaverse, or if this is just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. But in my opinion, I just am so incredibly bearish. Pivoting toward heavy duty VR glasses when it seems like we have years and years of evidence coming out of Meta that consumers just do not want this.
Travis Hoium: It seems like a space where they're throwing stuff at the wall, and we don't know exactly what's going to stick. But at least we know these lightweight things are going to stick a little bit. That seems like a little bit of the move in the right direction, Lou, but it's still it seems like this is a money losing proposition for the foreseeable future.
Lou Whiteman: We should say that this is one report, and we don't know what's going on, really. Apple has $65 billion in cash. I feel like they can do both. But look, the cynical take here is, I can't figure out to spin is Meta was right or Apple is really that desperate. Because in a way, this seems like it's validation of everything Meta is doing. In a way, it's Apple are they really just they need something? I agree with Emily. I see more potential in the Vision Pro. There's also more of a chance an outright flop. I don't get the obsession with glasses right now, and I'm worried to see everyone pushing in that direction.
Travis Hoium: One of the things that was interesting when the Vision Pro came out is look, I've been in the VR space for almost a decade now, and what was unique about it is it was almost like an AR pair of glasses while actually being VR. The pass through was better than we've ever had in any other device. It seemed like they were, even at that time, moving toward this AI future but the technology wasn't quite there yet. They hadn't miniaturized things enough to get to even where Meta and Ray Ban are with their current glasses. Maybe we were headed this direction all along, and like Lou said, they're walking and chewing gum at the same time. They're probably doing both of these things, but they're maybe now saying, hey, look, the Vision Pro has been a flop, and people are at least a little excited about these sunglasses or these glasses from Meta. Emily, is that maybe the right way to think about it? They're seeing what's gonna work and what's not, and they're seeing Meta's success. They have always been a follower. They're never usually the first company to release a device, so maybe that's the right strategy.
Emily Flippen: Yes, that's a really generous interpretation, I think, Travis. I think this is an issue. Really, I think it's an issue of bloat. I say that as somebody who is a fan of Apple. Ultimately, Apple is still a hardware business when push comes to shove. They have to be on the bleeding edge of whatever the new exciting hardware accessory is, even if that ends up getting commoditized, because otherwise, they could lose their position as one of the largest companies in the world. I understand the desperate need to be there. If Meta is onto something, Apple needs to be right there too. But here's the problem when you have so many extra billions of dollars in cash flow, is that it really does allow you to lack discipline where you choose to invest your CAPEX. I wish there was more focus coming out of the Apple Management team. Again, to your point, we don't exactly know how many resources are being put behind this larger version of these AR VR glasses. But I really do think that it's disappointing to see them spread out their attention when the Vision Pro hasn't lived up to its potential yet, and there is potential there. They might be a little early, but they invested more time and resources into convincing consumers about why this would be an addition to their everyday life. That can actually be onto something great. My concern is that when you do two things poorly, you do nothing well. I wish they would just focus on doing one thing well.
Lou Whiteman: Here's a question, and I don't know if this will end up being bullish or bearish, but, the Apple value proposition from the start was always, it just works. In a way that was tech for the normies. I'm a normie, so I appreciate that. I am yet to be convinced that the normies want these glasses, that there really is the market that they think there is. To me, I don't see it doing anything right now that you can't do on your phone, so it's an accessory to the phone, not a replacement. The watch is, too. The watch has done pretty well, but the watch is half the price of these. Do we want.
Travis Hoium: The watch is also nowhere near the market share that the iPhone.
Lou Whiteman: It is a niche product. Do we want an accessory that costs as much as the phone? I doubt it. The Glass Half Full is, Apple really sees a chance to do what they did with the iPhone relative to the Palm Pre and all those. They really have come up with something that is that next step. Glass Half Empty is that this is going to just be like the watch and be just another product out there that can't move the needle. When in theory, if they get the Vision Pro right over time, that could be a whole new product category. This is, again, what are we swinging for hits or swinging for home runs? Because this feels like going for a base hit and giving up on the home run swing.
Travis Hoium: I'll start with you, Lou, do you think the combination of artificial intelligence and these different form factors. Usually the technology revolutions, the disruption that happens, it comes with a new form factor. The mainframe, the PC, the smartphone, brought about all new winners, new business models. We've been talking about new form factors in AI for quite a while. The pendant didn't seem to stick. It seems like glasses has a chance. But then you run into this strange, I don't know if it's an uncanny valley where I can see some real value in, look, I can see in our recording, I can see your names. Sometimes I look down there when I'm reading the outro. I don't know why. I just do it. I'm meeting new parents as my kids go to school. I know I've met you before. I know you said your name, but I can't remember. If it just popped up on my glasses, that'd be great. On the flip side of that, if we're constantly recording everything all the time, that seems like a pretty dystopian vision of the future. It seems like we do need that killer app and we're just not there yet, and nobody's quite figured that out. Is that a fair critique of this next gen issue? It's almost like we're in the Apple Newton phase of the industry. We're 10 years too early.
Lou Whiteman: Let me give you a more subtle critique. Because I'm not going to go dystopian, although I see that, I see the fear. But look, we talk about what a distraction the phone is when you're driving, when you're walking down the street, whatever. Maybe, yes. If it just popped up Emily's name, if I couldn't think of it, that would be a help. But 90% of the things, be it directions, watching Netflix for gosh sakes while you're driving or something. All of these things that seem to be obvious use cases, that just doesn't seem like a good idea for me. Again, it does feel like that, yes, it's a neat accessory onto the phone, but largely, the reason this is the next big thing is, I think, because no one has any better ideas, not because it is a great idea.
Emily Flippen: That's an interesting way to put it. I'll just quickly tap off by saying, I wish Apple was OK with being second, in some cases. I think when you look at the success of the smartphone, Apple wasn't the first company to come out with a smartphone, but they waited for the proof and the pudding there with Blackberry before they entered the market and destroyed it. The same is true for smart watches. They waited for Garmin and others to come out, fit bit to show the demand for watches, and then said, let's take this market that already exists, and let's crush it. The market doesn't exist right now for these glasses. I think that's part of the problem that Apple's running up against.
Travis Hoium: When we come back, we are going to get to Tesla's phenomenal delivery numbers for the third quarter of 2025 and see what the future looks like because this may be a peak for a while. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
One of the other big pieces of news for the week was Tesla had a phenomenal quarter. Deliveries were 497,099 vehicles. That was a 7.4% increase from a year ago. The problem is, the $7,500 tax credit ended at the end of the third quarter. Emily, is this going to be as good as it gets for Tesla, at least for the foreseeable future?
Emily Flippen: I think it's a fair statement. I do think two things can be true at once, which is, that this was a great delivery month they put up, but it was also this deadline sprint that you mentioned for people to place orders before the tax credit expired. If I had to estimate, I would imagine that we're probably looking at a softer fourth quarter here, despite how strong the third quarter was in terms of deliveries, but at the same time, I'm still really bullish on the entire EV sector, especially in the United States, but across the world. I think the rumors of its death, so to speak, have been greatly exaggerated. There's a lot of people out there, a lot of investors who think that without government incentives, demand for electric vehicles just won't be there. It's an interesting argument, and it's one that I think we're going to get some more evidence toward or against as we see these tax credits expire, but big picture, we've seen higher interest rates, and that softens demand for more expensive cars. EVs are still on average, more expensive than more traditional vehicles, and you still need to have the installation and charging options. A lot of people choose to finance those if they have them installed on their house. Of course, with higher interest rates, less people being willing to finance at higher rates. There's a lot of factors that are going against EV adoption right now that are unlikely to persist over the long term. That's the thing where I'm like, it's great to see a Sean Carter from Tesla. I'm not expecting that to persist for Tesla or any other EV maker. I think Ford's CEO, which is commenting earlier this week that he expects EV market share to drop by half for this foreseeable future. Crazy numbers. But when I zoom out 10 years, I'm very not worried about electric vehicles here.
Lou Whiteman: Here's the interesting thing to me. These are the times autos are very cyclical. These are the times when historically, the big giants of the industry, based at Detroit, through most of the industry, they've used their balance sheet to muscle out competitors. When pricing becomes a problem, when affordability becomes a problem, and Ford today still has that great captive Auto Finance unit. GM is rebuilding theirs, where they really can offer you a deal you can't refuse. Someone else who's smaller, in this case, a Rivian, back in the day with others just can't afford to. On paper, Tesla is better positioned to do that than even the Detroit companies. They have a great balance sheet. However, Tesla, unlike all of these companies, also has a huge long list of things other than consumer finance they want to put their money to. I feel like to some extent, Tesla's near term destiny is in their own hands. If they want to minimize the blow of the tax credit, I think they have the wherewithal to do that. I don't know if for long term investors, that would be the best use of their capital, though, but I mean, I do think it's an interesting moment. In terms of the big picture for EVs, for me, right now, it makes sense that hybrids are where it's at because I think hybrids offer you a better deal, and I'm biased because I have a hybrid. Maybe I'm saying that. To me, the future of EVs is not tied to tax credits. It's not tied to what Elon Musk thinks when he wakes up in the morning. You tell me how and when that Model 2 hits the streets. You tell me if that Model 2 really is a $25,000 car. I will tell you what I think the near term future for Tesla EVs are. Similarly, all of these companies, Ford has a pickup truck. That's a very similar value proposition. Tell me whether or not those actually can be made at profit anytime soon. That, I think, is going to be the answer to the question of how quickly and how strongly we see EVs take off from here, not a $7,000 tax credit.
Emily Flippen: Why are we so focused on Tesla and Ford when we actually already have evidence that is the case. BYD out of China has been making profitable, low cost electric vehicles that are getting worldwide adoption. We don't see them a lot here in the United States because of our own tariff regime and lack of importing there. But I do think that we have evidence that this battery company, originally a battery company now a big car company can do it. There's no reason to believe that others can't eventually get there, as well. But that evidence exists. It's just a matter of, to your point, Lou, how quickly?
Travis Hoium: Absolutely. Speaking of companies that are growing in EVs, I think this one's fascinating is General Motors, do you know how much their EV growth was year over year? Gulf the third quarter, 105% to 144,668 vehicles. The Equinox EV, which is their entry level, $35,100. I believe that's less than you can get a Tesla for today. It does seem the dynamics have shifted quite a bit. What will be fascinating, they're still focusing on big trucks and SUVs. That's where the money is made, even though Tesla used to be high margin. Their margins are now lower than the traditional automakers today. It's partly because they're not making these expensive trucks and SUVs, which are selling like crazy today. This is going to be fascinating because it does seem like one thing that's going to be consistent is the market will probably not be growing as much as it would have had that $7,500 tax credit remained, and therefore, it's going to be more competitive because there is more supply coming into the mat.
Lou Whiteman: The one caveat there, I would say on just looking at GM numbers is, I think the dealer model provides more incentive to try and get move metal before the tax credit disappears because as soon as it's on location, that's the dealers problem, not the automakers problem. The dealers don't have that balance sheet to put to work. They wanted to move that metal. But we'll see if it holds up, that's great for GM.
Travis Hoium: I want to get your thoughts on we have the end of the third quarter just happened this week on Tuesday. That means the earning season is going to be coming very soon. Emily, what are you looking at for this earning season as it starts next week and the week after?
Emily Flippen: I'm actually looking for companies that are very obviously sandbagging with guidance. I say that, I think we all expect for guidance this quarter to come in weaker. It was that case last quarter. We are living in a really uncertain environment now, so it makes sense that not only are companies expecting their profit margins to be squeezed, especially with weak consumer spending, they don't know what's going to happen with inflation or tariffs, whatever the overhang may be. I always love it when a company's management team is always a bit more pessimistic than I'm, and sometimes I can be a red flag, but sometimes I can also be a buying opportunity. For instance, I think about Dutch Bros, who when you look back at their business at this point last year, kept guiding for low to mid single digit same store sales growth, so much weaker than what they were putting up because management was just that uncertain about the cannibalization that'd be happening with their business or consumer spending. Quarter after quarter, they just kept hitting it out of the park they only recently raised guidance. But that mismatch, in my opinion, between a really conservative management team and a really strong business, where I can see their path to out performance, even more than maybe management can, can be appealing because if you see shares fall really dramatically based on weak guidance that you think is a hurdle that can be easily passed, it can be a buying opportunity.
Lou Whiteman: It's so funny you say that because I was thinking the other day. I was like, I'm more excited about the opportunity to go shopping this earning season than normal. I do think that that's yeah, we're ripe for it, I think. All the containers are there. As far as what I'm looking for, I'll go big picture. I'm focused on margins just across the board. I'm really curious how much the macro is eating into margins. We know there's tariffs out there. We know that the consumer is struggling to get a feel for how much that companies are eating it. I think I'm more interested in looking at margin change over time than I'm even, revenue growth or earnings growth. I want to know not what happened in the last three months. I want to know what to expect the next three, six months to come, and I think that is at least a little bit of a window into what's going on out there.
Travis Hoium: Lou, do you think tariffs is going to be a bigger topic of discussion or less than it was over the last two quarters? I'll say maybe the second quarter, first quarter was a lot of, we have no idea what's going on. Second quarter, companies have gotten their heads around it. Third quarter, now we're really in it. Are we going to hear a lot about it, or is it going to just be in the background?
Lou Whiteman: I think we're going to hear a ton about it, but I think it's going to be in the guidance side because we're in the holiday quarter now, and I think that that's going to be front of mind. Travis, I've used this with you before the boiling frog analogy that you, tariffs are not a light switch. It's just over time, suddenly what happened? The holiday season seems like if I was a CEO, that would be front of mind for me at the holiday season. I think you'll be hearing about it a lot in the guidance.
Travis Hoium: It is going to be fascinating to see what companies can who has pricing power. Who doesn't? Who has to, like you said, eat those tariffs and who's able to pass them on to customers and where they're impacting a lot to learn over the next few weeks. When we come back, I'm going to have Emily and Lou take an over or under position on a bunch of predictions for the rest of the year you're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Today, we're going to play a little game called over-under. I'm going to give a prediction about something that's going to happen in the economy or the market, and Emily and Lou are going to guess whether they think there's going to be an over or under. Let's start with the topic that we discussed earlier, Metas Glasses. They sold about 1 million pairs of these smart glasses in 2024. That's a pretty big number. My question is, are they going to sell over or under 5 million units in 2028? Emily, I'm going to have you go first over or under 5 million.
Emily Flippen: I feel this will come as no surprise for anybody who listen to the first half of the show, but I have to go under here. I just don't see the use cases for it on Meta side. When you look at Metas financials, this business spent more on CapEx in the last 12 months than the business generated in operating income or an operating cash flow in all of 2022. They are just throwing money at the wall, and it's amazing to me how much money they're investing into various things, but nothing is sticking with consumers. Ultimately, you can't force a consumer to come out and buy a new product if they don't see a use case for it. It's amazing to me that they even sold 1 million units in 2024. That is peak hype, in my opinion. Unless something really sticks here for Meta, I expect that number to actually fall over the course of the next.
Lou Whiteman: Wow. I'm going to use Emily's words and come to the conclusion that over. Because, yes, Zuck needs this, and Zuck is more than willing to spend money, and Zuck is still hurting about.
Travis Hoium: You may just give them away.
Lou Whiteman: I wasn't going to go quite that far, but since you got there, I don't think that profitability, I'm glad we're talking volume. We're talking units, not profitability or success here.
Travis Hoium: But, I don't think we're under the delusion that these are going to be profitable in the next three years.
Lou Whiteman: My guess is, he's going to move these darn things. Come high or high water.
Travis Hoium: This will be interesting because I do think the adoption of the VR space really hit a wall. But glasses are different. Glasses are a little bit more passive. They're not quite lower cost, which is, I think, interesting $800 for these new display glasses. But there's definitely a market for it. The other thing to think about, too, is if you bought one in 2024, when are you going to want to update that? If there's not a lot of new features, that could be a headwind, too. We'll be fascinated to see how successful or unsuccessful Meta is moving into more of the glasses space. Let's go to the overall economy, and I want to get your thoughts on mortgage rates. The reason that I think this is important is housing is a huge driver of the economy. It's huge portion of our money is spent on rents, on mortgages. It provides tons of jobs. Higher mortgage rates, at least than we've had over the past decade, has been a real headwind. Fed funds rate is coming down. The rate that the Fed controls is coming down. The problem is, the longer term rates that drive mortgage rates and the borrowing rates for companies is not coming down at the same rate. Right now, we have a mortgage rate average of about 6.3% a year from now, do you think those mortgage rates are going to be over or under 6%? Down just slightly from where we are today, Lou how you go?
Lou Whiteman: Getting a real time lesson in the limits to the Fed's power. Wait, there's just so much going on other than the Fed that's driving these long term rates. I'm going under, and I'm not sure it's a good thing. I'm all over the place. What's going to happen in the economy in the next year? But I'm increasingly worried, I think, and I think that there's going to need to be more and more aggressiveness. I think housing is a natural place for both politics and policy to get involved here. I don't want to go too much under there, but I have a feeling we'll be eventually pushed downward one way or the other.
Emily Flippen: Might be a hot take here, but we're sitting at about 6% right now, and I think the general expectation is that the market can handle the housing market can handle these high rates for very much longer, and that the Fed is going to continue to cut rates, which eventually, hopefully, even though there is obviously a disconnect here between the Fed is doing and what lenders are doing, that will eventually come down, but I have to say over. I think mortgage rates are going to be over 6% one year from now. The reason is is because I don't actually think we're going to get as many rate cuts as the market is expecting. I think that tepidness is going to pull over into the market for mortgages. The reason I say that is because a lot of the inflation data, despite the fact that it has cooled off, and it's down, although obviously not to Fed's target rates, I expect that we probably heat up as a lot more of these price increases from tariffs are passed along to consumers in the back half of this year, a lot of that evidence has shown that companies so far have eaten the price of these tariffs, and that is eventually that dam is eventually going to break. In my opinion, that's unfortunately going to impact interest rates.
Travis Hoium: I do think it is interesting that we have not really seen we've been talking about this on these shows for months. We have not really seen the impact of tariffs yet. The inventory cycle for a lot of these companies is not a month or two. If tariffs went in place, April 2, it's not like you're going to see that in stores, even in June. They were planning in April now for the holidays. This is when we're going to see those price increases. I have kids. We're buying stuff for them all the time, and you're seeing those prices go up. I'm interested to see if that impacts consumers. Emily, is your point just that the market is going to say, you know what? Sure, these rates are going to come down short term, but long term, they're going to have to go back up to fight inflation.
Emily Flippen: I think it's going to be a combination between a weaker labor market and inflation here that's going to put the Fed in a bit of an odd position. Ultimately, I think, whenever you see broader economic concerns in combination with the dynamics that we're seeing in terms of the housing market today, I would just be surprised if rates fall that dramatically within one year. I hope I am wrong. I do tend to be a pessimist, and I like to be pleasantly surprised. I hope a year from now we're sitting here in October 2026, talking about our nice four per to 5% mortgages. But that feels like a pipe dream to me these days.
Lou Whiteman: You know what's fascinating, Emily, I'm pessimistic, too, but I think in the near term, it's easier to play games with it, and in the long term, it eventually comes back to bite you. I'm focused on the one year, too, but who knows? That's what makes market.
Travis Hoium: Let's quickly do an over under on the number of fed rate cuts in the next 12 months. Emily, it sounds you're going under three. That's where I'm going to set the bar. But is that officially your call?
Emily Flippen: It is. In fact, I'll tell you what. In the next 12 months, I will even go further. I think we have maybe one rate cut.
Travis Hoium: The market is pricing into this year.
Emily Flippen: Yes.
Travis Hoium: You don't think that's going to happen in 12 months?
Emily Flippen: I don't talked about this on Motley Fool Money in the past, I believe. I think I expected one rate cut in September, which we got. Despite the fact that all of the blind polling here from the Federal Reserve does indicate that even the people on the panel themselves expect a number of rate cuts over the remainder of the year.
Emily Flippen: We don't have, obviously, with the government shutdown, our most recent jobs data, and inflation has not moderated. I can't emphasize this enough. It has not moderated to the extent that the Fed wants it to moderate. It's still well above their target rate. We've actually seen it accelerates on a month over month basis, and there's a fair bit of evidence that despite the fact that tariffs have not had the impact that I think a lot of economists and investors fear to this point, which is wonderful, that that shoe is, in my opinion, likely to drop toward the back half of the year. Again, I really hope I'm wrong here. I really hope mortgage rates come down. I really hope we have three rate cuts. But I'm betting on one rate cut in the next.
Lou Whiteman: I really hope I'm wrong, Ron Gur, because for the record, I agree. If you want me, I play pundit. I agree with everything Emily said. I was reluctant to even cut the first time. I was scared about that, and I don't want rate cuts. I'm worried about inflation. But again, I think politics plays into this, and especially as the year goes on with the Fed. I think market dynamics is providing pressure. Officially, I would push to three. I think we are at three. But, if anything, if you force me not to push, I'm going to take the over. That scares me a bit, but I do think that just the pressure on the Fed to cut rates is only going to accelerate as Pal steps away and as other changes, and as just assist the situation, I'm afraid we are going to deteriorate some from here.
Travis Hoium: Lou, I did allow you to push on that one, but this one, we're going to make things a little bit more difficult. NVIDIA is the most valuable company in the world, $4.6 trillion market cap; Microsoft, 3.9, Apple, 3.8 trillion. My question for you, is NVIDIA going to be over or under the 1.5? Basically, are they going to be first or are they going to be lower than first? Most valuable company on January 1st, 2030. You have a little over four years between now and then. Are they going to maintain this ranking?
Lou Whiteman: Any good gambler has to take the field on that. I'm going to take the field and say under. However, NVIDIA is a pretty good choice to be there. It's a great company. They have staying power. But no, if you're going to give me every company or NVIDIA and have it play out four years, I'll take everybody else.
Emily Flippen: Unfortunately, if you look historically speaking, companies that are the largest in the world when you zoom out in a 5-10 year period don't tend to maintain that positioning. I have to agree with Lou here, I to take the under. That being said, if anybody can do it, it's NVIDIA. This would be, and you hate as an investor to say this time is different, but this could be the exception to the rule.
Travis Hoium: We'll end on this one. I want to get your S&P 500 picks over the next 12 months. Over or under 7,000. As we're recording, we're at about 6,750. I'm giving a little bit of a gain, 5% gain or so. Do you think a year from now we are under 7,000 on the S&P 500, Emily?
Emily Flippen: This is an interesting question because I think everyone in their dough will tell you right now that the S&P 500 is overvalued. The market is overvalued. We have all of these headwinds, consumers are feeling hurt. The government, as we are talking, is literally shut down, and the stock market is up. Make that make sense, exactly. There is this real disconnect that's happening between the American consumer, the American economy, and, I guess, general vibes of the American people here versus what we're seeing in the market. I fear that the irrationality, to some extent, can maintain over the course of the next year because it hasn't made a lot of sense to this point. That being said, I can't get behind why that would be. I have to take the under. I think it's less than five. In fact, I think the stock markets probably down from where we are today a year from now. Again, I hope I'm wrong, and pessimists sound smart, optimists tend to make more money, so I'm staying fully invested, regardless of what my short-term prediction is for the markets. But it's hard for me to rationalize how the market could go up from here, given the factors and the headwinds that we're seeing in the broader economy.
Lou Whiteman: It's hard to disagree with that. I've been all doom and gloom when we were talking about the Fed and stuff, but here's the deal. I do think that it's ""priced in."" I think one of the weird things is Liberation Day was such a shock that we just normalized that or became immune to that real quick. I am more confident that we aren't going massively in one direction or the other. I think it's going to just be a grind, but I'm going to take the over. I think that we can just grind along almost regardless of what's going on on Main Street for a while.
Travis Hoium: When we come back, we will get to stocks on our radar. You are listening to Motley Fool Monday.

To see our full advertising disclosure, please check out our show notes. One of the interesting news items for the week is Spotify founder and CEO, Daniel Ek, is stepping down. He is going to be replaced by co-CEOs Gustav Soderstrom and Alex Norstrom. Emily, this has been a phenomenal run for Spotify and for Ek over the past three years. I think they've solidified their business model, but going with the co CEO strategy seems to be a trend, too. What did you take away from this announcement?
Emily Flippen: I was really disappointed by this announcement because, as you mentioned, Travis, wow, it looks good for Spotify over the last couple of years; it wasn't always the case. When Spotify first went public, part of my conviction behind the business was the way that Dan Ek talked about the company being very focused on the long term, and investors can forget that there is a period for Spotify there, a very long period where investors were very pessimistic, believing that Spotify would never be able to get its gross margin above 30% because of the limits and the caps on the way that the licensing agreements for music operated. Dan Ek had a really impressive long-term vision for what the Spotify platform could be, and he really did execute well on that, raised prices when it was appropriate, while expanding into things like audiobooks and podcasting, of which so many people, even internally in Spotify, were very skeptical about his investments there. Ek led that initiative. It's disappointing to see him leave, even though he will stay on his executive chair. I don't love co-CEOs in general, but I will say if anybody can pull it off, it's possibly this pair. Norstrom and Soderstrom have already acted together as co-presidents of Spotify. They seem to have different expertise, one more product, one more operational. Hopefully they'll find a way to marry in that sense, but the devil's always in the details, and it's scary when you have a founder, CEO leaving the helm of a great company.
Lou Whiteman: Everything in my gut makes me want to hate the co CEO structure. You need one person in charge. I think I need to get over that, though. We've seen it in a lot of companies. I do think, look, the CEO title has always been vague. It means different things in different companies. It's too much for one human being to do all the work of a big company. Average tenure of CEOs is falling, so you need to have a lot of talent there. I think if you look at this case, and I think there's a good chance it works. I think the idea of just we're almost just recategorizing what we call people. When inevitably, nobody was multitasking everything, and everybody had different roles, anyway. I think what's evolving more is just how we describe these things, not how companies work. You need the right people. You need well-defined roles. You need, maybe a founder as executive chairman to play referee if needed. I think it can work, and I need to be less scared of it. Hopefully for the best year.
Travis Hoium: It has been interesting to see Netflix has done a similar thing, where they have different expertise. It does seem like a two-headed dragon at the top, and these companies are so big now that maybe that makes sense because it's a huge job to fill. Let's get to the stocks that are on our radar. We're going to bring in Dan Boyd from behind the glass. Lou, I'm going to have you go first. What's on your radar this week?
Lou Whiteman: Dan, I'm looking at Delta Airlines, ticker DAL. They kick off transport earnings next week, Thursday, I think, should set the tone not just for airlines, but could provide insight into the consumer, into big macro, and all that. Baseline expectations is that corporate travel is holding up better than tourists. International is steady, and premium products are in demand. If that proves true, that is really good news for investors not just in Delta, but United too, which I think Delta and United, probably the best stocks in this sector. Very curious to hear what they have to say and what we can read into the entire sector from them.
Travis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about getting into airline stocks?
Dan Boyd: Now, Lou, you are a Georgia guy. How much of this is blind Homerism?
Lou Whiteman: I haven't lived in Georgia that long.
Dan Boyd: You're saying none?
Lou Whiteman: No.
Dan Boyd: I don't believe it. I don't believe that for a second.
Lou Whiteman: Dan, as someone who flies Delta regularly, I have all the reason in the world to hate them, trust me.
Dan Boyd: Fair enough.
Lou Whiteman: Emily, what's on your watch list?
Emily Flippen: Well, hopefully, a stock that generates a little less hate than Delta Airlines. I'm looking at Mercado Libre. The ticker is MELI. Mercado Libre shares are down about 15% this week because this e-commerce behemoth that operates in South America looks like it's getting a bit of renewed competition from Amazon. Amazon announcing that in their attempt to expand their presence in Brazil, they'd be waiving additional fees for sellers and fulfillment by Amazon throughout the country over the holiday season. In my opinion, this is a great buying opportunity, Dan. You have to listen to me here because Mercado Libre's been there, done that. Sea Limited, with the Shoppe app, tried to move into Brazil in Latin America, South America, a couple of years ago, and got absolutely trounced by Mercado Libre. Mercado Libre has by far the biggest lead in this space. I couldn't be less concerned for the lead they have here, and with shares off around 15%. What's a better time to be buying?
Travis Hoium: Dan, Emily's going with a long-term winner compared to the troubling industry in the airlines. What do you think about Mercado Libre?
Dan Boyd: She said, you have to listen to me. Travis, so I guess I have to listen to Emily now.
Emily Flippen: Let this be a lesson to ask for what you want in life.
Travis Hoium: What's going on your watch list? Is it officially Mercado Libre?
Dan Boyd: It's definitely going to be Mercado Libre. I think the price point might be a little too good to ignore these days.
Lou Whiteman: For Lou Whiteman, Emily Flippen, our production leader, Dan Boyd, and the entire Motley Fool team, I'm Travis Hoium. Thanks for listening to Motley Fool Money. We'll see you here tomorrow."

Tanzeel Akhtar is a seasoned journalist who has been reporting on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology since 2015. Her work has appeared in leading publications including The Wall Street Journal,...
Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) continues to cement its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, ranking fifth among U.S. corporate treasuries with approximately $80 billion in digital assets, according to company data and recent regulatory filings.
A chart published by the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla.
Bitcoin Holdings and Valuation
According to the company’s latest Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion.
The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC.
The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date.
The appreciation reflects Bitcoin’s sustained rally through Q3 2025. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense, noting the accounting implications of its Bitcoin-centric balance sheet.
ATM and Preferred Stock Programs
The filing further detailed updates to Strategy’s extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which collectively represent about $63.9 billion in potential capital issuance. These include:
• $2.1 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF)
• $4.2 billion in Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC)
• $21 billion in 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK)
• $4.2 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD)
• $21 billion in Class A common stock (MSTR)
The company reported no new share issuances during the period, noting that any proceeds from potential future sales would be presented net of commissions.
Financial Position and Oversight
As of the end of Q3 2025, Strategy’s digital-asset carrying value remained $73.21 billion, with a corresponding deferred-tax liability of $7.43 billion. The figures reaffirm Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as its core corporate reserve asset.
The financial disclosures were internally prepared and reviewed by KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. With Bitcoin’s market value continuing to climb, Strategy’s holdings now place it firmly among the top five U.S. corporations by total treasury size — a rare achievement for a firm whose reserves consist primarily of digital assets.

Candy Ventures Sarl (CVS), a portfolio of companies founded by Mr Candy, is taking legal action against Dutch businessman Robert Bonnier over allegations he “duped” it into investing about 7.5 million euros (£6.5 million) into his social media start-up, Aaqua BV.
A trial in London was told, earlier on Tuesday, that Mr Bonnier claimed Apple and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) were set to invest one billion US dollars (£740 million) in Aaqua.
This led to CVS swapping shares in podcasting firm Audioboom for “worthless” shares in Aaqua in 2021, with CVS now asking the court to rescind the investment or order Mr Bonnier and Aaqua to pay £5.7 million in damages.
Mr Bonnier is representing himself but has been blocked from defending the claim after breaching court orders, meaning he cannot cross-examine witnesses called by CVS.
Giving evidence on Tuesday, Mr Candy said that Mr Bonnier’s “blatant lies” about Apple and LVMH’s investment were “a very good story”, but stated: “It is disgraceful what has happened.”
He said: “I look stupid here now in court, but he was so believable and not just believable to investors, but believable to employees who left high-paid jobs.”
He continued: “We want justice for them.”
He added: “I am lucky enough, I can afford it, but whether I can get anything out of this, ever, who knows.”
He concluded: “It is not some conspiracy here.
“What has happened is we have all been defrauded by Mr Bonnier, and slowly we put the jigsaw pieces together.”
Mr Candy, who became Reform’s treasurer last December, owns 90% of CVS but is not a director, with the firm instead managed by his business partner, Steven Smith.
In a witness statement, Mr Candy said he first became aware of Aaqua in 2020 and met Mr Bonnier in Dubai in 2021, finding him to be an “extremely capable operator”.
He continued that Mr Bonnier “was apparently very well connected”, with the Dutchman claiming he personally knew Apple chief executive Tim Cook and LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault and was frequently meeting with their executives.
CVS agreed in February 2021 to transfer 1.5 million shares in podcasting firm Audioboom to Aaqua, worth about £6.5 million.
It also agreed to purchase 15,000 Aaqua shares, which were believed to be worth about 7.5 million euros (£6.5 million), a value which barristers for CVS told the court was “false and artificial”."

A class action against Qualcomm that, if successful, could result in payouts for UK smartphone users, entered its second day of an expected five-week duration at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London.
Consumer group Which? has brought the claim on behalf of around 29 million UK Apple and Samsung smartphone users.
It will focus on whether Qualcomm held market power and, if so, whether it abused its position as a dominant company.
Which? alleges Qualcomm breached UK competition law by taking advantage of its dominance in the patent-licencing and chipset markets.
It claims that this resulted in Qualcomm being able to charge manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung inflated fees for technology licences, which have then been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices or lower-quality smartphones.
Daniel Jowell KC, for Qualcomm, told the tribunal: “You’ll recall that in the run up to this trial, on multiple occasions we have sought to tease out of the claimant what actually is the precise conduct that is said to constitute the alleged abuse.
He added: “What turns this innocuous and lawful chipset supply policy into the abusive and unlawful NLNC (No Licence No Chips). We got to the stage where it became very puzzling because no one has ever contested that Qualcomm can’t maintain both a patent licencing business and a chipset supply business. Indeed any such suggestion would be rather absurd.
He went on: “That left it very unclear to us what alternative conduct or business model the CR (class representative) proposed that Qualcomm could and would have adopted instead of the CSP (Chipset Supply Practice) in order for Qualcomm to comply with competition law.”
And he told the tribunal: “If the essence, or if you like the hallmark, of the abusive conduct is the effective dictation of terms, you just don’t find it in the evidence.”
On Monday, Philip Moser KC, for Which?, told the hearing: “The nature of the abuse, where the abuse manifests itself, is in the area of negotiation of the royalty.
“And Qualcomm, instead of competitive negotiation, uses the inherent risk, or sometimes explicitly stated threat, of chipset supply disruption, software delay, to foreclose a normal discussion of royalties, and conditions for the licences.
“Instead, it’s ‘unless you take our package of licences at Qualcomm’s rate and on our terms, unless you do that there are no chips’.
“And Qualcomm’s terms include a royalty at a rate which we say is likely to be inflated. And that’s payable on every phone whether it uses Qualcomm’s chips or not.”"

DENVER, October 07, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Mac Admins Foundation (MAF), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to the global community of Apple administrators, and Fleet, a leading provider of Apple device management, today announced a deepened partnership, highlighted by the continuation of their ""Meetups for Mac Admins"" speaker series and Fleet becoming the foundation’s largest sponsor. This renewed collaboration comes as enterprises increasingly look toward open solutions for agility and control as the device management market experiences significant shifts.
Fleet Device Management is demonstrating its commitment to the global IT community with a significant financial contribution and investment in the next generation of Apple administrators. This record-setting sponsorship follows increased enterprise adoption of Fleet’s open device management platform for Macs, iPhones and iPads.
Companies across various sectors, including financial giants like Stripe, have migrated to Fleet for mobile device management (MDM - a part of the Fleet product that has rapidly matured in the last 2 years) for large deployments of computing devices. Wes Whetstone, Client Platform Engineer at Stripe, reported moving 10,000 Macs to Fleet for device management. There are currently over 2,000,000 devices enrolled in Fleet used by more than 1,300 companies across 90+ countries.
""We're thrilled to welcome Fleet as our newest and largest sponsor,"" said Erin Merchant, co-chair of the Mac Admins Foundation. ""Fleet has been an exceptional partner to the Mac Admins community—from fostering vibrant discussions in their Slack channel to organizing community meetups and supporting speakers. This sponsorship formalizes a relationship built on genuine engagement and shared values. We're grateful for Fleet's behind-the-scenes contributions and excited to expand our collaboration through new programs and initiatives.""
The Apple device management market could be in flux soon, as Jamf (JAMF) explores a potential sale, raising questions for IT departments about product roadmap continuity, customer data ownership, and long-term platform reliability under new ownership.
In this rapidly changing landscape, the Mac Admins Foundation remains essential as a centralized, non-profit organization supporting the global community of Apple administrators. It serves as a crucial source for management tools and best practices, shared solutions via open-source projects, and human connection through the Mac Admins Slack workspace as well as local meetups."

Those gains are significant, but are they enough that if you had bought Apple stock 10 years ago, you could retire today?
Learn More: I Asked ChatGPT What the Stock Market Will Look Like in 100 Days — Here’s What It Said
Read Next: 6 Big Shakeups Coming to Social Security in 2025
That depends on the numbers. We threw together a couple scenarios to see if you could be retiring comfortably on Apple stock if you were lucky enough to buy in a decade ago.
The Price of Apple Stock in 2015
A decade ago, Apple stock was trading between $24 and $25 per share (in split-adjusted terms). Since then, Apple has had several stock splits, which has greatly increased the size of returns for long-term shareholders. A stock split is when a company increases the number of its shares while lowering the price of each share proportionally, so the total value of your investment stays the same. This can be a psychological move as much as a financial one — removing barriers to trading high-priced stocks.
So, let’s assume you invested $10,000 in Apple stock a decade ago. The math works out to purchasing around 416 shares with your $10,000 (this doesn’t count transaction or broker fees). That $10,000 would today be worth around $100,000 if dividends were reinvested (we’re rounding up to make the math simple).
Find Out: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell
Could That Fund a Retirement?
While $100,000 would not fund a retirement alone, it certainly could give you a nice slush fund to draw upon, assuming you had other retirement funds.
For example, if you withdrew from your $100,000 by the common 4% withdrawal rule, you could take out $4,000 per year, which could pay for some expenses but it wouldn’t be enough to live on. Probably better to leave that money invested, to keep reaping the benefits of compound interest and further stock splits.
To generate something closer to a modest yearly income, say $40,000 per year, you’d need a portfolio of around $1 million. To have gotten to $1 million from Apple alone over 10 years, at $24/share, you’d have needed roughly 41,666 shares able to grow (with reinvested dividends and splits) to $1,000,000. So, if you’d invested around $100,000 in Apple a decade ago and held through splits and dividends, that might have put you at roughly a $1 million portfolio today, enough for a modest retirement income.
Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Stock
Reading these figures today could inspire someone to move a huge chunk of their investments into Apple today, but this could be a bad move, despite its performance, according to Chloe Elise, CEO and financial education expert at Deeper Than Money."

In just the past week alone, Broadcom climbed 2.3%, shrugging off minor volatility and reminding us it is still a force to be reckoned with in the tech sector.
But what’s really driving these moves? Some news has stoked excitement, such as OpenAI announcing a partnership to co-develop advanced AI chips with Broadcom. This partnership highlights Broadcom’s integral role in the AI supply chain. On the other hand, headlines that Apple is cutting back on Broadcom chips in favor of its in-house designs have added a little caution to the outlook, hinting at new risks to some parts of Broadcom’s business. It is a perfect snapshot of the push and pull shaping the stock’s story right now.
Now here is where things get interesting: despite all the drama and dizzying long-term growth, Broadcom’s valuation score is currently sitting at 0 out of 6, based on our checklist of undervaluation signals. So is the stock expensive, or is there something the score does not capture? That is where digging deeper into valuation methods matters. In the end, I’ll share a perspective on valuation that makes even the strictest scorecard look incomplete.
Broadcom scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: Broadcom Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to their present value. This approach provides a perspective on whether a stock’s current price reflects its true long-term earning potential.
For Broadcom, the latest trailing twelve months free cash flow (FCF) stands at approximately $24.8 billion. Analysts forecast robust growth, with FCF projected to climb significantly over the coming decade. While professional estimates extend to around five years, further projections from Simply Wall St suggest Broadcom could generate over $110 billion in free cash flow by 2035.
Based on this aggressive growth scenario, the resulting intrinsic value per share is calculated at $225.23. However, compared to Broadcom's current share price, this implies the stock is about 49.0% overvalued according to the DCF model. In other words, Broadcom’s current market price is well above what discounted cash flow projections would suggest is fair value."

The analysts identified 75 companies across tech, utilities and capital goods sectors that are closely tied to AI, including Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) Many of these firms are prolific debt issuers and in the case of tech, they are cash rich with very low net debt. The cohort trades at 74 basis points, 10 basis points tighter than the broader JULI index, they said.
Companies linked to AI have seen their equity valuations skyrocket since ChatGPT launched the modern AI era three years ago, as investors rush to get exposure to the technology that has the potential to shake-up the global economy. That’s sparked concerns that any setback in earnings from mega tech firms could trigger a broader selloff given their stretched valuations.
“Debt tied to AI companies is growing fast but it trades tight for good reasons,” wrote the analysts. They noted that most of these companies are high-quality issuers, either cash rich or not highly levered and are likely highly regulated, which justifies their outperfomance.
Debt investors are also scrambling to get a piece of the pie. Oracle’s (ORCL) $18 billion bond sale last month — the second-largest high-grade deal this year, garnered nearly $88 billion in investor demand. Banks and private credit firms have also been competing to underwrite debt deals supporting the development of large data centers.
“The torrid ascent of AI stocks has caused some angst for credit investors worried that any potential downside there could have credit implications,” wrote the analysts. “From a fundamental perspective, these fears are not justified.”
Still, an equity selloff in AI-related names would likely impact credit too, they added, given how tightly it’s trading. There is a risk if these companies use their pile of cash to fund capital expenditure or mergers and acquisitions ahead of debt redemption.
“We think select shorts in CDS can make sense as a cheaper tail hedge for a cross-asset portfolio,” they said."

While Apple’s share price has traded sideways lately, its 1-year total shareholder return of 16% hints that investors who took the long view have still been rewarded, even as near-term momentum cools and market nerves creep in about just how much future growth is already priced in.

The recent wave of downgrades raises a critical question for prospective investors: does Apple’s stock offer hidden value under the surface, or have markets already priced in all of the company’s future growth potential?
Most Popular Narrative: 44.7% Overvalued
With Apple’s last close at $256.69 but a narrative-implied fair value of just $177.34, the gap in expectations is striking. According to Investingwilly, the financial underpinnings do not justify current market enthusiasm, especially as Apple’s growth slows.
Apple’s P/E ratio currently exceeds 28x, far surpassing the broader market’s average of around 20x. For a company that is no longer experiencing explosive growth, such a high P/E ratio seems unsustainable. The market is pricing in continued rapid growth, but this assumption is increasingly unrealistic as Apple's product lines mature and market saturation sets in.
Do you want to uncover the driving assumption that makes this fair value so much lower than the market price? There is a sharp focus on slowing core business growth and the real sustainability of Apple’s profit margins, with one critical financial forecast changing the whole investment case.

Candy Ventures Sarl (CVS), a portfolio of companies founded by Mr Candy, is taking legal action against Dutch businessman Robert Bonnier over allegations he “lied” to “deceive” it into investing around 7.5 million euro (£6.5 million) in Aaqua BV, which he directs.
Mr Candy, who was announced as Reform’s treasurer in December last year, owns 90% of CVS.
Barristers for the company told a trial on Tuesday that Mr Bonnier claimed Apple and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) were set to invest one billion US dollars in Aaqua, and as a result, CVS swapped shares in podcasting firm Audioboom for “worthless” shares in Aaqua.
It is asking a court to rescind the investment or order Mr Bonnier and Aaqua to pay £5.7 million in damages.
Mr Bonnier is representing himself at trial and in August was blocked from defending the claim for breaching court orders, with barristers for CVS telling the court he was “restricted to attendance and making oral submissions” and was “not allowed to advance any factual case”.
He has told the court that while he “overstated the prospects of an investment” into Aaqua, he did not believe CVS would “rely” on it.
In written submissions for the trial in London, Jonathan Nash KC, for CVS, said: “In late 2020/early 2021, Mr Bonnier lied to CVS, time and again, both orally and in writing, to deceive it into investing in his company, Aaqua.
“He told CVS that he had discussed Aaqua with two of the world’s biggest names, Apple and LVMH, and believed that they would invest in the company.”
He continued: “In fact, and as Mr Bonnier well knew, none of that was true.”
He added: “As a result of his flagrant fraud, CVS, like other sophisticated investors, was duped into investing in Aaqua.”
Mr Nash told the court Aaqua, which is now insolvent, was established in the Netherlands in 2020 to develop a “new social media software application”.
Mr Bonnier is claimed to have told Mr Candy and Steven Smith, CVS’s executive director, that Apple and LVMH were set to invest in Aaqua, which Mr Smith told the court was “completely fundamental” to CVS’s decision to invest.
Mr Candy met Mr Bonnier in Dubai in January 2021.
Mr Nash claimed Mr Bonnier said he personally knew Apple chief executive Tim Cook and LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, and told Mr Smith that Aaqua would be the “next Facebook”.
CVS agreed in February 2021 to transfer 1.5 million shares in podcasting firm Audioboom to Aaqua, worth around £6.5 million."

With fintech names regularly in the spotlight and sector developments unfolding, Klarna’s moves have grabbed attention for good reason.
But before you decide your next move, let’s acknowledge the elephant in the room: Klarna’s valuation isn’t screaming “undervalued.” In fact, Klarna scores a 0 out of 6 on our value checklist, meaning it does not pass any of the standard undervaluation screens. Maybe that sounds blunt, but understanding why is crucial and could help you sidestep expensive mistakes, or spot some hidden upside others are overlooking.
So, how do we figure out if the stock is truly worth its price? That is where different valuation approaches come into play. In this next section, we will break down these methods and what they can reveal about Klarna’s true worth. And stick around, there is an even smarter way to make sense of the numbers that we will hit at the end of this article.
Klarna Group scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: Klarna Group Excess Returns Analysis
The Excess Returns model evaluates whether a company is generating returns above its cost of equity, focusing on how profitably Klarna Group invests shareholder capital. In this method, the return on equity and growth of book value take center stage, offering insight into whether ongoing investments are creating long-term value for shareholders.
For Klarna Group, the core numbers are:
-
Book Value: $6.32 per share
-
Stable EPS: $0.47 per share (Source: Weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 6 analysts.)
-
Cost of Equity: $0.49 per share
-
Excess Return: $-0.02 per share
-
Average Return on Equity: 7.60%
-
Stable Book Value: $6.15 per share (Source: Median Book Value from the past 5 years.)
Based on these inputs, the Excess Returns model indicates Klarna’s intrinsic value is far lower than its current share price. Specifically, the discount implied by this model is a staggering 640.3 percent, meaning Klarna stock appears dramatically overvalued by this standard. The absence of substantial excess returns suggests the company is not generating enough profit over its cost of capital to justify its present valuation."

The companies did not release pricing details of the acquisition.
Qualcomm previously acquired edge computing company Foundries.io in March 2024 and announced it was acquiring Edge Impulse in March 2025.
Edge computing includes computers that help power processing far away from data centers, ranging from point-of-sale systems in retail stores to small sensors that allow workers to remotely monitor offshore wind turbines to internet of things (IoT) devices such as smart TVs and cars. Applications generally require a balance between computing performance and power usage.
Italian company Arduino develops software and hardware that help power everything from hobbyist robots and rudimentary home automation projects to enterprise IoT platforms.
“Arduino has built a vibrant global community of developers and creators,” Nakul Duggal, Qualcomm’s group GM of automotive, industrial, and embedded IoT, said in a statement.
“By combining their open-source ethos with Qualcomm Technologies’ portfolio of leading-edge products and technologies, we’re helping enable millions of developers to create intelligent solutions faster and more efficiently — including a path towards global commercialization by leveraging the scale of our ecosystem,” he added.
Qualcomm has been working to diversify its offerings at a time when the smartphone market continues to stagnate.
Last month, the company debuted its second-generation Snapdragon X2 Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chips for Windows laptops and smaller desktop platforms. It’s also making a deeper push into the automotive space.
However, the company’s smartphone business still makes up an outsized portion of its overall revenue.
In 2024, Qualcomm reported total revenue of $33.2 billion. Of that, $24.9 billion came from handset sales. Its IoT business accounted for $5.4 billion, while its automotive segment brought in $2.9 billion.
Apple (AAPL), which uses Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone, is also increasingly moving away from the company, deploying its own custom modems in its iPhone Air and iPhone 16e.

Analyst Edison Lee stated that the stock’s current valuation prices in an “overly bullish iPhone outlook.”
“Better demand for iPhone 17, partly due to a price cut on the base model, is already in the price. That has led to excessive expectations on 18 Fold, and the replacement cycle.”
Lee further stated that he is unclear how big of a market there would be for a phone that costs around $2,000. A price-driven replacement cycle is unlikely to be sustainable, particularly one without new features. This could in turn result in margin pressure.

The firm noted how the new iPhone Air, the thinnest iPhone yet, isn’t resonating well with customers which makes “any bullish view on foldable risky.”

While Warren Buffett said, “our favorite holding period is forever,” occasional investor skittishness is nothing new. Yet has it gone to extremes?
Despite solid stock market performance this year, “I think that we’re in a period where people are not sure about capitalism,” ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi on a new episode of the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (see video above; listen below).
“I do believe we’re still stuck with what happened in 2000 and 2008, which were both horrendous,” he continued. “Although if you held on to the Mercks of the world, you ended up doing fine.”
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Cramer has sat in the host chair of ""Mad Money"" for nearly two decades and is the author of several books, including the recently published ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" He has studied markets and worked to demystify them for the average investor. He was one of the first to call out Nvidia (NVDA) — “my best pick” — when it was just a gaming company. He also had a hand in coining the acronym FAANG (Facebook, now Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG), now Alphabet (GOOGL).

“FAANG was the greatest creator of wealth in my life other than Nvidia, and I think my job was to find great stocks,” Cramer said. “But I wanted people to understand why I thought they were great.”
For many young investors, crypto and the hot stocks of the moment often crowd out the more traditional names and advice, leaving them susceptible to more volatile investments. “Compounding is so boring,” Cramer said. “People think it’s too hard. They don’t understand what the P/E means. They don’t understand what it means to buy and hold a great stock.”
This shorter-term thinking contrasts with Buffett’s sentiment on the stock market. He once said, “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”

Year to date, markets remain stable. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up nearly 15% while the Russell 2000 (^RUT) is up 11.61%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up 9.76%. Top S&P 500 performers during this same time period include Robinhood (HOOD), Seagate Technology (STX), Western Digital (WDC), Newmont (NEM), and Palantir (PLTR).
Impatience and skittishness are only two obstacles, according to Cramer. “The market got a bad rap because it seemed to be the playground of billionaires,” he said. “It got to be the image of the filthy rich, and the billionaires don’t help.”"

Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, one of a dying breed of red-state Democrats, is in his second-term running a manufacturing powerhouse in the US heartland — which now finds itself at the center of Trump’s policy shifts.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Kentucky bet big on electric cars, only to see the administration kill a key incentive. It’s welcomed major manufacturing investments, only for companies to face tariffs and the threat of immigration raids. And Beshear argues there’s more pain to come from Trump’s trade war.
“The impacts are hitting the economy in Kentucky and across the country. They haven’t been fully felt yet,” he says in an interview in the state capital of Frankfort. “While Donald Trump says he wants to reshore American manufacturing, his tariffs are actually preventing it from occurring.”
All that might explain why the Bluegrass State is home to three of the last prominent Republicans willing to buck Trump on tariffs and other issues — and to Beshear, who’s also grappling with his own party’s branding and how it can win back the White House. The 47-year-old, sometimes mentioned as a potential candidate in 2028, says any decision on whether to run is a long way off — while the threat from Trump’s tariffs is immediate and escalating.
‘Wait a Minute’
Kentucky ranked first in the nation last year for imports relative to its economy, and is among the top trading states overall. It’s a one-time coal giant turned manufacturing hub, with major auto and aerospace plants and, of course, its iconic bourbon. A bottle emblazoned with Beshear’s dog’s likeness sits on a shelf in his office at the Old Governor’s Mansion. Just above it sits Beshear’s own portrait, on a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket.
KFC might not be on the trade war’s front lines, but many of the state’s key industries are. Bourbon makers are facing boycotts — including in Canada, Kentucky’s top export market and a country in Trump’s crosshairs. Manufacturers like Ford Motor Co., which has a plant near Louisville, now face tariffs for inputs like steel and aluminum.
Beshear says it’s the unpredictability of Trump’s tariff rollout that’s causing much of the trouble. “The only thing that doesn’t change is that it’s going to change every day,” he says. Industry experts aren’t being consulted, and “the president might think he’s helping domestic manufacturers, but in fact he’s hurting them.”"

Gold soars above $4,000 as ETFs see strongest quarter on record
Gold futures (GC=F) soared to new all-time highs above $4,000 on Tuesday as investors piled into the precious metal amid a weakening dollar and growing expectations for more Federal Reserve rate cuts.
Futures for the yellow metal are up more than 50% year-to-date, marking their highest return in a calendar year since 1979.
Meanwhile, a new report from the World Gold Council released Tuesday showed that global gold-backed exchange-traded funds recorded their largest quarterly inflows on record during the three month period ending in September.
Inflows into gold ETFs jumped 23% to $26 billion quarter-over-quarter, led by North American funds and followed by European and Asian investors.
“Ongoing trade, policy, and geopolitical risks continue to persist with no clear signs of abatement,” the report said.
Trading activity in gold also exploded during the period, according to the report.
Average daily volumes surged 34% month-over-month, driven by record-setting prices that hit 13 new all-time highs in September.
Wall Street has remained bullish on the precious metal, with Goldman Sachs analysts recently reiterating that gold is their ""highest-conviction long recommendation.""
On Monday, JPMorgan analysts noted pullbacks, ""which typically come 2-3 months after the initial Fed cut, have been dips to buy into gold.""

What you need to think about before taking a tax-free pension lump sum
We are still several weeks away from the autumn budget, but speculation is swirling that tax-free pension cash could be cut. This is a rumour that risks people making decisions they later come to regret.
While the main purpose of a pension is to give you an income throughout your retirement, you can take out lump sums whenever you want from the age of 55. Up to 25% of the total value of your pension can be withdrawn tax-free.
Rumours that this allowance could be cut has already had an impact – in the most recent FCA Retirement Income Market stats, the number of plans entering drawdown where only tax-free cash was taken surged by 29% between 2023-24 and 2024-25. The amount of tax-free cash taken overall ballooned by 63%. It suggests that people could be making big decisions in haste that they could repent at leisure.
The decision to take tax-free cash should be part of a long-term plan made after assessing all the pros and cons rather than a knee-jerk reaction in response to a rumour that could have a whole host of unintended consequences.

E-bike operator Lime boosts turnover
The electric bike sharing start-up Lime has reported a 75% rise in turnover to £111.3m in the UK, as the popularity of its green bikes and scooters continues to grow.
The Guardian has the details...
While more people are hopping on Lime bikes, the UK arm of the company reported a 40% drop in pre-tax profit to £1.7m in its 2024 financial year, which was largely driven by a 79% rise in its administrative expenses.
Lime bikes have become an increasingly popular mode of transport in London, although the company has come under fire from local authorities over bikes being discarded on the street. In some areas, there are geofences that stop bikes from being parked and freeze their electrical functions to discourage people from cycling through.
Lime, which is based in San Francisco, operates fleets of e-bikes and scooters in 280 cities around the world. Over the summer there were reports that it was considering a stock market floatation, with estimates suggesting that it could be valued at about $500m.
Last year, chief executive Wayne Ting told the Sunday Times that Lime was “ready” for a float in New York, but that the IPO market at the time was “largely shut”.

Pound weakens as dollar strengthens amid political uncertainty
The pound dipped 0.3% against the dollar (GBPUSD=X) on Tuesday morning, to trade at $1.344 at the time of writing, with sterling continuing to face pressure from a stronger greenback.
The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was up 0.3% at 98.37 at the time of writing.
Chris Turner, global head of markets and regional head of research for UK & CEE at ING (ING), said that the dollar index ""should remain range-bound, but with a slight upside bias given developments in Japan and France"". Both the Japanese yen and the euro are included in the US dollar index basket of currencies.
Meanwhile, the euro also weakened against the dollar (EURUSD=X), amid political turmoil in France, following prime minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned after less than a month in the job.
Jim Reid, head of macro and thematic research at Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE), said: ""[President Emmanuel] Macron has asked Lecornu to continue consultations with party leaders to 'define a platform for stability' and report back by tomorrow evening, but the political arithmetic remains unforgiving even if there's an outside chance he salvages something.""
The pound was steady against the euro (GBPEUR=X) on Tuesday, trading around €1.1503 at the time of writing.

The company adds that staff will begin to return on Wednesday to the company’s stamping operations in Castle Bromwich, Halewood and Solihull, UK, and other key areas of its Solihull vehicle production plant, such as its body shop, paint shop and its Logistics Operations Centre (LOC).
JLR says this move will be ""closely followed"" by the resumption of vehicle manufacturing in Nitra, Slovakia. The Range Rover and Range Rover Sport production lines in Solihull are expected to restart later in the week.
It is not yet clear when output will resume at JLR's Halewood plant on Merseyside.
Experts have warned that it is still likely to be several weeks before the production lines are running as normal.

Tenant demand continues to climb in Q3
The latest market analysis by Dwelly, one of the UK’s leading lettings acquisition and success planning experts, has revealed that tenant demand continued to climb across the rental sector during the third quarter of this year, with West Sussex home to the highest demand, whilst Rutland saw the largest quarterly increase.
Dwelly’s Rental Demand Index analyses tenant demand across each county in England, looking at what proportion of total rental market listings have already been marked as ‘let agreed’.
The latest index shows that, across England as a whole, just under a third (31%) of all rental properties had been snapped up by tenants in Q3, a 1.7% increase on the previous quarter.
-
The hottest spot for tenant demand was West Sussex, where 47.2% of all rental listings were already let.
-
Cumbria follows closely at 41.3%, while Somerset (41.8%), Suffolk (41.4%), Wiltshire (43.0%) and Hampshire (40.5%) also rank among the areas with the highest demand for rental homes.
-
In contrast, Nottinghamshire was the coldest spot of the rental market in Q3, where fewer than one in five (18.4%) of rental properties had found a tenant.
-
When it comes to the sharpest quarterly increases, Rutland has seen demand climb by 9.2% in the last quarter, with the City of London up 8.6% and Northumberland up 6.5%.
-
Norfolk has also enjoyed a 4.5% uplift, with Greater London not far behind at 4.4%.
-
At the other end of the spectrum, Herefordshire has recorded the largest quarterly decline, with demand falling by 12%.
-
The Isle of Wight has dropped by 9.8%, Cornwall is down 7.5%, Gloucestershire has fallen 5.6%, and North Yorkshire is down 5.3%.

B&M warns over profits after sliding UK sales
Budget retailer B&M has warned over annual profits after seeing sliding sales in the UK and soaring costs.
The group said UK like-for-like sales dropped by a worse-than-expected 1.1% in its second quarter, with the group now forecasting half-year underlying earnings will tumble by 28% to around £198 million.
This comes after it saw wage costs surge by about £30 million in its first half to September 27, on top of a £14 million packaging tax hit under the new Extended Producer Responsibility rules.
It said it now expects full-year underlying earnings in the range of £510 million to £560 million – a fall of up to 18% on the previous year.
The group said it was taking “decisive actions” to boost its flagging performance but cautioned these will take up to 18 months to bear fruit.
“We are confident they will restore B&M’s value proposition and support a return to sustainable like-for-like sales growth for B&M UK,” it said.
Turnaround measures include cutting prices of some of its key value items, bringing in more flexible “managers specials” promotions, refocusing and cutting the number of ranges it has and improving availability of its most popular products on shelves.
While the group said it had seen an improvement in UK like-for-like sales since the second quarter, it still expects trading to be impacted over the final six months, with a range of between a low single-digit drop up to a low single-digit sales increase.
B&M has 786 stores in the UK operating under the B&M brand, plus 344 stores under the Heron Foods and B&M Express brands, while it also has 140 stores in France.

Goldman Sachs raises gold price forecast
Goldman Sachs(GS) has raised its forecast for the gold price at the end of next year, following the recent surge in bullion prices.
It now expects the precious metal to hit $4,900 per ounce in December 2026, up from a previous forecast of $4,300 per ounce, as the flows of money into gold from central banks, and investors buying gold-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are “sticky”, meaning prices will rise higher than expected.
Gold is currently trading at $3,947 per ounce, having hit a record high of $3,977 per ounce overnight.
In a new analyst note, Goldman analysts said:
-
Central bank buying to average 80/70 tonnes in 2025/2026 as EM central banks are likely to continue the structural diversification of their reserves into gold (contributing 19pp to the 23% price increase we expect by Dec26)
-
Western ETF holdings to rise as the Fed cuts the funds rate by 100bp mid-2026 (contributing 5pp by Dec26)

German industrial orders fall
German factories suffered a decline in orders in August, down 0.8%, according to statistics office Destatis. This was largely due to a sharp drop in orders in the automotive industry, for data processing equipment, electronic and optical products, and for pharmaceuticals.
It followed a 2.7% month-on-month drop in July.
Carsten Brzeski, ING’s global head of macro, warns that the industrial slump in Europe's largest economy is set about to end any time soon.

Novo Nordisk cuts production line jobs at key plant in US
Wegovy-maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) has laid off dozens of employees at the largest U.S. manufacturing site for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs, a Reuters review of LinkedIn posts showed, a signal of where it is making cuts in a major restructuring under new CEO Mike Doustdar.
The previously unreported cuts included staff in manufacturing roles, from quality control to production line technicians, at Novo's major Clayton, North Carolina, plant and other facilities in the state, an analysis of 73 posts and profiles show.
The layoffs, while only a small part of a planned 9,000 job cuts globally, underscore how Novo is cutting back even on frontline production in the top market for Wegovy as it looks to sharpen its focus, trim costs, and claw back lost ground in fierce competition with rival Eli Lilly (LLY).
The cuts, which follow earlier ones focused on the obesity education team in the U.S., come as the administration of President Donald Trump pressures pharmaceutical companies to expand U.S. drug production and create more domestic jobs.
The Danish drugmaker last year became Europe's most valuable listed company on unprecedented demand for weight-loss drugs before a sharp share price slide as sales growth slowed. It is now trying to turn around its fortunes and reduce costs and staff that bloated as it rode the Wegovy boom.
A Novo spokesperson declined a Reuters request for further details beyond last month's global layoffs announcement. ""This process takes time and our highest priority is to support our employees,"" the spokesperson said.

BYD UK sales soar by 880%
BYD has revealed that the UK has become its biggest market outside of China, after sales there surged by 880% in September compared to a year earlier.
The company sold 11,271 cars in the UK last month, with the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV) accounting for the majority of those sales.
It comes as figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed that sales of electric vehicles (EVs) jumped to a record high last month.
BYD, which offers cheaper models than many of its Western rivals, said its share of the UK market jumped to 3.6% in September.
The company will launch more new hybrid and electric cars in the months ahead, said the BYD's UK manager Bono Ge. He added that the brand's future in Britain looks ""hugely exciting"", having just opened its 100th retail outlet.

Ineos announces 60 job cuts
Ineos is set to cut a fifth of jobs at its Hull chemical plant, blaming net zero rules, high energy costs and competition from overseas.
It warned that the decision is part of a structural crisis in the industry, and that the UK and Europe are “sleepwalking into deindustrialisation”.
Sir Jim Ratcliffe's chemical company added that the job losses are “a direct result of sky-high energy costs and anti-competitive trade practices”, claiming that importers are dumping their product into the UK and European markets.

Shell expects 'significantly higher' gas trading in the third quarter
Shell (SHEL.L) has said it expects trading in its gas division to be ""significantly higher"" in the third quarter than in the previous three months.
In a trading update on Tuesday, Shell offered production guidance for its integrated natural gas division of 910,000 to 950,000 barrels of equivalent per day (boe/d) for the third quarter. That compared to a previously guided range of 910,000 to 970,000.
However, the Anglo-Dutch oil major said it expected trading and optimisation for this division to be ""significantly higher"" than in the second quarter.
Shell raised the production outlook for liquified natural gas (LNG) to a range of 7 million to 7.4 million metric tonnes, compared to previous guidance of 6.7 to 7.3 million metric tonnes.
The company forecasted production for upstream oil production in the third quarter to be between 1.79 million to 1.89 million boed.
Shell also said it expected to report a refining margin of $11.60 per barrel in the third quarter, which would be higher than the $8.90 recorded for the previous three months.
Tuesday's trading update gives investors an idea of what to expect when Shell releases its full third quarter results on 30 October.
Shares in Shell rose 2% shortly after the market open on Tuesday morning, the second biggest gainer on the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) at the time of writing.

Where did house prices rise and fall?
Northern Ireland once again lead the fastest annual property price inflation, with average property values up 6.5% over the past year (down from 7.9% last month), the data showed. The typical home now costs £216,496, though prices remain well below the UK average.
Meanwhile, Scotland recorded annual price growth of 4.5% in September to an average of £215,588. In Wales, property values rose 1.9% year-on-year to £227,845.
In England, the North East, recorded the strongest annual growth with prices up 4.8% to £180,443, followed by the North West (3.9%).
The South West saw a second consecutive price fall by 0.2% over the past year (previously 0.7%) with prices now £303,067.
Prices are up only very slightly on the year in London (0.6%) and the South East (0.2%), with the capital remaining the most expensive part of the UK, with an average property value of £543,497.

US government shutdown continues
In terms of the US government shutdown, last night saw a fresh vote on a stopgap bill to reopen the government. The vote failed as expected, with a margin of 52-42 as Republican leadership needed 60 votes to advance the bill.
Late on Monday, US president Donald Trump told reporters that he was open to negotiating with Democrats over the healthcare subsidies, saying: “We are speaking with the Democrats, and some very good things could happen with respect to health care.”
While Senate minority leader Schumer denied that claim, he remained open to discussing the subsidies.
The comments indicated there was a potential path to a deal, but betting markets continue to see a large divide. Polymarket now suggests an 68% chance of the shutdown not ending until at least 15 October, down from 74% before President Trump’s comments.
Polymarket has also priced in a 22% chance that this shutdown breaks the 35-day record.

Asia and US overnight
Stocks in Asia were mixed overnight, as trading volumes remain subdued due to market holidays in China, Hong Kong and South Korea.
The Nikkei (^N225) ended flat on the day in Japan, following a 4.75% surge on Monday, which marked its best performance since April, when it responded to the 90-day reciprocal tariff extension.
Early morning data revealed that Japanese household spending increased at a faster rate than anticipated in August, suggesting that consumers are feeling relatively optimistic, which is a positive indicator for the recovery of private consumption.
Consumer spending rose 2.3% year-on-year in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of growth and significantly surpassing the median market forecast of a 1.2% increase.
Meanwhile, the Japan 30-year auction saw stronger demand than its 12-month average, alleviating investor concerns following Sanae Takaichi’s election victory over the weekend. Yields on the 30-year JGBs have decreased 2.6bps, trading at 3.28%, while the 10-year JGBs are down by -0.5bps, currently standing at 1.68% as we go to press.
Across the pond on Wall Street, US markets were unfazed by matters in Europe or the ongoing shutdown. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.4%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 0.7% higher — both moving to new record highs. The Dow Jones (^DJI) lost 0.1%.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-07T07:40:00,"Up 350% Year to Date, is the Party Over for MP Materials Corp Investors?","MP Materials has seen a huge increase in interest in its business, but the big story is that the interest is from more than just investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e8ed1f21c9095c387c5ada9b3101974b8f1d890356f0073054c3f1123ab8e4e2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/up-350-year-to-date-is-the-party-over-for-mp-mater/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/up-350-year-to-date-is-the-party-over-for-mp-mater/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/up-350-year-to-date-is-the-party-over-for-mp-mater/,fool.com,200,,"MP Materials (MP -9.95%) went public a few years back via a merger with a special purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC). Like many SPAC deals, there was initial excitement that eventually cooled off. At least until 2025, when MP Materials' unique focus led to a big investment from the U.S. government.
The business appears to have a huge growth opportunity ahead of it.
What does MP Materials do?
MP Materials mines for and processes what are known as rare-earth metals. These metals are integral to today's advanced technology, used by tech companies to make the cellphone in your pocket and defense contractors to make the missiles used to protect entire nations. Modern technology wouldn't be possible without the products MP Materials produces.
There's one important missing piece to that story. China is the world's largest producer of rare earth metals. And it has shown no hesitance in using that fact to its advantage when dealing with other countries. The most recent example has come as the United States attempts to change the tariff regime as it currently exists. China limiting access to rare-earth metals is a massive risk for not just companies, but also entire countries.
In fact, the whole purpose of MP Materials' business is to be a rare-earth metals provider that operates in an economically and politically stable region. It wants to parlay that fact into relationships with customers needing a reliable supply of these materials. It was the story used to support the SPAC deal and it remains the story as the company starts to ramp up its business.
MP Materials just got a huge vote of support, and a lot of cash
MP Materials' basic business model has not changed since it went public. And it hasn't changed in 2025 even as the stock price has rocketed higher. But there has been a big shift in the outlook for the business just the same.
Essentially, MP Materials is a mining and materials company. It costs a lot of money to operate a this type of business and it takes a lot of time for the capital investments that are made to finally pay off. In other words, a key factor to look at with an upstart like MP materials is its balance sheet. Simply put, is there enough cash for the company to actually get where it wants to go?
That's not a big problem for MP Materials anymore. That's because it inked a large investment deal with the U.S. government. That deal was followed by a large partnership with Apple (AAPL 0.41%). And then that was followed up by a public stock sale that saw so much demand it was upsized.
MP Materials went from a good idea that might work out to one that seems almost certain to work out thanks to a huge influx of cash. Adding up the money from the three events noted above suggests that the company will see its cash balance cushioned by around $1.5 billion. That's going to help get the business up and running, which is only the start of the opportunity for the business and investors. Since rare-earth metals are largely coming from just one supplier today, MP Materials has a huge potential market for its products. And that could lead to huge long-term growth for the company.
Wall Street has reacted as you would expect
The problem with MP Materials as an investment is that Wall Street has clearly priced in a lot of good news. That's not unreasonable given the backstory, but it does increase investment risk. Has the stock's growth hit an emotionally driven peak, suggesting that the party could soon be over for investors? If you think in days and not decades, the answer could easily be yes given the idiosyncratic risk of the story here.
But if you think in decades, there is a very long-term opportunity for MP Materials as a business. And its growth as a business is only just getting underway. It isn't a ""bet-the-house"" type of investment, but the story is still very interesting. All in, more aggressive investors willing to accept some near-term turbulence might still find this stock alluring even after the big price run. Just go in knowing that this is a company that you may need to own for a long time to benefit from its business growth."

The company also launched another $3.5bn of share buybacks, representing its fifteenth consecutive quarter of at least $3bn in repurchases.

""In addition, its diversity of operations across oil, gas, chemicals, and retailing regularly allows one area of strength to counter another of weakness."""
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-07T05:00:34,What you need to think about before taking a tax-free pension lump sum,Tax-free pension cash could be cut in the autumn budget — here are three factors to consider before taking cash out of your pension,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d504f9f851d378b17e3e5fec39f3f3c198c617f92d5e0f5bbc9882ecfc57edb2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/pension-advice-tax-free-lump-sum-warning-050034410.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/pension-advice-tax-free-lump-sum-warning-050034410.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/pension-advice-tax-free-lump-sum-warning-050034410.html,yahoo.com,200,,"We are still several weeks away from the autumn budget, but speculation is swirling that tax-free pension cash could be cut. This is a rumour that risks people making decisions they later come to regret.
While the main purpose of a pension is to give you an income throughout your retirement, you can take out lump sums whenever you want from the age of 55. Up to 25% of the total value of your pension can be withdrawn tax-free.
Rumours that this allowance could be cut has already had an impact – in the most recent FCA Retirement Income Market stats, the number of plans entering drawdown where only tax-free cash was taken surged by 29% between 2023-24 and 2024-25. The amount of tax-free cash taken overall ballooned by 63%. It suggests that people could be making big decisions in haste that they could repent at leisure.
Read more: Why relying on inheritance for retirement is a bad idea and what you could do instead
The decision to take tax-free cash should be part of a long-term plan made after assessing all the pros and cons rather than a knee-jerk reaction in response to a rumour that could have a whole host of unintended consequences.
Three things to think about
1. Don’t take it because you can – have a plan
Many people take their tax-free cash as part of a long-term plan to pay off their mortgage, travel or make home renovations.
If you take it without knowing what you want to do with it, then you risk some poor outcomes. One example would be taking the money from a really tax efficient environment within a self-invested personal pension (SIPP) and keeping it in an account paying poor rates of interest while you decide what to do with it. There’s also the potential to fritter it away over time.
2. What are the tax consequences?
You need to consider the tax consequences of where you plan to put this tax-free cash. You could reinvest some in a stocks and shares ISA but if you’ve got a significant amount, you may still have money left over. Depending on what you want to do with it you need to consider the potential impact of taxes such as capital gains tax or dividend tax.
3. Are you planning to reinvest it back into your SIPP if the decision doesn’t happen?
You may decide to take the money now and if the decision doesn’t happen simply reinvest it back into your SIPP. This may seem straightforward, but you need to beware that you don’t fall foul of pension recycling rules.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) top iPhone assembler, reported record September and third-quarter revenue on Sunday but still fell just shy of market expectations.
The Taiwan-based giant said September revenue rose 38% month-over-month and 14.2% year-over-year to NT$837.07 billion ($27.54 billion). For the third quarter, revenue increased 14.5% sequentially and 11% from a year ago to NT$2.06 trillion ($67.78 billion), slightly below the NT$2.09 trillion analysts had expected, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Foxconn's key businesses continue to move in different directions. Its smart consumer electronics division which includes iPhones slipped slightly year-over-year, with the company citing exchange-rate effects. Meanwhile, its cloud and networking products segment, which makes artificial intelligence servers for clients such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), delivered strong growth as demand for AI infrastructure continues to accelerate.
Looking ahead, Foxconn said it expects continued sequential growth in Q4, helped by rising AI server shipments and the seasonal uptick in information and communications technology products. The company also warned, however, that global political and currency risks could still weigh on results."

Qualcomm, however, says the lawsuit mischaracterises its long-standing requirement for manufacturers to obtain a licence for its standard essential patents before buying chipsets.
The company's lawyers also rejected the suggestion by Which? that Qualcomm could demand certain royalties from Apple and Samsung, who ""can and do exert enormous buyer power"".
The case brought by Which? at London's Competition Appeal Tribunal is to determine whether Qualcomm is liable to the claimant class, with a further trial to determine any damages if Which? is successful.
A similar consumer lawsuit against Qualcomm in California, which challenged the company's patent licensing and exclusive-dealing chip agreements with Apple and other manufacturers, was dismissed in 2023.

Consumer group Which? has brought the claim on behalf of around 29 million UK Apple and Samsung smartphone users.
It will focus on whether Qualcomm held market power and, if so, whether it abused its position as a dominant company.
The trial, which will run for five weeks at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London, opened with submissions on behalf of Which?
Philip Moser KC, for Which?, told the hearing: “The nature of the abuse, where the abuse manifests itself, is in the area of negotiation of the royalty.
“And Qualcomm, instead of competitive negotiation, uses the inherent risk, or sometimes explicitly stated threat, of chipset supply disruption, software delay, to foreclose a normal discussion of royalties, and conditions for the licenses.
“Instead, it’s ‘unless you take our package of licences at Qualcomm’s rate and on our terms, unless you do that there are no chips’.
“And Qualcomm’s terms include a royalty at a rate which we say is likely to be inflated. And that’s payable on every phone whether it uses Qualcomm’s chips or not.”
If Which?’s first trial is successful, there will then be a second trial focusing on Qualcomm’s conduct and the damage suffered by the class, that Which? has calculated at around £480 million.
Which? alleges Qualcomm breached UK competition law by taking advantage of its dominance in the patent-licensing and chipset markets.
It claims that this resulted in Qualcomm being able to charge manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung inflated fees for technology licences, which have then been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices or lower-quality smartphones.
Which? is seeking damages for all affected Apple and Samsung smartphones purchased between October 1 2015 and January 9 2024.
It estimates that individual consumers could be due an average of around £17 per phone if the action is successful.
Which? said the action was “vital” to obtain redress for consumers and to “send a clear message to powerful companies like Qualcomm that if they engage in harmful, anticompetitive practices, Which? stands ready to take action”.
Which? chief executive Anabel Hoult said: “This trial is a huge moment. It shows how the power of consumers – backed by Which? – can be used to hold the biggest companies to account if they abuse their dominant position.
“Without Which? bringing this claim on behalf of millions of affected UK consumers, it would simply not be realistic for people to seek damages from the company on an individual basis – that’s why it’s so important that consumers can come together and claim the redress they are entitled to.”
Qualcomm is expected to make its opening submissions on Tuesday."

The retail REIT’s strategic move helps create value and drive footfall at the properties.
In June 2025, Simon Property purchased Swire Properties’ stake in Brickell City Centre’s open-air shopping center, and now owns and manages the asset. With more than 90 retail stores, including Apple, Zara and Coach, and more than 15 premium dining and entertainment locations, the center will act as a major footfall driver for the company.
In April 2025, Simon Property acquired its joint venture partner’s remaining interest in Briarwood Mall, consolidating the same in its portfolio. In January 2025, Simon Property announced that it had taken over 100% of The Mall Luxury Outlets entities from Kering. Established in 2001, The Mall operates two luxury outlets: one in Leccio, near Florence, Italy, and the other in Sanremo on the Italian Riviera.
Moreover, Simon Property actively indulges in redevelopment and expansion projects in markets with a favorable risk-reward ratio. The company has such projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants and restaurants, ongoing at properties in North America, Europe and Asia. As of June 30, 2025, the company’s share of net investment in redevelopments amounted to around $1 billion.
In addition, Simon Property is making efforts to bolster its financial flexibility. With solid balance-sheet strength and available capital resources, it remains well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.
How Are Other Retail REITs Capitalizing on Growth Opportunities?
Kimco Realty KIM is driving growth through redevelopments, selective acquisitions and asset recycling. For 2025, Kimco plans $100-$125 million in net acquisitions, funded partly by $100-$150 million in dispositions of low-growth assets, with redevelopment yields up to 17% and Kimco’s structured investments yielding 9-10%.
Federal Realty FRT is enhancing its operational performance through disciplined expansion in supply-constrained premium markets with an affluent population. The company is also disposing of non-core assets, which provides the dry powder to carry out value-accretive acquisitions. From the year 2019 through the second quarter of 2025, the company’s gross investment in acquisitions amounted to $2.1 billion, and gross proceeds from dispositions totaled $1.1 billion.

Nvidia's (NVDA) next decade could make lawyers — and maybe investors — rethink everything.
""Nvidia is going to make a ... chip reasoning platform,"" CNBC's ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (see the video above; listen below). ""The next one is going to be, 'Let me tell you what I think,' and it's going to be maybe superior to how you're thinking. That's the big breakout ... the reasoning one.""
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Cramer, who was among the earliest to tout Nvidia when it was still dismissed as a gaming chipmaker, said if Nvidia executes, its chips could make judgments with ""far fewer mistakes"" than humans.
That ""chip reasoning"" platform could upend industries far beyond tech. He likened it to astronomer Vera Rubin, who pioneered the existence of dark matter. He used law firms as an example, noting that with the system, ""you don't need that fourth-year associate anymore.""
Cramer's conviction in Nvidia runs so deep that, in 2017, he renamed his dog Nvidia to hammer the point home. At the time, Cramer and Sozzi worked together at TheStreet — the business news publication Cramer founded in 1996.
""I couldn't get people to focus on it,"" Cramer said. ""By the way, no one wanted to believe because it was too crazy.""
What he saw during a visit to CEO Jensen Huang's office convinced him that Nvidia was more than just a gaming company. Early demonstrations of artificial intelligence creating art, theater, and even restaurant scenarios were what he described as ""inconceivable.” At the time, Huang urged him to talk up Nvidia.
""I just saw it with my eyes,"" Cramer said. ""I'm going to tell people they must buy this stock.""

Even today, he tells investors to refrain from asking him about Amazon (AMZN) versus Apple (AAPL) — and to heed his advice from 2017.
""Are you an idiot? Buy Nvidia. NVDA,"" he said.
Still, the question for investors now isn't what Nvidia achieved in the past 10 years, but what comes next. Shares are up more than 1,300% in the past five years.
And Nvidia may also face pressure to strike licensing deals to comply with regulatory rules.
""They [Nvidia] do have to start getting deals with the New York Times,"" Cramer warned, pointing to the battle over training data. ""That's why Cloudflare is such a good stock."" Cloudflare (NET) provides web security services.
Cramer's appearance on Opening Bid Unfiltered coincides with the promotion of his eighth book, ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" Like his Nvidia anecdotes, Cramer said the book blends stock-picking stories with investing lessons — though he admits that calling a company like Nvidia early doesn't happen every cycle."

Oct 6 - Apple's pricing approach sits at the center of a new analyst note from Needham. Laura Martin argues that Apple did not raise iPhone prices fast enough to match inflation since 2019, and she estimates that gap cost shareholders about 13% in forgone value.
Martin maintains a ""Hold"" rating and links weaker pricing power to a lack of clear, differentiated features that would justify higher prices.
Apple launched the iPhone 17 lineup, including the slimmer iPhone Air, but early market checks show uneven demand: the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro report stronger starts while the Air lags, and Bank of America notes elevated lead times for core models that point to robust interest there.
Martin frames the issue as one of pricing leverage rather than overall demand; other analysts highlight strong unit demand for some models, so views differ across the street.
To investors, the most important thing is simply realistic, monitor whether Apple will be able to convert new features into actual price strength or simply rely on increased sales and promotion.
Is AAPL Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 43 analysts, the average target price for Apple Inc is $247.99 with a high estimate of $310.00 and a low estimate of $175.00. The average target implies a downside of -3.90% from the current price of $258.05.

Apple's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Apple's main business drivers.
Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. The Services portfolio that includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services now contributes a significant part of revenues.
The non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPods continue to gain traction. In fact, Apple dominates the Wearables and Hearables markets due to the growing adoption of Watch and AirPods. Solid uptake of Apple Watch has helped Apple strengthen its presence in the personal health monitoring space.
Apple is expanding its non-iPhone portfolio with the launch of Apple Vision Pro a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world.
Headquartered in Cupertino, CA, Apple also designs, manufactures and sells iPad, MacBook and HomePod. These devices are powered by software applications including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems.
Apple’s other services include subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, the new Apple TV app, Apple TV channels and Apple TV+, a new subscription service.
In fiscal 2024, Apple generated $391.04 billion in total revenues. The company’s flagship device iPhone accounted for 51.4% of total revenues. The Services, Mac and iPad categories contributed 24.6%, 7.7% and 6.8%, respectively. The Wearables, Home and Accessories products category contributed 9.5%.
Apple primarily reports revenues on a geographic basis, namely the Americas (North & South America), Europe (European countries, India, Middle East and Africa), Greater China (China, Hong Kong & Taiwan), Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific (Australia & other Asian Countries).
In fiscal 2024, Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific accounted for 42.7%, 25.9%, 17.1%, 6.4% and 7.8% of total revenues, respectively.
Apple faces stiff competition from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Google, Huawei and Motorola in the smartphone market. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer and Asus are its primary competitors in the PC market. Other notable competitors are Google & Amazon (smart speakers) and Fitbit & Xiaomi (wearables)."

What Wall Street Has Been Saying
Analyst opinions on Apple remain mixed, with recent research notes reflecting both enthusiasm for the company’s potential and caution about near-term risks. Below is a summary of the main themes from recent Wall Street commentary.
🐂 Bullish Takeaways
-
Several firms, including Morgan Stanley and Wedbush, have increased their price targets. Morgan Stanley notably boosted its target to $230, citing surging demand forecasts for the upcoming iPhone 17 and improved execution in supply chain management.
-
Bulls are particularly enthusiastic about growth in Apple’s services segment, with analysts highlighting that continued service revenue momentum is poised to drive a higher proportion of total profits and help support a premium valuation multiple.
-
Recent notes from Barclays credit Apple’s operational transparency and effective cost controls with sustaining investor confidence, even as the product landscape evolves.
-
Looking ahead, optimism centers around key product innovations such as the anticipated foldable iPhone. Analysts project it could meaningfully boost revenues, especially in fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
🐻 Bearish Takeaways
-
More cautious voices, including Bernstein, have maintained neutral to underweight ratings and kept price targets flat or slightly reduced, emphasizing that current stock valuations already reflect aggressive expectations for iPhone sales and product refresh cycles.
-
Concerns remain around signs of moderating demand for recent iPhone models, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, with J.P. Morgan highlighting evidence of longer lead times and softer upgrades among some key customer segments.
-
Bearish analysts also point to ongoing competitive and margin pressures in major international markets such as China, warning that these issues could weigh on near-term execution and constrain risk-adjusted returns.
-
Several reports, including those from UBS, cite the relatively slower pace of innovation in artificial intelligence and persistent regulatory risks as additional factors limiting upside and justifying a more cautious or neutral stance.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-06T11:47:20,A new era of financial service: The convergence of banking and telecom,"In the first of a series of four articles, Pablo Cella discusses the growing convergence between banking and telecommunication services, highlighting how a mobile-first world is blurring the lines between these industries",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=289b3ecf6aa5c634da8accca5531993cd81a3e4cba6fd99677aff958b35281bf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.retailbankerinternational.com/comment/the-convergence-of-banking-and-telecom/,https://www.retailbankerinternational.com/comment/the-convergence-of-banking-and-telecom/,https://www.retailbankerinternational.com/comment/the-convergence-of-banking-and-telecom/,retailbankerinternational.com,200,,"In our mobile-first world, the lines between communication and financial services have blurred. People – including me – use their mobile devices for everything, and banks don’t want to be left behind or to be just another app among dozens of other options. That is especially true as fintechs expand into a broader range of financial services and tech giants, like Apple and Google, venture into payments and other financial services.
For their part, telcos want to provide more than just the infrastructure for the mobile-first world. Like banks, they want to be central as the mobile-first world becomes mobile-always. Financial services offer an ideal way for telcos to claim a larger share of the mobile-era pie, and banks can win a more central position in people’s economic lives by facilitating the convergence of communication and financial services.
As the convergence takes shape, individual banks and telcos have three options. They can observe from the sidelines, dabble in converged services, or lead the way. Leaders in both industries have an unprecedented opportunity to surge ahead, gaining a revenue and adoption edge.
Slow movers risk falling behind a trend poised to generate tremendous value for customers. That’s especially true as generative AI has the potential to ease and accelerate the more challenging aspects of the convergence.
A global showcase of bank/telco convergence
Across regions, there is ample evidence of the convergence of banking and telecom. N26 in Germany provides an interesting and explicit example. A neobank, N26, has offered banking services in Germany since 2013. It recently launched a digital mobile offering. Customers simply activate a plan from within their mobile app. What about infrastructure? Vodafone Germany partnered with N26 to deliver connectivity, with the telco giant growing revenue while avoiding marketing spend.
N26 can expect competition. European digital bank Revolut is launching a similar mobile service. Revolut is going the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) route, which means it accesses infrastructure through leasing rather than a partnership. Like other MVNOs, Revolut plans to offer low-cost service to attract customers, and it will sweeten the deal with loyalty points.
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataOn the telco side, many communication service providers, especially in the developing world, have offered digital wallets for years. In 2016, Yoma Bank and Telenor Myanmar partnered to launch a digital wallet called Wave Money in Myanmar. Today, it serves 35 million customers. Orange Money and VodaPay in Africa provide similar examples of digital wallet success.
Telco-powered financial services aren’t confined to the developing world. Rogers Communications in Canada operates a bank that offers credit cards and digital wallets. In Norway, three mobile operators united to create a payment platform called Strex. Success with consumers inspired Strex to enhance its service to help e-commerce merchants reach more customers.
What’s fuelling and accelerating the convergence?
As evidenced by the examples above, the convergence of telco and banking takes many forms – virtually all centred around mobile services. Mobile devices are the new high street or town square. Linking financial services to connectivity is as intuitive as a shop owner adding a trendy product line to their shelves – but with more technical and customer service challenges.
In many ways, the imperative to include the unbanked led the trend, with digital wallets linked to apps connecting the unbanked and underbanked to financial services, especially payments. The converging services outlined above are a continuation of the trend. As the convergence gathers momentum, you’ll see telcos inspired to offer customers more embedded finance options, like buy now pay later.
On the banking side, N26’s success may lead some to launch connectivity services. Collaboration sets the stage for more innovation, especially in markets where telcos play key roles in digital identity programs. In those markets, such as India and Estonia, telcos support an identity infrastructure that accelerates financial service provisioning and know your customer requirements.
From convergence to superapp ecosystem
What is likely to grow in this fertile bank and telco ecosystem over the next three to five years? Superapps. More specifically, bank- and/or telco-led superapps where experimental partnerships expand into fully integrated platforms that include payments, connectivity, loans, insurance, and IoT services. As other partners join, the superapps will include a curated and trusted entertainment, lifestyle, and commerce marketplace.
GenAI has the potential to bring an integrated experience to supperapps. Imagine an AI-powered financial coach helping to guide customer choices across the supperapp ecosystem. AI can also smooth the integration “seams” that can create friction when multiple businesses try to connect services.
Superapps with finance and connectivity as cornerstones have already taken root in many markets, including Rakuten in Japan, Paytm in India, and Grab in Southeast Asia. North America and Europe lack similar superapps. However, the convergence of telcos and banks—and their ability to fuel growth with loyalty programs—will catalyse the emergence of new “everything” platforms, which will evolve into superapps in more markets.
Lead or get left behind
Banks and telcos position themselves to win the coming convergence by taking steps to expand capabilities and form partnerships. You could march forward with a go-it-alone strategy, but you’re likely to get further faster with an ally. By partnering, telcos and banks can gain the growth, loyalty, and revenue advantages of expanded services – without having to master the details of a new industry. The first step? Form a partnership and create a joint innovation lab to prototype and test converged services. To accelerate progress, upskill teams in AI, security, and digital experience design to support convergence initiatives. Ensure that you preserve customer trust by prioritizing data ethics, transparency, and consent.
Beyond seeking partnerships with telcos, banks should:
- Invest in modern API-first architectures that enable open finance and seamless integration with telco platforms and other third-party services.
- Consider offering connectivity services to customers either by co-branding services with a leading telco or by exploring MVNO models that use leased infrastructure.
- Develop embedded finance strategies that include lending, insurance, and wealth management in order to insert services into telco ecosystems.
- Accelerate AI-powered innovation by emphasizing use cases that could redefine the convergence model, such as AI-led underwriting and autonomous financial orchestration.
Telcos should:
- Build or acquire digital wallet capabilities as the first step and explore options to add regulated financial products in collaboration with traditional banks.
- Strengthen data governance and compliance frameworks to prepare for the regulatory complexity of financial services.
- Partner with banks to co-create trusted products that take advantage of your customer relationships to streamline processes like credit scoring, underwriting, and fraud detection.
- Connect AI-powered customer service efforts to current partnerships to smooth the way to greater future integration.
Looking Ahead
As a leading technology and services provider to communication and financial service industries, we see the convergence happening up close. Explore how banks and telcos are turning next-gen technology into future-focused innovations. And stay tuned for upcoming posts on the bank/telco convergence, which look more closely at how these sectors can accelerate innovation with GenAI and through strategic partnerships.

Shawbrook said on Monday it was considering an initial public offering (IPO), with Reuters reporting that the company could be valued at as much as £2bn.
The digital bank was previously listed on the LSE from 2015 until 2017, when it was bought by a consortium led by BC Partners and Pollen Street Capital.
The bank provides lending products ranging from complex structured credit facilities for growth-focused businesses to mortgages for professional landlords, as well as simple loans for individuals. Between the end of 2013 and 30 June 2025, Shawbrook grew its loan book from £1.4bn to £17bn.
CEO Marcelino Castrillo said the IPO would mark an ""important milestone"" in the firm's journey.
Shawbrook, which was founded in 2011, delivered 35% growth in underlying profit before tax to £168.6m in the first half of 2025.
Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said it was a ""vote of confidence"" that Shawbrook had chosen to return to the LSE.

""It has ambitious growth plans to nearly double the size of its loan book by the end of 2030,"" he said. ""The banking sector has been a rich source of stock market returns over the past year, suggesting that Shawbrook’s IPO could attract a lot of interest.""
Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said that a dual listing in New York and London last week by data centre real estate investment trust Fermi (FRMI, FRMI.L) and the revival of Shawbrook's IPO show that the UK market ""is not yet doomed to irrelevance"".
""These stories, coming in a week when the UK fell behind Mexico in the global IPO ranking, show that the City can still command the attention of vibrant companies,"" he said. ""It sends a message to Westminster that, with a little more love and attention, London can still compete with other major global financial hubs.""
Shawbrook's announcement came after Princes Group, whose products include tinned tuna, as well as the Napolina, Branston and Flora brands, said on Friday that it was considering listing in London.
Princes said an IPO would help raise funds to support further growth via additional acquisitions.
In addition, The Beauty Tech Group (TBTG.L) made its debut on the London market on Friday, with its shares initially rising after trading began but falling 1.3% into the red at the time of writing on Monday."

Kia placed ahead of Ford (F) as 9,455 Sportages hit the road over the month, while Ford's Puma recorded 8,310 registrations and remains the most popular model for 2025 overall.
The Nissan (4021.T) Qashqai took third place with 7,218 cars sold.
The Jaecoo 7 was number four on the list, with 6,489 units sold, followed by the Vauxhall Corsa, with 5,841 registrations.

The BYD (BYD) Seal U, Hyundai (0053800.KS) Tucson, MG HS, Volkswagen (VOW3.DE) Golf and Volvo (VOLCAR-B.ST) XC40 models completed the top 10.
""Electrified vehicles are powering market growth after a sluggish summer – and with record ZEV uptake, massive industry investment is paying off, despite demand still trailing ambition,"" said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive.
""The Electric Car Grant will help to break down one of the barriers holding back more drivers from making the switch – and tackling remaining roadblocks, by unlocking infrastructure investment and driving down energy costs, will be crucial to the success of the industry and the environmental goals we share.""
More than half (50.8%) of all new vehicles registered during the month were electrified. Chinese EV manufacturer BYD has become a favoured low-cost option as Tesla's (TSLA) dominance in the UK market has waned in the second half of the year.
New car sales rose by 13.7% to reach 312,891 units – the best September performance since 2020.
All market sectors drove growth, with the biggest increase recorded by fleets, where volumes rose 16.9% to reach 174,336 units. Private consumer demand also rose, up 8.9% to 131,003 units, while business registrations rose 28.6% to reach 7,552 deliveries, the SMMT said.
September typically accounts for around one in seven annual registrations. Overall demand year-to-date is up 4.2%.

Qualcomm remains the leading innovator in the smartphone chipset market, and it has incorporated AI features into its latest phones.
Despite its position in the market, the stock struggled to move higher as it contends with the coming loss of Apple as a client and its heavy dependence on China.
Nonetheless, Qualcomm's supply agreement with Apple is valid until March 2027, which means it could still drive sales in the immediate future. Additionally, it maintains a strong presence in the most advanced phones running Alphabet's software. As indications of another upgrade cycle begin to appear, Qualcomm's long-suffering shareholders could finally experience an improvement in shareholder returns.
The coming upgrade cycle
Admittedly, identifying Apple as a potential catalyst for Qualcomm stock may seem nonsensical at first glance. Qualcomm's agreement with Apple ends in 17 months, giving users a limited amount of time to upgrade to a Qualcomm-powered iPhone. Moreover, the built-in AI features introduced with the iPhone 16 failed to drive the sales increases typically seen in past upgrade cycles.
However, it is likely too early to write off iPhone-driven sales as a revenue source. Phones older than the iPhone 11 will be unable to load iOS 26, a factor that will likely push iPhone users to finally upgrade in the near term, and a similar situation is likely to arise next year.
Furthermore, investors should remember that Android holds a 75% global market share, according to StatCounter. That should bolster Qualcomm even as Apple transitions away from its products.
The Android side of the business is also different since numerous manufacturers, including Samsung, Sony, and Motorola, use its chipsets. These phones typically do not last as long, and until the release of the S24 in January 2024, Samsung phones only guaranteed four years of Android updates. Now, with the S24 and later models receiving seven years of updates, the longer-lasting phone could push more users to upgrade in the near term.
Qualcomm's new focus
While smartphone chipsets made up 63% of Qualcomm's total revenue in the first nine months of 2025 (ended June 29), Qualcomm intends to compensate for the lost Apple revenue through other business segments. These businesses, particularly its Internet of Things (IoT) and automotive segments, produce other devices that can drive Qualcomm's growth.
Handset revenue grew 11% yearly in the first nine months of the year, but that did not compare to the other segments. IoT and automotive revenue increased by 29% and 44%, respectively, and with that growth, these businesses could help revive Qualcomm stock as they become a larger part of the company.
Addressing the limitations
Indeed, even with such improvements, around 46% of the company's revenue came from China in fiscal 2024. While we will likely get an update on this figure after the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release, it may seem uncomfortably high.
Nonetheless, investor interest has increased in China-based companies like Alibaba and Baidu. That indicates that investors now see China exposure as less of a liability.
Investors may also not know what to make of Qualcomm's valuation. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16 is about half of the S&P 500 average of 31, but the fact that the earnings multiple is near a 52-week high is indicative of an improved outlook. Additionally, that P/E ratio could rise much further as Qualcomm's business conditions improve, taking its stock higher over time.
Consider Qualcomm stock
Amid business challenges and a low valuation, an upgrade cycle and the diversification of its offerings could finally push investors to stop underrating Qualcomm stock. Indeed, the loss of Apple as a client and high dependence on China have boded poorly for Qualcomm on the surface and likely explain its 16 P/E ratio.
Still, neither of those factors changes the fact that Qualcomm remains the No. 1 smartphone chipset producer. Moreover, its diversification into IoT and automotive gives it more avenues where it can apply its technology. With investors appearing to be less worried about China exposure and an upgrade cycle likely to increase sales, the chip stock is unlikely to stay as cheap as 16 times earnings for long."

Multicoin Capital managing partner Tushar Jain has predicted that the GENIUS Act will trigger a competitive upheaval in retail banking, with major technology companies poised to challenge traditional banks by offering stablecoin products with superior yields and user experiences.
Jain argued that banks have long exploited retail depositors by paying minimal interest rates.
He foresaw that tech giants like Meta, Google, and Apple would soon leverage their massive distribution networks to offer stablecoins with better returns, instant settlement, 24/7 payments, and free transfers embedded directly into widely used apps and operating systems.
Banking Industry Fights Yield-Sharing as Deposit Flight Fears Mount
The banking sector has mounted an aggressive lobbying campaign to prevent stablecoin platforms from offering competitive yields to holders, despite the GENIUS Act’s prohibition applying only to issuers, not intermediaries.
Five major U.S. banking trade organizations have urged Congress to close perceived “loopholes” that allow crypto exchanges to offer stablecoin yields through affiliate programs and marketing arrangements, citing Treasury estimates of potential $6.6 trillion deposit outflows.
Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose particularly warned that stablecoin interest payments could trigger 1980s-style deposit flight similar to when money market funds surged from $4 billion to $235 billion in seven years, draining traditional bank deposits.
During that period, withdrawals exceeded new deposits by $32 billion between 1981 and 1982 as consumers chased higher returns.
The American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute argued that joint marketing arrangements between issuers and exchanges could accelerate deposit flight during periods of financial stress.
However, the banking lobby’s position faces contradictions as major institutions simultaneously explore stablecoin opportunities.
Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser confirmed the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin” while developing tokenized deposit services for corporate clients.
JPMorgan also launched JPMD deposit tokens for institutional blockchain payments and served as lead underwriter for Circle’s IPO.
Jain dismissed banking concerns, noting that the prohibition on passing interest to stablecoin holders is “easily circumvented,” as evidenced by Coinbase’s yield-sharing with customers.
Stripe CEO Patrick Collison reinforced this view, arguing that depositors “are going to, and should, earn something closer to a market return on their capital.”
Given that average U.S. savings deposits yield just 0.40%, while $4 trillion in bank deposits earn 0% interest, Collison’s point is well-taken.
Stablecoin Market Consolidation Faces Disruption From New Entrants
The long-standing Tether-Circle duopoly, which controls 86% of the $298 billion stablecoin market, faces mounting pressure from new issuers offering yield-sharing arrangements and customizable reserve structures.
Venture capitalist Nic Carter argued that the dominance of the two major issuers has begun declining from its 91.6% peak in March 2024, driven by intermediaries rolling their own stablecoins to capture reserve yield rather than surrendering revenue to third parties.
White-label issuance platforms, including Bridge, Anchorage, Brale, M0, and Agora, have dramatically reduced fixed costs, enabling even seed-stage startups to launch their own stablecoins.
Exchanges and fintechs now face strong incentives to internalize yield rather than allowing Tether to earn approximately $35 million annually on every $500 million in deposits while the intermediary receives nothing.
Phantom wallet launched Phantom Cash, a Bridge-issued stablecoin with embedded earn and debit card functionalities.
Similarly, Hyperliquid’s public bidding process for its stablecoin attracted proposals from Native Markets, Paxos, Frax, Agora, Sky, Curve, and Ethena.
The platform currently hosts $5.5 billion in USDC, representing 7.8% of the total USDC supply, and aims to reduce its dependence on Circle while capturing reserve yield.
Ethena’s USDe has emerged as the biggest success story of 2025, surging to a $14.7 billion supply by passing along yield from crypto-based trades.
Other yield-focused stablecoins, including Ondo’s USDY, Maker’s SUSD, Paxos’ USDG, and Agora’s AUSD, have collectively accumulated more supply than during the prior bull market cycle.
Carter noted that cross-chain swaps have become significantly more efficient and cheaper, reducing network effects that previously benefited major issuers.
According to him, many fintechs and neobanks now display user balances in generic “dollars” or “dollar tokens” rather than USDC or USDT, guaranteeing redeemability in any stablecoin while managing reserves internally.
The Global Dollar consortium, launched by Paxos, includes Robinhood, Kraken, Anchorage, Galaxy, Bullish, and Nuvei, alongside over a dozen other partners.
Similarly, a report by Cryptonews suggests that JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo held early talks about creating their own stablecoin consortium.
Carter predicted that banks will join the stablecoin market as issuers, despite concerns about deposit flight, noting that even maintaining a 50- to 100-basis-point margin could generate meaningful revenue from trillions of deposits.

It's made up of:
- Nvidia (NVDA 0.20%)
- Microsoft (MSFT 0.20%)
- Apple (AAPL 0.41%)
- Alphabet (GOOG 1.38%) (GOOGL 1.52%)
- Amazon (AMZN -0.93%)
- Meta Platforms (META 1.08%)
- Tesla (TSLA 0.95%)
If you bought shares of these stocks five years ago, you're a happy investor. This group still makes up a huge chunk of the largest stocks in the market, with seven of the top eight largest stocks by market cap listed on U.S. exchanges belonging to this group. Of these seven, I think five are excellent buys now, although one could also sneak onto this list.
What are the five? Let's find out.
Apple and Tesla are on the outside looking in
Since there are more stocks that I think are buys than stocks to avoid, let's start with the two that I'm avoiding first.
Apple headlines this list as a stock I want no part of owning. While it has been a top performer over the past decade, a lot of that growth can be attributed to multiple expansion, which in this case occurred because investors were willing to pay more for the stock. Apple is one of the most expensive stocks in this group, despite having some of the slowest growth rates. (Note: Nvidia and Tesla were removed from this graph because they skew the growth and valuation figures)
As a result, the other stocks are far more attractive.
Tesla is also another one I'm not sure about. It's seeing some headwinds in its EV business, but it also has several promising technologies coming down the pipeline. I'm more neutral on Tesla than I am on Apple, but it just doesn't look like as good a buy as these other five right now.
The AI infrastructure buildout is a huge growth driver for the Magnificent Seven
The biggest trend around the other five is clearly artificial intelligence. A boatload of money is being spent on AI infrastructure right now, and many of these companies are reaping the benefits.
Nvidia is clearly the biggest beneficiary, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are being purchased in massive quantities by the AI hyperscalers to power workloads. There doesn't appear to be any signs of this trend slowing down, and Nvidia will continue to be an excellent stock to hold over the next few years as AI data centers continue to be built.
Next, Alphabet was once a concern for investors that generative AI competitors would eliminate it. However, Alphabet appears to have weathered the storm and has integrated generative AI into the Google Search engine. AI Search Overviews have become a popular feature, and are used by millions around the globe. This helped secure Alphabet's future, but it also has another promising segment that shares some overlap with Amazon and Microsoft.
Cloud computing is a monster market that has received a huge AI boost. Most companies don't have the resources to maintain a massive data center, so it makes more sense to rent the computing power necessary to run AI models from cloud providers like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure. These divisions are major growth and profit drivers for all three, although Amazon's business benefits the most, with 53% of Amazon's operating profits coming from AWS during Q2. Cloud computing is the primary reason to own Amazon and Microsoft stock, and the growth is far from over in this industry.
Lastly, there is Meta Platforms. Unlike the previous four, Meta doesn't have a division that's benefiting from all of this AI spending. Yet.
Meta is developing its AI models to boost its advertising prowess across its social media platforms. It has already seen some success, but there is still a lot of room for improvement here. Additionally, Meta is launching AI glasses that help bring AI into the real world. Time will tell if this endeavor is worth the massive amount of money Meta has poured into this division, but if it becomes a hit, it could launch a brand new revenue stream for Meta. Even without some of the benefits that AI could have on Meta's business, it's still posting incredible results, with its ad business delivering 22% year-over-year revenue growth during Q2 and projected to grow revenue at a 20% rate overall in Q3.
Meta is a strong investment option alongside most of its other peers in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" and I wouldn't be surprised to see this group outperform the S&P 500 moving forward."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-06T09:30:00,Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $1 Trillion Company of the Decade,This company is close to achieving a $1 trillion market cap.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0a154862cb726947ac5102e5d021a3701af709acb6835314eb371479051a3d7a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/prediction-this-ai-stock-first-new-1-trillion-co/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/prediction-this-ai-stock-first-new-1-trillion-co/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/prediction-this-ai-stock-first-new-1-trillion-co/,fool.com,200,,"Since Apple became the first company to reach a $1 trillion market cap in 2018, tech investors closely followed companies that have reached this milestone. Today, a total of 10 U.S. companies have market caps above $1 trillion, with Berkshire Hathaway being the only one without direct ties to the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.
However, the next tech stock in line to achieve this milestone is Oracle (ORCL 1.80%), a company that may come as a surprise to many investors. Here's how it is most likely to reach the $1 trillion mark as it reemerges as a force in the AI industry.
Oracle's rise to $1 trillion
Long known as a database company, Oracle leveraged its extensive data center presence to pivot into the cloud, creating Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). That successful shift in Oracle happened largely under the radar, as its larger competitors captured most of the investor attention.
In many cases, Oracle provides a competitive advantage over other cloud providers, and not just for its own workloads. OCI stands out by providing lower costs for compute capacity and the ability to scale performance and capacity more precisely than competitors like Amazon's AWS.
This product is so successful that in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Aug. 31), its remaining performance obligations (RPOs) rose an astounding 359% to $455 billion. Amid that news, the stock rose 36% in the following trading session on Sept. 10.
That briefly took its market cap above $900 billion. Even though the market cap has pulled back into the $815 billion range, Oracle looks to have the catalysts needed to exceed the $1 trillion mark.
Additionally, there are no other likely candidates as the next $1 trillion AI company. The next largest U.S.-based tech company in AI is Palantir Technologies at a $440 billion market cap, and its elevated valuation metrics could impede its path to $1 trillion. Also, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the cloud AI market of 40% through 2030. Even if that estimate proves optimistic, it is highly unlikely that anything would stop Oracle's march to $1 trillion.
But should investors buy?
Today, the cloud segment makes up 48% of the company's revenue. Moreover, that part of the company grew by 28% yearly in fiscal Q1. Admittedly, overall revenue growth was only 11% in that quarter, and the 11% annual revenue growth in fiscal 2025 shows that the fiscal Q1 growth rate is not an anomaly.
Nonetheless, thanks to the rise in RPOs, analysts believe overall revenue growth will rise to 17% this fiscal year and 22% for fiscal 2027, a move that should bode well for the company.
Amid such gains, it may not surprise investors that the stock is up more than 380% over the last five years, including a 135% gain from its April low.
Still, Oracle's balance sheet might give investors pause. Its liquidity is around $11 billion, a modest level compared to companies like Apple or Google parent Alphabet. It has also taken on more than $91 billion in debt, a considerable strain on the balance sheet, considering its book value of less than $25 billion.
Buying Oracle stock will also come at a price. The company's current P/E ratio is 67, making it far more expensive than its close competitors in the Magnificent Seven. Such an earnings multiple may leave investors questioning whether Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet might be a more suitable choice.
The next trillion-dollar AI company
In the race to AI, Oracle is already close to achieving that milestone, and no other U.S.-based AI company is likely to reach that point before Oracle.
However, a more critical question for investors is whether they should try to capitalize on that growth, and the answer is likely no.
Indeed, given the industry CAGR and Oracle's RPOs, it should beat the market. Nonetheless, the AI stocks in the Magnificent Seven have surpassed the $1 trillion market cap. Since they offer investors lower valuations and safer balance sheets, such stocks are likely more prudent choices for investors than Oracle."

Just last week, OpenAI sent shares of e-commerce companies Shopify Inc (SHOP). and Etsy Inc. (ETSY) soaring after unveiling an instant buy option in ChatGPT. Then a blog post detailing new features the company is using internally sent a fresh wave of jitters through software stocks like Atlassian Corp. (TEAM), already reeling from fears about AI disruption.

Such market-moving sway, usually reserved for behemoths like Apple Inc. or Nvidia Corp., is the latest sign of OpenAI’s rising influence on a wide variety of stocks even though there’s little indication the startup, which was recently valued at $500 billion, plans to list its shares anytime soon. That’s made OpenAI’s announcements and events — like the developer conference it’s holding on Monday — critical for traders.
“Software and internet investors are keenly focused on where OpenAI will go next and how disruptive it could be,” said UBS (UBS) analyst Karl Keirstead. As OpenAI continues to expand, he said, “the consensus view is that it will have to diversify more aggressively beyond ChatGPT subscriptions.”
Investors will be looking for clues about those plans at OpenAI’s third annual DevDay, which kicks off at 10 a.m. in San Francisco. The event could drive another round of stock moves with potential gains for partners or infrastructure providers and declines for companies in businesses the artificial intelligence giant is pushing into.
The Sam Altman-led company is likely to unveil more consumer AI agents that could include a “more robust travel booking agent,” Keirstead wrote in a research note on Oct. 1. OpenAI could also unveil an AI browser, the analyst said.
“Even though we can’t play OpenAI directly, this could be an important event, since any information we learn about its plans or products will help investors assess the landscape,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, which has about $10.5 billion in assets. “Maybe we learn that companies seen as being at risk aren’t as threatened as we think, or maybe we get insight into the next big AI play.”
Of course, OpenAI has been a factor for market pros ever since ChatGPT ignited a mania for AI in late 2022. The subsequent race to beef up computing power has fueled the rise in stocks of chipmakers like Nvidia and cloud-computing providers like Oracle Corp. (ORCL) Yet while fears about AI’s disruptive potential have long been present, they’ve mostly been theoretical. That’s starting to change."

The mining stock has been on a tear in 2025, with a 309% gain year to date, but concerns over valuation and slowing revenue growth may have started weighing down on this explosive performance.
Supply chain independence remains MP's key tailwind
MP Materials' second-quarter earnings report wasn't all good news. Although total revenue spiked 84% year over year, it also fell about 5.6% quarter to quarter. Operating expenses were also higher on a quarterly basis, and its earnings per share deteriorated by $0.05 per share.
The revenue declines and widening losses stand out, but there were bright spots worth highlighting. The company produced a record of 597 metric tons of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) -- its flagship rare metal. It also inked a huge deal with Apple (AAPL 0.41%) in mid-July, then got a hefty investment by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).
Both deals have helped bolster MP's cash position, which was about $263 million at the end of June, a roughly 32% increase from the first quarter.
A vote of confidence from the DoD highlights MP's strategic advantage. For years, it's been building up its facility in Mountain Pass, California, one of the only rare earth mines of any significance in the U.S. And although its facilities don't have quite enough manufacturing power to meet demands, the investments can fund expansion efforts that will increase production.
On that note, an investment in MP Materials is a bet that its rare earth metals, which are used to make super-strong magnets found in countless modern-day technologies, will continue to be in high demand in the future.
Like other mining stocks, MP Materials will be volatile, especially as it aims to ramp up production. But with policy tailwinds and a mining asset that no other company has, MP has what it takes to bounce back from the slide."

It Could Turn a Monthly $300 Investment Into $1 Million.,The billionaire has proven his investing strengths over time.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c6ed5c346686c46bbdb4e58430ba2df066fb00c0f296bda40245640adf69b8fa,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/warren-buffett-has-recommended-this-etf-it-could-t/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/warren-buffett-has-recommended-this-etf-it-could-t/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/warren-buffett-has-recommended-this-etf-it-could-t/,fool.com,200,,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is known for his engaging stories about investing, and he's quick to throw in a quip here and there that will get a chuckle out of the crowd. But investors take his investing advice very seriously. That's because this investing giant, as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has delivered market-beating returns for nearly six decades.
Throughout his investing career, Buffett has pointed out and invested in great companies -- from Apple to Coca-Cola -- but he's also spoken of another complementary investment that is an ideal addition to just about any portfolio. Buffett has even held shares in it, and in one of his shareholder letters several years ago, recommended it to all investors. This is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.43%).
This exchange-traded fund tracks the performance of the S&P 500, and over the long run, the benchmark has scored major wins for investors. In fact, considering that performance, a $300 monthly investment in the Vanguard fund could reach $1 million over time. Let's find out more about this Buffett-approved ETF and how an investment in it could reach into the millions.
Instant diversification
First, a quick note about ETFs. These funds group together many stocks according to a particular theme, allowing you to instantly diversify and gain exposure to a lot of companies with just one purchase. The theme could be an index, such as the S&P 500, or it might be an industry such as pharma or energy.
You can purchase an ETF as you would a stock as they trade daily on the market, so it's quick and easy to get in on these assets. One thing to note is that ETFs charge fees, and you can see them reflected in the expense ratio; go for ones with ratios of less than 1% in order to optimize your overall gains. The Vanguard S&P 500 fits the bill as its expense ratio is only 0.03%.
So, why did Buffett recommend this fund to investors? Because Buffett believes in the strength of American companies over time, and investing in this S&P 500 index tracker is the ideal way of benefiting from this.
Owning a cross-section of businesses
In his 2013 letters to shareholders, Buffett wrote that the goal of non-professional investors should be ""to own a cross-section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well. A low-cost S&P 500 index fund will achieve this goal.""
The S&P 500 index always includes the top U.S. companies across industries that are powering the day's economy, and it keeps current by reviewing members on a quarterly basis to cut certain ones and replace them with others that may be more relevant. This strategy has helped the index reflect the economy of the times, and it's been a winner for investors, too, as the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual gain of 10% since its launch as a 500-member index back in the late 1950s. That's an average, so note there are years when it's up and years when it's down.
In his 2013 letter, Buffett gave the nod to ""a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.)""
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, tracking the index's performance, allows you to bet on it, and one strategy in particular may turn a regular monthly investment into a fortune if you have enough time. This is thanks to the power of compounding.
Turning $300 into $1 million
Here's an example: While there are no guarantees, for this thought exercise I'll consider that the S&P 500 will continue to deliver an average annual gain of 10%. If you make an initial investment of $1,000 in the Vanguard S&P 500 fund, then add $300 per month to that for 35 years, the value of your investment may climb to $1 million.
So, here, you're combining Warren Buffett's valuable investment advice with a strategy that relies on compounding, and the results look pretty impressive. Of course, the index's gains over the next 35 years may vary -- they could shift higher or lower -- so the resulting value of your investment is impossible to predict.
But the S&P 500 has proven its growth capabilities over time, thanks to the strength of American businesses, as Buffett says, so it's reasonable to be optimistic about a long-term investment in this index. All of this means now is a great time to follow Buffett's advice and get in on this Vanguard S&P 500 fund and invest regularly to supercharge your winnings over time."

Imagine a future where the biggest US stocks like Tesla (TSLA) or Nvidia (NVDA) can be traded around the clock, with the transactions settled in seconds.
Momentum is building toward that vision. The crypto industry, along with Wall Street heavyweights, wants to bring tokenized stocks, or digital versions of traditional shares that are recorded on a blockchain's digital ledger, into the mainstream.
Last month Nasdaq (NDAQ) asked regulators for permission to allow listed stocks to trade in tokenized form on its exchange. If the request is granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it would mark a pivotal step toward merging traditional finance with blockchain. The SEC opened the proposal for public comments in September, with a decision expected within 45 to 90 days of publication.
“Tokenization is like a freight train. It can’t be stopped, and eventually it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Robinhood (HOOD) CEO Vlad Tenev said at a crypto conference in Singapore on Wednesday. Over the summer, the trading platform launched more than 200 US stock and ETF (exchange-traded fund) tokens in Europe.
Meanwhile, Wall Street firms ranging from Goldman Sachs to asset manager BlackRock have already rolled out tokenized money-market funds. BlackRock is also reportedly exploring the launch of tokenized ETFs.
""Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,"" BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said in the company's annual newsletter in July. ""Markets wouldn't need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds.""
Supporters argue that tokenized stocks make trading more accessible to investors, enable exchanges of assets in just one blockchain transaction, and expand their use in lending or as collateral.
“These are financial tools that the retail investor is not used to,” said Kevin Rusher, founder of real-world asset borrowing and lending firm RAAC. ""It lowers the barrier to entry.""
The market for tokenized real-world assets, which include stablecoins, bonds, real estate, and commodities, could swell from about $600 billion in 2025 to nearly $19 trillion by 2033, according to Boston Consulting Group and Ripple.
The rollout of some tokenized equity products abroad have had a rocky start.
Tokens tracking popular stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) in Europe have struggled with thin liquidity, leading to prices diverging from those of actual stocks.
Concerns about third-party issuers have also surfaced."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-05T12:05:00,2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now,These industry leaders in semiconductors and cloud computing could make solid investments.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c9936f9b5c3255171ce48fbca9b60812229647c130cb2c58c43e35d490109c38,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-buy-right-now/,fool.com,200,,"AI is accelerating demand for chips and cloud computing services. The AI chip market is expected to grow 29% per year through 2030, according to Grand View Research, while the cloud computing market is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 20%.
For investors looking for quality growth stocks to cash in on this opportunity, here are two no-brainer choices.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Demand for AI chips is driving robust growth for the leading chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.32%). TSMC, as it's also known, makes chips for other designers, including Nvidia, Apple, and Advanced Micro Devices. It controls more than 65% of the global foundry market, according to tech market researcher Counterpoint.
TSMC has invested for decades building expertise in cutting-edge chipmaking processes, which allows its clients to focus on what they do best, which is designing the most powerful chips in the world. The relationship TSMC built with its clients over the years is a competitive advantage. Its moat is so wide that even Intel has not been able to make headway against TSMC despite recent investments to build its own foundry business.
Demand for AI semiconductors and other high-performance chips pushed TSMC's revenue up 44% year over year in the second quarter. Its competitive lead allows it to earn a high net margin of over 42%.
As more investment goes into building more advanced AI, the company should continue to report stellar financial results. Developing smarter AI requires growing amounts of computational power, which is a catalyst for TSMC. The company is investing to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and elsewhere to mitigate the risks of higher costs from tariffs and to be able to meet growing demand.
Despite its commanding lead in the foundry market, the stock looks undervalued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28. Analysts expect earnings to rise at an annualized rate of 21% in the coming years. Assuming the stock continues to trade at the same valuation, that is enough growth to double the share price within the next four years.
2. Oracle
AI is a major catalyst for growth in the cloud computing market, since businesses can use AI in the cloud to get better insights from their data. Oracle (ORCL 1.80%) might be the best cloud stock to buy based on its leadership in enterprise database services and its extensive data center infrastructure that is optimized for AI.
Oracle's total revenue grew 12% year over year last quarter, but that doesn't tell investors about the real momentum happening in the business. The stock is soaring on the accelerating growth in its cloud infrastructure business, where the company is signing deals with major tech companies. In the second quarter, its remaining performance obligations (contracted revenue not yet realized) surged 359% year over year.
This impressive growth shows Oracle is becoming the preferred choice for AI workloads in the cloud. It can bundle its industry-leading database services with top AI models.
It also benefits from offering cloud customers integrated services across other cloud platforms like Amazon, Alphabet's Google, and Microsoft. This is clearly attractive to its customers -- Oracle's multi-cloud revenue jumped 1,529% last quarter.
Management expects the momentum to continue, as more workloads shift from AI training to inferencing, where models learn to make forecasts from new data. Its cloud infrastructure revenue is expected to grow 77% for the full year.
The stock is soaring because the robust demand in cloud infrastructure will grow its total revenue by 16% in fiscal 2026 on a constant-currency basis, indicating accelerating growth. This justifies the stock's high P/E multiple. AI is creating a more sticky relationship with Oracle's cloud database customers, setting up excellent return prospects for investors."

General Dynamics
What happened? On Monday, Seaport upgraded General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) to Buy with a $376 price target.
*TLDR: GD weakness is a buy opportunity. Catalysts loom; investors should front-run.
What’s the full story? Seaport upgrades GD to Buy from Neutral, slapping a $376 price target on it. The rationale? Near-term budget theatrics and potential government shutdown weakness scream ""buy-the-dip opportunity,"" especially with valuation looking compelling and new tax incentives juicing business jet demand. Investor sentiment? Indifferent, echoing a neutral consensus. But Seaport says that’s noise. The fiscal year ends September 30, and while a shutdown could spook the herd, it’s likely short-lived. GD’s fundamentals are improving, and The Firm sees the selloff as a gift. Execution concerns that once justified neutrality have eased, reducing downside risk. Near-term, GD might trade flat or down on shutdown fears, but Seaport says get ahead of the curve. Positive catalysts loom: a continuing resolution (CR) is more probable than a shutdown, the Pentagon’s pivot to “how soon” from “how much” is juicing backlog growth, and new contracts with incentive fees are margin boosters. Post-2026, upside risks are real, and investors are already discounting 2027/28.
Shutdown or not? It’s 50/50, but Seaport leans toward a CR and a 3-month extension. A shutdown, if it happens, is mostly headline risk—unless it drags beyond six months. The real pain? The Akron invoice processing center shuts, choking cash flows. Defense firms, though, are insulated from broader CR impacts.
Bottom line: GD’s weakness is a setup for a bullish move. Buy now, hold tight, and let the catalysts do the work.
NuScale Power
What happened? On Tuesday, BofA downgraded Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR) to Underperform with a $34 price target.
*TLDR: Valuations unrealistic; downgrades reflect skepticism. Near-term risk outweighs reward.
What’s the full story? BofA downgrades Oklo Inc (NYSE:OKLO) (Neutral from Buy) and Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR) (Underperform from Neutral), arguing valuations now bake in SMR deployment ramps and discount rates that are, frankly, delusional. Reverse DCFs at a 14% discount rate suggest 15.5GW for Oklo and 34.7GW for NuScale by 2040—44% and 92% above their base cases, respectively.

The company known also as Foxconn reported revenue of NT$2.06 trillion ($67.6 billion) for the three months to September, generally in line with analysts’ projections. It also projected a rise in sales this quarter from the previous three months, citing strong AI demand.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Hon Hai’s results may lend weight to bets on the sustainability of a post-ChatGPT boom in AI infrastructure construction that’s swept up big tech firms like Meta Platforms Inc. and startups including OpenAI. Globally, investors have poured capital into the suppliers of that rollout, from chipmakers and networking firms to companies like Hon Hai that make servers to house Nvidia chips. Still, some investors have warned that valuations are unsustainable until AI services truly go mainstream.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Hon Hai’s unaudited 3Q25 revenue rose 11% YoY to a record for the quarter, driven by the strong cloud and networking segment amid surging AI infrastructure demand. This momentum should carry into 4Q and help offset softer consumer electronic revenue, which rose sequentially in 3Q on the iPhone 17 launch but still dipped YoY on currency impact.

The Taiwanese company has said it expects revenue from servers to have more than doubled in the September quarter while its consumer electronics business stagnates. It’s poised to gain from its role in OpenAI’s Stargate AI infrastructure project: Last month, the world’s most valuable startup unveiled plans to invest about $400 billion in five new US data center sites in partnership with Oracle Corp. and SoftBank Group Corp.
Foxconn still depends on Apple Inc. for a sizable portion of its revenue by assembling the US client’s gadgets including iPhones. But as those sales plateau, it’s grown increasingly reliant on the AI boom.
Yet seismic geopolitical shifts present threats to Hon Hai’s business. In May, it cut its full-year revenue guidance, citing potential fallout from the US-China trade war. It’s already diversifying its manufacturing footprint away from China in a bid to offset the damage."

Revenue for Nvidia's biggest server maker and Apple's top iPhone assembler jumped 11% from the same quarter last year to T$2.057 trillion ($67.71 billion), Foxconn said in a statement on Sunday.
While that was below the T$2.134 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate, Foxconn said the result was better than expected.
On a U.S. dollar basis, Foxconn said third quarter revenue rose 16.1% on year. The Taiwan dollar has strengthened some 8% so far this year against the greenback.
Strong AI demand led to robust revenue growth for its cloud and networking products division. Smart consumer electronics, which includes iPhones, posted a slight revenue decline, affected by exchange rates, the company said.
September revenue rose 14.2% on year to T$837.1 billion, a record for that month.
Operations are expected to ""maintain sequential quarterly growth as AI server shipments continue to ramp up in the fourth quarter"" and due to the traditional peak season ahead of year-end holidays in major Western markets, the company said.
""However, the impact of the global political and economic situation and exchange rate fluctuations will need continued close monitoring,"" it added, without elaborating.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, does not provide numerical forecasts. It will report third quarter earnings on November 12.
Foxconn's shares have risen 23% this year, outperforming the 16% rise for the Taiwan market. The stock closed up 0.44% on Friday ahead of the revenue data release, compared with a 1.45% gain for the benchmark index.

Building her business based around natural peanut, almond and coconut butters has also seen Murray live in a shed rent-free for three months. Firstly, though, it was her love for running which led the former theatre producer to this point.

In 2013, she was training for the Paris marathon and looking for the best post-training nut snack. Perusing the supermarket offering, most products contained palm oil and additives. On a trip to the US, she also noted a booming almond butter market. “I thought it could be better here,” says Murray.
Working part-time at the science museum, she started testing nutritious recipes at home, with 99% nuts and a sprinkling of sea salt.
She read Mintel reports at the British library, researched the size of the market in comparison to the US and believed there was an opportunity to capitalise.
At the same time she came across a corporate competition called Escape the City, with the winner living rent-free in a shed at the company’s head office in south London for three months. When she was called up to say she had won, she handed in her notice an hour later.
Murray, who was 24 at the time, says: “It was very comfortable, probably one of the weirdest things I've ever done, but it gave me a chance to have a bit of a runway without any overheads.”
At the back end, she raised £120,000 on Crowdcube in nine days to fuel her first production, aided by a £5,000 loan from her parents after quitting her job.
“It wasn’t so simple as making it in the kitchen and seeing what happens,” admits Murray. “There was thinking and consideration behind the scenes as to who the consumer I was targeting. Was the category growing or in decline, and whether there were trends suggesting protein and nut butters were going to increase in size or be stagnant.”
Diagnosed with dyslexia aged seven, Murray says that dyslexic thinking led to her noting “different trends across many different places” and a shift in terms of the food landscape narrative towards protein."

Long-term shareholders should have no complaints. If you invested $10,000 in Apple stock a decade ago, here's how much you'd have today.
Crushing the market
A company doesn't get to be valued in the trillions of dollars without taking care of its investors. This is what Apple has done. In the past 10 years, the business has generated a total return of 938% (as of Sept. 30), which would have seen a $10,000 starting sum turn into an incredible $103,800.
This gain significantly outperforms the broader S&P 500. The closely watched index has put up a total return of 321% during the same time.
Key factors driving returns
Investors should understand what variables supported Apple's returns. In this instance, net income was up 119% between Q3 2015 and Q3 2025 (ended June 28). The business has been able to sell more of its devices, like the iPhone, MacBook, Watch, and AirPods, over time. What's more, Apple's services division is growing at a double-digit pace and posts a high gross margin.
The other key factor supporting the stock has been valuation expansion. Apple's price-to-earnings ratio, which currently sits at 38.6, has increased by 207% in the past decade."

While AI may interact with us through software, it still relies on a physical backbone – processor chips, server stacks, and device interfaces that bring it to life. Bernstein analyst Mark Newman understands this dynamic and has been closely watching the AI hardware sector.
“Hardware stocks have historically lagged overall tech in large part because hardware companies have struggled to grow. That said, hardware stocks offer high dispersion, creating opportunities for near-term Alpha generation, while the potential for AI re-rating and broader growth reacceleration offer longer-duration opportunities,” Newman opined.
“Although near-term concerns of an AI-bubble persist,” the analyst added, “we see huge upside in the long-term for IT hardware. While there is a huge range of outcomes, we land at $1.3T for enterprise inference in the 2030 base case (67% 25-30E CAGR).”
Putting these themes into action, the Bernstein expert looks closely at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), two companies with strong positions in AI-capable hardware. Let’s dive in and find out which one the analyst has selected as the right AI hardware stock to buy right now.
Apple
First up, Apple needs little introduction – it is a household name everyone is familiar with. The tech giant got its start in the 70s, when it helped to launch the very idea of personal computing, and later its early Macintosh computers introduced the mouse pointer and the GUI that are now ubiquitous. Today, the iPhone and iPad, along with the MacBook line, have a devoted following, giving the company a user base one billion strong.
The company was the first on Wall Street to reach a one trillion dollar market cap; its current market cap of ~$3.8 trillion makes it the third-most valuable publicly traded company in the US and the company generated over $391 billion at the top line in its fiscal year 2024.
As noted, Apple has a large and loyal customer base; this stems from a business model decision made by the company as far back as the 1980s, when its Mac computers introduced a series of innovations that quickly made them popular with graphics and publishing professionals – but that also made them incompatible with other computer operating systems. Since then, Apple has built an entire ecosystem based on its own devices, their quality and capabilities, and their users’ loyalty. The model has worked, and supports Apple’s reputation for quality and its solid position as a leader in the world of personal technology."

The firm reiterated its Buy rating on Apple with a $270 price target.
“Carrier incentives allow iPhones to be more affordable as they bundle iPhone financing … with telecom services under one monthly payment, and spread out the cost of the iPhone over 24/36 months,” BofA wrote.
The analysts noted that under certain trade-in programs, the phone itself can be free.
Subsidies for the new iPhone 17 series are said to be $100 higher than last year, offsetting the iPhone 17 Pro’s $1,099 starting price, compared with $999 for the iPhone 16 Pro.
BofA highlighted T-Mobile’s management commentary that iPhone activations are up double digits, while Verizon also pointed to strong upgrade activity.
“Recent lead times indicate the iPhone 17 shipment times are more extended vs last year,” BofA added.
Trade-in promotions are designed to encourage upgrades every two to four years, the analysts said.
“Only newer iPhones (iPhone 13 and newer) have the highest trade-in value of $1,100,” and all three major carriers now accept devices “in any condition (including broken or malfunctioning phones).”
Upfront costs remain, with customers paying an activation fee of $35-$40 and tax on the full retail price.
BofA estimated that with maximum trade-in credits, the new iPhone 17 requires $229-$234 upfront, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max costs $380-$385.
Carriers benefit by locking customers into higher-tier unlimited plans, BofA said, with credits applied evenly across 24- to 36-month installment terms.

While valuations are high, comparisons to the dot-com era suggest this may be a structural shift.
The combined market value of the United States' Magnificent Seven tech giants has now exceeded the entire output of the European Union, as a relentless rally in technology stocks stretches valuations and stokes concerns over potential market excess.
As of the close on 2 October 2025, the seven leading US tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla — commanded a total market capitalisation of $20.8 trillion (€17.7tn), eclipsing the EU’s total economic output of $19.4tn (€16.5tn).
Nvidia alone, now the world’s most valuable company, boasts a market valuation of around $4.3tn (€3.9tn) — equivalent to the GDP of Germany, Europe’s largest economy.
This extraordinary milestone is fuelling debate. Is this a transformative moment for global capitalism, or are we witnessing the early signs of a new tech bubble?
To assess that, we must ask: What truly defines a technology stock bubble — and how does today compare to the speculative frenzy of the early 2000s?
What is a tech bubble?
A tech bubble could be defined not just by high valuations, but by a widespread disconnect between market prices and the underlying economic reality or business fundamentals.
It’s characterised by speculative fervour, excessive investor optimism, and the belief that rapid technological change will deliver limitless profits — often without regard to earnings or sustainable business models.
Renowned economist Robert Shiller describes bubbles as periods of “social contagion” — where stories of quick riches fuel mass enthusiasm, drawing in more investors and driving prices even higher, regardless of the fundamentals.
In this phase, fear of missing out overrides risk assessment.
“Speculative bubbles are fuelled by the contagious spread of market stories, which inspire enthusiasm and a desire to participate among a growing number of investors,"" Robert Shiller wrote in his 'Irrational Exuberance'.
Hyman Minsky, another influential economist, argued that during euphoric booms, speculation becomes the dominant force in markets.
As asset prices climb, they are increasingly justified by narratives rather than data. Eventually, a trigger — whether macroeconomic, regulatory, or psychological — bursts the illusion, leading to a sharp correction. In tech bubbles, this dynamic is often amplified by the allure of innovation.
Investors project exponential growth onto emerging technologies — from dot-coms in the late 1990s to blockchain in the 2010s, and now potentially artificial intelligence.
‘This is not a bubble, but a reshaping of capitalism’
Jordi Visser, senior managing director and head of macro research at 22V Research, argued that branding today’s rally as a bubble misses the point.
“To separate AI from the lazy shorthand of ‘bubble’, we have to recognise that what’s unfolding is not speculative mania but a structural arms race,” he said, pointing to deep investment by governments and corporations in AI capabilities as a matter of national and economic security.
Rather than being driven by unsustainable euphoria, Visser suggests that AI is accelerating a decades-long process of economic concentration. That's one where wealth and innovation are being compressed into fewer hands, be they companies, households or nations.
“Bubbles lift everyone into euphoria; concentration leaves most behind,” he said.
Still, there are signs that investor sentiment is stretching. The speed of capital inflows into AI-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the speculative rise of small-cap AI names, and the dominance of a few megacaps over the broader market may not suggest a full-blown bubble, but they do indicate heightened risk.
Moreover, the structural bets being placed on AI may not all yield long-term gains. As with previous technological revolutions, not every firm will emerge a winner. The ghosts of AOL, BlackBerry and Yahoo! — once market leaders — still linger as reminders of how quickly innovation can outpace incumbency.
Are we in dot-com-like euphoria?
To assess whether we’re in a bubble similar to the late 1990s, it’s worth revisiting the numbers. The current tech rally can be traced back to November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT — a landmark moment for generative artificial intelligence that ignited a new wave of enthusiasm in Silicon Valley and beyond.
Since then, the Nasdaq 100 — the benchmark index for the largest US tech firms — has surged by 140% in under three years.
That’s impressive, but still modest compared to the dot-com era. In the three years leading up to the March 2000 peak, the Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 500%.
By that measure, we’re still far from the level of euphoria that defined the turn-of-the-century tech boom. Valuations, while elevated, are not yet extreme.
One of the most widely used indicators to assess equity valuations is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company’s current share price to its expected earnings over the next 12 months.
Here’s how the Magnificent Seven currently stack up:
Nvidia: 33.2x
Microsoft: 33.2x
Apple: 33.3x
Alphabet: 24.8x
Amazon: 32.1x
Meta: 25.5x
Tesla: 220.0x
Only Tesla appears significantly out of line, trading at a forward P/E of 220 — the highest in the Nasdaq 100 alongside Palantir, another AI-focused firm. Excluding Tesla, the group’s valuations are actually lower than the broader Nasdaq 100, which currently trades above 40x forward earnings.
In this context, while pricing is undoubtedly rich, it doesn’t yet reflect the frothy excesses of the dot-com bubble, at least not by traditional valuation standards.
Bottom Line
Today’s tech rally is extraordinary in both scale and symbolism.
That the world’s top seven tech companies can collectively outvalue the European Union’s economic output speaks volumes about the shifting balance of economic power in the digital age. But by traditional measures of euphoria — explosive price increases, irrational valuations, widespread retail mania — the current cycle falls short of the dot-com peak.

The British entrepreneur has been toughening up protective phone cases, and now its soon-to-launch hardshell luggage, every year since co-founding Mous in 2014, when he had to come up with novel ways to get his startup noticed.
“When we first launched, it was a complete disaster because no one was buying them as people didn't know about them,” admits Griffith.

The designer, who was working at Procter & Gamble (PG), teamed up with university friend Josh Shires, who was experimenting with a 3D printer in his room and trying to make tech accessories. In a flooded market, the duo knew they had to create a unique product to stand out in the phone category.
Their first design was a phone case that wound in headphones — “a terrible product and badly designed,” says Griffith — as they put their life savings of around £40,000, including a £7,000 loan from Virgin StartUp, into their concepts and learned how to develop products.
With a few months left of their dwindling funds, they decided to move to China, prolonging cash flow by a year and eliminating the need for constant video calls to Asia. They subsequently spent over two years working on product development for western companies and factories before mulling how to reposition Mous.
“Just out of fear of failure we thought to do everything to our best ability,” recalls Griffith.
However, a crowdfunding campaign stalled and bankruptcy loomed, largely after being told not to use magnetic phone cases, before Griffith approached brand expert and fellow co-founder Lucy Hutchinson. She became “hooked” by the prospect of consumers being excited by a phone case.
Griffith’s first stunt was to stand outside an Apple (AAPL) Store in London, throwing his phone to the floor. Security, he says, weren’t too keen and after moving outside Griffith saw the general public recording his demonstrations.
The crowdfunding gathered momentum, and he soon had 50,000 backers and 2.5 million preorders. Getting noticed has clearly worked, too. The firm's recent stunt from the Swiss dam, in which an iPhone 17 in a protective Mous case survived the drop, has already garnered 30 million organic views across social media."

The pullback came as SemiAccurate published a blunt rebuttal of the rumors, stating there is no agreement and dismissing the speculation as baseless.
SemiAccurate, a publication with a long track record of scrutinizing chip industry developments, dismissed the speculation outright. “TLDR is no,” the publication said in response to whether AMD would fab its chips at Intel.
The rumor gained traction earlier in the week after Semafor reported that Intel and AMD were in early-stage discussions about a partnership. That report sent Intel shares up nearly 6% and AMD up more than 1% midday Wednesday, as investors cheered the possibility of cooperation between the traditional rivals.
Despite the market reaction, SemiAccurate claims to have spoken with individuals on both sides who flatly denied any such arrangement. “I asked multiple people on both sides who know and everyone said it is BS. None even hinted that there is something in the works, all said the same hard no,” the site noted.
Adding another layer of intrigue, SemiAccurate suggested financial motives may have been behind the leak. “The best answer SemiAccurate has heard from multiple sources is that it appears that someone was trying to cover a short,” the site explained.
Intel has recently scored support from major players including the White House, Nvidia, and SoftBank, and is reportedly in talks with companies like Apple. Analysts such as Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research maintain that Intel’s 18A fabrication process could present a compelling case for prospective clients, including AMD.
Still, technical limitations remain a sticking point. AMD’s current chips are largely manufactured by Taiwan’s TSMC, and Intel’s process technology, according to Semafor, may not yet be suitable for AMD’s leading-edge designs.
As speculation continues to swirl, SemiAccurate urges caution and due diligence. “SemiAccurate is saddened by the idiocy of the net, several of our peers, and the echo chamber who puked this BS back as fact without doing the merest shred of research,” the report adds.

The speech effectively argued that while growth is important, regulation is needed to prevent another banking crisis.
""The growth issue, is crucial,"" Bailey said at the farewell symposium for Klaas Knot, a Dutch central banker who ended a term as chair of the Financial Stability Board in July. ""Our economies rely on financial risk taking, and that is essential to support investment and growth.""
He cited technological advancements such as the rise of alternative asset classes such as crypto as a potential future risk to stability.
He said crypto is an area that requires ""thorough assessment of possible vulnerabilities and their financial stability implications.""

He also said the banking system needs to be ready to mitigate against the potential future risks of AI in financial services.
""Our system must be constantly assessed and adapted as needed,"" he said. ""But that process must be grounded in the core principles and ideas of financial stability.""
The comments come as the government faces tough decisions around ways to manage stoking growth in the economy, with chancellor Rachel Reeves previously pledging to cut red tape to allow for ""informed risk-taking"" in financial services.
Bailey added that he didn't think that tougher regulations post global financial crisis was a cause of weak productivity and growth since then.
Earlier this week, new ONS figures showed the UK economy grew by an unrevised 0.3% in the second quarter, confirming a sharp slowdown. The figures came a day after Reeves delivered a speech at the Labour party conference, in which she pledged an approach rooted in ""securonomics"", emphasising economic stability and sensible spending over calls to shake up fiscal rules.
The next Bank of England rate-setting meeting is on the calendar for 6 November, ahead of the government's autumn statement on 26 November.
The Bank of England reduced its main interest rate to 4% in August 2025 but held it at that level in September. Market watchers have predicted a high chance of a 25 basis point cut in November.

Talk to enough experienced dividend investors and chances are they'll rattle off sectors like consumer staples, healthcare and utilities as some of their favorite payout destinations. Odds are equally good that they won't mention technology.
That's understandable, because the 12-month distribution rate on the largest exchange traded fund (ETF) tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index is a piddly 0.48%Obviously nothing to write home about, but that data point obfuscates tech's status as a rising payout growth spot. In fact, in dollar terms, Microsoft (MSFT 0.20%) and Apple (AAPL 0.54%) are two of the biggest dividend payers in the S&P 500.
Apple and Microsoft are widely held stocks, but in what amounts to a pleasant surprise for equity income investors, the duo is an appetizer in the tech dividend equation. Seven-course meals are available with the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV 1.23%) and the ProShares S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats ETF (TDV 0.96%).
Similar tickers, but different methodologies. So, let's examine how these ETFs live up to their tech dividend billings.
TDV: A familiar playbook
As its name implies, the ProShares S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats ETF has Dividend Aristocrats DNA. The TDV follows the S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats – a collection of tech companies that have increased payouts for at least seven straight years.
With tech and dividends still considered newlyweds, that index requirement sounds confining, but TDV holds 38 stocks. That roster size is aided by index flexibility that allows for ""tech-related"" companies. Mastercard (MA -0.36%) and Visa (V -0.16%) being prime examples.
If there's a rub with TDV's plumbing, it's that the dividend increase streak requirement precludes some big names from entering the index. For example, Alphabet (GOOG 1.38%) and Nvidia (NVDA 0.20%) are dividend payers, but they haven't increased payouts for seven straight years, so they're not yet candidates for TDV admission.
TDV has points in its favor, including equally weighting its holdings. That means the ETF can be an income-generating complement to stakes in tech funds that weigh components by market capitalization – many of which have rosters where a small number of stocks command whopping percentages of the portfolios.
TDIV: Tech dividend flexibility
While TDV's dividend increase streak mandate has a country club membership feel to it, the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund has its own elements of exclusivity. The fund follows the Nasdaq Technology Dividend™ Index, which has several rules dividend investors need to acknowledge. Those include requiring member firms to have paid a dividend over the past year, no payout cuts over that time and a minimum yield of 0.50%.
By eschewing the payout increase streak protocol, TDIV sports a significantly larger roster than its rival – 94 holdings to be precise. There's another big difference between the tech dividend ETFs. TDIV holdings are dividend value-weighted. In plain English, the ETF's index places added emphasis on stocks with big dividends and massive market caps. Hence, Broadcom (AVGO 2.81%), Oracle (ORCL 1.80%) and Microsoft combine for nearly a quarter of the ETF's weight. TDIV has a different way of doing things, but it's hard to argue with its performance since inception in August 2012.
There are other marquee differences between TDIV and its nearest competitor. Notably, the First Trust ETF can hold international stocks, some of which have been additive to performance, and 20% of its portfolio can be allocated to communication services stocks. The latter point is pertinent because if Alphabet and Meta Platforms (META 1.08%) increase their payouts enough to drive their yields to 0.50%, those stocks would be eligible for TDIV admittance, perhaps increasing the ETF's growth profile along the way.
Different tech dividend strokes for different folks
For fee-conscious investors, TDV is an appealing option because its annual expense ratio is 0.45%, or $45 on a $10,000 position, compared to TDIV's 0.50%, but fee tussles aren't the end ETF comparisons. Smart investors know there's more to the story.
The ProShares ETF may be more appropriate for investors seeking documented dividend dependability via an instrument that as currently constructed, leans into mature, older guard technology companies. Plus, the fund's equal-weight methodology may be attractive at a time when so many cap-weighted indexes are heavily concentrated in a small number of stocks.
On the other hand, TDIV is perhaps the better choice for growth investors that want a dash of income. Past performance isn't a guarantee of future returns, but it shouldn't be ignored that over the past three years, TDIV's returns and volatility traits stacked up well against some traditional tech ETFs, indicating its flexibility and index mechanics play in investors' favor."

Top 5 Upgrades:
-
Erste Group upgraded Alibaba (BABA) to Buy from Hold. The firm says the company is ""developing very well"" in artificial intelligence applications.
-
Fox Advisors upgraded Instacart (CART) to Outperform from Equal-Weight. The firm thinks the 24% decline in the stock since August 11, including 16% over the past month, on ""overblown"" competitive concerns has made shares ""oversold,"" the firm tells investors.
-
Gordon Haskett upgraded Zillow (Z) to Buy from Hold with a $90 price target, citing the belief that the negative sentiment weighing on the shares over the past two weeks creates ""a favorable risk/reward.""
-
Wells Fargo upgraded Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $212, up from $170. The firm says its concerns around pharmaceutical tariffs, pricing risk and Stelara's loss of exclusivity are now largely behind Johnson & Johnson.
-
Rothschild & Co Redburn upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $417, up from $325. The firm still expects compression in the company's take rate over time, but believes its retail volume growth will help to mitigate this.
Top 5 Downgrades:
-
Jefferies downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $205.16, down from $205.82. Better demand for iPhone 17, likely driven by no price hike in the Pro and Pro Max models and ""an effective price cut"" on the 17 base model, is already in the price, which has led to ""excessive expectations"" on the replacement cycle and prospects of the 18 Fold, the firm tells investors.
-
Piper Sandler downgraded Instacart (CART) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $41, down from $62. The firm cites the company's rising competitive pressures from Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), Uber (UBER) and DoorDash (DASH) for the downgrade.
-
Wolfe Research downgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Peer Perform from Outperform with a fair value range of $70-$80. The firm believes the shares will be range-bound with investors requiring further proof of branded execution before getting more constructive.
-
KeyBanc downgraded Corteva (CTVA) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target after the company announced its intent to separate into two public companies.

The firm said that “better demand for 17 [iPhone] is likely driven by no price hike in P/PM and an effective price cut for the base, not due to new form factor or tech innovations.”
Jefferies noted that iPhone 17 PM resale prices remain “at a premium of 5% to 15% for all variants, vs only one variant trading at a premium last year.”
Stronger China demand is also attributed to “deeper price cut at the base model than outside China” and “highest trade-in value offered for iPhone 15/16 among major markets.”
However, Jefferies warned that “more positive sales momentum has inflated expectations on the replacement cycle and prospects of the 18 Fold.”
They added that the foldable device faces challenges, including price and market size: “We do not doubt AAPL will be able to make the most beautiful foldable phone in the market, but the question is the TAM of a US$2K phone.”
The note highlighted competitive pressure from Samsung, whose Galaxy Z Fold 7 display is “nearly crease-free, and its thickness (unfolded) at 4.2mm is even thinner than the 17 Air at 5.5mm,” with industry expectations of annual volumes “no more than 3m units.”
Jefferies concluded that Apple’s current valuation “prices in overly bullish iPhone outlook,” noting that even with a US$100 price hike for the iPhone 18, their discounted cash flow model “remains little changed at ~US$205, or US$800bn below the current market cap.”
They said this implies demand for foldable iPhones “100% above JEFe” forecasts, underpinning the downgrade.

Analyst Edison Lee cut his rating on the stock to underperform from hold, writing that the stock’s current valuation prices in an “overly bullish iPhone outlook.” Shares fell 0.9% on Friday.
The stock’s consensus recommendation — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — now stands at 3.93 out of five, making Apple the least-loved of the Magnificent Seven except for Tesla Inc. Even so, bearish ratings for the stock are relatively rare. Fewer than 7% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a sell-equivalent rating on the shares. Roughly 57% recommend buying, while that ratio is above 90% for Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Amazon.com Inc.
The stock has risen more than 20% off a low hit in early August, an advance that has returned it near record levels. Despite that advance, the stock is barely positive this year, while the Nasdaq 100 Index has risen more than 15%.
Much of the recent strength has come on stronger-than-expected demand for the company’s latest iPhone, as well as optimism over an upcoming foldable model.
Lee wrote that “better demand for iPhone 17, partly due to a price cut on the base model, is already in the price,” and this “has led to excessive expectations on 18 Fold, and the replacement cycle.”
He added that it was unclear what market there would be for a phone that costs around $2,000, and trimmed his price target to $205.16 from $205.82. The stock last closed at $257.13, meaning the new target points to downside of more than 20%.

Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e31d28bf71603f255f15b351732e5467f3425de5bb77ed6b0c700354aa6699ab,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-apple-inc-130003605.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-apple-inc-130003605.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-apple-inc-130003605.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +7.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 12% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.9%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.36 points to a change of +9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.89 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple."

Over the past month, Apple’s share price climbed 11.9%, which is a solid gain even for a tech superstar. While the weekly change is flat at 0.1%, the longer-term picture is impressive, with a 14.5% return over the last year and a hefty 129.9% return across five years. Clearly, there is a reason why Apple so often finds itself in the investing spotlight.
What's driving all of this, besides the typical Apple buzz? Recent headlines suggest major shifts in the tech landscape, from Apple redirecting resources to develop cutting-edge smart glasses designed to compete with Meta, to the broader rivalry shaping up around AI and hardware capabilities. News around regulatory pressure and lawsuits, while part of the tech world’s backdrop, hasn’t shaken investor optimism in a noticeable way just yet.
But before getting swept up by the headlines or past performance, it is smart to ask whether Apple’s current share price offers real value. According to our valuation checks, Apple comes in with a value score of 1 out of 6, indicating it only meets one of the usual criteria for being undervalued. In the next section, we will break down these different valuation approaches, and later, share a perspective on valuing Apple that goes beyond all the traditional models.
Apple scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: Apple Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a valuation method that estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to the present day. Essentially, it asks how much all the future cash that Apple is expected to generate is worth in today's dollars.
For Apple, current Free Cash Flow over the last twelve months stands at $97.1 Billion. Analyst forecasts suggest robust growth in coming years, with projected Free Cash Flow reaching $195.5 Billion by 2030. While analyst estimates are available for the first five years, cash flows beyond that are extrapolated based on recent trends and growth assumptions.
Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, Apple’s DCF calculation arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of $233.22 per share. When compared to Apple’s current share price, the DCF implies the stock is about 10.3% overvalued."

The health and fitness industry has evolved from a niche pursuit to a global growth engine, fueled by a stronger cultural focus on healthier living. Consumers today want more than occasional workouts; they seek balanced nutrition, structured fitness routines, and comprehensive wellness solutions. Demand for gyms, supplements, and tailored programs continues to expand, while technology has made personal health management more accessible. Wearables, mobile apps, and online coaching provide real-time data, customized guidance, and ongoing motivation. Rising awareness of obesity, chronic illness, and mental well-being has only accelerated this movement toward proactive self-care.
Technology giants are playing a critical role in this evolution. Apple (AAPL), through the Apple Watch and its Fitness+ platform, blends health tracking with guided training experiences. Amazon (AMZN) is pushing deeper into healthcare with One Medical, combining artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools with virtual care to make health management more convenient. These innovations are transforming how people approach wellness, merging fitness, healthcare, and daily life in ways that amplify industry growth.
The scale of opportunity is underscored by numbers. The global health and wellness market is expected to reach $11 trillion by 2034, advancing at a 5.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2025. Preventive care initiatives, workplace wellness programs, and supportive government policies continue to reinforce this trend. At the same time, specialized offerings such as boutique studios and premium clubs highlight a more integrated view of physical, nutritional and mental health. This is opening new revenue channels for innovators like United Natural Foods (UNFI), American Well Corporation (AMWL), SunOpta (STKL) and Peloton Interactive (PTON).
For investors, the message is straightforward: wellness is here to stay. As consumers continue to prioritize their health, demand for fitness, nutrition, and digital health solutions should remain robust. Our Health & Fitness Screen is designed to highlight leading stocks in this space — including the four above — helping identify opportunities in a market set for sustained expansion.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is rethinking its mixed-reality playbook. Instead of pushing ahead with a cheaper follow-up to its $3,499 Vision Pro headset, the company is now putting its energy into developing AI-powered smart glasses, Bloomberg reported.
The project has Apple engineers working on at least two versions. One pair would link directly to an iPhone and skip having its own display that version could be ready as soon as 2026. The other would include a built-in display, similar to the new Meta (NASDAQ:META) Ray-Ban glasses that just hit shelves.
Apple wants its glasses to be lighter, cheaper, and more approachable than Vision Pro. They'll lean heavily on voice commands, powered by an upgraded Siri expected to roll out next year. The goal is to make the glasses feel natural to use and easier on the wallet compared to Vision Pro's steep entry price.
Meta has already set the tone with its $799 Ray-Ban smart glasses, showing off how AI can be woven into everyday wear. Apple's pivot suggests it's ready to make this the next battleground in consumer tech.
It's important to note that Apple posted diluted EPS of $1.57 in Q3 and $6.59 TTM, averaging EPS expansion at 15.9% annually over the past decade."

Stocks are rising to new highs largely on the back of continued AI fervour, with OpenAI's valuation climbing to $500bn (£371bn), making the company the most valuable startup in the world.
New AI deals also boosted optimism as Hitachi LTD (6501.T) teamed up with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) on energy projects, and Fujitsu (6501.T) expanded work with Nvidia (NVDA).
Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) and European stocks were mixed as oil prices remained on track for their steepest weekly drop in three-and-a-half months.
Brent crude (BZ=F) the international benchmark, has fallen 8% so far this week, down from $70.13 per barrel last Friday night to $64.58 per barrel today, and on Thursday hit its lowest level since 2 June. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded near $61.

Analysts expect the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) to keep increasing oil output which has pushed down energy prices in the last few days. The group are set to meet on Sunday to decide on output for November, and could hike output further despite concerns that the oil market is already oversupplied.
However oil prices rose on Friday on the back of a fire breaking out at Chevron’s (CVX) El Segundo refinery in Los Angeles.
The refinery is one of the largest on the US West Coast; according to a county official, the flames had been confined to one area.
OPEC raised production by 400,000 barrels a day in September, formally unwinding output cuts made by the group and its allies in 2023, according to a Bloomberg survey. Saudi Arabia increased supply exactly in line with its OPEC+ quota for the month.
It comes as investors remain optimistic despite the continued US government shutdown and persistent warnings that market valuations have risen too high, Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: ""Valuations are high, and some investors wonder whether this is another tech bubble. But a bubble – by definition – isn’t a bubble until it bursts.
""That leaves global investors with an unbearable FOMO – fear of missing out on a further rally – which keeps valuations elevated. Prospects of multiple Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts in the coming months also help support risk assets.""

US service sector growth slows
US services sector growth slowed last month, according to a report from data firm S&P Global.
Its latest US services PMI report shows that business activity expanded again last month, but at a weaker pace, while Trump's tariffs continued to drive operating expenses higher.
This pulled the S&P Global US services PMI business activity index down to 54.2 in September, down from 54.5 in August.

Best savings account deals with inflation-beating rates
UK households are always looking for ways to make their money go further amid the cost of living crisis, and savings accounts can help.
The Bank of England (BoE) opted to hold interest rates steady at 4% in September, dampening hopes for further monetary easing this year and dealing a blow to mortgage holders and borrowers across the UK. However, this is good news for savers, as most deals will remain untouched.
Still, sticky inflation is squashing savers’ real returns on their pots of cash, making it essential for people to shop around.
The rate of inflation as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) was 3.8% in August, the same as in July, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.
Experts urge savers to shop around for the best deals and review their accounts regularly, as many may still be sitting on products that fail to beat inflation.
Data released by the BoE this week found that deposits into banks and building societies rose by £5.4bn in August.
The central bank said that this was mainly driven by households putting an an additional £2.6bn into interest-bearing sight deposit accounts, £2.3bn into individual savings accounts (ISAs) and £700m into non-interest bearing accounts. This was offset by savers withdrawing £1.9bn from fixed rate accounts.

September jobs report delayed amid government shutdown
Typically, around this time, we would turn to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment report to assess how many jobs the US added in September. Economists polled by FactSet expected the US to have added around 50,000 jobs during the month and for the unemployment rate to have held steady at 4.3%.
But with the government closed for the third day, that hotly anticipated data is delayed, leaving investors and economists to piece together a picture of a softening labor market with data from job openings, private payrolls, and other indicators.
As my colleagues Emma Ockerman and Kerry Hannon note, the longer the shutdown stretches on, the bigger a deal it will be for those awaiting the data:

Gold (GC=F) prices looked set to finish the week near all-time highs as investors continued to pile into safe-haven assets amid uncertainty about how long the US government will be locked down for.
Gold futures looked set to end the week nearly 3% higher, rising 0.5% on Friday to $3,888 per troy ounce. Gold spot prices also gained 0.5% in the session, to trade at $3,864.
The uptick puts the yellow metal on course for a seventh weekly gain.
Haven assets have become more attractive amid the US government shutdown, in part because it means the Friday payroll report has been delayed, meaning Wall Street has less visibility on the health of the US economy.
Goldman Sachs said earlier this week that upside risks to a forecast analysts made for gold to hit $4,000 by mid-2026 have grown. Both speculative positioning and an increase in gold exchange-traded funds (ETF) demand have increased the chances of more price rises.

'Bank loyalty is a recipe for disaster'
Financial experts have urged savers to make an easy step to earn £120 as they warn “bank loyalty is a recipe for disaster”.
Falling bond rates and sticky inflation mean savers who stay loyal risk missing out on the most competitive returns, Moneyfactscompare.co.uk has revealed.
Last year, the average savings rate was 3.75% while the top rate paid closer to 5%, meaning savers could have missed out on £120, Moneyfacts said.
Moneyfacts survey data shows that one in four people are missing out on real returns because they have never switched savings accounts.
Caitlyn Eastell, spokesperson at Moneyfactscompare.co.uk, said:
Meanwhiel, Antonia Medlicott, founder and managing director at Stonehouse-based Investing Insiders, urged savers to change banks and said you may need to look further afield for the best deals.

Princes Group plots London listing
Food and drink company Princes Group has announced that it is considering listing on the main market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), in a boost to the UK market.
The firm, whose products include Princes tuna, as well as the Napolina, Branston and Flora brands, said on Friday that any initial public offering (IPO) would be comprised of new ordinary shares to raise funds that would support further growth via additional acquistions.
Princes Group, which is owned by Italian food group Newlat, is seeking a valuation of around £1.5bn ($2bn), according to a Reuters report. A spokesperson for Princes Group had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.
Simon Harrison, CEO of Princes Group, said that a listing on the LSE is a ""natural next step"" for the company.
""Beyond providing access to capital to execute our M&A [merger and acquisition] ambitions, it will provide a platform to accelerate growth by expanding our product portfolio and expertise, extending our international reach, and attracting top talent as we continue building for the future,"" he said.
Princes Group generated revenue of £2.1bn in its last fiscal year and £964m in the first half of this year. Net profit came in at £9.2m for 2024 and £30.5m for the first half of this year.
Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that Princes' products are ""mainstays of a weekly grocery shop when consumers are feeling flush"" but are at risk of being swapped for supermarket own-brand items by shoppers when times are harder.
He suggested that further potential tax tweaks in the autumn budget could knock consumer confidence levels and lead shoppers to curb spending.

Why Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade could be its most important yet
Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world’s second-largest blockchain, is on the cusp of a transformative upgrade. Dubbed Fusaka, it is set to undergo two testnet phases this month, with a potential launch on the Ethereum mainnet scheduled for the end of November.
For investors, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts alike, the upgrade promises not only immediate improvements but also a bold vision for Ethereum’s next decade.
To understand the impact of Fusaka, Yahoo Finance UK spoke with Dankrad Feist, co-lead of the protocol architecture team at the Ethereum Foundation, who described the upgrade as a culmination of years of research into scaling Ethereum.
At its heart, Fusaka is all about making Ethereum faster and cheaper to use. It does this by improving how data is handled, which helps ""rollups"" — secondary chains like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism — work more efficiently. These rollups run on top of Ethereum and let users enjoy the same features but at a much lower cost.
""The main thing Fusaka does is it provides much more space for rollups… they will have much more ability to scale based on this, like they can provide a lot more capacity to the users. Correspondingly, the transaction costs will go down. So this is a really exciting one, and it will hopefully bring great benefits to Ethereum users,"" Feist said.
In practical terms, this means Ethereum (ETH-USD) could handle more transactions per second while reducing fees, which would be key improvements for both developers and everyday users.

OBR hands Rachel Reeves first report on UK economy
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has handed chancellor Rachel Reeves its first evaluation of the state of the UK economy ahead of the November budget.
The OBR’s Budget Responsibility Committee, which consists of the economists Richard Hughes, David Miles and Tom Josephs, are expected to warn the chancellor that the UK’s outlook is significantly worse than assumed in March, setting policy discussions about likely £30bn tax rises and possible savings in motion.
Its downgrades for productivity and revisions on calculations for supply-side effects of policy are expected to contribute to a £30bn hole in public finances.
Higher debt interest payments, due to 30-year gilt yields rising by over 40 basis points since the last Autumn Budget, and U-turns on welfare savings made at the spring statement are also likely to add to costs.
The OBR said in a report in July that it had overestimated growth forecasts by 0.7 percentage points over a five-year horizon and underestimated borrowing by as much as 3.1 per cent of GDP.
It added that turbulence in the global economy in the last few years had added greater uncertainty to its forecasts but the signs suggest the OBR will take a harsher view of the future of UK growth.

Tesla tumbled last night despite Q3 delivery numbers
Tesla (TSLA) stock tumbled, even after it reported blowout third quarter global deliveries, as the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US likely juiced sales.
Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company.
Tesla (TSLA) stock but fell over 5% in Thursday trading, but looked set to recover slightly when markets open later on, trading up 1.4% in premarket.
Competitor Rivian (RIVN) on Thursday issued a dour forecast that cast a spotlight on the electric vehicle (EV) industry's gloom, as it looks to a world without the federal credit.
Tesla (TSLA) also said global production came in at 447,450. The company deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products.
Tesla's huge Q3 follows similarly strong EV sales results from GM (GM), Ford (F), and Rivian. Buyers likely pulled forward EV sales after the Republican-led US government phased out the federal $7,500 (£5,570) EV tax credit.

UK business activity growth falls to five-month low
UK service sector growth has hit a five-month low thanks to budget uncertainty and weak overseas demand.
Services companies reported that activity only rose marginally in September amid “sluggish demand conditions,"" with weak sales pipelines and pressure on margins from sharply rising staff costs” leading to job cuts.
This pulled the S&P Global UK Services PMI Business Activity Index down sharply to just 50.8 in September, from August’s 16-month high of 54.2.
This was weaker than the ‘flash estimate’ of 51.9, which suggests growth weakened towards the end of September.

Japan faces Asahi beer shortage after cyber-attack
Japan is facing a shortage of Asahi products, including beer and bottled tea, as it battles with the impact of a major cyber-attack.
Most of the Asahi Group's factories in Japan have been at a standstill since Monday, after its ordering and delivering systems were hit.
Major Japanese retailers, including 7-Eleven and FamilyMart, have now warned customers to expect shortages of Asahi products.
Asahi has temporarily suspended orders and shipments of its products with ""no prospect of resumption"", FamilyMart said in a statement on Thursday.
""We sincerely apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused,"" said FamilyMart, adding that it is working with Asahi to resume the sale of the products.
Asahi is the largest brewer in Japan and also owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. Japan accounts for around half of its total sales.

Wetherspoon’s boss vows to keep price rises to a minimum
Tim Martin, the boss of pub chain Wetherspoon’s has promised to keep price increases to a “minimum”, after blaming a packaging tax and rising energy bills for extra costs.
He said the “extended producer responsibility” levy on packaging will lead to increased costs from £800,000 to £2.4m a year.
Martin also criticised the impact of “non-commodity” energy costs – taxes or levies added to the pub chain’s bills for the electricity it uses – which he said will add £7m a year from this month.
He added that the “non-commodity” costs would account for 62% of Wetherspoon’s overall electricity costs.
Martin reiterated that Wetherspoons has already been hit by a £60m annual cost increase due to increases in employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) and the minimum wage.

Consumer confidence in UK economy falls to lowest point this year
Consumer confidence in the UK economy fell during the last quarter to its lowest point so far this year, according to a survey.
KPMG’s latest Consumer Pulse survey of 3,000 UK consumers saw the number of people feeling that the economy is worsening increase from 51% to 62% in the last three months – up from 43% since 2025 began.
The majority of consumers (58%) continue to feel financially secure, with no change since the last quarter.
However, because of a perception that the UK economy is worsening, consumers say they are reducing or deferring spending, the survey found.
Of those who agreed that the UK economy was worsening, 56% said they were cutting spending on everyday items, up from 51% last quarter.
The cost of groceries was the most common reason to feel that the economy was worsening, at 81%, up from 79% last quarter, followed by the cost of utilities, at 77%, up from 74% last quarter.

Fuel prices creep higher despite oil slipping
The RAC has revealed that petrol and diesel prices rose by around a penny a litre during September, even though crude prices remained muted during the month.
RAC Fuel Watch data shows that the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol went up from 134.64p to 135.41p (+0.77p) while diesel increased from 142.19p to 143.14p (+0.95p).
Although fuel prices have risen in eight of the past 12 months they are still below the highs seen in late February, when petrol hit a 12-month peak of 139.65p per litre.
RAC head of policy Simon Williams argues that price increases are unjustifiable:

Oil remains on track for biggest weekly fall since June
Oil prices remained on track for their steepest weekly drop in three and a half months.
Brent crude (BZ=F) the international benchmark, has fallen 8% so far this week, down from $70.13 per barrel last Friday night to $64.58 per barrel today, and yesterday hit its lowest level since 2 June. West Texas Intermediate traded near $61.
Analysts expect Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) to keep increasing oil output which has pushed down energy prices in the last few days. The group are set to meet on Sunday to decide on output for November, and could hike output further despite concerns that the oil market is already oversupplied.
However oil prices have risen today on the back of a fire breaking out at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery in Los Angeles.
The refinery is one of the largest on the US West Coast; according to a county official, the flames had been confined to one area.
OPEC raised production by 400,000 barrels a day in September, formally unwinding output cuts made by the group and its allies in 2023, according to a Bloomberg survey. Saudi Arabia increased supply exactly in line with its OPEC+ quota for the month.

UK's cheapest supermarket in September revealed
Consumers are eager to seek out the best deals on their weekly shop as prices continue to rise and the latest analysis from Which? found that Aldi was the cheapest UK supermarket in September.
The consumer group's monthly price analysis compares the average price of a shop consisting of popular groceries at eight of the UK’s biggest supermarkets.
A shopping list of 71 items in September cost £122.88 on average at Aldi.
Which? retail editor Reena Sewraz said that this shows Aldi ""continues to represent great value without the need for two-tiered pricing"".
Lidl was found to be the second cheapest supermarket, with this basket of groceries costing an average £123.95. Which? pointed out given none of the items included in its analysis were cheaper for Lidl Plus customers, there is just one Lidl price this month.
The same list of 71 items would have cost Tesco (TSCO.L) shoppers an average £135.64 with a Clubcard and £138.66 without one. For those using a Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L) Nectar card, September’s shopping list of items averaged £138.74. Without a Nectar card, the same items at Sainsbury’s cost £142.70.
For a longer shopping list of 186 items, Asda was found to be the cheapest supermarket in September, with this basket of groceries costing an average £465.66. Which?'s analysis showed that this was cheaper than Tesco (TSCO.L) (with a Clubcard) by £6.79.
Which? said that Aldi and Lidl were not included in this comparison as they have a smaller range of products compared to the other supermarkets.
Waitrose was found to be the most expensive supermarket for both a shop of 71 items and 186 items, costing an average £167.19 and £531.39, respectively.
The analysis included special offer and loyalty prices where applicable, but not multibuys.

Asia and US overnight
Stocks in Asia were higher overnight with the Nikkei (^N225) rising 1.9% on the day in Japan, nearing recent peaks, after a surprisingly dovish speech by Bank of Japan governor Ueda and ahead of a crucial ruling party vote that would determine the next prime minister of the country.
Ueda reaffirmed the bank's longstanding position on interest rates, thus avoiding signalling any policy changes for this month following recent market speculation about an imminent rate hike. Market pricing has dipped to 59% for an October hike down from 65%. The Yen has weakened around a third of a percent.
Staying with Japan, the jobless rate increased to 2.6%, its highest level in over a year in August, from 2.3% the previous month, and against expectations of 2.4%. Additional data revealed that the job-to-applicant ratio decreased to 1.20 from 1.22, marking the lowest number of job openings since 2022.
Meanwhile the Hang Seng (^HSI) fell 0.7% in Hong Kong, impacted by losses in EV stocks following a decline in Tesla overnight.
Trading volumes are subdued due to market holidays in China and South Korea, with Chinese markets remaining closed until the middle of next week.
Across the pond on Wall Street, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) crept 0.06% higher, able to shrug off shutdown jitters to creep to yet another record high. Things had looked even more promising at the open, before faltering following the employment data.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 0.4% higher, managing to reach a new record, even as the Mag-7 underperformed at (+0.08%), and the Dow Jones (^DJI) also gained 0.2%.

That's according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which said non-food items helped drive September's rate of shop price inflation higher. However, food inflation of 4.2% was unchanged year-on-year and was above the three-month average of 4.1%.
In addition, the BRC warned last week that food inflation would rise further and remain above 5% well into 2026 if the retail sector faces additional tax hikes in the upcoming autumn budget.
Persistent inflation is adding to pressures that consumers have faced since the cost of living crisis emerged a few years ago, squeezing household budgets and prompting people to shop around for the best value prices."

With its name playfully derived from ""Just Another Management Framework,"" Jamf (NASDAQ:JAMF) provides software that helps organizations deploy, manage, and secure Apple devices across their workforce while maintaining a seamless user experience.
Why Are We Cautious About JAMF?
-
Underwhelming ARR growth of 11.1% over the last year suggests the company faced challenges in acquiring and retaining long-term customers
-
Estimated sales growth of 10.3% for the next 12 months implies demand will slow from its two-year trend

Pioneering the concept of ""digital twins"" for infrastructure projects long before it became an industry buzzword, Bentley Systems (NASDAQ:BSY) provides software solutions that help engineers design, build, and operate infrastructure projects across sectors including roads, bridges, utilities, mining, and industrial facilities.
Why Do We Think Twice About BSY?
-
Customers had second thoughts about committing to its platform over the last year as its average billings growth of 11.3% underwhelmed
-
Demand will likely be soft over the next 12 months as Wall Street’s estimates imply tepid growth of 9.9%
-
Operating profits increased over the last year as the company gained some leverage on its fixed costs and became more efficient

Welcome to Episode #459 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.
Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.
This week, Tracey is going solo to talk about three top big cap stocks that are not in the Magnificent 7. There are many other great companies that are growing their earnings. Look beyond the old technology standbys like Apple and Meta Platforms.
These three companies could even be described as “old economy” as they represent the construction, manufacturing, railroad and retail industries, among others.
Diversify your portfolio away from just seven companies. There are other great companies that deserve a look.
3 Top Stocks That Aren’t the Magnificent 7
1. Fastenal Company (FAST)
Fastenal is a distributor of industrial and construction supplies. Shares of Fastenal are trading near their all-time highs, up 37% over the last year.
It isn’t cheap. Fastenal trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 44. A P/E over 30 is often considered expensive. But Fastenal also has growth. Earnings are expected to be up 11% in 2025 and another 10.8% in 2026.
Should Fastenal be on your short list?
2. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B)
Berkshire Hathaway is the conglomerate of old economy companies, including BNSF Railway and Geico insurance. It is led by 95-year-old Warren Buffett. Buffett is retiring from the CEO position at the end of this year.
Shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up just 9% over the last year due to uncertainty now that Buffett is retiring. Shares trade with a forward P/E of 24.8. That’s expensive on a historical basis for Berkshire.
Earnings are expected to fall 7.7% in 2025 but gain 2.2% in 2026.
Should Berkshire Hathaway, one of the trillion-dollar companies, be on your short list?
3. Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)
Costco is a warehouse retailer with stores in North America, Europe and Asia. Costco has been one of the top performing stocks over the last 5 years, gaining 161% compared to just 100% in the S&P 500.
It is not cheap. Costco trades with a forward P/E of 46.6. But the analysts are bullish. Earnings are expected to jump 10.3% in fiscal 2026 and 10.1% in fiscal 2027.
Should Costco be on your short list?

Broadcom has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, carving out a strategic niche in the rapidly evolving chip market.
While competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offer off-the-shelf, high-performance GPUs, Broadcom focuses on designing custom AI chips for its hyperscale customers, the tech giants that own and operate the world’s largest data centers.

This approach allows companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to tailor silicon to their exact needs, offering a compelling, often less expensive, alternative to the pricier, general-purpose Nvidia chips.
By helping these key players design their proprietary AI accelerators, Broadcom solidifies its foundational role in the sector, ensuring its technology is deeply integrated into the core infrastructure of the AI revolution.
KeyBanc Capital Markets reinforced this outlook by reiterating its Overweight rating on Broadcom and raising its price forecast to $420 from $400, citing the company’s foundational position in AI and the broader semiconductor supply chain.
Following recent channel checks, analyst John Vinh said that the supply chains of Nvidia and Broadcom “sound the best,” as upward revisions are coming to chip-on-a-wafer-substrate (CoWoS) supply.
Broadcom’s trajectory as a core AI beneficiary is evident in its expanded targets. Its 2026 CoWoS supply goal has climbed to 190,000 units, reflecting an anticipated year-over-year increase exceeding 160%, Vinh noted.
A critical factor in its AI dominance remains control over Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPU franchise through 2026, with volumes expected to more than double.
Additionally, Broadcom has secured significant new AI ASIC orders, including 400,000-500,000 units for OpenAI and roughly 100,000 units for Apple, reinforcing its influence over AI development and production.
Analyst John Vinh raised the price forecast to $420 based on $10.37 fiscal 2026 consolidated earnings per share (EPS).
Price Action: AVGO stock was trading higher by 2.31% to $341.10 at last check Thursday.

Oct 2 - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is changing course on its mixed-reality strategy, choosing to prioritize smart glasses powered by artificial intelligence over a major reboot of its Vision Pro headset, according to Bloomberg. The company has reassigned staff who were working on a lighter, more affordable Vision Pro toward smart glasses development, aiming to compete directly with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).
Engineers are developing two versions of the glasses. One will connect to an iPhone and operate without its own display, with a potential release as early as 2026. A second version would include a built-in display, similar to the recently launched Meta Ray-Ban Display. At the same time, Apple still intends to refresh its Vision Pro with a faster processor and a modest redesign by the end of this year. FCC testing records suggest the updated headset is already in the pipeline.
The smart glasses are expected to rely on voice commands, AI features, and an upgraded Siri projected for release in March. Importantly, they are set to carry a lower price tag compared with the Vision Pro, which launched at $3,499. Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses, priced from $799, hit the market last week, signaling intensifying competition in wearable AI technology.
Is Apple Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 43 analysts, the average target price for Apple Inc is $248.00 with a high estimate of $310.00 and a low estimate of $175.00. The average target implies a downside of -2.92% from the current price of $255.45.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Apple Inc in one year is $225.34, suggesting a downside of -11.79% from the current price of $255.45. Gf value is Gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-02T15:25:06,What Does Meta’s $14.2B CoreWeave Deal Mean for the Stock’s Value in 2025?,"If you have been watching Meta Platforms' stock lately, you are not alone in wondering if now is the time to buy, hold, or cash in. The company has served up some dramatic price swings, and the only thing that has grown faster than Meta’s share price over the last three years—an eye-popping 419% climb—is the debate around what it’s actually worth right now.

The company has served up some dramatic price swings, and the only thing that has grown faster than Meta’s share price over the last three years—an eye-popping 419% climb—is the debate around what it’s actually worth right now.
Of course, recent weeks have been a bit bumpier. In the past month, Meta’s stock dipped by 2.4%, and it is down 4.2% over the last week. Some of that may be nerves around heightened regulatory and legal risks, especially after a U.S. judge let lawsuits proceed over Meta’s connection to gambling apps. Meanwhile, there’s also excitement: Meta just inked a deal with CoreWeave for up to $14.2 billion in computing power and is reportedly acquiring chips startup Rivos to advance its AI strategy. Combine that with fresh competition as Apple shifts its focus to smart glasses, and you have a cocktail of innovation and risk reshaping the narrative.
With all these factors swirling, Meta still boasts a value score of 5 out of 6, meaning it is considered undervalued across five key metrics. But how meaningful is that score for people weighing their next move? Let’s break down the main methods investors use to assess whether Meta is truly undervalued, and, as a final thought, we will wrap up with a perspective on valuation that even veteran investors sometimes overlook.
Why Meta Platforms is lagging behind its peers
Approach 1: Meta Platforms Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's value by forecasting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to today’s dollars. For Meta Platforms, this involves starting with its latest free cash flow and projecting how that might grow over time, accounting for both analyst estimates and broader market assumptions.
Currently, Meta’s free cash flow stands at an impressive $57.63 billion. Analyst projections, along with further extrapolation for additional years, anticipate that this figure could rise to $108.58 billion by 2029. Simply Wall St extends forecasts even further, with free cash flow expected to surpass $199.94 billion by 2035. Most of these projections use a two-stage model that balances rapid near-term growth with more gradual gains in later years.
Based on these projections, the estimated intrinsic value per share for Meta is $1,084.17. This figure is notably higher than its current share price, implying a substantial discount of 33.8%. In plain terms, the DCF suggests Meta’s shares are significantly undervalued right now."

Semafor reported that Intel was in “early talks” with AMD, but Bernstein highlighted the lack of detail, noting it was “unclear how much of [AMD’s] manufacturing would shift to Intel if the two companies reach a deal, or whether it would come with a direct investment.”
Bernstein said the report was the latest in a string of speculative headlines around Intel.
“The ‘save Intel’ news has flowed quick and easy over the last several weeks, starting with the government’s acquisition of a sizeable stake in return for providing the company’s previously-promised $8.9B in CHIPS act money, Softbank’s $2B investment, a new NVIDIA partnership involving both a product arrangement as well as $5B equity stake, and more recently talk of the company approaching both Apple as well as TSMC (though the latter dismissed such talk over the weekend),” wrote the firm.
Bernstein added: “Frankly, we wouldn’t be surprised to hear more of these (especially of the speculative nature).”
On the Intel-AMD rumor, the analysts wrote: “We remain somewhat skeptical... hopes for a foundry deal (from anyone) seem very premature to us though, and not just because Intel and AMD remain locked in a competitive product battle that the latter is clearly winning at the moment.”
They noted Intel has yet to deliver its 18A process internally, with the external 18AP version “still quite some time away” and 14A “years longer than that.”
While not ruling out limited collaboration in packaging or lagging-edge products, Bernstein said a leading-edge deal was “probably not in the cards at this point.”
Bernstein continues to rate both Intel and AMD Market Perform, adding: “We suspect more volatility remains in store for the shares; we remain on the sideline.”

Long derided as a phony form of crypto, the idea has gained new life as everyone from Stripe to Circle is building their own chains. On the latest episode of the Crypto Playbook vodcast (available on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube), Coinbase’s Jesse Pollak—who is the driving force behind the company’s Base blockchain—made the case why they will catch on.
To understand why Pollak’s project is a fraught one, it’s helpful to go back to 2015 when, in the depths of a crypto winter, some began rallying around the phrase “blockchain not Bitcoin.” The idea, popularized by an emerging corporate faction of the crypto industry, held that it was best to leave blockchain technology to banks, IBM, and other established players.
The plan proved a miserable failure. Bank-backed blockchain projects like R3 raised large sums of money, but failed to take off, as critics—correctly for the most part—dismissed them as glorified databases that would give preferential treatment to whoever owned them. As it turned out, Bitcoin-style decentralization mattered a lot.
Pollak says that this era of corporate blockchains, or at least Base, is different. He has a point in that Pollak is a true crypto native, not a blow-in from the corporate sector, and that design choices for the Base chain reflect a decentralized ethos.
“We don’t want to re-create the old systems with new tech. From day one, we’ve focused on decentralization. Not just talk—we’ve taken real steps. First, we built Base as an Ethereum L2, not an isolated chain. Second, we built on the OP Stack, an open standard. Third, we moved from stage 0 to stage 1 decentralization earlier this year in collaboration with Optimism and others,” he said, describing technical aspects of Base.
Pollak stressed that Base’s code is open-source and that the chain aspires to be a Linux-style ecosystem used by many different crypto builders. He said that it is a big reason Coinbase plans to launch a token on Base—as a way to align incentives and token decentralization.
Coinbase began floating the idea of a token last month, and if it goes forward, it will attract significant interest from both builders and speculators. So how and when will the Base token arrive?
Pollak was careful in his answer, saying that Coinbase is determined not to rush the token deployment, and that it is not planning to announce a release date anytime soon.
He did, though, acknowledge that token launches have a troubled history, and that they have often served to enrich their backers at the expense of the broader community tied to the blockchain. In response, Pollak said Coinbase is treading carefully, while also working with projects on Base that have issued tokens of their own in a responsible fashion—including one called Aerodrome that had a “fully fair launch.”"

Apple (AAPL, Financials) has suspended development of a lower-cost version of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset to prioritize smart glasses, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company had been preparing a lighter, less expensive model, code-named N100, for release in 2027. Employees were told last week that resources will instead be shifted toward accelerating work on glasses that could rival devices from Meta Platforms.
Apple is reportedly developing two versions of the glasses. The first, known as N50, would connect to an iPhone without a built-in display. The model could be unveiled as early as next year ahead of a commercial release in 2027. A second version with its own display is targeted for 2028, but development timelines are being pushed forward.
The $3,499 Vision Pro launched in February 2024 but has struggled with limited mainstream content and competition from cheaper headsets such as Meta's Quest. Meta in September unveiled new smart glasses under its Ray-Ban and Oakley brands, with prices starting at $800.
Apple's smart glasses will lean on voice controls and artificial intelligence integration, according to the report. The company declined to comment.
Investors will be watching whether Apple's push into AI-enabled wearables helps close the gap with Google and Meta, both of which are rolling out consumer-ready products."

After testing Meta’s new Ray-Ban Display glasses in a New York City demo, the brokerage said the experience highlighted “the key challenges that have prevented smart glasses from mass consumer adoption since Google Glass (2013).”
In particular, Oppenheimer said Meta’s single-eye display “fails to tackle well-known issues that cause eye strain and blurry vision.”
The analysts added that while the Ray-Ban Display introduces novel designs, it is “too early to view [it] as an everyday wearable such as Apple Watch, let alone a potential challenger to smartphones.”
Oppenheimer concluded: “We came away from the demo more confident that Apple’s hardware ecosystem is safe from new AI-enabled smart glasses for the next 2-3 years. It also gives Apple more runway to fine-tune its own smart glasses products.”
The report cited several barriers to adoption, including conflicts with human vision that “result in significant eye strain and blur after staring at the display for more than seconds.”
Oppenheimer said the Ray-Ban Display is best suited for brief glances, not “delivering denser information such as longer text or video.”
The firm also warned of “feature creep,” as Meta AI functions push the glasses to deliver more information than human vision comfortably allows.
While the demo showed early consumer interest, with stock selling out on launch day at the store visited, Oppenheimer’s verdict was clear: “We came away convinced that Ray-Ban Display will remain a niche product.”

“The iPhone 17 cycle is modestly stronger than we originally expected,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, adding that while “the market has already priced this in,” there remains “a positive bias to T12M estimates, and the early drivers of iPhone 17 strength get us more excited about the iPhone 18 cycle.”
The bank increased its fiscal 2026 iPhone revenue forecast by 4 percent, reflecting “3% higher units and 1% higher ASPs,” and said “a build increase is imminent, driven by demand strength from the iPhone 17 base, Pro and Pro Max models.”
Morgan Stanley noted that “the key driver of a stronger iPhone 17 cycle — an aged iPhone installed base in need of upgrades — combined with the first-ever Foldable iPhone and 6 total new iPhone launches next cycle … supports high-single digit Y/Y iPhone revenue growth extending into FY27, even before we make any assumptions around AI.”
On earnings, the analysts said: “As a result of these factors, we are raising our FY26 and FY27 EPS by 2% and 6%, respectively, and increasing our price target to $298, or 32x our new FY27 EPS of $9.30, 6% above Consensus.”
Morgan Stanley’s new bull case target is $376, a scenario that “embeds over 270m iPhone shipments and $10.16 of EPS, which is achievable if Foldables and AI catalyze even stronger demand.”

The world’s largest digital asset by market capitalisation rose by around 3.5% in the past 24 hours, briefly touching $119,455 (£88,516) before pulling back to now change hands for around $118,500. This marks bitcoin's (BTC-USD) strongest price since mid-August.

Other major tokens, including ethereum (ETH-USD), XRP (XRP-USD) and solana (SOL-USD), gained by 5.5%, 4% and 6% respectively over the past day.
The global cryptocurrency market cap today is $4.17tn, an increase of 4.0% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dominance is at 56.7% and ethereum (ETH-USD) dominance is now at 12.7%, showing that bitcoin is still the strongest asset in terms of investor appetite.
The rally coincided with the US government’s failure to reach a funding agreement, forcing agencies to close and furloughing roughly 750,000 workers at a daily cost of an estimated $400m.
The shutdown also halts the release of key economic data, including Friday’s closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, a development that could delay monetary policy signals and alter risk sentiment.

“The US shutdown injects a new variable, removing critical macro data and amplifying uncertainty,” said Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN. “Options markets already reflect this fragility, with traders hedging for drawdowns. At the same time, bitcoin (BTC-USD) options remain cheap relative to realized volatility.”
In other words, investors are paying for protection against a sharp drop in bitcoin (BTC-USD), but that insurance is still relatively inexpensive given how volatile the cryptocurrency has been. This points to a market that is on edge, preparing for turbulence, while also leaving room for traders to cheaply bet on big price swings.
Hard assets are now in focus
Gold (GC=F) has also been a major beneficiary of the mounting fiscal and political stress in the US. The precious metal closed September with a 12% monthly gain, its strongest rally since 2011, underscoring a broader investor shift into hard assets as Federal Reserve officials continue to warn that inflation remains “too high.”
This comes as New York Fed president John Williams reiterated that rate cuts remain contingent on incoming data, data that may now be delayed by the shutdown.

Chicago, IL – October 2, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT.
Is Apple Stock About to Break Out?
After stumbling out of the gate this year, sliding more than 30% in the first four months, Apple has staged an impressive comeback. Over the past three months, the stock has outpaced nearly every other tech giant, trailing only Alphabet.
Earlier in the year, skeptics pointed to Apple’s lackluster AI strategy and slower growth compared with rivals like Microsoft and Alphabet. But a strong Q3 report, highlighted by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales and record services revenue, has helped the company reclaim leadership. The latest iPhone launch has also fueled optimism, delivering meaningful upgrades across the product line, including the new iPhone Air.
At the same time, Apple is signaling a more deliberate approach to AI, committing $500 billion in US investments tied to artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and data centers. Additionally, rather than racing to build its own standalone AI model, Apple may be positioning itself as a strategic partner in the broader AI ecosystem and leveraging its strong position in eyeball real estate with mobile devices.
With strong momentum behind it, Apple now looks poised for a technical breakout that could carry shares to fresh record highs. Below, I’ll break down the trade setup.
Apple Stock Forms Bull Flag
In recent months, Apple’s price action has resembled that of a classic growth stock, climbing steadily higher. Over the past two weeks, shares have been consolidating into an increasingly tight bull flag, which typically signals an imminent breakout.
The key level to watch is $257. A decisive breakout and close above this resistance would confirm the bull flag and likely propel Apple to new record highs.
Today’s session briefly pushed above $257 before reversing back into the range, underscoring why it’s important to wait for a closing confirmation rather than intraday moves. On the downside, a close below support at $253.50 would suggest the stock needs more time to reset before attempting another leg higher.
Are Apple Shares Overvalued?
Concerns about Apple’s valuation are valid. The stock is trading at an elevated multiple while sales are expected to grow only in the mid–single digits. That said, Apple still commands an extraordinary position with over 1.5 billion iPhone users and a rapidly expanding services business. It’s also worth noting that nearly all Mega cap tech stocks are trading at premium valuations."

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) underperformed against its European peers on Thursday, while Wall Street advanced despite warnings that the US government gridlock could slow economic growth.
As the federal government enters day two of a shutdown, Treasury secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC's Squawk Box: ""This isn’t the way to have a discussion, shutting down the government and lowering the GDP. We could see a hit to the GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America.”
The US's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annualised rate of 3.8% in the third quarter, growing for the second straight quarter after growth contracted in the first quarter. But on Wednesday, US senators failed to advance a plan to fund the government after another round of votes.
Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul noted that the White House also appears poised to use the shutdown as an opportunity to expand president Donald Trump's powers to potentially fire government workers or cut programs.
Meanwhile, data from Eurostat, the EU’s statistical office, showed that the eurozone unemployment rate rose from 6.2% in July to 6.3% in August.

While the number of unemployed people was 11,000 higher than in July, it was 15,000 lower than in August last year, and 136,000 lower than in June.
Elsewhere, UK financial services activity steadied after a sharp fall. According to the latest CBI financial services survey, business volumes declined with a weighted balance of -36%, down from -24% in June.
Despite the deterioration in activity, sentiment was broadly flat, rising to +3 after a sharp fall of 52% in the previous quarter.
Firms expect conditions to improve next quarter, with volumes growth forecast at 37%. Profitability fell at a slower rate in the third quarter, coming in at -13% compared with -24% in June, however, it is expected to jump in Q4 (+26%).
Headcount slipped 24%, but firms see the pace of reduction slowing to -7%. The survey also revealed that firms plan to increase IT investment over the next year, with uncertainty about demand cited as the biggest factor limiting investment. The share of firms highlighting this rose to 69%, the highest since 2012.

When 'job hugging' is a good idea — and when it holds you back
With so many people looking for work and so few jobs available, workers are choosing to stay in their current roles for security and convenience. At face value, it makes sense. With so much competition, job hugging – staying in a job, even if you don’t love it – can be the best option.
According to data from more than 350,000 small businesses and 2 million employees across the UK, Australia and New Zealand by Employment Hero, 55% of employees are now prioritising security over ambition. Younger employees aged between 18 and 34 are more likely to cling onto the job they have, with 53% saying there is simply too much competition for roles.
However, some career experts argue that staying in a job for too long can lead to other problems, like career stagnation, skills degradation and disengagement.
So what are the pros of job hugging – and when should you think seriously about moving on?

Half of British adults gambled in last month
Almost half of adults (48%) in Great Britain have gambled in the last four weeks, according to an annual survey by the industry regulator.
Some 2.7% of adults scored “8+” on the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) in 2024 – up from 2.5% the previous year – which is “statistically stable” compared to the year before, the Gambling Commission found.
The headline figure of those who gambled over the last month – which is the same as the previous year – falls to 28% when those who had only bought tickets for a lottery draw were excluded.
Overall, some 42% of adults who gambled in the past 12 months rated the last time they gambled positively, compared to 21% who rated it negatively.
The chance of winning “big money” was the main reason why people gambled (85%), followed by finding gambling to be fun (72%).
Andrew Rhodes, chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said:

Manchester synagogue stabbing: Two killed in car and knife 'terror attack' and suspect believed dead
Two people have been killed in a suspected terror attack outside a synagogue in Greater Manchester by a man who was shot by police and is believed to be dead.
Greater Manchester Police said it was called to an incident at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on Middleton Road in Crumpsall, north Manchester, at 9.31am by a member of the public, who said he had witnessed a car being driven towards members of the public.
The suspected attacker was shot and is also believed to be deceased, but it cannot be confirmed due to safety issues surrounding ""suspicious"" items on his body. A bomb disposal unit has been called.
Footage shared on social media appeared to show members of the public shouting to firearms officers that the suspect had a bomb strapped to him.
The attack took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. Keir Starmer said he was “absolutely shocked” by the attack and “additional police assets are being deployed to synagogues across the country”.

OpenAI Valuation Soars to $500 Billion, Topping Musk’s SpaceX
OpenAI has completed a deal to help employees sell shares in the company at a $500bn valuation, propelling the ChatGPT owner past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup.
Bloomberg has the details:
Current and former OpenAI employees sold about $6.6bn of stock to investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T Rowe Price, a person familiar with the transaction said. That boosted the US company’s price tag well past its previous $300bn level during a SoftBank-led financing round earlier this year.
That rapid rise underscores the investment frenzy surrounding the leaders of a technology with the potential to transform industries and economies.
Sam Altman’s OpenAI is one of several companies including Nvidia Corp (NVDA) now leading a global push to build data centers and develop artificial intelligence services, an undertaking that’s expected to cost trillions of dollars.
Though it has yet to turn a profit, the US startup is helping fuel that infrastructure boom by inking mega-sized deals with the likes of Oracle Corp (ORCL) and SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS).

September sees highest number of homes listed this year
The latest internal data from eXp UK has shown that September has delivered a notable surge in market activity, with the firm recording an average of 81 new properties listed every day over the course of the month — the highest daily level seen across each month so far in 2025.
In fact, almost 2,431 homes were listed with eXp UK in September alone, marking a 19% increase versus the total seen in August.
This follows the usual seasonal decline seen during the summer months, with total instructions having fallen by 6% between July and August.
The daily average of 81 new listings marks a clear uplift not only on the quieter summer months, but also on every preceding month of the year, with the previous 2025 peak standing at 72 new instructions per day in May and June.

UK firms' hiring plans weakest since 2020
UK companies’ hiring plans are currently at their weakest levels since 2020, according to a news Bank of England survey.
In the three months to September, businesses expected to keep employment steady over the next year. It is the first time since the quarter to November 2020 that firms did not intend to take on more staff.
Policymakers at the central bank hope that a weaker jobs market will bring down wage growth and help lower inflation, which it expects to hit 4% in September, double its target and up from 3.8% in August.

How to avoid the stamp duty tax on a holiday home
In the last year, it’s got significantly more expensive to buy a holiday home in the UK. In last October’s budget, it was announced that the stamp duty paid on a second home (known as additional stamp duty) had increased from 3% to 5%. This rate only applies to UK properties, but even if your primary residence is abroad you will need to pay this higher rate on purchase.
The British government is not unusual in levying a property tax on second home purchases, and many European countries have similar policies in place.
These tax changes have led to many holiday homeowners changing tactics and investing in properties they might not have considered before. We investigated the ways you can buy a holiday bolthole without having to pay a massive tax bill.

Bitcoin price hits two-month high amid US shutdown
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) climbed to its highest level in more than two months on Thursday as the US government officially shut down.
The world’s largest digital asset by market capitalisation rose by around 3.5% in the past 24 hours, briefly touching $119,455 (£88,516) before pulling back to now change hands for around $118,500. This marks bitcoin's (BTC-USD) strongest price since mid-August.

Thames Water creditors propose new rescue plan
Thames Water's lenders have proposed a new rescue plan with £5.4bn funding to prevent the UK's largest water company from collapsing.
A consortium of investors who hold much of the company’s debts, called London & Valley Water, have been locked in negotiations with the regulator Ofwat for months. The group said £12.5bn of debt will be written off, in what is expected to be the largest-ever loss on a UK infrastructure investment.
Within this, class A investors will write off £4bn of their loans – a quarter of all class A debt – compared with £3.2bn offered in May.
The creditors also said they would invest about £150m more in new equity capital than previously suggested, taking the total to £3.15bn.
Mike McTighe, the proposed future chair of Thames Water under the terms of plan, said ""from day one, we will inject billions in new investment"".
He added that under a new company board, there would be a focus on ""reducing pollution and rebuilding public trust so that by the end of this decade Thames Water can once again be a reliable, resilient, and responsible company"".
Ofwat said it would review the latest plans.

Gold holds five-day rally amid Fed cut bets and US shutdown
Gold prices steadied on Thursday, hovering around 0.1% higher after a five-day rally that saw it reach successive records. Bullion traded at $3,900 an ounce at the time of writing, about $20 below a peak set on Wednesday.
The precious metal has pushed higher this week as the US government shutdown began, and as traders added to bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates following weak private payrolls data.
Non-farm payroll numbers, which are due Friday, will now be delayed because of the shutdown, which also risks increasing pressure on the dollar and strengthening gold prices.
Traders have added to bets the Fed will cut rates twice more this year to support a weakening labor market. Lower borrowing costs tend to boost non-yielding gold, which also becomes cheaper for most buyers when the greenback softens.
The precious metal has rallied almost 50% this year, putting it on track for the biggest annual gain since 1979 — supported by central-bank buying and rising holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds.
Monthly ETF inflows in September were the largest in three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Silver also edged up on the day, after rallying to the highest in 14 years during the previous session, while platinum and palladium likewise rose.

Shein to open first permanent outlets in France
Shein has chosen France as the location to open its first permanent physical outlets, occupying concessions in department stores in Paris, and then followed by five others in the cities of Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers and Limoges.
Shein told the BBC on Thursday that France's ""influential global fashion market"" was a ""natural choice"" to test for physical stores.
The company has previously opened temporary pop-up stores in cities such as London, Madrid and Paris, but has never operated a permanent physical shop.
The new outlets are being opened through a partnership with retail property group Societe des Grands Magasins (SGM). The French company runs the BHV Marais and Galeries Lafayette department stores that will house what Shein calls ""shop-in-shop"" outlets.
Shein said the outlets will create around 200 jobs in France, adding that the collaboration aimed to revitalise city centres and department stores in the country.

Tesco raises profit outlook
Tesco (TSCO.L) has raised its profit outlook after sales were boosted by an unusually hot summer.
Britain’s biggest retailer saw like-for-like sales rise 4.9% in the first half of the year, while across the group like-for-like sales (at outlets open at least a year) climbed by 4.3%.
Overall revenues rose by 5.1% to £33.1bn but profit before tax fell by 6.3% to £1.3bn.
Tesco said it had won market share from its rivals, but highlighted rising competition and “continued pressure on household budgets”. It said it had reduced prices on 6,500 products, with an average reduction of 9%.
The grocer now expects to make an adjusted operating profit of between £2.9bn and £3.1bn this year, up from between £2.7bn and £3bn previously.

Shawbrook to weigh London IPO filing
Shawbrook Group, the British bank backed by BC Partners and Pollen Street, is considering announcing plans for a potential initial public offering in London as soon as the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter.
Bloomberg has the details:
No final decisions have been made and the plans could still change, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. A spokesperson for Pollen Street didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for BC Partners and Shawbrook declined to comment.
The bank could seek a valuation of about £2bn ($2.7bn), Bloomberg News reported in July. Shawbrook’s listing would be a welcome boost for London’s IPO market, after the UK dropped out of the top 20 global venues for first-time share sales last quarter.
The Essex-based lender offers specialist loans to UK businesses and had £15.8bn in loans on its balance sheet at the end of June, according to its interim financial report. Its statutory profit after tax reached £119.5m in the first half of the year, up from £94m for the same period in 2024, according to the filing.
Shawbrook previously went public in London in 2015 and traded there until BC Partners and Pollen Street led a consortium that acquired the bank in 2017.
The potential IPO would be a boost — and a test — for the London Stock Exchange, which has overhauled its listing rules in an effort to reinvigorate its public markets.

Stocks in Asia advanced overnight, with the Nikkei (^N225) rising 0.9% on the day in Japan, supported by robust performance in local mining stocks, while the Hang Seng (^HSI) jumped 1.8% in Hong Kong after resuming trading post holiday. The Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) remained closed.
In South Korea, the Kospi (^KS11) added 2.7% on the day, standing out as the top performer, reaching a record high.
It came after consumer inflation in the country accelerated in September, rising 2.1% year-on-year. This slightly exceeded the 2.0% forecast, and recovered from a nine-month low of 1.7% recorded the previous month.
Across the pond on Wall Street, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, reaching another record high despite the shutdown noise and an ADP report showing a contraction in private payrolls.
At the same time, fresh fears over the US labour market saw Treasury yields decline sharply as investors priced in more rate cuts.

At face value, it makes sense. With so much competition, job hugging – staying in a job, even if you don’t love it – can be the best option.
According to data from more than 350,000 small businesses and 2 million employees across the UK, Australia and New Zealand by Employment Hero, 55% of employees are now prioritising security over ambition.

However, some career experts argue that staying in a job for too long can lead to other problems, like career stagnation, skills degradation and disengagement.
So what are the pros of job hugging – and when should you think seriously about moving on?
Pros of job hugging
For workers, job hugging can mean increased security, especially in a difficult economic environment. With reports of mass layoffs becoming more common, employees may feel that holding onto a stable role is the best option.
Read more: Women losing out on pay after having miscarriages
On average, it takes someone nearly four months to find a new job in the UK, according to a survey of 2,500 job seekers by StandOut CV. Each job seeker has to dedicate 6.5 hours per week to their search, and make an average of 162 applications to secure that job offer. Luckier candidates may find a new role within a few weeks, but for many, the process can take even longer.
“The guarantee of a regular pay cheque is also key when it comes to job hugging, along with other benefits such as health insurance, discounted gym memberships or season ticket incentives,” says Kate Palmer, employment services director at Peninsula.
“Losing these can have a significant financial impact, especially when they’ve been built up with tenure or seniority within a company, which can lead to employees being reluctant to change jobs.”
For employers, job hugging can appear to be a positive thing. If retention rates are higher, less time and money is spent on recruiting new staff. But, Palmer adds, job huggers may be more inclined to maintain the “status quo” rather than grow and develop within their current role. In other words, they may be happier to coast.
“They may not put themselves forward for projects, apply for internal roles or push themselves to perform to their best,” she says. “They can often be disengaged or unmotivated, which can in turn spread throughout the team.”"

The company is reallocating internal resources in a bid to gain ground in a growing segment of AI-powered wearables that many in the tech industry view as the successor to the smartphone, according to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The delayed headset, code-named N100, was targeted for a 2027 launch with a lighter form factor and lower price point than the current Vision Pro. But Apple recently told teams it is refocusing efforts on two smart glasses projects, aiming to accelerate timelines despite trailing key competitors.
The company’s first model, internally referred to as N50, will not have its own display and is designed to work in tandem with the iPhone. Apple intends to preview this model in 2025, with an anticipated release in 2027, while a display-equipped version originally targeted for 2028 has now been fast-tracked.
Meta, which first launched Ray-Ban Stories in 2021, has since gained traction in the segment with the Ray-Ban Meta, introduced in 2023. Last month, it refreshed its non-display model with longer battery life, improved cameras, and athletic designs, cementing its early lead in wearable AI.
Google, meanwhile, is developing its own AI smart glasses leveraging its Android XR operating system and the Gemini chatbot assistant. Models are expected to release later this year or in 2026 in partnership with eyewear companies including Warby Parker and Gentle Monster.
Even OpenAI is entering the wearable AI space, partnering with former Apple design chief Jony Ive to develop an AI-powered device for market launch.
These developments signal a broader realignment across major tech firms toward wearable devices driven by generative AI, always-on connectivity, and seamless user interfaces. Apple’s decision to pivot signals recognition that the company must adjust course now or risk missing a transformative hardware cycle.
While Apple still heads the high-end mixed-reality market with the Vision Pro, the product’s limitations in portability and affordability have constrained its adoption. Internal hopes are now pinned on AI-infused glasses that could offer a lighter, more scalable entry point for consumers.
By redirecting R&D focus now, Apple is betting that it can regain competitive ground in a race that increasingly favors nimble, AI-focused offerings. The challenge, however, remains steep as Meta continues to expand its lead in this next-generation category."

The iPhone maker had been preparing a cheaper, lighter variant of its headset, code-named N100, for release in 2027, Bloomberg said. But the company told staff internally last week that it is reallocating employees from that project to accelerate work on glasses.
The $3,499 Vision Pro, launched in February 2024 to heavy fanfare, has struggled to sustain momentum amid a thin slate of mainstream content and competition from cheaper devices such as Meta's Quest.
Apple is working on at least two types of smart glasses, the report said. The first, dubbed N50, will pair with an iPhone and lack its own display. Apple aims to unveil the model as soon as next year, ahead of a release in 2027.
The second version, with a display, is planned for 2028, but Apple is now seeking to accelerate development of the product that could challenge the Meta Ray-Ban Display, the report said.
In September, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off the company's first consumer-ready $800 smart glasses with a built-in display and a new wristband controller at Meta's Connect event. Meta also unveiled a new pair of Oakley-branded glasses called Vanguard aimed at athletes.
Apple's glasses will rely heavily on voice interaction and artificial intelligence, the report said.
The company declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.
At its annual product launch event last month, Apple introduced an upgraded line of iPhones, alongside a slimmer iPhone Air.
The event, however, was light on evidence of how Apple — a laggard in the AI race — aims to close the gap with the likes of Google, which showcased the capabilities of its Gemini AI model in its latest flagship phones.

Sustained demand for high-end devices and steady growth in wearables and services underscore the company’s resilience, even as shifting consumer priorities and global risks pose potential headwinds.
JPMorgan said its latest annual consumer survey indicates a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 17 Series, with existing iPhone users driving volumes. At the same time, interest from Android switchers is softer compared to last year.

Analyst Samik Chatterjee noted that faster performance, improved aesthetics, and enhanced camera capabilities are the leading factors behind consumer interest, while AI features did not rank among the top five reasons for upgrading.
The survey also shows continued preference for high-end iPhones, although the iPhone 17 base model has gained significant traction relative to prior base models.
Overall, JPMorgan views the cycle as robust, driven by upgraders and premium model demand, and maintained its Overweight rating on Apple with a price forecast of $280.
The analyst said that the stronger intent to purchase a new iPhone in 2025 was evident, with 71% of respondents planning an upgrade, compared to 68% in 2024 and 63% in 2023.
Interest among U.S. consumers increased year-over-year, signalling momentum for the iPhone 17 Series, while demand in China eased slightly but remains robust at around 90%.
JPMorgan’s consumer survey shows that faster performance, camera capabilities, improved aesthetics, and 5G connectivity remain the top factors driving demand for new iPhones.
Consumers continue to place a premium on core hardware and user experience improvements, with performance ranking as the most important purchase driver.
Despite Apple’s push into artificial intelligence, AI features slipped further down the priority list, ranking seventh this year compared with sixth last year, underscoring that AI is not yet a key motivator for iPhone upgrades.
The analyst stated that Apple’s premium devices continue to experience momentum, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max emerging as the most popular choice among respondents at 33%, followed by the iPhone 17 Pro at 22% and the base iPhone 17 at 20%.
The firm noted that high-end models account for a greater share of demand within the iPhone 17 Series, representing 72% of intended purchases compared with 64% for the iPhone 16 Series last year. This shift toward a richer product mix was observed across both the U.S. and China, underscoring consumer preference for Apple’s top-tier models."

AMD shares are also trading over 1% higher on the news.
Intel has recently secured investment and public support from several major players, including the White House, Nvidia, and SoftBank. The company is also reumored to be in discussions with Apple.
AMD’s current chips are primarily manufactured by Taiwan’s TSMC. According to the Semafor, one challenge of any potential deal is that Intel currently lacks the technology to produce AMD’s most advanced and profitable chips.
The scope of any manufacturing shift to Intel remains unclear, as does whether AMD would make a direct investment similar to deals made by other companies. No agreement is certain at this point in negotiations, the report added.
Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry thinks a potential deal between the two makes sense. The analyst said Intel’s 18A backside power delivery could attract AMD to sign up as a foundry customer.

The new products, announced Wednesday, include new versions of the Bike and Bike+, Tread and Tread+ and the replacement of the Row with a Row+, confirming an August Bloomberg report. The hardware on each of the products gains a Swivel Screen so the display can move, letting users switch to activities like yoga or pilates off the device while still viewing classes. Throughout, the line is powered by a new artificial intelligence platform, Peloton IQ, offering personalized guidance, insights and coaching plans.
To go along with the new models, Peloton is implementing significant price increases, with an average bump of around 11% for hardware and 19% for the subscription fees.
“We know that every dollar is precious and people are considering how to spend their money these days,"" Chief Executive Officer Peter Stern said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ""We are very careful about what we do here, but we are also looking at the value that we deliver.”
Peloton’s stock fell as much as 10% to $8.10 on Wednesday in New York, its biggest intraday decline since June 17.
Stern, a former Apple Inc. and Ford Motor Co. executive who joined Peloton in January, is working to turn around the company after years of sales declines, several rounds of layoffs and a sizable gap in new product releases. In August, the firm cut about 6% of staff and projected that full-year revenue for fiscal 2026 will drop 2%.
All of the offerings also have faster chips, improved audio and upgraded WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The higher-end Bike+, Tread+ and Row+, add a camera for movement tracking, allowing the devices to offer personalized guidance. They also have an integrated fan, more immersive speakers in partnership with Sonos Inc., and voice control with the phrase “OK Peloton.” The Bike+ also has a tray to hold a phone or tablet.
The hardware price increases range from 6% for the Row+ to 17% for the Bike:
Bike ($1,695, up $250 from $1,445)
Bike+ ($2,695, up $200 from $2,495)
Tread ($3,295, up $300 from $2,995)
Tread+ ($6,695, up $700 from $5,995)
Row+ ($3,495, up $200 from $3,295 for the prior non-Plus model)
The price bumps for subscription plans run from 14% to 23%:
The All-Access membership required for full use of the hardware is rising to $49.99 a month, up from $44.
The App+ Membership, which provides full access to Peloton’s class library on phones, tablets and other devices, increases to $28.99, up from $24.
The App One Membership, which offers access to a slimmer lineup of content and is also meant for viewing on mobile devices, will go to $15.99 from $12.99.
In a move aimed at addressing some user complaints, both new Bike models have also been upgraded with a new seat that has improved cushioning, according to Peloton. There’s also a new $65 Comfort Saddle with extra padding and width that can be added to either the new or older models.
Peloton also announced Wednesday it acquired Breathwrk, an app specializing in breathing exercises for stress reduction, mood improvement and sleep. The company will also integrate more deeply with data collected from Garmin Ltd. and Apple devices and partner with Halle Berry's Respin Health for a perimenopause program.
Peloton IQ will come out of the box on new models and arrive on older hardware via a software update, the company said. It’s central to the company’s new strategy, providing performance estimates and more in-depth progress tracking. In a demo, Peloton showed how a user can customize a workout based on specific muscles they want to target.
“The business is getting healthier with a focus on product innovation and the use of AI, though it's unclear if subscriber trends are stabilizing,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Geetha Ranganathan and Raveeno Douglas in a note on Wednesday. Citzens analyst Andrew Boone described the price increases as a likely “near-term headwind to subscriber growth.”
The user experience improves with the new camera system on the plus models, leveraging technologies used in the recently discontinued Guide, a TV box with a camera aimed at analyzing workouts to provide live coaching, Chief Product Officer Nick Caldwell said in an interview.
“Members wanted that experience to be more tightly integrated into our existing products,” he said. The new IQ platform can also handle body recognition and analyze form correction. For instance, it can tell users when their back is too low during a pushup.
With Peloton rolling out the new camera and AI features, the company no longer has plans to build a standalone strength training device, according to Caldwell, who added that 2 million people actively conduct strength training with Peloton products.

Over the past three months, the stock has outpaced nearly every other tech giant, trailing only Alphabet (GOOGL).
Earlier in the year, skeptics pointed to Apple’s lackluster AI strategy and slower growth compared with rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet. But a strong Q3 report, highlighted by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales and record services revenue, has helped the company reclaim leadership. The latest iPhone launch has also fueled optimism, delivering meaningful upgrades across the product line, including the new iPhone Air.
At the same time, Apple is signaling a more deliberate approach to AI, committing $500 billion in US investments tied to artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and data centers. Additionally, rather than racing to build its own standalone AI model, Apple may be positioning itself as a strategic partner in the broader AI ecosystem and leveraging its strong position in eyeball real estate with mobile devices.
With strong momentum behind it, Apple now looks poised for a technical breakout that could carry shares to fresh record highs. Below, I’ll break down the trade setup.

Apple Stock Forms Bull Flag
In recent months, Apple’s price action has resembled that of a classic growth stock, climbing steadily higher. Over the past two weeks, shares have been consolidating into an increasingly tight bull flag, which typically signals an imminent breakout.
The key level to watch is $257. A decisive breakout and close above this resistance would confirm the bull flag and likely propel Apple to new record highs.
Today’s session briefly pushed above $257 before reversing back into the range, underscoring why it’s important to wait for a closing confirmation rather than intraday moves. On the downside, a close below support at $253.50 would suggest the stock needs more time to reset before attempting another leg higher.

Are Apple Shares Overvalued?
Concerns about Apple’s valuation are valid. The stock is trading at an elevated multiple while sales are expected to grow only in the mid–single digits. That said, Apple still commands an extraordinary position with over 1.5 billion iPhone users and a rapidly expanding services business. It’s also worth noting that nearly all Mega cap tech stocks are trading at premium valuations.

Apple (AAPL), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, could be a great candidate to consider.
This maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.52%.
For the last reported quarter, Apple came out with earnings of $1.57 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 per share, representing a surprise of 10.56%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.65 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.48%.
Price and EPS Surprise
Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Apple lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Apple has an Earnings ESP of +3.25% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.
With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate."

Toncoin (TON) has gained momentum over the past 24 hours, rising by more than 4.5% with a 20% surge in trading volume, potentially positioning itself as the next big crypto.
The rally comes as TON Foundation announced a high-profile leadership addition aimed at strengthening its global brand presence. According to press release, it has appointed Gerardo Carucci as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), effective immediately.
Carucci will oversee global brand strategy, creative direction, and community growth, positioning TON as the financial and creative backbone of Telegram.
With experience at Apple and Nike, Carucci brings strong expertise in brand storytelling and marketing innovation. At Apple, he displayed product launches as cultural events, including the openings of Apple Park and Steve Jobs Theater.
At Nike, he delivered groundbreaking FIFA World Cup and Olympics campaigns that redefined digital consumer engagement.
Carucci described TON as a platform where community, commerce, and culture intersect, presenting opportunities for global impact.
Pavel Durov’s Philosophy and TON’s Evolution
Telegram founder Pavel Durov has long advocated for financial freedom through decentralized technologies. Early investments in Bitcoin allowed him to sustain personal expenses while Telegram itself remained unprofitable.
Durov continues to believe in Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value, predicting its rise to $1 million. He has backed TON as a scalable blockchain capable of serving hundreds of millions of Telegram users through shardchain technology.
Originally launched in 2018–2019, TON faced regulatory hurdles in the US, but has since been revived as The Open Network.
Today, it powers daily NFT trading volumes within Telegram and remains central to Durov’s vision of integrating blockchain into everyday digital life.
TON Price Outlook: Bullish and Bearish Scenarios
Based on the weekly chart, Toncoin is consolidating within a descending triangle pattern. Price currently trades at $2.72, near the lower boundary of the structure, with support at $2.67.
A breakdown below this level could expose TON to downside targets around $1.80–$2.00, revisiting previous demand zones. The RSI sits at 38.94, indicating weak buying pressure, while the MACD remains slightly negative.
On the other hand, if TON manages to break above the descending trendline resistance near $3.20, it could trigger a bullish reversal. Upside targets in that scenario lie around $5, with a potential move toward $8 if the new executive addition is a success.

- Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly close to finalizing a $10 billion deal to buy OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum.
- The deal would be the conglomerate's biggest since its $11.6 billion purchase in 2022 of insurer Alleghany.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) is reportedly close to a $10 billion deal to buy the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum (OXY), in what would be the largest deal by Warren Buffett’s conglomerate since 2022.
Buffett, according to the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, is already the largest shareholder in Houston-based Occidental. Berkshire’s 2022 purchase of insurer Alleghany for $11.6 billion was the last major deal for the conglomerate, which has been growing its cash pile lately by unwinding shares in companies like Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC), rather than making big-ticket acquisitions.
According to the reports, citing people familiar with the matter, talks for the conglomerate to buy OxyChem could be completed within days. The OxyChem deal would be Buffett’s second big bet on chemicals after Berkshire Hathaway's acquisition of Lubrizol in 2011, the reports said.
Why This Is Significant
With the ""Oracle of Omaha"" set to step down as CEO at the end of the year, investors are closely watching Warren Buffett's moves at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway to gauge its strategy. The company has a record $344 billion cash pile and has held off on large acquisitions in recent years, so this potential deal is of special interest to investors.
Berkshire had a record cash-and-equivalents pile of $344 billion at the end of June, while debt-laden Occidental has been selling noncore assets to raise cash. Lofty valuations have made it difficult for Buffett, known for being a value investor, to deploy that cash, including buying back its own stock.
The 95-year-old Buffett, known as the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" is planning to retire from his role as CEO at the end of the year, with Greg Abel set to take over.
Shares of Occidental Petroleum, which entered Wednesday down 4% this year, were little changed in recent trading. Berkshire Hathaway's shares were about 1% lower but have gained nearly 10% since the start of the year.
Occidental and Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately respond to Investopedia's requests for comment."

Nearly half of the analysts covering CoreWeave now have buy-equivalent ratings after at least three raised their recommendations in September. It’s a stark shift from mid-July, when less than 20% of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommended buying the stock.
The improving sentiment follows recent agreements with companies including OpenAI that quelled fears CoreWeave was too beholden to Microsoft Corp., which accounted for more than 70% of its revenue at the end of June. On Tuesday, CoreWeave said it will provide Meta Platforms Inc. with as much as $14.2 billion worth of computing power. The news sent the stock soaring, capping its best month since June with a gain of 33%.
“The Street is finally seeing the stickiness and the demand story when it comes to CoreWeave,” said Tejas Dessai, director of thematic research at Global X ETFs, which holds CoreWeave shares. “Once you get these data centers up and running, of course the demand exists, and then the infrastructure in terms of using AI compute services can be a very attractive business.”
Since its initial public offering in March that was propped up by long-time backer Nvidia Corp., CoreWeave has been one of the most controversial stocks on Wall Street. Bulls see a new breed of computing services provider that is poised to win more business as spending on AI continues to climb. For bears, it’s a cash-burning trap that’s destined to end badly when demand eventually slows.
CoreWeave shares have gained more than 230% since their debut but remain down 27% from a June peak when the market capitalization of the Livingston, New Jersey-based company briefly exceeded $88 billion. The stock fell 1.9% at 10:05 a.m. in New York trading on Wednesday.
The shares have considerable upside even after September’s run up, with strong demand expected to translate into future profits, Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note on Tuesday initiating coverage of CoreWeave with an outperform rating. The analysts’ 12-month price target is $175, implying potential for a gain of more than 25% from Tuesday’s closing price."

Top 5 Upgrades:
-
Jefferies upgraded Carvana (CVNA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $475, up from $385 The firm says the results of its consumer survey, web scape, and capacity analysis suggest Carvana will continue to deliver elevated growth and upside to consensus estimates.
-
Jefferies upgraded Delta Air Lines (DAL) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $70, up from $62. The Q3 revenue outlook raise to 2%-4% from 0%-4% gives the firm ""enough confidence"" in the topline for Q4 and 2026 that margin expansion is coming despite the short-term lack of earnings drop through in Q3.
-
HSBC upgraded Autodesk (ADSK) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $343, down from $388. The firm sees signs that Autodesk is well positioned to monetize artificial intelligence and is likely to see margin expansion.
-
Jefferies upgraded Sunrun (RUN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $21, up from $11. Cash generation is ""expected to finally materialize"" in the second half and the firm sees a strong growth set up into 2026 as U.S. Third-Party Owners prepare to claim wallet share in the wake of 25D expiration and a narrowing in the competitive landscape.
-
Baird upgraded United Rentals (URI) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $1,050, up from $888. The firm says multiple fundamental datapoints suggest stabilization in the broader rental industry following two years of deceleration.
Top 5 Downgrades:
-
Northland double downgraded DraftKings (DKNG) to Underperform from Outperform with a price target of $33, down from $53, to reflect the increasing headwind that the firm sees from prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket.
-
RBC Capital downgraded GE Vernova (GEV) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $605, down from $631. While GE Vernova is benefiting from strong demand for energy generation/distribution and from positive price dynamics and productivity improvements, this is now more fully reflected in current valuation and consensus expectations through the end of the decade, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
Evercore ISI downgraded Allstate (ALL) to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $233, up from $230, following what the firm calls a ""solid run"" in the year-to-date. With the Street and the firm now assuming Allstate is over earning in auto in 2026-27, Evercore also sees less scope for positive estimate revisions compared to at the beginning of the year.
-
Goldman Sachs downgraded Doximity (DOCS) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $64, up from $57, which implies 13% downside potential. The company's growth profile does not support the stock's current valuation, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
Goldman Sachs downgraded LivaNova (LIVN) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $55, down from $56. The firm believes that as the Essenz product cycle passes the halfway point, LivaNova's decelerating sales growth and slowing rate of margin expansion are likely to limit the potential for multiple expansion."

Cherney
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Qualcomm has shifted its flagship chips to the latest generation of Arm Holdings' computing architecture with new features aimed at better AI performance, sources familiar with the matter said, a move that could boost Arm's revenues and help Qualcomm's chips compete against offerings from MediaTek and Apple.
The decision at least partially settles a question of whether and how Qualcomm would continue to work with Arm technology, following an acrimonious legal battle between the two last year, and the move is likely to raise revenue for Arm which charges more for the newer tech.
Arm shares jumped 5% during the regular session after Reuters published the news of Qualcomm's decision to use Arm's latest technology.
San Diego, California-based Qualcomm last week introduced a new generation of PC and phone chips. Unlike previous generations, two sources familiar with the matter said Qualcomm's new chips will use the ninth version of Arm's computing architecture, called ""v9"" in the industry, which includes several improvements aimed at helping chips handle tasks from chatbots and image generators better.
Qualcomm rivals such as MediaTek, which has at times eclipsed Qualcomm's market share for mobile phone chips, has publicly confirmed its use of Arm's v9, and most analysts believe Apple uses it, too. The technology is called an instruction set architecture, a fundamental technology that controls what kind of apps can run on a central processing unit.
Qualcomm declined to comment on what technology it used for its newest chips but said in a statement that ""we chose the instructions that make sense for our customers. That's the beauty of having our own CPU design team - we can pick and choose the instructions that add value.""
Arm declined to comment.
While Arm faces competition from newer rivals such as RISC-V, an open chip standard that is free to use, that technology is decades less mature than Arm's and has a smaller software developer base. Qualcomm also could have elected to stick with a previous generation of Arm technology, as it did with chips announced last year.
How much Qualcomm's move could bolster Arm revenue is difficult to calculate because Qualcomm licenses Arm's computing architecture but designs much of its chip itself rather than buying design elements off the shelf from Arm, said Jay Goldberg, senior analyst for semiconductors and electronics at Seaport Research Partners.
But the move is remarkable because of the legal battle, which has not completely ended, Goldberg said. Less than a year ago, Arm had threatened to cancel a key license to Qualcomm, though it later rescinded that threat."

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.
Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.
2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist
The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Apple (AAPL) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.80 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 30, 2025.
By taking the percentage difference between the $1.80 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.74 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Apple has an Earnings ESP of +3.25%.
AAPL is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) as well.
Broadcom Inc. is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on December 11, 2025. AVGO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.86 a share 71 days from its next earnings release.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Broadcom Inc. is $1.85, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +0.41%.
Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, AAPL and AVGO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.
Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported
Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading. Check it out here >>

finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-01T12:43:24,"Is the AI bubble about to burst?

Is AI a bubble about to burst? Well, many analysts are still saying AI is a strong buy.
Yes, valuations have risen to sky high levels and questions are growing as many AI software stocks have started showing some cracks in recent weeks.
But the huge demand for AI infrastructure is only set to grow further. That's according to many bulls, including analysts at City and Jeffries.
City Group is out with a new forecast saying Big Tech's AI spending is not slowing down anytime soon.
They now see infrastructure spending climbing past $2.8 trillion by 2029.
That's half a trillion more than they were estimating just a few months ago. Why?
Hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are racing to build data centers and secure more compute power with AI capital expenditures projected projected to hit $490 billion by 2026 alone.
And almost every company in the world right now is looking into how to embed AI tools into their operations.
Also, keep in mind that nations around the world from the US to China to Europe are all investing to be more self-sufficient in AI infrastructure.
Just today, the US and Taiwan are negotiating over who should be building more chips.
So, what are the companies that are set to keep growing?
Brent Thill from Jeffries shared his view with Josh Lipton here on Yahoo Finance.
I think the application names that, you know, Salesforce, Adobe, those names, investors are re-underway. They see these open AI demos they just launched about customer care or doing digital signatures and you you start to see what OpenAI is saying, what Sam Altman's saying about wanting to get into SAS or software as a service.
I think that's freaking everyone out. So, you're seeing a lot of money, you're seeing names like Hubspot down 10% today, Braze down 10, Docusign down 11% in one day on the fear of Open AI entering the application game.
It doesn't matter what happens with AI, they're going to need infrastructure. OpenAI is going to need Microsoft, Oracle, Core Weve. And so, I think this the conversation we're having with our clients is the application names are under duress and I don't think it's as bad as the stocks are are telling you, but no one wants to be there right now because there is no S-curve.
So software's kind of a tale of two cities. One side, you know, um, there's zombies and in in trash and in a crazy amount of debris floating in the air and that's in the apps category.
And then on the infrastructure side, it's like the sun's out, you know, temperature's perfect, and everyone wants to be there. And I I'm a little that that's been our our view to stay stay overweight in infrastructure.
I think that trade lasts till 26 before we see money shift back to the broader software coverage. But right now, it's, um, you know, my group continues to underperform semis, AI infrastructure. And and so I think investors will come back to these names at some at some point when they see an S-curve or an inflection in in AI revenue. We don't see that yet in the application names yet.
Brent, since you mentioned Core Weve and I have you here, I want to ask you that they did ink this $14 billion meta deal. I want to get your thoughts on that headline, Brent. And also just you also cover meta.
Whether you have any concerns, Brent, that you have these hyper scalers maybe becoming, are they becoming too relying on kind of one key AI infrastructure name, Brent?
For many that know Meta's infrastructure, they would characterize them as one of the best builders on the planet of data center infrastructure.
And the fact that they would go to Core Weve tells you how good Core Weve is.
And that's all you need to know. Like, Meta can't even keep up with their own plans to build their own infrastructure, and they need to go to Core Weve to help them build that infrastructure.
Same thing, Microsoft, Core Weve, you've heard Google talk. So, all the hyper scalers, all the consumer grade, you know, standout leaders in internet are all turning to Core Weve because they can't make their plans for AI deployments without the help of Core Weve.
And they are considered kind of the master luxury builder if you will of AI.
And many ask, you know, how how long this is going to last, like what's Core Weve's competitive advantage. And over time, I think Core Weve's going to look a lot like Amazon AWS, which is it was the infrastructure to begin with, and then it becomes a software story. and AWS is a giant software story. I think if Core Weve
can pull this off. I said this when Palenteer went public. Like, if Palenteer can go from selling really high-end, you know, was like Tesla, selling really high-end cars to then selling cars that nurses, doctors, you know, can drive, the mass market can drive, then then we're in a great spot. I think Core Weve can get to the mass market over time.
But right now they're winning the best builders in in AI and and and as long as these contracts keep coming and we think they are, you know, stock's going to keep going higher."

Apple (AAPL, Financials) and OpenAI have asked a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, which accused them of illegally restricting competition in generative AI.
The suit, filed in August, alleged that Apple gave preferential treatment to OpenAI through an exclusive partnership, which led to Apple's App Store sidelining Musk's X and Grok apps. xAI claimed the arrangement justified billions of dollars in damages.
In a court filing Tuesday, Apple countered that its agreement with OpenAI is not exclusive and that it intends to partner with other chatbot developers. The company has integrated ChatGPT into its iOS and macOS systems for iPhones, iPads and Macs, but lawyers said this does not limit competition.
xAI and X do not plausibly allege that ChatGPT integration harms competition, Apple's attorneys wrote. OpenAI joined in seeking dismissal of the claims.
xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case remains pending in federal court."

DALLAS, Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Parks Associates' recently released Consumer Insights Dashboard: Tech Ecosystem Dashboard reveals 51% of US internet households report owning a smart speaker and/or display. Among those households that purchased or received a new smart speaker in the past six months, over half chose an Amazon-branded device, 18% chose a Google product, and 8% chose Apple's HomePod.
""While Amazon claims dominance in the smart speaker market, other third-party players must stay motivated,"" said Jennifer Kent, VP, Research, Parks Associates. ""Competition among brands such as JBL, Bose, Sony, and Sonos remains intense as they battle for consumer choice and to maintain their position in the market.""
The Tech Ecosystem Dashboard also reports that major brands in the consumer electronics market are expanding their ecosystems by leaning into services, platform control, and established hardware leadership. These strategic positions shape how each brand builds its ecosystem around core users. Amazon and Google serve the broader home, while Apple designs for the individual. Samsung anchors its value in the living room and connected appliances. Each company is investing in operating systems, data services, and cross-device engagement to deepen user loyalty and capture recurring revenue.
Other research highlights:
-
Apple has the most robust ecosystem, reaching 61% of US internet households.
-
Samsung's consumer electronics ecosystem reaches one-half of households and is comprised chiefly of smartphones and smart TVs.
-
Amazon's ecosystem reaches 46% of households and is comprised of smart speakers/displays, streaming media players, and, to a lesser extent, tablets.
-
Google's ecosystem reaches 29% of households and is centered on smart speakers/displays.
-
Microsoft's ecosystem has the widest reach (64%) and is almost exclusively confined to computers, with extended reach through Xbox consoles.
""Trust is central to expanding from hardware into services, and the recent $2.5 billion FTC settlement with Amazon underscores the risks when consumers feel trapped in subscriptions,"" Kent said. ""For Amazon, the smart speaker anchors a broad home ecosystem that connects media, commerce, and utilities, making transparency and trust essential to sustaining engagement.""

But with many of these companies near all-time highs and trading at pricey valuations, it's tough to find great investment opportunities.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.66%), or TSMC for short, is one of those companies that recently hit a new high. Despite that, it's still one of the best semiconductor stocks available right now. Here's why.
A dominant chipmaker at a reasonable cost
TSMC is the world's leading semiconductor foundry. Other companies, such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, design chips, but it's TSMC that manufactures those chips.
Several of the biggest tech companies are customers of TSMC, including the aforementioned Nvidia and AMD, as well as Apple, Intel, and Qualcomm. TSMC also has a 70% share of the global foundry market as of second-quarter 2025, up from 67% in the first quarter of the year. Second-place Samsung Electronics, for comparison's sake, has a 7% market share.
TSMC's market position and customer base make it one of the safer semiconductor companies to invest in. You also don't need to pay a massive premium for it. TSMC is trading at about 28 times forward earnings. Market leader Nvidia costs about 40 times forward earnings at the moment. If you've been looking for a fairly priced semiconductor stock, TSMC fits the bill."

NS&I retail director Andrew Westhead said: ""As autumn arrives, two winners from North East Scotland and Greater Manchester are settling into the season a million pounds richer.
""Premium bonds offer tax-free prizes to savers with every £1 bond having an equal chance of winning in the draw, and it’s great to see our Scottish millionaire winning the jackpot with a holding of £10,150.
""Sometimes people don’t update their contact details with us, which can lead to unclaimed prizes. In Greater Manchester, there's one £100,000 prize and two £50,000 prizes still waiting to be claimed from past draws.""
NS&I said that there are currently 2,646,717 unclaimed premium bond prizes worth a total £108.35m.
Unlike other investments, where investors earn interest or a regular dividend income, bonds are entered into a monthly prize draw where people can win between £25 and £1m. All premium bonds prizes are free of UK income tax and capital gains tax.
The chances of all bonds winning are the same, regardless of when or where they were bought. Even if you did not get a winning ticket this time, be sure to check for any unclaimed prizes.
Prizes do not expire, meaning you can claim as far back as the original 1957 draw. Premium bond holders can reduce the chances of their prizes going unclaimed by managing their premium bonds online or opting to have any prizes paid directly into their bank accounts by BACS, with notification by email.

""We've learned ... people are not willing to pay [a] $30,000 premium for that big battery on a [$50,000], $60,000 utility,"" Farley told Yahoo Finance at Ford's Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit, Mich. ""But they're willing to buy a $30,000 EV if they save $2,000 a year compared to gas costs.""
Farley's comments underscore the challenges Ford faces as it pushes further into EVs. While global EV demand grows, price sensitivity is shaping which models will succeed.
The CEO said the automaker has been ""No. 2 to Tesla for three years"" and is taking lessons from that experience to better align with consumer demand.
Ford is also rethinking its EV strategy and benchmarking against BYD, China's EV leader. In 2024, BYD reported annual revenue of $107 billion, surpassing Tesla's $97.7 billion.
""[BYD has] full support from the Chinese government ... they've been at this for 20 years,"" he said, adding the company has ""a lot of good"" intellectual property.
""Ford has to innovate, to catch up with BYD because we're a global company,"" Farley said. ""We're going to compete with them around the world.""
He emphasized that electrification is accelerating abroad, and the US is just one part of a worldwide market. Part of those innovation efforts comes in the form of a new ""universal electric vehicle platform"" aimed at affordability. Farley said the goal is a $30,000 EV that appeals to mainstream buyers while maintaining competitive performance and features.
""... We had to reload our capital on what we learned, move as fast as we can, and then we've got to make sure we're future-proof to BYD,"" he added.
He compared the industry’s adoption of electrification to the way technology has transformed other sectors. “Anytime there’s new technology … things changed,” he said, pointing to how Apple’s iPhone reshaped mobile devices and disrupted legacy companies like Motorola.
Analysts note that Ford's approach aligns with broader market realities. In a note to clients, JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman highlighted that while EV demand is growing, minimizing ""EV-related losses going forward"" remains a critical factor for adoption.
Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney wrote that ""the degree of success with company specific initiatives such as the transition to hybrids/EVs"" is a key factor of the firm's Neutral rating on the stock."

However, in recent times, this hasn't been the case. Over the past 12 months, shares have climbed about 13%, falling short of the S&P 500's gain.
But the shares have been rebounding nicely, and they trade close to their all-time high. Maybe it's time for investors to ride the momentum. Where will this consumer discretionary stock be in one year?
A fresh product lineup
Apple just released its lineup of iPhone 17 models. And according to Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, demand appears to be stronger than it was for last year's iPhone 16 launch -- and that has led him to raise his price target on the stock to $310. If more consumers upgrade than expected, it will boost revenue numbers for the company.
Even though it's been 18 years since the iPhone was launched in 2007, this product line is still crucial to the company's success, as it represented 47% of total revenue in the third quarter (ended June 28). As revolutionary as this single device has been, investors are still right to temper growth expectations in the years ahead. It's very difficult to keep pushing up revenue from a base that's over $400 billion on a trailing-12-month basis.
The company also introduced its AirPods Pro 3, which with the iPhone 17 models, are all compatible with Apple Intelligence. Two new Apple Watch models were also announced.
Should the latest products and any new launches in the near term turn out to be hits, in addition to progress made with artificial intelligence efforts, the market could view the business in a more favorable light. And that can obviously be a boon for the stock price.
Watch the stock's valuation
The famous value investor Ben Graham is known for saying decades ago: ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine. But in the long run, it is a weighing machine."" The meaning is straightforward. It points to investors being influenced by news headlines, trends, and sentiment, which drives stock prices over 6 to 12 months. But over several years, it's a company's underlying fundamentals that matter most.
Turning our attention to Apple, it's clear that changes to the stock's valuation will have a huge effect on investor returns over the next year. That's because the valuation reflects Graham's voting machine just mentioned. And the valuation can change based on many factors, like new product/service launches, leadership changes, moves made by competitors, AI developments, and general market and economic sentiment. It's totally unpredictable how investors react to things.
It doesn't help that shares currently look expensive. They trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38.8. That represents a 62% premium to the trailing-10-year average. It's probably safe for investors to assume that the P/E will stay the same or maybe even contract over the next 12 months.
The most important factors over the long term
The best way to invest is with a mindset that thinks about the next five years and beyond. Investors will quickly focus on Apple's key competitive advantage, which is the powerful brand that resonates so well with consumers across the globe.
Another thing to consider are the company's robust profits. It generates so much net income -- $84.5 billion through the first nine months of fiscal 2025.
Trends with Apple's brand strength and ongoing profitability are some of the most crucial factors that investors should focus on. That's true when considering the stock as a long-term investment, as these will drive business value.

Which is the better stock for dividend investors?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1f2e72915e52e689eced53f5299944cdc37a4a7554f43dd77b4a2a6de31a15e4,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/better-ai-dividend-stock-apple-vs-broadcom/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/better-ai-dividend-stock-apple-vs-broadcom/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/better-ai-dividend-stock-apple-vs-broadcom/,fool.com,200,,"If you were trying to find dividend stocks before the year 2000, the largest companies in the U.S. were a great place to look. Stalwarts like General Electric (today called GE Aerospace), Pfizer, Walmart, IBM, and the oil companies that would merge to form ExxonMobil were all among the 10 largest companies by market cap, and all paid dividends.
Today, on the other hand, the country's largest companies are much more stingy their payouts. Of the nine U.S.-based companies with trillion-dollar-plus market caps, just two pay a dividend: Broadcom (AVGO 2.81%) and Apple (AAPL 0.54%).
But which of these massive tech companies is the better buy for dividend investors?
Rising payouts, shrinking yields
At first glance, neither company's dividend looks particularly impressive. Apple's dividend yield is just 0.4%, and Broadcom's isn't much better, at 0.7%. Are those even worth considering for income investors?
The answer is yes, because those yields aren't small due to a lack of dividend increases from management. In fact, both Broadcom and Apple have a recent history of annual dividend hikes. Broadcom has raised its dividend every year since 2016, and Apple has done so since 2012.
The reason the companies' yields are currently so small despite these annual increases is actually a good thing for investors. Their share prices have increased much faster than their dividend payouts. Over the last 10 years, Apple's dividend has grown by 100%, while Broadcom's has grown by more than 1,200%! But during that same period, Apple's share price has increased more than 800%, and Broadcom's shares have jumped more than 2,800%, so the dividend yield for each has shrunk.
Broadcom has done a better job of increasing its dividend relative to its share price increases, but there's more to consider here.
Paying for that payout
Dividends are paid out of free cash flow, and Apple has a lot more of that than Broadcom. In 2024, Apple generated $108.8 billion in free cash flow, compared to just $19.4 billion for Broadcom. Meanwhile Broadcom paid a total of $9.8 billion in dividend payments, compared to $15.2 billion for Apple.
One way to look at this is that Broadcom is much more generous with its dividend payments, and in fact, Broadcom's dividend increase of 1,240% over the last 10 years is roughly comparable to the trailing 12-month (TTM) increase in its net income (1,250%) and its free cash flow (1,350%) during that time. That still leaves Broadcom with plenty of leftover cash after its dividends are paid.
Although Apple spends a smaller percentage of its free cash flow on dividend payouts, it has actually increased its dividend much faster than its free cash flow. On a TTM basis, Apple's free cash flow has only increased by 37.8% over the last 10 years, and its net income has only gone up by 86%, but its dividend has increased by 100%. So, it may spend a much smaller percentage of its free cash flow on shareholder dividends than Broadcom, but it has raised its dividend at a faster rate relative to its free cash flow.
The better AI dividend stock
While both companies' dividend yields are comparatively small, they've both shown a commitment to annual dividend increases, and both have plenty of room to increase their dividends further without overly taxing their free cash flow.
Because both dividends look well funded and likely to continue growing, dividend investors will likely want to pick Broadcom for its (currently) higher yield. That said, income investors are unlikely to go wrong with either of these massive artificial intelligence (AI) heavyweights."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-10-01T09:30:00,This ETF Has Beaten Every Stock in the Magnificent Seven This Year. Is It Too Late to Buy?,This semiconductor ETF has been an overlooked champ.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4f15f790c8378ed52c410bd25890d55f1e53d0eae62d5a1f6b49e46c71da4fa3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,fool.com,200,,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" has been driving the AI boom ever since its earliest days.
The group of seven stocks, which includes seven of the most valuable stocks on the market -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- all have some exposure to AI and are seen as the leading technological companies.
However, after driving the stock market rally through 2023 and 2024, the Magnificent Seven's performance has been more pedestrian this year. In fact, three of the seven have underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
A basket of all seven of those stocks would have gained 17.5% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 through Sept. 26, which was up 13%. That's a solid return, and investors can get exposure to the Magnificent Seven through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF.
However, there's one ETF that has not only nearly doubled the return of the Magnificent Seven this year, it's beaten every stock in the elite group through Sept. 26. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH 2.03%), which is up 33.2% year to date, and has a long track record of outperforming the S&P 500.
Meet the VanEck Semiconductor ETF
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF aims to replicate the MVIS U.S.-listed Semiconductor 25 Index, and like the Magnificent Seven, its biggest holdings have significant exposure to AI. These are the top 10 stocks in the ETF.
| Stock | % of ETF |
|---|---|
| Nvidia | 21.8% |
| Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) | 10.6% |
| Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) | 9.5% |
| Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) | 6% |
| Lam Research | 4.4% |
| Analog Devices | 4.4% |
| ASML | 4.2% |
| Micron Technology | 4.1% |
| Texas Instruments | 4.1% |
| Qualcomm | 4.1% |
Nearly 40% of the value of the ETF comes from Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom, three stocks that have been top performers in the AI boom. Notably, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has also outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF because the SMH's holdings are more concentrated in those three leading stocks.
While the Magnificent Seven might hold better-known stocks like Apple and Tesla, semiconductor companies have seen their business soar during the AI boom as they are providing the core computing power to make AI applications work. They form the building blocks of the AI revolution, and should as long as the data center buildout phase continues, with companies like Oracle pledging to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure.
Is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF still a buy?
The VanEck SMH ETF is not only outperforming the S&P 500 this year, but it has a long track record of delivering superior returns. Since its inception in 2011, the fund has gained more than 2,000%, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $200,000 and trouncing the S&P 500 along the way, which is up by less than 600% during that time.
Looking at its valuation, the SMH ETF isn't cheap, but it's not as expensive as you might think. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39, which is much cheaper than popular AI stocks like Tesla or Palantir Technologies, and is only moderately more expensive than the S&P 500 at a P/E of 28. Meanwhile, some of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top holdings, like Taiwan Semiconductor, still look cheap considering its growth rate.
Given its exposure to the top chip and AI stocks and its diversification across the industry, the SMH ETF still looks like a strong buy. Over the long term, the fund looks like a good bet to continue to outperform the S&P 500, and given the massive capex spending in AI, it has an edge over the Magnificent Seven group as well."

Apple started allowing EU users to install alternative marketplaces earlier this year under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). At that time, the installation process was lengthier and involved multiple “scare screens” — warnings about the potential dangers of installing apps from sources other than the App Store.
Developers complained that Apple’s tactics resulted in people abandoning the installation process. Earlier this year, the EU slapped a $568 million fine on Apple for not complying with DMA rules.
In July, Apple released a new process for installing third-party app marketplaces on iPhones with iOS 18.6. The new process includes only one screen showing users that they might miss some features, such as subscription management offered by the App Store. The screen also informs users that the alternative app store’s developer will handle their data directly.
Epic Games said that prior to the iOS 18.6 update, 65% of users attempting to install its game store abandoned the process. However, after the update, that figure dropped to 25%. The company noted that this drop rate is closer to the rate it observes with Windows and macOS users installing its game store.
Despite this improvement, the company remains critical of Apple’s policies, including charging a core technology fee, imposing notarization and approval policies, and implementing rules that make it difficult for developers to distribute their apps through alternative app stores.
Epic Games repeated an argument from its lawsuit against the iPhone maker: that Apple allows users more freedom to install apps from outside the App Store on Mac computers. During that lawsuit, Apple’s SVP of software, Craig Federighi, said that if the company allowed the same level of freedom on iOS as on Macs, the platform would be overrun by malware.
Apple is not the only company Epic Games is battling. Epic Games is also criticizing Google for having a lengthy process for installing third-party app stores, along with screens that warn users against installing apps from unknown sources. The gaming company said that Google misleads users by suggesting that apps from competitors like Epic Games might be harmful.
Last year, a court in the U.S. ordered Google (GOOG) to open up the Play Store and allow third-party app stores. In July, the search giant lost its appeal against the decision."

American companies shed 32,000 jobs in September, in a sign that the labour market weakened last month — missing Wall Street estimates for 51,000 jobs created, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

The London stock market has had a strong 2025, with defence companies, miners and banks all in demand. So far this year, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) has risen by almost 15%, on track for its strongest year since 2009.
Meanwhile, UK manufacturing production fell for the eleventh successive month in September, with the rate of contraction the fastest since March. The effects of the downturn were widespread, with the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors all seeing output fall sharply.
Manufacturers reported that production had been scaled back in response to weaker intakes of new business, with tepid demand from both domestic and export markets.
Traders are also weighing up the US government shutdown, after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree a funding plan for federal departments. Previous shutdowns have been resolved fairly quickly, but it does mean that traders will not see US economic data until the situation is resolved.
Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said typically, “a shutdown is immaterial for markets"".
Stocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio
""In fact, the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted for over a month, actually saw Wall Street rise. The issue for markets here is twofold. One, it could delay the release of Friday’s non-farm payrolls data, which is going to be a nuisance, if nothing else, especially as market participants search for insights on the health of an ailing US labour market.
""US president Trump has also threatened to permanently lay off workers, which could turn the shutdown into a mini labour market shock.""

Reddit stock falls for second day as references to its content in ChatGPT responses plummet
Reddit (RDDT) stock fell as much as 8% in early trading Wednesday, extending a 5% decline from the previous trading session amid new data that showed the use of its content in leading AI chatbot ChatGPT had plummeted in mid-September.
Reddit content was cited in just 2% of ChatGPT responses on Tuesday, much lower than the 9.7% of ChatGPT responses that cited Reddit the previous month, according to data from AI search engine tracker Promptwatch. At its peak in September, Reddit was cited in more than 14% of ChatGPT answers.
Still, Reddit was the top social platform cited by the leading AI chatbot, with its content surfacing in 4.3% of ChatGPT's responses on average in September. Meanwhile, LinkedIn, the second-most-cited social platform, was referenced in only 0.4% of ChatGPT's answers during the month.
Reddit is often used as a social media version of a search engine, with users frequently appending ""reddit"" to online queries when looking for advice or instructions. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) still dominates ""traditional"" online search. That means Reddit, like other search resources, faced a potentially existential threat with the rise of AI chatbots, beginning with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.
Reddit has circumvented that threat of displacement by inking billion-dollar data licensing deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google to use its content for their AI models. Reddit has also launched its own AI search and advertising tools.

Should Rachel Reeves hike taxes or cut benefit spending in budget?
Speculation is ramping up as to what chancellor Rachel Reeves could announce in the autumn budget, to help strengthen the UK's public finances.
Reeves refused to rule out some tax rises were form part of it in an interview with the BBC on Monday, ahead of her speech at the Labour party conference. The Labour party promised in its manifesto not to raise taxes on ""working people"", with a pledge not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance or value-added tax (VAT).
Following her first autumn budget last year, in which the chancellor announced £40bn of tax rises, Reeves told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) that she would not be ""coming back with more borrowing or more taxes"".
However, in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday she said: ""Everyone can see in the last year the world has changed and we’re not immune to that change.""
When asked whether she could guarantee that she would not extend the freeze on income tax thresholds, in another interview, with BBC Breakfast, Reeves said: ""I'm not going to be able to do that.""
Later, in her Labour party conference speech, Reeves said: ""In the months ahead, we will face further tests, with the choices to come made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and the long-term damage done to our economy, which is becoming ever clearer.
""Our first year in power was about fixing the foundations. Our second must be about building a renewed economy for a renewed Britain.""
Given the projected shortfall in public finances, what do you think Rachel Reeves should do in the autumn budget to help shore up the UK's public finances? Vote in the poll here.

US private payrolls data misses estimates
US companies shed 32,000 jobs in September, in a sign that America’s labour market weakened last month — missing Wall Street estimates for 51,000 jobs created, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

The biggest decline was in the hospitality field, which lost 19,000 jobs, though several sectors reported job losses. The bright spot continues to be education and health services, which gained 33,000 jobs in September.
A government shutdown has heightened the significance of the private payrolls report, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics will not publish the all-important monthly jobs report during the stoppage. As my colleague Hamza Shaban notes in today's Morning Brief (see the blog below), the hole left by that missing data is expected to complicate the Federal Reserve's policymaking.

UK can ‘reap the benefits’ of finance stablecoins, says Bailey
The governor of the Bank of England has said the UK should “reap the benefits” of stablecoins as part of the country’s financial system.
Andrew Bailey said it would be “wrong to be against stablecoins as a matter of principle” amid broad debate over the future of money.
However, in an article for the Financial Times, he stressed that widely used stablecoins should be regulated in a similar way to traditional money.
Stablecoins are a form of cryptocurrency which are pegged to official currency.
These differ from other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin (BTC-USD), which have no innate monetary value, and are therefore volatile.
Mr Bailey said that physical money assets and digital assets can co-exist in a changed financial system to how it currently operates.
“The system does not have to be organised like this,” he said.
“It is possible, at least partially, to separate money from credit provision, with banks and stablecoins co-existing and non-banks carrying out more of the credit provision role.
“But it is important to consider the implications of such a change thoroughly before going ahead.”

UK manufacturing falls to five-month low
UK manufacturers suffered a challenging September, as a quiet domestic market and lower intakes of new export business stymied production volumes and total new order intakes.
The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to a five-month low of 46.2 during the month, down from 47.0 in August, to remain below the neutral 50.0 mark for the twelfth consecutive month.
Four of the five PMI components (output, new orders, employment and stocks of purchases) were at levels consistent with a worsening of operating conditions.
Manufacturing production fell for the eleventh successive month in September, with the rate of contraction the fastest since March. The effects of the downturn were widespread, with the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors all seeing output fall at solid rates.
Manufacturers reported that production had been scaled back in response to weaker intakes of new business, with demand from both domestic and export markets weak.
New order intakes subsequently fell for the twelfth month in a row, and to one of the greatest extents during the past two years. The worsening of current market conditions was linked to subdued client confidence, US tariff uncertainty and the consequences of a high cost backdrop (especially for energy and staff).
There were also reports that automotive supply chains were being disrupted following production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover. September saw a further marked decrease in new export business.
New orders from overseas clients fell at one of the quickest rates in over two years. There were reports of weaker order intakes from the US, the EU, the Middle East and Asia.

Greggs sales growth cools after July heatwave
Sausage roll merchant Greggs' (GRG.L) stock ticked up as much as 7% in London on Wednesday morning as it said sales have risen in recent months, but blamed unusually hot July weather and a tough consumer backdrop for a slowdown in growth.
The high street bakery chain, with 2,675 shops in the UK, has continued to expand its sprawling estate across the country.
It reported a 6.1% increase in sales over the third quarter of 2025, compared with the same period a year ago. On a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of new shop openings, sales growth across company-managed shops slowed to 1.5% year on year.
It also marks a slowdown from the 2.6% like-for-like growth recorded in the first half of the year.
Unusually hot weather held back sales in July as shoppers made the most of the sunny conditions, but trading got back on the front foot again in August and September, Greggs told investors.
The bakery chain highlighted the expansion of its menu, including high-protein options such as egg pots and protein shakes, and seasonal items such as its pumpkin spice latte and toffee fudge muffin.
It has also continued to open new shops recently in Tesco and Sainsbury’s as part of a partnership with the supermarket chains, as well as relocating smaller shops to better locations.
Total openings on a net basis, which subtracts the number of closures, came to 57 so far this year.

Spotify boss to step down
Spotify (SPOT) CEO Daniel Ek is stepping down from his position at the company's helm, he said on Tuesday, with his sights set on building the ""next Spotify"" in another industry.
Ek said he wants to develop tech that creates ""progress in areas that matter most to society"".
""I am often asked, 'How do we build more Spotifys out of Europe?'"" Ek said in a note to Spotify employees on Tuesday. ""That’s why several years ago, I announced my intention to help create more of these supercompanies – companies that are developing new technologies to tackle some of the biggest challenges of our time.""
Ek will solidify his push into venture capital through his firm Prima Materia. He has said he will invest around €1bn into European ""moonshot"" companies.
Ek will remain as executive chair of Spotify (SPOT), meanwhile, and will be replaced by co-CEO and chief product and technology officer Gustav Söderström and chief business officer Alex Norström on 1 January.
The company's share price lost nearly 4.2% yesterday and was trading 0.6% lower in premarket on Wednesday.

Eurozone inflation rises over 2% target
Inflation in the euro area rose to 2.2% in September, up from 2.0% in August and the highest level since April, new flash estimate data showed on Wednesday.
According to statistics body Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, services inflation came in at 3.2%, followed by food, alcohol and tobacco where prices rose by 3.0%.
Goods prices rose by 0.8%, while energy was 0.4% cheaper than a year ago.
The reading was in line with economist expectations. On a month-on-month basis, prices edged up 0.1%, mirroring August's figure.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, held steady at 2.3% for the fifth month running, offering reassurance that underlying price pressures are not gaining momentum, even as headline figures rise.
Among inflation’s key drivers, services led the pack with a 3.2% annual increase, slightly up from 3.1% in August.
Although today's figures means inflation currently now sits above the European Central Bank’s (ECB) forecast of 2%, it is still lower than in the UK where inflation was 3.8% in August.
Estonia posted the highest inflation rate at 5.2%, followed by Croatia and Slovakia at 4.6% each. At the other end of the spectrum, Cyprus recorded no annual change, and France saw a mild increase of 1.1%.
Meanwhile, Italy and Portugal led with price increases of 1.3% and 1.0% respectively, suggesting some localised acceleration.
It comes as the ECB kept interest rates unchanged at its September meeting, maintaining the deposit facility at 2%.
Its projections showed inflation is expected to average 2.1% in 2025, easing to 1.7% in 2026, before nudging back up to 1.9% in 2027. Core inflation is seen gradually declining over the same horizon.
Diego Iscaro, head of European economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:

Eurozone manufacturing slips back to contraction
The manufacturing sector in the eurozone slipped back into contraction in September, new data on Wednesday has revealed.
Data firm S&P Global reported that factory operating conditions across the euro area deteriorated last month, due to a reduction in new order inflows and a sharper rate of job shedding.
This pulled its HCOB eurozone manufacturing PMI from 50.7 in August to down to 49.8, back below the 50-point mark which shows stagnation.
Although production volumes continued to expand, business confidence weakened.

UK business confidence plunges to lowest level on record
Business confidence slumped to its lowest level on record last month amid concerns over soaring costs, according to a new survey of company bosses.
Data from the Institute of Directors (IoD) showed that firms said higher labour costs has been the biggest contributor to growing pessimism about the economy.
The industry group’s monthly economic confidence index, which measures business leader optimism about the prospects of the UK economy, posted a minus 74 reading for September.
It marked a significant decline from minus 61 and struck the lowest level since the index was launched more than nine years ago.
The previous record low was a reading of minus 72 recorded in July this year in the face of worries over trade tensions.
In the fresh research, business bosses also saw cost expectations increase to reading of plus 89 amid an uptick in inflation.
Around 83% of surveyed leaders linked the worsening outlook to higher labour costs, while supply chain inflation and energy costs were also highlighted as significant factors.
Labour costs jumped for many firms from April after the Government increased the national minimum wage and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for businesses.

Global stocks cheer best September since 2013
Investors cheered a strong September, often a weak month in the markets, which also came with concerns that the artificial intelligence boom had run too high.
Global stocks climbed by 3.5%, their best September since 2013, while the S&P 500 share index also had its best September in fifteen years.

Where did house prices rise and fall?
On a quarterly basis, Nationwide's data showed that most regions saw a modest slowdown in price growth in the three months to September.
Northern Ireland remained the top performing area with annual house price growth of 9.6% in the July-September quarter, followed by Wales with 3.0% annual growth, Scotland with 2.9%, then England with 1.6%.
Prices rose faster in Northern England than the South, with average prices in Northern England (comprising North, North West, Yorkshire & The Humber, East Midlands and West Midlands) up 3.4% year on year.
The North (which incorporates areas, such as Tyneside, Teesside and Cumbria) was the top performing region in England – with prices up 5.1% year on year.
Meanwhile average house price growth in Southern England (South West, Outer South East, Outer Metropolitan, London and East Anglia) slowed to 0.7%. This was driven by a marked softening in price growth in Outer Metropolitan and Outer South East, the latter being the weakest performing region, with annual growth of 0.3% (down from 2.6% last quarter).

UK house prices rise by 0.5% in September
UK house prices rose more than expected in September, despite concerns about affordability as mortgage rates edged higher in recent weeks.
The average cost of a home climbed 0.5% on a month-on-month, according to Nationwide's latest house price index, released on Wednesday. This was more than the consensus forecast of a 0.2% monthly increase, according to Capital Economics.
On an annual basis, price growth was steady at 2.2%, only marginally higher than the 2.1% recorded in August.
The average price of a residential property now stands at £271,995, compared to £271,079 in August.

Investors shrug off US government shutdown worries
The first federal government shutdown in years began early on Wednesday morning after lawmakers and president Donald Trump stopped negotiations and spent the final hours before the stoppage largely focused on trying to set up the other side to take the political blame.
The victory of gridlock was sealed Tuesday evening when twin Senate votes failed to advance either a Republican bill (even as three members of the Democratic caucus crossed party lines to vote yes) or a Democratic plan. No compromise plan was offered, ensuring the funding lapse.
The shutdown — the first since a seven-week stoppage during Trump's first term — began at 12:01 a.m. ET as the new fiscal year began. That last shutdown took place in 2018-19 and broke the record for the longest in American history.
Federal agencies will now implement their contingency plans and send hundreds of thousands of government workers home to wait out a stalemate.
Previous shutdowns have been resolved fairly quickly, but it does mean that traders will not see US economic data until the situation is resolved.
Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said typically, “a shutdown is immaterial for markets.""

Asia and US overnight
Asian equity markets were quiet overnight, due to holidays in China and Hong Kong for National Day. Markets in mainland China will remain closed until the middle of next week.
Throughout the region, Japanese stocks are underperforming, with the Nikkei (^N225) and down 0.9% amid concerns over potential interest rate hikes after a survey showed increasing confidence among the country’s largest manufacturers.
Sentiment among Japan's major manufacturers showed improvement for the second consecutive quarter, increasing 1 point to +14 compared to June's results. The index for large non-manufacturers held steady at 34, close to its peak level since the early 1990s.
In addition, large enterprises across various sectors intend to raise their business investments by 12.5% for the current fiscal year, an increase from the previously projected 11.5%.
Markets are pricing in around a 70% chance of an interest rate hike in October with two big events to come later this week — a speech from Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, on Friday and the conclusion of the LDP leadership election over the weekend.
Meanwhile, the Kospi (^KS11) bucked the regional negative trend, adding 1.9% on the day.
Across the pond on Wall Street, markets brushed off some initial shutdown jitters, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rising 0.4%, recovering to close less than 0.1% from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was 0.3% higher and he Dow Jones (^DJI) gained 0.2%.
Overall investors remained hopeful that the issues will be sorted over the coming days, with little wider impact on the economy or earnings.
The Mag-7 were mixed with Nvidia (NVDA) up 2.6% reaching another all-time high, but Meta (META) slipped. 1.2% and Amazon (AMZN) likewise losing ground by around the same amount.

Wall Street will be laser-focused on the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, which tend to grow faster than the rest of the market thanks to powerful trends like artificial intelligence (AI).
The Magnificent Seven stocks include:
Meta Platforms and Alphabet (Google) are heading into this earnings season with significant momentum across their various businesses, mostly thanks to AI. They also happen to be the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks by one traditional valuation metric, making them a great value for investors.
Here's why they might be great buys in October (and beyond).
The case for Meta Platforms
Over 3.4 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every single day, which include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Meta generates most of its revenue by showing ads to those users, so the longer they stay online, the more money the company makes.
Meta uses AI in its recommendation algorithms to learn what type of content each user likes to see, so it can show them more of it. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), this strategy drove a 6% increase in the amount of time users were spending on Instagram compared to the year-ago period, and a 5% increase for Facebook.
Meta has applied a similar AI-powered strategy to its ad-recommendation engine to target users more accurately, which is driving a modest increase in conversions. This allows the company to charge a higher price per ad, because businesses are getting a greater return on their investment.
Meta is also using AI to power new features like its Meta AI chatbot, which launched in late 2023 and already has over a billion monthly active users. It's powered by the company's Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which rival some of the best models from leading start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic. As Meta AI's capabilities expand, it's likely to become a major tailwind for engagement.
Meta's revenue increased by 22% during the second quarter, accelerating from its first-quarter result of 16%. In other words, better engagement and higher ad conversions are driving significant momentum in its business. According to Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street now expects the company to generate $196.1 billion in revenue for the whole of 2025, with earnings of $28.15 per share. Both figures would be record highs.
Meta stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.9 as I write this, making it the second-cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. As a result, there might be plenty of room for upside from here.
The case for Alphabet
When AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT went mainstream in 2023, investors were worried they would take traffic away from traditional internet search engines because they gave consumers a faster and more convenient way to access information. That would have spelled bad news for Alphabet, because Google Search accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue.
Alphabet met those concerns with innovation, developing its own AI models called Gemini, along with a chatbot with the same name. The Gemini models power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to provide holistic answers to search queries. These responses appear above the traditional search results, so users no longer have to sift through web pages to find the information they need.
Overviews strike a good balance between the traditional Google Search experience, and the convenience provided by AI chatbots. As a result, Alphabet said more than 2 billion people were using them at the end of the second quarter, and since they monetize at a similar rate to traditional Google Search results, they aren't hurting the company's valuable core business.
Finally, Google Cloud deserves a special mention because it has become a key part of Alphabet's AI strategy. It provides computing power from state-of-the-art centralized data centers, in addition to an expanding list of ready-made LLMs from top third-party developers. These are the main two ingredients required to develop AI software, which is why nearly all AI unicorns (start-ups worth $1 billion or more) are using Google Cloud in some capacity.
Google Cloud's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 32% during the second quarter. That momentum is likely to continue because the platform's order backlog climbed at an even faster rate of 38%, reaching a whopping $106 billion, which will be converted into revenue as Alphabet brings more data centers online.
Alphabet stock has soared by 48% over the past year, yet its P/E ratio is still just 26.2 which makes it the cheapest member of the Magnificent Seven. Considering the company's resounding success in the AI space so far, I think its stock could be destined for much higher ground."

Chicago, IL – October 1, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Meta Platforms META.
Will Amazon Keep Rebounding This Year?
On the surface, the price performance of Amazon stock has been very respectable. After all, AMZN is only 9% from a 52-week and all-time high of $242 a share (post-split basis).
That said, the rebound in AMZN has been subpar after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs rattled the broader market earlier in the year.
Rebounding +15% in the last six months, Amazon stock is now virtually flat in 2025, being the worst performer out of its ""Mag 7"" big tech peers, just behind Apple’s YTD gains of over +1% with Nvidia’s +35% leading the way.
Keeping this in mind, investors may be wondering if Amazon stock is being overlooked at the moment and if AMZN will keep rebounding.
AI is Streamlining Amazon’s Businesses
As illustrated by the price, consensus, and surprise chart above, Amazon has now exceeded EPS expectations for 11 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, Amazon has posted a very impressive average EPS surprise of 22.98% in its last four quarterly reports.
Most appealing and correlating with this exceptional operational performance is that Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence in nearly every facet of its business, as depicted below.
1. Enhancing Customer Experience
Amazon has integrated generative AI into Alexa, making interactions more natural and context-aware. Also boosting Amazon’s core e-commerce business, generative AI is providing smarter product listings, with engagement being further boosted by AI-generated ads that create lifestyle-themed visuals.
2. Revolutionizing E-Commerce Operations
AI-powered robots: Operating over 750,000 intelligent robots in its warehouses, Amazon has optimized inventory movement and storage while improving efficiency and safety.
Predictive analytics: Amazon is using AI to forecast demand and manage global inventory, reducing waste and improving delivery speed.
3. Driving Innovation Through AWS
Amazon Bedrock: Fully managed generative AI platform that allows developers to access top-tier machine learning models through a single application programming interface (API), including Anthropic’s Claude, Meta Platforms' Llama, and Amazon’s Titan model.
4. AI in Everyday Services
Amazon One: Futuristic, frictionless way to make payments and verify identity, with customers using their palm thanks to AI-powered biometric recognition."

""Despite ongoing uncertainties in the global economy, underlying conditions for potential home buyers in the UK remain supportive.
""Unemployment is low, earnings are rising at a healthy pace, household balance sheets are strong and borrowing costs are likely to moderate a little further if the bank rate is lowered in the coming quarters as we, and most other analysts, expect.

“Providing the broader economic recovery is maintained, housing market activity is likely to strengthen gradually in the quarters ahead.""
On a quarterly basis, Nationwide's data showed that most regions saw a modest slowdown in price growth in the three months to September.
Northern Ireland saw the strongest house price growth in the third quarter of 9.6%, while England experienced a further slowing of growth to 1.6%, down from 2.5% in the previous three months.
Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""The housing market looks set to continue experiencing modest growth. On the one hand, the recent strength in pay growth has seen affordability improve slightly, although it remains stretched.
""On the other hand, the situation for many buyers will be made more difficult by slowing real income growth and mortgage rates that could be set to rise, as financial markets do not expect interest rates to be cut again until next year.
""On balance, it appears likely that 2026 will see another year of modest house price growth, with the Bank of England eventually restarting interest rate cuts in the first half of the year."""

The existence of this internal tool marks a new phase in Apple’s AI preparations, as the new Siri is now slated to debut as early as March of the upcoming year, after multiple delays.
The Veritas app is currently for internal use only, and Apple has no immediate plans for a consumer release, reflecting executive reluctance about entering the general chatbot market, as articulated by Apple software chief Craig Federighi in a June interview with Tom’s Guide. The Veritas app allows Apple’s AI division to quickly evaluate new features for the revamped Siri, which include the ability to search through personal data, such as songs and emails, and perform in-app actions like editing photos.
The app, which is similar to popular chatbots, allows users to manage multiple conversations across different topics, save and reference past chats, follow up on earlier queries, and support extended back-and-forth exchanges. The software is designed to test the revamped underlying system, code-named Linwood, which relies on LLMs and combines work from Apple’s own Foundation Models team with a third-party model.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories worldwide.

On September 26, Meta Platforms announced that it will launch an ad-free subscription option for users of Facebook and Instagram in the UK in the coming weeks. This move is a response to regulatory guidance from the UK’s data protection authority, which had raised concerns about how platforms handle personal information for targeted advertising.
The subscription model offers users a choice: they can continue to use the services for free with targeted advertising or pay a monthly fee to use the apps without ads. Users who opt for the paid plan will not see ads, and their data will not be used for advertising purposes. The introduction of this ad-free tier is part of a broader industry trend where tech companies, including Apple and Alphabet’s Google, are adjusting their models due to increasing regulatory pressure over personal data use and targeted ads.
The pricing for the ad-free subscription is set at £2.99 a month for access via the web. For subscriptions made through iOS and Android mobile apps, the price will be £3.99 a month, with the higher price accounting for service charges imposed by Apple and Google. The company’s ads business accounted for about $164.5 billion in total revenue last year, with ads representing about 98% of that revenue.
Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) develops products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality and mixed reality headsets, augmented reality, and wearables worldwide.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -When Daniel Ek founded Spotify in 2006, a viable music product was a ""moon shot."" The global music industry was struggling with years of declining sales, online music piracy was rampant, and services like Apple's iTunes were pricey.
Ek, then a 23-year-old coder, believed if access to music was as easy as turning on a tap - in a way that was legal and fair to artists - users would come. The key was streaming, not downloads, an idea that revolutionized the industry and catapulted Spotify into a $140 billion music powerhouse.
The serial entrepreneur, who announced on Tuesday he will step down as Spotify's CEO next year, has his sights set on building the next Spotify — albeit not in the music industry. Ek told Reuters on Wednesday he wants to focus on companies in Europe that are ""working on some of the biggest challenges through technology that make a meaningful difference.""
""Big challenges often appear impossible until someone decides to tackle them,"" Ek said in an email. ""At Spotify, we started with what felt like an impossible idea. Nearly 20 years later, that idea is used by almost three-quarters of a billion people around the world ... What once looked unreasonable is now obvious.""
Calling himself an ""optimist"" and a ""problem-solver at heart,"" Ek said, ""We’re at a crossroads for the kind of future we want to build"" and that transitioning into the role of executive chair at Spotify would give him the chance to dedicate more of his time to this kind of problem-solving and building beyond Spotify.
Ek has pledged to invest through his venture capital firm Prima Materia 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion) of his own wealth in European “moonshot” projects — early-stage startups in deep technology, AI, and climate and health tech.
WAR TECH SPARKS ARTIST BACKLASH
In 2018, Ek co-founded Neko Health to help people stay healthy through preventive measures and early detection. The company has raised $325 million in total funding.
Ek has also invested in Germany's Helsing, a maker of AI-controlled combat drones that has received over a billion dollars to become the largest defence startup in Europe, valued at $12 billion. This investment, though, has drawn criticism.
Music groups including Massive Attack, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, and Hotline TNT removed their music from Spotify in protest.
""Music and weapons are not a good mix,"" said Simon Dyson, analyst at Omdia. With some high-profile artists pulling their music from the service, ""the sounds of protest are starting to become a distraction,"" he said."

On September 26, Lynx Equity shared an analysis on Intel Corporation, stating that it expects “the stock to drift upwards powered by headlines to perhaps the $40-range.”
Discussing the recent media reports regarding Intel’s CEO approaching Apple and TSMC, the firm expressed its skepticism and stated that there is “little reason for Apple to agree to invest in Intel, from a strategic sense. Even less so for TSM.” However, it strongly supports NVIDIA’s investment in Intel.
The firm’s analysis suggests a potential server product ramp in 2027 based on Intel’s custom x86 CPU integration into NVIDIA’s AI racks. Lynx said that after this integration, “Intel’s NVLink-enabled x86 CPUs, on a stand-alone basis, could have interesting applications in traditional racks too.”
“After having jumped ~25% on the NVDA announcement and another ~15% on the AAPL headline, in the near term, we expect INTC stock to continue heading upwards, not as much due to fundamental reasons, but because the Intel CEO has managed to keep the company in the news. After ignoring the stock for over a year, institutional investors may be forced to take a view. On a fundamental basis, there may be a little bit of thaw in the permafrost as Intel’s core business sees modest upside. In his earnings presentation, Micron CEO raised his expectations for traditional server growth this year. Also, China’s subsidy program is helping boost client PC sales. Intel’s core portfolio of products may drive modest upside to revenue guidance. However, margins in the back-half of the year can be expected to be under pressure as Panther Lake ramps, the despite Raptor Lake reported to have raised pricing. Net/net, we expect the stock to drift upwards powered by headlines to perhaps the $40-range and then come under pressure as the earnings event draws closer.”

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the Top AI Stocks in the Spotlight on Wall Street. On September 26, BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $270.00 price target.
According to the firm, carrier incentives such as those offered by T-Mobile and Verizon make iPhones more affordable for customers through bundled financing options and extended payment plans.
Carriers are offering $100 more in subsidies compared to last year which offsets the iPhone 17 Pro’s higher base price of $1,099 (256GB storage) versus the iPhone 16 Pro at $999 (128GB storage).
According to T-Mobile, iPhone activations have grown by double-digits. Verizon also reported strong upgrade activity in its existing base which it believes may carry through.
“Carrier incentives allow iPhones to be more affordable as they 1) bundle iPhone financing (can make the phone itself free with eligible trade-in, under select plans) with telecom services under one monthly payment, and 2) spread out the cost of the iPhone over 24/36 months. This year, subsidies for the new iPhone 17 series are higher by $100 vs. last year to cover the iPhone 17 Pro’s higher base price (iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099 with 256GB storage, vs. iPhone 16 Pro at $999 with 128GB storage). As per T-Mobile mgmt., iPhone activations are up double digits (new and existing customers). Verizon mgmt. commentary also suggests strong upgrade activity in its existing base during the quarter, which we believe could carry through to the iPhone launch. Recent lead times indicate the iPhone 17 shipment times are more extended vs last year, while Pro and Pro Max are similar to last year.”

The transaction could be announced in coming days, the person said, asking not to be identified because the talks are confidential. It would be Berkshire’s largest deal since its acquisition of Alleghany Corp. in 2022 for $13.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Representatives for Occidental and Berkshire didn’t immediately reply to messages seeking comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on the potential deal earlier Tuesday.
After years spent refraining from large deals and progressively unwinding big holdings like his stake in Apple Inc., Buffett appears to be back on the offensive. The 95-year-old chief executive officer, set to leave that role at the end of the year, placed a $1.6 billion bet on UnitedHealth Group Inc. in recent months.
Still, the conglomerate’s cash pile totaled $344 billion at the end of June, close to a record.
Occidental, which is backed by Berkshire, has announced almost $4 billion of asset sales since the start of last year as it works to pay down debt. It bought smaller rival CrownRock LP last year for $10.8 billion.
OxyChem — which makes basic chemicals such as chlorine, sodium hydroxide and vinyl products — is expected to generate pretax income of $800 million to $900 million this year, according to company filings.

London, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pixalate, the leading global platform for ad fraud protection, privacy, and compliance analytics, today released its Q2 2025 report. The report exclusively examines mobile apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store that are registered in the U.S. and likely aimed at children under 13 (i.e., Child-Directed) but do not collect Verifiable Parental Consent (VPC), potentially violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
This report highlights potential privacy violation risks for app developers under COPPA, specifically concerning the collection, sale, or sharing of children’s personal information through likely Child-Directed apps without obtaining lawful VPC, as assessed by Pixalate. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s COPPA Rule governs the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 in the United States (U.S.). It also outlines multiple acceptable methods for obtaining a VPC.
Key Findings Raise Concerns About Children’s Data Privacy
The legal analysis, conducted by Pixalate’s legal and data science teams, examined 1,149 U.S.-registered, likely Child-Directed Google Play and Apple App Store-hosted apps with advertising capabilities:
-
99% Non-Compliance Rate: 1,136 out of 1,149 manually reviewed Google Play and Apple App Store-hosted apps failed to obtain VPC under the COPPA Rule, as assessed by Pixalate
-
Apple App Store violations: 866 of 877 examined Apple iOS-hosted apps (99%) lacked lawful VPC mechanisms
-
Google Play Store Violation: 270 out of 272 examined Google Play-hosted apps lacked lawful VPC mechanisms
-
Additional Personal Information Sharing Violations Discovered in Likely Child-Directed Apps without VPC Measures:
-
40% of the apps shared device IDs in the ad bidstream
-
42% of the apps transmitted IP addresses in the ad bidstream
-
34% disclose location information in the ad bidstream
-
31% of the apps transmitted all three types of personal information in the ad bidstream
Advertising Supply Chain Implications
The report identifies major advertising platforms facilitating monetization within these likely non-compliant apps:

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.
Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Allie Canal, live at the Nasdaq. Let's get a look at some of today's top analyst calls on Wall Street.
First up, Apple. Shares are flat after a new note from Needham analyst Laura Martin, who's calling out what she describes as the hidden cost of good enough.
Martin argues that iPhone prices haven't kept pace with inflation and blames that on a lack of innovation.
She estimates that Apple's revenues would have been about 13% higher since 2019 if the company had raised prices in line with inflation, calling it a missed opportunity tied to what she describes as value destructive pricing policies.
In other words, Apple's added new colors and cameras, but not enough killer features to really justify meaningful price hikes.
That's why Martin is sticking with her hold rating, saying that Apple still lacks the pricing power that comes from true product differentiation.
Next up, Warner Brother's Discovery. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Erlich continues to see unbundling as the most likely path forward with a company split targeted for early Q2 2026.
The view here is that separating the business could unlock more value and potentially spark a bidding war for WBD's studio and streaming assets.
Ahead of third quarter earnings, analysts point to strong box office tailwinds and steady momentum in streaming, although linear TV advertising does remain a challenge.
Bank of America raised its price target on shares to 24 bucks from the prior 16, and reiterated a buy rating citing improving fundamentals, a strong content slate, and multiple catalysts heading into next year.
And finally, Celsius Holdings, shares are rising after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight.
The firm sees another leg higher for the energy drink maker as top line growth accelerates, especially with competitor Alani moving under Pepsi's distribution and Monster once again raising prices.
Morgan Stanley boosted its price target to 70 bucks, implying more than 20% upside from current levels.
The firm cited strong category demand, low elasticity, and easier comps through mid-2025.
Celsius shares have already surged over 100% so far this year, and we'll see where things can go from here.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AAPL. Apple Inc.'s share was trading at $254.43 as of September 23rd. AAPL’s trailing and forward P/E were 38.61 and 31.65 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
Apple Inc., long regarded as the quintessential blue-chip and a staple of modern portfolios, is facing a fundamental transformation that challenges its reputation as an invincible growth engine. Despite a $3 trillion market capitalization and a legacy of innovation, Apple now exhibits the hallmarks of a classic value trap: a premium valuation disconnected from its deteriorating fundamentals.
The company trades at a P/E above 30 while projected revenue growth for fiscal 2025 and 2026 is a modest 6.3% and 4.8%, respectively, reflecting stagnation rather than the premium expansion investors expect. Its historically dominant iPhone business, which generates over half of total revenue, is faltering due to market saturation, lengthening upgrade cycles, and fierce competition, particularly in Greater China, where sales declined 11% year-over-year in Q1 2025 despite price adjustments. Other hardware categories, including wearables and accessories, show signs of saturation, while Mac and iPad growth remains inconsistent.
Apple’s innovation engine is similarly struggling. High-profile projects such as Project Titan were canceled after years of investment, and new initiatives like the Vision Pro have failed to achieve mass-market adoption. In AI, the company trails competitors, forcing a reactive approach that underscores its loss of technological leadership. Compounding internal challenges, Apple faces a coordinated global regulatory assault. U.S. antitrust actions, the EU Digital Markets Act, and Japan’s Mobile Software Competition Act threaten its Services division, which has been central to its high-margin growth, by targeting the walled-garden ecosystem that sustains its premium pricing.
Taken together, Apple’s stagnant core business, failing innovation pipeline, and regulatory pressures reveal a stark disconnect between valuation and reality. The market’s perception is anchored in past glories, masking the risks to future profitability and positioning Apple as a prime example of a value trap, with the potential for significant repricing as the fundamentals catch up.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Apple Inc. (AAPL) by Kontra in October 2024, which highlighted the sticky product ecosystem, steady iPhone replacement cycles, growth in services and wearables, and a strong cash return strategy. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 8.26% since our coverage. The thesis still stands, while Darius Dark Investing shares a contrarian perspective emphasizing stagnating growth, faltering innovation, and rising regulatory pressures challenging Apple’s premium valuation."

(LOGI) has launched two new headsets, the Zone Wireless 2 ES and the Zone Wired 2 for Business, designed to help office workers cut out noise and stay focused.
The headsets use adaptive noise cancellation that changes automatically based on the surroundings and AI-powered microphones that block background sounds like typing or chatter. The headsets are certified for Microsoft Teams, part of Microsoft’s (MSFT) collaboration suite, Zoom and Google Meet, which makes setup easier and reduces IT issues. Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have native Bluetooth call control, allowing headsets to connect directly without a dongle, eliminating the need for a USB port.
Moreover, the wireless version runs up to 20 hours of talk time and 25 hours of listening time, while the wired version removes the need for charging and is a simple plug-and-play option. Both headsets can get remote software updates through Logitech Sync, so employees don’t have to stop working for updates.
Logitech borrowed design features from gaming headsets, such as a strap that spreads weight evenly for long use. The headsets also allow customization of audio and settings through the Logi Tune app. Sustainability is also a part of the design. The company used recycled plastics, metals, and cobalt, and has replaceable parts like earpads and straps to make them last longer.
The Zone Wireless 2 ES will be available in November at $159.99 for the Bluetooth variant or $179.99, which comes with a receiver. The Zone Wired 2 will be available in December for $129.99. This launch fits Logitech’s wider plan to grow its enterprise and hybrid work products, moving beyond consumer accessories into solutions that help businesses improve productivity.
Logitech’s Innovative Product Line Drives Growth
Alongside the new Zone headsets, Logitech has been adding products across gaming, streaming, and spatial computing. At its Logitech G PLAY 2025 event, the company showed one of its biggest portfolio updates so far, covering PC and console gaming, esports, sim racing, and streaming tools.
A highlight was the launch of the Streamlabs AI Streaming Agent, created with NVIDIA’s (NVDA) ACE technology. The tool can act as a co-host and live producer, handling scene switching, clipping highlights, and fixing issues in real time.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-30T13:58:00,Research Shows 3 Keys to Big Tech's Success that Companies Can Implement Now,"Many of the most valuable, biggest names in business — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Tesla — are platform tech companies, using network effects for exponential growth. The keys to these thriving tech giants' success offer lessons for other industries and smaller businesses, says Associate Professor of Marketing Bobby Zhou at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=38c8153dcb1760a410a3f5119c25f4ec6737ab9e4a4a4f8bc89860da6725cc1b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/research-shows-3-keys-big-135800646.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/research-shows-3-keys-big-135800646.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/research-shows-3-keys-big-135800646.html,yahoo.com,200,,"COLLEGE PARK, Md., Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Many of the most valuable, biggest names in business — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta and Tesla — are platform tech companies, using network effects for exponential growth. The keys to these thriving tech giants' success offer lessons for other industries and smaller businesses, says Associate Professor of Marketing Bobby Zhou at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business.
From new research co-authored with Boston University 's Andrei Hagiu, Zhou outlines key strategies that others can implement. He says any brand can benefit from ""platformization"" and harness the power of network effects. He says there are three methods for doing so:
-
Open the door to third parties. Tap into the power, agency and creativity of third parties to build your business. Look at the example of Apple, says Zhou. The company was a pioneer platform player that leveraged outside app developers. ""Now with literally millions of independent third-party developers, their IOS has become one of the most powerful ecosystems,"" says Zhou. And all of those apps on a user's iPhone make it much less likely that they'd switch to a Google or Android phone, regardless of price. ""Apple's app store is probably the most prominent, visible success story in the last 20 years or so, in terms of platform businesses."" The top players have tapped third parties to make themselves the most powerful companies in their industries. But you don't need to be a tech giant to do so, says Zhou. ""Aggressively utilizing those strategies will not only facilitate your growth but also make your brand and business more defensible."" He points to FreeWater.io, which gives customers bottles of water for free by selling ads on packaging to third parties. They also offer consumer add-ons, like nutritional supplements and flavor additives. ""If you do something similar to other companies, but your affiliation with a lot of third parties makes you stand out, consumers will choose you,"" says Zhou.
-
Connect your customers. Building connections among your customers improves your brand's strength, says Zhou. ""Platform companies are so successful because they create ways for their consumers to connect and that creates a lot of value."" For smaller companies, one way to create connections is by organizing conferences to allow people in different industries to interact. Also be sure to learn what your customers are doing in their day-to-day so you can find ways to connect them with each other, says Zhou. That will boost your company's brand equity among customers. One example: Intuit's accounting software QuickBooks, used by both accountants and small to medium business owners. ""QuickBooks started providing an online space where accountants can easily connect with small business owners through the software."" Zhou says companies also need to be aware of the risks. ""Anytime you connect people together, there are risks for confrontations or unpleasant experiences. It's the platform or the business owner's responsibility to determine the extent of moderation."" Think uncivilized conversations on social media, he says. ""When customers have bad experiences, they are much more likely to blame the platforms,"" he says. ""When you are building the bridges, think about how you are going to facilitate, even moderate, the interactions among those users.""
-
Reach your customers' customers. ""Figure out how to reach out to your customers' customers while making sure your first customers are happy,"" says Zhou. ""That creates value for everyone."" He pointed to OpenTable, which started as an accounting software for restaurants. OpenTable figured out a way to reach their customers' customers: the diners, to use their app to make reservations. Another example: the Shopify platform, which provides online storefronts for retailers. Shopify also built an app for shoppers, where they see their preferred retailers, but also get suggestions to explore new stores."

Sep 30 - Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 17 launch has started to lose steam just weeks after hitting the market, according to analysts at Jefferies Financial Group (JEF). While early orders looked strong and briefly pushed AAPL shares higher, new tracking data suggests that sales momentum is fading, especially in the U.S.
Apple stock was down 0.5% on Monday.
Jefferies noted that delivery lead times, the gap between placing an order and receiving the device, have shortened across all four iPhone 17 models.
Analysts view this as a sign that demand is cooling. The U.S. remains the weakest market among the six we track, Jefferies wrote, pointing out that many buyers may have already upgraded earlier this year due to tariff concerns. The brokerage monitors sales trends in the U.S., China, Hong Kong, Germany, the U.K., and Japan.
Apple now faces pressure to deliver fresh features that can reignite consumer demand. The company has teased new artificial intelligence upgrades for its 2026 iPhone lineup, including a revamped Siri.
Is AAPL Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 42 analysts, the average target price for Apple Inc is $245.14 with a high estimate of $310.00 and a low estimate of $175.00. The average target implies a downside of -3.65% from the current price of $254.43.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Apple Inc in one year is $224.16, suggesting a downside of -11.90% from the current price of $254.43. Gf value is Gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-30T12:15:00,Is Growth Stalling for MP Materials Investors?,"MP Materials was in the right place at the right time, but there is a lot of hard work to be done from here.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2e973b1a1c22d427a77d7a0d7476d4192bbe36dbc5f4e13898e56a1efa2f1fa1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/is-growth-stalling-for-mp-materials-investors/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/is-growth-stalling-for-mp-materials-investors/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/is-growth-stalling-for-mp-materials-investors/,fool.com,200,,"In the second quarter of 2025, MP Materials' (MP -8.54%) revenue declined sequentially from the first quarter. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and earnings both fell deeper into the red. That's not a change that most investors will find pleasing to read, but the company's future remains very bright.
Here's why MP Materials' growth isn't stalling, even though there's a lot of heavy lifting for the company to do from here.
What does MP Materials do?
MP Materials mines for and processes rare earth metals. These metals are vital to the technology sector and get used in everything from cellphones to missiles. That said, MP Materials is really best viewed as a mining company.
That's important because mining is a very capital-intensive business. A company has to find a place to mine, get approval for it, build the mine, operate it (in this case also process the output into usable rare earth metals products), and then return the mine back to its pre-mine state once it is depleted. MP Materials is really just at the very beginning of this process, which is the most expensive from a capital investment point of view.
That said, MP Materials finds itself in a very enviable position thanks to geopolitical issues. The new U.S. tariff regime has led to friction with China, which is the world's largest producer of rare earth metals. China has been very willing to limit access to these vital metals as it vies for the best tariff deal. That, essentially, has put the world on notice that China can't be counted on as a supplier of rare earth metals.
MP Materials has a huge opportunity to exploit
MP Materials didn't just magically find itself here. The company's specific goal was to create a rare earth metals supplier that is located in an economically and politically stable region. The company is exactly where it wanted to be and that is leading to a huge influx of cash.
The U.S. government has invested in MP Materials. Apple has inked a sizable deal with the company. And, after the stock advance following these two events, the company was able to sell shares into the market at attractive prices. Demand was so strong for MP Materials' stock that it was able to sell more shares than it had originally planned.
This is all very good news from a growth perspective. It means that MP Materials has the cash it needs to keep building out its business. And that, in turn, means that it still has a huge growth opportunity ahead that will be easier to achieve since access to capital is less of a constraint. If anything, the growth opportunity isn't stalling out, it is getting more attractive.
Don't expect instant results at MP Materials
Despite the positives here, there's still one small problem. MP Materials is a young miner that is building out its business. That takes time and will likely mean red ink for at least a while longer.
MP Materials stock is up over 350% over the past year, with most of that gain coming after the U.S. government's investment in the company. So while the business has huge growth potential, a lot of that appears to have been priced into the stock in a very short period of time. Investors should probably tread cautiously with MP Materials, which looks like it has become a story stock at this point.
If the story doesn't happen as expected (including as quickly as expected), the shares could quickly turn lower again even if the long-term opportunity for the business remains robust."

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-30T09:24:00,"For data center contracts, it’s all about the fine print","Construction attorneys share how contractors can protect themselves in the high-demand, fast-track environment.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b734f1f903a38c17c2ef65eb01846d7514686ab16a2eaf2e3bcd780f05b10e3f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.constructiondive.com/news/data-center-contracts/761391/,https://www.constructiondive.com/news/data-center-contracts/761391/,https://www.constructiondive.com/news/data-center-contracts/761391/,constructiondive.com,200,,"This feature is a part of “The Dotted Line” series, which takes an in-depth look at the complex legal landscape of the construction industry. To view the entire series, click here.
From the outside, a data center structure looks like a simple warehouse. Its construction contract would reveal a different story.
Data center construction is booming in the U.S. Contractors on the ground report being buried in early-stage activity, even amid concerns of a slowdown.
For example, Apple unveiled plans earlier this summer to invest at least $20 billion on two data centers in Pennsylvania. Hyperscaler CoreWeave also recently selected a joint venture of New York City-based Turner Construction and Wohlsen Construction of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to build its $6 billion facility.
For contractors looking to get in on the action, the math is simple. Win a data center award, collect a large check. Landing the right contract, though, is anything but simple.
“Data center projects tend to be relatively simple structures with really sophisticated power and utility needs and really unique equipment requirements,” said Andrew Greene, office managing partner in the Seattle office of law firm Perkins Coie. “From a risk management standpoint, it’s more dealing with supply chain issues, dealing with labor issues.”
Most data centers use engineering, procurement and construction contracts or turnkey models, where one contractor designs and builds the facility, said Trent Cotney, a partner and construction team leader in the Tampa, Florida, office of law firm Adams & Reese. That structure simplifies ownership but creates a heavier lift for the contractor.
“What makes it more complicated is the amount of regulation that goes into a lot of these contracts,” Cotney told Construction Dive. “There is adherence to fire codes, NFPA, NEC, permitting related issues, all those types of things.”
Fast track delivery
Developers are more eager than ever to capture artificial intelligence demand as quickly as possible. It’s made fast-track delivery on data center projects become the industry norm, said Cotney.
But speed also magnifies the risks.
The rush to build swiftly “puts a big burden on the contractor,” said Cotney. Greene noted many projects sit in remote locations, where sourcing enough specialized labor is already difficult. The combination means a greater potential for mistakes.
“We do a lot of OSHA defense for construction and general industry, and unfortunately, we’ve had some incidents on these types of projects,” Cotney told Construction Dive. “Anytime you’re dealing with high voltage, this level of fast track, it requires operational excellence. Navigating safety in this type of environment is absolutely critical.”
Materials in the spotlight
Copper ranks one of the most key inputs on these jobs, given its central role in power distribution and cabling. Recent tariffs on the material have caused a host of problems for contractors with data center projects.
“Copper is a pretty important element of a lot of the equipment that goes into these types of projects,” Greene told Construction Dive. The prices have fluctuated significantly in the last year, and it’s expected to continue over the next year and a half, he said.
“That price fluctuation tends to impact projects indirectly, through the availability and cost of the equipment that gets installed,” said Greene.
Cotney highlighted tariff-related increases won’t show up in the data immediately. Instead, these impacts work their way through the supply chain over four to 12 months, depending on how quickly inventory turns over and whether distributors absorb some of the added expense.
That delay makes it harder for contractors to predict cost impacts.
To protect themselves, Cotney said many firms insert price acceleration provisions that allow for contract adjustments if a material rises more than 5%, or they may use tariff-specific clauses tied to U.S. Customs data. Others pursue strategies such as pre-purchasing, or negotiating direct purchase orders where the owner buys the material outright.
“The end result is where you’re basically going to the end user, the owner or developer, and saying here is the tariff hit. Here is the direct impact of that. Here’s a change order reflected on that,” Cotney told Construction Dive. “And you have a contractual basis to do that.”
Attorneys also flagged other sensitive inputs. Equipment sourced internationally, such as transformers or generators, often dominates the risk profile, said Greene, since availability and shipping schedules drive the entire project timeline.
Cotney added aluminum, fiber optics, lithium batteries and refrigerants can all complicate negotiations as well. Cooling systems, in particular, pose unique challenges.
“There have been a variety of EPA regulations in the past that truncated what cooling systems can be used,” Cotney told Construction Dive. “There’s a large agenda on this administration as far as rolling back some stuff, but to my knowledge, some of those still are up in the air. So, being able to obtain the refrigerants needed to power these giant cooling systems within these data centers is something that’s unique.”
He added that emerging technologies in this area, such as liquid cooling, could further shift how contracts address these risks in the years ahead.
“I think there’s going to be some major evolution of how we go about cooling these things to make it more efficient,” said Cotney. “But for now, refrigerant is a concern.”
Workforce and cybersecurity
Labor is another pain point in contract talks.
Data center construction projects require many skilled electricians and mechanical workers, many of whom may hold temporary immigration status. That creates compliance challenges for owners and developers, who may require certified payrolls even when not federally mandated, said Cotney.
“A lot of the workforce that I see being used on these data center projects are under H-2B or temporary protective status, depending on what’s being done,” he said. “Immigration and workforce is obviously a big topic for all of construction right now.”
Security adds yet another layer. With these hyperscale facilities underpinning AI and cloud systems, guarding design and construction documents is more important than ever.
“What are we doing to protect information that is going to be conveyed on this construction because access to how this thing was built could, if it falls in the wrong hands, potentially be a huge cyber threat,” said Cotney. “So, confidentiality, cybersecurity protection, even as it relates to the contract and the contract documents, is critical because of the amount of information.”
Follow the money

“This is where the money is at right now. There is a lot of money being put out both by government and private industry to move this forward light speed,” Cotney told Construction Dive. “So, ton of profit, but also a lot of risk and I think you need to assess it in your contract.”"

However, both companies have benefited from recent positive developments, and their shares surged over the past month or so.
Here's some even better news for investors: There could be plenty of upside left for these market leaders. Apple and Eli Lilly are top picks for both growth-oriented and income-seeking investors.
1. Apple
Apple has faced several issues this year. First, while its tech peers are benefiting from their work in artificial intelligence (AI), the iPhone maker's initiatives in this field haven't been as impressive as some would have liked, and definitely not on par with those of its similarly-sized competitors. Second, heavy tariffs on imported goods -- especially from China, where Apple manufactures a significant portion of its products -- could erode its margins and bottom line.
Even so, Apple rebounded over the past few months, partly thanks to efforts to appease the Trump administration and avoid extremely punitive tariffs. More recently, during its latest event, the company announced its lineup of new products. There was nothing groundbreaking related to AI, but some analysts believe Apple's new iPhone 17 line could once again kick-start a strong renewal cycle.
Given all that's happening, the stock has risen by 17% over the past six months, and I think it remains attractive for long-term investors.
Apple's most recent results, for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2025 (ended June 28), were strong and continued to show momentum in a key category: active devices. Revenue increased 10% year over year to $94 billion, earnings per share rose 12% to $1.57 compared to the year-ago period, and active devices reached new all-time highs across all categories.
With more than 2 billion devices in circulation -- and more than 1 billion paid subscriptions -- Apple's services segment is slowly but surely growing. The segment's juicier margins will, in the long run, help the company significantly improve its bottom line, provided it maintains or grows its installed base. Apple's recent quarterly update, along with expectations for the newest iPhones and other devices, demonstrates that it's capable of doing so.
Lastly, the stock is a terrific pick for dividend seekers. True, it has an unimpressive forward yield of around 0.4%. However, Apple generates a substantial amount of free cash flow, has increased its dividends by 100% over the past decade, and boasts a highly conservative payout ratio of 16%, which leaves ample room for further dividend increases. Apple can still deliver market-beating returns over the long run while consistently growing its dividend.
2. Eli Lilly
Eli Lilly's shares dropped Aug. 7 after it reported mixed phase 3 results for its investigational oral GLP-1 candidate, orforglipron. The medicine induced a mean weight loss of 12.4% in overweight or obese (but not diabetic) patients over 72 weeks. Wall Street was hoping for better weight-loss numbers, and lower rates of clinical-trial dropouts due to adverse reactions. However, following that debacle, the company has performed well: The stock is up 15% since.
One reason Lilly is rebounding is that it reported data from another phase 3 study for orforglipron, this time in overweight or obese and diabetic patients. The medicine's weight loss numbers and A1C reductions in this study were significant, positioning it for regulatory submissions. The therapy also proved more effective than Novo Nordisk's oral GLP-1 drug, Rybelsus, in a head-to-head study.
Eli Lilly is already a dominant player in the weight loss market. The approval of orforglipron -- likely by early 2027 at the latest -- should cement the company's status in the field.
In the meantime, expect to see further pipeline progress for the drugmaker. Its candidate retatrutide looks perhaps even more promising than its current crown jewel, Zepbound. Retatrutide induced weight loss of up to 24.2% in 48 weeks at the highest dose in a phase 2 study, with weight still falling afterwards, while Zepbound had a mean weight loss of up to 22.5% after 72 weeks. Retatrutide still needs to complete phase 3 results, but things are looking promising.
With these upcoming new launches, Lilly should maintain strong sales and earnings growth for the foreseeable future. The drugmaker's second-quarter revenue was up 38% year over year to $15.6 billion, an outstanding performance for a pharmaceutical company of this size.
Lastly, there's the dividend, which has increased by 200% in the past decade. The company's payout ratio of about 44% looks reasonable. The forward yield is a modest 0.8%, but Eli Lilly's strong underlying business and willingness to grow its payouts more than compensate for that."

This followed growth of 0.7% in the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter, which was also unrevised, the ONS said on Tuesday.
The figures come a day after chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered a speech at the Labour party conference, in which she pledged an approach rooted in ""securonomics"", emphasising economic stability and sensible spending over calls to shake up fiscal rules.

""In the months ahead, we will face further tests, with the choices to come made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and the long-term damage done to our economy, which is becoming ever clearer,"" she said.
In interviews ahead of her speech in Liverpool on Monday, Reeves declined to rule out some tax rises in the autumn budget, which she is set to deliver on 26 November.
Reeves' reiterated commitment to economic stability comes as she faces increasing pressure over the state of public finances, with the latest data showing government borrowing surged to £18bn in August.
Commenting on Tuesday's ONS data, Capital Economics chief UK economist Paul Dales said: ""The small upward revisions to real GDP in recent years partly helps to explain the strength of inflation and means that productivity growth wasn’t quite as weak as previously thought.

""The OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] will take these revisions into account ahead of the budget, but they are very unlikely to prevent the downgrade to the OBR’s productivity growth forecasts that will contribute to the Chancellor having to raise some money, most likely via higher taxes.""
He said that ""in Q2 itself, the shape of growth was a little more encouraging"".
""Most striking was that the change in business investment was revised from -4.0% q/q to -1.1% q/q,"" he said. ""This was offset by smaller contributions to GDP growth from net trade, inventories and the alignment adjustment."""

But Apple (AAPL 0.54%) stands out as a company that's not only done that -- but it's also become a household name. Thanks to the company's strong leadership, from co-founder Steve Jobs to current chief executive officer Tim Cook, and wildly popular products like the iPhone and Mac, Apple took the spotlight, and importantly, has stayed there.
Could another company possibly follow in those footsteps? One already is a significant way there, and my prediction is this artificial intelligence (AI) stock will be the next Apple of the 2030s. Let's check out this amazing growth story.
A $4 trillion giant
It's important to note that this player already is a market giant and even surpasses Apple when it comes to market value -- it's worth more than $4 trillion, while Apple is valued at about $3.7 trillion. But, in my opinion, this player still has room to run in other areas, such as products and services, and steps taken now and in the coming years should secure its spot as a long-term leader. The company I'm talking about is Nvidia (NVDA 0.27%).
You probably already have heard a lot about Nvidia thanks to its role in the ongoing AI boom. The company designs the graphics processing units (GPUs) -- or chips -- that power crucial AI tasks, and it sells a variety of other related offerings as well. On top of this, Nvidia has a long history in the market of video games, selling GPUs to power the images and action on the screen -- this, in fact, was Nvidia's first big business.
The foray into AI has been a particularly wise move as it's helped Nvidia's earnings soar in the double- and triple-digits quarter after quarter. Since Nvidia put its focus on this area early in the AI story, it established the first-to-market advantage -- and this has helped it stay steps ahead of rivals when it comes to innovation.
Though Nvidia's path so far may seem incredible, with a 1,200% gain in the stock price over the past five years, the company is on track for what may be a broader market position in the years to come. So, its dominance and presence across technology may be even greater in the 2030s.
Use of AI in the real world
Here's what I mean. Right now, the AI infrastructure buildout is happening, and this spending may total as much as $4 trillion by 2030. Nvidia should benefit greatly from that as tech giants need its GPUs to power data centers. The 2030s then may bring greater use of AI in the real world, including AI in explosive growth areas such as robotics, as well as the use of AI in quantum computing -- which may be a major growth area in the coming decade.
Nvidia will be a key player in these next growth phases since the company's chips power not only the training of models but the actual use of these models, the ""thinking"" processes as these models do their jobs.
Meanwhile, Nvidia today is making key moves to broaden its position across the computing market. To ensure its position in quantum computing, it's establishing a quantum research center -- so it's involved in this area as of now. And, importantly, earlier this month it announced an investment in Intel that would bring its chiplets to Intel's personal computer (PC) systems and incorporate Intel's top central processing units (CPUs) into Nvidia's leading AI platforms. This strengthens Nvidia's AI offerings and expands its presence in the PC market.
Maintaining gaming leadership
At the same time, Nvidia hasn't neglected its position in the gaming market. In the most recent quarter, gaming revenue jumped 49% to more than $4 billion. This is a smaller market than its overall AI business -- which brought in more than $40 billion in revenue -- but still represents a significant growth driver.
So, as Apple has dominated in consumer and business tech products in recent years, Nvidia is well positioned to do the same in the AI world -- from personal computers to data centers. Apple has been immediately linked to communication and computing over the past several years -- in the 2030s, Nvidia may be looked to as a general communication and computing giant too.
It's also important to note that, like Apple, Nvidia is driven by a leader with a strong vision. Jensen Huang co-founded Nvidia, and as CEO, he has what it takes to help the company take the next leap in its growth story. So, my prediction is Nvidia will be the Apple of the 2030s -- a company everyone is talking about and one that should continue to deliver solid growth to investors."

- The top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee are seeking details from 10 major U.S. companies, including tech giants Amazon, Apple and Meta, regarding their recruitment and hiring practices related to H-1B visa holders.
- Over the past few years, the companies have leaned heavily on H-1B visa petitions to fill tech-related positions, favoring foreigners over American workers, Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the committee’s chairman and ranking member, respectively, said in a recent press release announcing the probe.
- “We are concerned about some troubling employment trends in the tech industry,” the lawmakers said in letters to the firms. The list of companies under scrutiny also includes Google, Microsoft, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, Deloitte, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Tata Consultancy Services.
Dive Insight:
The Senate investigation comes amid a growing debate over the impact of H-1B visa hiring on U.S. workers, particularly in the tech industry.
It also comes at a time when the unemployment level in America’s tech sector is “well above” the overall jobless rate, according to the press release.
On Sept. 19, President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions, citing “systemic abuse” of the program.
“The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor,” the order states.
The abrupt and dramatic change sowed confusion among employers as it quickly went into effect at midnight on Sept. 21, according to an article published by law firm Davis Wright Tremaine.
“Much is still unclear and litigation is expected,” the article said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has called on the administration to withdraw the new fee, saying it could “impede economic growth,” as previously reported by CFO Dive.
In fiscal 2025, Amazon applied for and received approval to hire at least 10,044 H-1B employees, the highest number of any U.S. company, Grassley and Durbin said in their letter to the tech giant, noting the company has laid off tens of thousands of employees in recent years.
“With all the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the lawmakers wrote.
Similar concerns were raised in the other letters.
Among other questions, Amazon and the other companies were asked to “explain in detail” whether they make a good faith effort to fill open positions with Americans before filing H-1B petitions. They were also asked whether they have displaced any American employees with H-1B holders.
Spokespersons for Microsoft and Cognizant declined to comment.
Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, Deloitte and Tata Consultancy didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."

This was up from 0.9% growth in August and was above the three-month average of 1% inflation, the retail trade association said.
The BRC's latest shop price monitor showed that non-food inflation increased 0.3% on the previous month. Year-on-year non-food prices were still 0.1% lower, though this was higher than the 12-month decline 0.8% prices to August.
Helen Dickinson, CEO of the BRC, said: ""A year and a half of non-food deflation looks set to come to an end, as inflationary pressures spread beyond food. DIY and gardening saw rising prices, while some back-to-school categories continued to see reductions as retailers offered promotions on electricals such as laptops ahead of the new academic year.""
Food inflation of 4.2% in September was unchanged on a year-on-year basis, compared to the previous month but was above the three-month average of 4.1%. Fresh food inflation came in at 4.1%, while ambient food prices grew by 4.2% year-on-year, both unchanged from August's BRC data.

Dickinson said: ""Food inflation held steady after seven consecutive months of rises but increased labour and energy costs continue to push up input prices for many farmers, particularly of cattle, with dairy and beef prices remaining high.
""Households are finding shopping increasingly expensive. The impact on retailers and their supply chain of both global factors and higher national insurance and wage costs is playing out in prices for consumers.
""The new packaging tax, set to take effect in October, will put further upward pressure on inflation.""
She added that while retailers continue to absorb costs as much as possible, ""any further tax rises in the upcoming budget would keep shop prices higher for longer.""
""Ultimately, it is British households who will bear the consequences – positive or negative – of the chancellor’s decisions,"" said Dickinson.
The BRC warned last week that food inflation would rise and remain well above 5% into 2026 if the retail industry were hit with further tax rises in the autumn budget.
The UK's headline rate of inflation held steady in August, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), released in September. It said that the consumer prices index grew by 3.8% in August, which was unchanged from the previous month's reading but still represented a 19-month high."

Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, was seen smiling as he accompanied Tiffany Trump, the US president’s youngest daughter, down the red carpet at Windsor Castle’s state banquet.
He exchanged small talk with the Prince of Wales and enjoyed a prime spot at the table, sitting a few seats down from King Charles and the US president.
But while the bosses of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI trumpeted multibillion-pound investments in the UK as part of the visit, Cook had much less to say.
Apple was absent from any of the investment announcements made by the UK Government, which totalled £150bn from some of America’s biggest companies.
Nor, unlike some of his counterparts, did he take to the airwaves to hail the benefits of being in Britain.
Unusually, for someone who regularly documents their visits around the world, Cook also did not post on social media about the event. By contrast, last week he tweeted five times about a short trip to Japan.
“The likes of [Salesforce chief Marc] Benioff and Jensen [Huang, the Nvidia founder] were everywhere, and he certainly wasn’t,” says one investor present at many of the private business events during the state visit.
The silence may mean nothing, particularly as Apple typically refuses to appear on press releases alongside competitors, and Cook has a busy diary.
But a close follower might also see evidence of a cooling relationship between the iPhone giant and the UK.
The order, known as a Technical Capability Notice, struck at the heart of Apple’s promise to protect users’ privacy, a key element of the company’s sales pitch.
The UK is already one of the most active countries in terms of requesting data from Apple, according to the company’s law enforcement reports, but the demand was unique among Western nations.
To put the request into context, only China has previously demanded that the company compromise the encryption that protects people’s iCloud accounts.
Neither the Government nor Apple has acknowledged the secret order, but the Silicon Valley tech giant has pushed back fiercely.
In February, it disabled encryption for iCloud backups in Britain – sending a message that it would rather remove a feature than be seen to weaken it – and said it was “gravely disappointed” at the situation.
Apple has challenged the case at the secretive Investigatory Powers Tribunal, and in August, Trump’s national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard said the Home Office had agreed to drop the matter.
However, there has yet to be any official confirmation of this, and a subsequent court document indicated the notice was still live.
“No other government has this power,” says Gus Hosein of campaign group Privacy International. “And when industry gets out of line with this Government’s interests, it strikes out.”
The tech giant is also feeling the heat from empowered competition regulators. In July, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it planned to classify Apple as having “strategic market status” in the smartphone industry.
If it follows through with the threat, the CMA has wide-ranging powers that could see it crack down on lucrative parts of Apple’s business, including the App Store, which accounts for billions of dollars in revenue.
The CMA may also require Apple to offer more choice regarding web browsers and enforce interoperability.
This could allow rival smartwatch and headphone manufacturers to connect to iPhones in the same way that the Apple Watch and AirPods do.
In response to the threat, Apple has accused the CMA of an “EU-style” crackdown, claiming that the UK regulator is imitating Brussels in its battle against big tech.
Worryingly for Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves’s growth ambitions, the company also suggested that the proposed action might affect its investment plans in Britain.
“There is no basis for this intervention, which would be unnecessary and send a hostile signal to businesses making long-term investments in innovation and infrastructure in the UK,” it told the CMA.
Last week, in a potential sign of where things could lead, the company stepped up its battle with Brussels, warning that it could withhold new products from Europe.
Meanwhile, the CMA has so far held firm and rejected the comparison to Europe’s digital laws, saying Britain’s competition regime “works in a fundamentally different way to the EU”.
However, Britain’s fractious relationship with one of the world’s biggest tech companies has not gone unnoticed on the other side of the Atlantic.
Cook has long had a healthy relationship with Trump, who has taken a dim view of foreign governments’ attempts to rein in America’s tech giants.
Trump described the Home Office’s encryption demand as “something that you hear about with China”, while JD Vance, the vice-president, was also instrumental in getting Britain to pull back on its demands.
Trump’s White House has also tacitly criticised the proposed CMA crackdown.
In response to news of the regulator’s actions, it told the Maga-friendly news magazine The Washington Examiner: “The administration has made its position on digital services taxes and other unfair regulations targeting American technology firms abundantly clear, and we are actively addressing our concerns in discussions with our trading partners.”
Cook may not have made a big impression during Trump’s visit to Britain. But if his presence led to the president pushing Starmer to back off Apple, then he might have considered it worth the trip."

After all, AMZN is only 9% from a 52-week and all-time high of $242 a share (post-split basis).
That said, the rebound in AMZN has been subpar after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs rattled the broader market earlier in the year.
Rebounding +15% in the last six months, Amazon stock is now virtually flat in 2025, being the worst performer out of its ""Mag 7"" big tech peers, just behind Apple’s AAPL YTD gains of over +1% with Nvidia’s NVDA +35% leading the way.
Keeping this in mind, investors may be wondering if Amazon stock is being overlooked at the moment and if AMZN will keep rebounding.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the companies that soared by double- and triple-digits last week. Intel grew its share price by 20.01 percent week-on-week to hit a new all-time high as investor sentiment was boosted by news that it was courting Apple Inc. to invest in its business. On Friday alone, Intel Corporation (INTC) soared to a new all-time high of $36.30 before trimming gains to finish the day just up by 4.44 percent at $35.50 apiece after announcements that it was courting Apple Inc. to invest as part of its efforts to bolster its revival and expansion program.
Initial negotiations are currently underway, with a focus on how to work more closely. Talks, however, could still fall through. Earlier this month, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) secured a $5 billion investment from chip giant Nvidia Corp., covering the development of AI infrastructures and personal computing products that accelerate applications and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise, and consumer markets. Additionally, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia will focus on seamlessly connecting their architectures using the latter’s NVLink, which would integrate the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Intel’s leading CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem to deliver cutting-edge solutions for customers.

Doesn’t mean they can’t do exactly what they’re doing now, but they have big plans. David, we’re at that moment now, where I think we should be, let’s say suspect, suspicious, of any of these things. Because, the idea that Intel is like a flailing company, the stock has moved up big. We know that they’ve got money from a bunch of people. They have government money, they have Softbank money, uh, they have NVIDIA money. I think that they could be interested in money from anyone. I don’t know why this came down to Apple.

Jefferies reiterated its Hold rating on Apple (AAPL, Financials) with a $205.82 price target, citing weakening momentum in the company's new iPhone lineup. Apple shares closed at $255.46, up 17.5% over the past six months, leaving them above the target and near-trillion-dollar highs.
The firm noted shorter lead times for the iPhone 17 Pro in China and Hong Kong compared to last year, while Pro Max lead times also fell in the U.S. and China. Standard iPhone 17 models remain in high demand, though wait times are easing across most markets.
Resale values for the iPhone 17 Pro Max in Hong Kong dropped 51% week-over-week, though still above 2024 levels. Analysts said higher average selling prices could offset a weaker product mix.
Other analysts remain more bullish: Evercore ISI raised its Apple target to $290, and Bank of America reiterated a Buy with a $270 target, pointing to carrier incentives and strong upgrade potential. Apple is also working on Veritas, an internal AI app to revamp Siri, and has begun discussions with Intel for a possible investment.
At the same time, Apple has pressed the EU to scale back its Digital Markets Act, citing challenges for its business model. The next key catalysts for investors include iPhone 17 demand updates and progress on AI initiatives in 2026."

The company says Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building “production-ready” applications, rather than just prototypes, representing a leap in reliability from previous AI models.
Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be available via the Claude API and in the Claude chatbot. The pricing for developers is the same as Claude Sonnet 4: $3 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, or more than the entire “Lord of the Rings” series) and $15 per million output tokens.
In the last year, Anthropic’s AI models have emerged as a favorite among developers and enterprises, in large part due to their strong performance on software engineering tasks. Apple and Meta reportedly use Claude AI models internally, and Anthropic has made a significant business selling API access to AI coding applications such as Cursor, Windsurf, and Replit. Recently, OpenAI’s GPT-5 has challenged Anthropic’s dominance in the space, outperforming Claude models on a variety of coding benchmarks.
Anthropic says Claude Sonnet 4.5 offers industry-leading performance on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified. However, Anthropic AI researcher David Hershey tells TechCrunch that it is hard to capture Claude Sonnet 4.5’s performance on benchmarks alone.
Hershey says he’s seen Claude Sonnet 4.5 code autonomously for up to 30 hours during early trials with some enterprise customers. In that time, he watched the AI model not only build an application, but also stand up database services, purchase domain names, and perform a SOC 2 audit to make sure the product was secure.
In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Cursor CEO Michael Truell said Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents state-of-the-art coding performance, specifically on longer horizon tasks. Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said in a statement that Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a “new generation of coding models.”
Anthropic also claims that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is its most aligned frontier AI model yet, with lower rates of sycophancy and deception than previous models. The company says it has also improved Claude’s susceptibility to prompt injection attacks.
Alongside the launch of Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic is also launching the Claude Agent SDK. The company says this is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code and can be used to help developers build their own agents.
Anthropic is also releasing a temporary research preview called “Imagine with Claude” for Max subscribers, which shows the AI model generating software on the fly. The company says the model will respond to user requests in real time, with no predetermined functionality or prewritten code.
The tense competition in the AI world has made it common for companies to ship flagship models every few months. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is launching less than two months after Anthropic’s last AI model, Claude Opus 4.1. These rapid production cycles make it difficult for any company to hold a meaningful lead for very long."

It’s not just Gen Z who can’t afford the cost of living right now. Even wealthy boomers who have retired with at least six figures in savings are feeling the pinch.
That’s according to a study from Prudential Financial. The Fortune 500 investment, money management, and retirement planning firm surveyed around 20,000 people over the age of 50 and found retirees are living well below their means.
Married 65-year-olds with at least $100,000 in financial assets withdrew an average of 2.1% of their savings annually—that is, nearly half the usual spending rate of retirees, according to the research.
David Blanchett, head of retirement research at PGIM DC Solutions, an affiliate of Prudential Financial and coauthor of the study, told the Wall Street Journal that since 1926, retirees have been able to spend 4% of their savings per annum without risking running out of money in the last 30 years of their lives.
But now, the prospect of living to upwards of 95 years old is becoming an increasingly likely reality for older people—and you can bet the cost of housing, health care, bills, and food is going to go up in that time.
It’s why instead of splashing out on those golden years with trips around the world on a cruise, spending below one’s means has become prevalent especially among wealthier retirees, the survey concluded.
Retirees feel unprepared for the jobless years—a ‘consumption puzzle’
Researchers are calling the trend the retirement consumption puzzle.
Essentially, even after grinding and gathering wealth for decades, retirees feel unprepared for the jobless years looming ahead and continue to squirrel away what money they have instead of finally enjoying it.
One paper bluntly concluded that “individuals do not plan rationally for an expected reduction in income at retirement.”
It bucks the general assumption that boomers—who hold more than half of America’s wealth—are kicking back their feet and enjoying a comfortable retirement in their mortgage-free McMansions.
In reality, according to Federal Reserve data, fewer than half of all boomers have saved enough for retirement, and worryingly, 43% of 55- to 64-year-olds had no retirement savings at all in 2022. That year, 30% of people over 65 were economically insecure and made less than $27,180.
It’s no wonder that many are actually going back to work to live out their retirement dreams.
The new retirement is no retirement
“Unretiring” has become a global phenomenom. In the U.K., nearly 20% of baby boomers and late Gen Xers are rejoining the workforce—or planning to. Meanwhile, the number of those who have continued to work past 65 in the U.S. has quadrupled since the 1980s, according to the Pew Research Center."

But for investors, it’s not just the specs and sleek design turning heads; this launch could signal important shifts in Apple’s growth and revenue. Therefore, it is important for stockholders to understand the bigger picture.

The new iPhone 17 models bring upgrades like the advanced A19 Pro chip and improved battery life, along with new features tailored for creators and mainstream users alike. Even the iPhone Air, now slimmer and more affordable, aims to attract a wider range of buyers. These changes hint at strong holiday sales and a healthy upgrade cycle. Below is how they can directly impact Apple’s market performance.
Also here is how you can own Apple Stock without buying shares directly.
How This Affects Apple’s Market Position
For investors, the iPhone 17 lineup strengthens Apple’s grip on the premium smartphone market but also signals challenges. The Pro models target high-end users who drive a significant portion of Apple’s profit growth. Yet, CNBC reported that intense competition from Chinese manufacturers and emerging AI-driven devices could slow momentum, putting pressure on Apple’s market share and stock valuation.
With the hardware cycle maturing, analysts said Apple’s future stock growth depends increasingly on services revenue and ecosystem expansion. Even so, flagship iPhone sales remain a major revenue pillar that investors closely monitor. How well the iPhone 17 series performs this holiday season may set the tone for both earnings and stock sentiment.

Stock Outlook: Risks and Opportunities
Apple’s stock showed moderate fluctuations around the iPhone 17 launch as investors had mixed reactions. According to Investing.com, Morgan Stanley reported that early demand for the iPhone 17 is higher than last year’s, fueled by longer lead times and improved supply, supporting an Overweight rating on Apple stock. Despite short-term volatility, this indicates a potential stabilizing upgrade cycle that could lift sales.
Bloomberg reported two analyst downgrades citing underwhelming innovation and competitive tech pressure, tempering enthusiasm despite initial gains. The stock is down about 5% year-to-date, lagging some tech peers, though it remains resilient over longer terms. Bloomberg analysts said Apple’s pricing strategy, higher prices on premium models, could support earnings despite slower unit growth."

- Intel shares remain in the spotlight after soaring 20% last week, boosted by reports the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
- Since breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, the stock has continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week.
- Investors should watch critical overhead areas on Intel's chart around $45 and $56, while also monitoring major support levels near $30 and $26.
Intel (INTC) shares remain in the spotlight after soaring last week amid investor optimism that the embattled chipmaker could secure additional investments.
The stock gained 20% last week and has risen more than 40% since the start of the month, boosted recently by reports that the chipmaker is soliciting investments from Apple (AAPL) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). Intel earlier this month receiving a $5 billion pledge from AI Favorite Nvidia (NVDA), which came not long after the U.S. government announced it had taken a 10% stake in the company.
Analysts say they anticipate new developments on the investment front spurring more gains for the stock in the near term, though cautioned they still have concerns about the company's fundamentals. Intel shares were down 4% at around $34 in the opening minutes of Monday's session.
Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and identify critical price levels worth monitoring.
Multi-Month Trading Range Breakout
Since breaking out above a multi-month trading range earlier this month, Intel shares have continued to trend sharply higher and closed above the closely watched 200-week moving average last week.
Importantly, the stock’s recent advance has occurred on above-average trading volume, raising the prospect of follow-through buying.
Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator sits in overbought territory near a reading that marked local tops in the stock in January 2020 and December 2023.
Let’s identify major overhead areas on Intel’s chart to watch if the shares keep climbing and also point out support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements.
Critical Overhead Areas to Watch
The first overhead area to watch sits around $45. This location may provide resistance near a trendline that connects a range of peaks and troughs on the chart stretching all the way back to May 2019. This level also roughly coincides with the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level when applying a grid from the December 2023 high to the lower trendline of the stock’s multi-month trading range.
A successful close above this critical level could trigger a rally toward $56. Investors who have accumulated shares at lower prices may decide to lock in profits in this region near a horizontal line that links a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between October 2019 and January 2022.
Major Support Levels to Monitor
During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $30 level. The shares could attract buying interest in this location near several countertrend highs in late 2022 and early 2023, which also closely align with a sideways trend on the chart from May to July last year.
Finally, a deeper pullback in Intel shares may see a retest of major support around $26. This area on the chart marks the top of the stock's multi-month trading range and could flip from prior resistance into future support.

We recently published Analysts Are Talking About These 10 Stocks as AI Investments Continue to Grow. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Alex Kantrowitz, Big Technology Founder, said in a latest program on CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has finally shifted the market focus from AI to its core business of iPhones with the latest model launch of its flagship device. The analyst thinks Apple’s lack of progress on AI is “still a problem,” but the company has “shifted the story” for now.
“Well, the first thing I would say is it’s great news for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that there’s a story about the company that is not involving Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) intelligence or AI. We are going back now to the roots of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) which is that they are an excellent phone maker and the improvements that they showed for this model are coming out. People want these models because they’re more durable because they have better battery life and they are going back to their bread and butter and we’re hearing about the product itself and people are responding. So, I think the narrative that’s been around Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) not being able to do artificial intelligence over the last few years, that’s still a problem, but they’ve shifted their story. People are responding. They’re going out lining up to buy the phones both in New York, but also in China, which is really important.”
Apple can only do so much in innovation to revolutionize its iPhone each year. A UBS survey shows that the iPhone upgrade cycle has reached 35 months in the US. A separate report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners says about 63% of iPhone users keep their smartphones for more than two years. Apple is losing its pricing edge as it has to put a cap on its price tags to compete in key markets like China. Samsung, Xiaomi and other companies can launch advanced hardware and software features to compete with Apple and keep the company under pressure in Asia.
Macquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined in the quarter and meaningfully underperformed the S&P 500. The security contributed to relative performance due to our underweighting, approximately 50% lower than the benchmark weight. While Apple continues to have laudable attributes and strong repurchase intent, the company is failing to grow at historical rates given the maturation of many key products.”"

CNBC ‘Fast Money’ trader Dan Nathan said in a recent program that he’s turned bullish on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) despite overall weak sentiment and the company’s auto business showing soft trends. Here is why he thinks the stock can rally:
“The bulls and the bears agree that the EV business is bad. I think the consensus for Q3 deliveries is probably low. I think there’s probably been a pull forward. If you think about that $7,500 tax credit that’s going away at the end of the month and look at how this stock, we just want to pull the chart up here. It looks like it’s a beneficiary of this rotation. You know, look at all of the MAG7 names. The rotation in the MAG7. They basically all other than Apple today underperformed the NASDAQ. So, if you look at this thing, it’s built this base a series of higher lows here. It’s right up against that resistance level from a few months ago. It’s held its 200 day moving average. might you see this thing rally into quarter end? October 1st, 2nd, I think is when they’re going to report Q3 delivery. So, I think from a trading perspective, it looks very interesting.”

Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Tesla’s global sales in the second quarter fell 14% year over year. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

Reeves refused to rule out some tax rises were form part of it in an interview with the BBC on Monday, ahead of her speech at the Labour party conference. The Labour party promised in its manifesto not to raise taxes on ""working people"", with a pledge not to increase rates of income tax, national insurance or value-added tax (VAT).
Following her first autumn budget last year, in which the chancellor announced £40bn of tax rises, Reeves told the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) that she would not be ""coming back with more borrowing or more taxes"".
However, in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday she said: ""Everyone can see in the last year the world has changed and we’re not immune to that change.""
When asked whether she could guarantee that she would not extend the freeze on income tax thresholds, in another interview, with BBC Breakfast, Reeves said: ""I'm not going to be able to do that.""

Later, in her Labour party conference speech, Reeves said: ""In the months ahead, we will face further tests, with the choices to come made all the harder by harsh global headwinds and the long-term damage done to our economy, which is becoming ever clearer.
""Our first year in power was about fixing the foundations. Our second must be about building a renewed economy for a renewed Britain.""
Reeves has repeatedly said she is committed to sticking to her self-imposed fiscal rules, which include not borrowing to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliament, as well as aiming to get debt falling as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in the same time frame.
Meanwhile, the government was forced to U-turn on proposed cuts to welfare benefits in June, following pressure from within the Labour party. At the same time, work and pensions secretary Pat McFadden told the BBC last week that reform of the welfare system ""must happen"", partly to help address the rising cost of benefits.

But HSBC cautioned that “much can happen before year-end” and outlined several milestones that could determine whether the rally continues.
A key test is the looming government funding deadline. “Congress has until 30 Sep to increase the debt limit and avoid a government shutdown,” HSBC wrote.
The firm noted that over the past 30 years, the government has shut down only five times, with the longest, 34 days, occurring under President Donald Trump’s first administration.
Monetary policy is another factor. “HSBC economists expect the Fed to cut 25bp at both the 29 Oct and 10 Dec FOMC meetings,” the analysts said, adding that recession risks remain low, with consensus probability at 30%.
The firm observed that historically, Fed cuts outside of recessions “results in an 8% rise in the S&P 500 over a six-month period, on average.”
Trade developments also matter. Tariff extensions with Mexico expire on October 31 and with China on November 10.
HSBC said that “further extension, a broader trade deal or start of the USMCA review, in the case of Mexico, would be a positive development.”
The durability of AI investment is another driver. HSBC said it expects third-quarter earnings to “confirm or even expand” capex commitments from hyperscalers, noting that of the Mag7’s $1 trillion cash reserves, “$414bn [is] going to capex with room for more at Apple to catch up in AI.”

By slashing interest rates to near-zero levels and expanding its balance sheet via quantitative easing (QE), the Fed injected trillions of dollars into the financial system. This liquidity tsunami didn’t just stabilize markets; it supercharged them.
Nowhere was this more evident than in the tech sector, where companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. used the cheap capital to innovate and give their growth a good boost via good old-fashioned financial engineering.
The buyback boom: Financial engineering on steroids
Apple alone has repurchased US$704-billion worth of its own stock over the past decade. That figure exceeds the market capitalization of all but 13 companies globally.
Microsoft, meanwhile, spent US$199 billion on buybacks during the same period. Meta and Alphabet Inc. added another US$207 billion and US$317 billion, respectively. In total, just four tech giants deployed more than US$1.4 trillion on buybacks.
These buybacks reduced share counts, artificially boosted earnings per share (EPS) and helped sustain lofty valuations. In essence, companies used Fed-fuelled liquidity to build new products or expand operations and to juice their stock prices, like athletes on performance-enhancing drugs.
Enter AI: A new kind of financial loop
Now, with the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in full swing, we’re witnessing a new form of circular financial engineering. Companies aren’t just selling products; they’re investing in their customers to ensure those customers can afford to buy more of their products to justify forward growth and implied valuations.
Take Nvidia Corp., OpenAI Inc. and Oracle Corp. Nvidia recently announced a US$100-billion investment in OpenAI to build out 10 gigawatts of AI data centres. That’s equivalent to the output of 10 nuclear reactors and involves deploying four million to five million graphics processing units (GPUs), essentially Nvidia’s entire annual production.
But here’s the twist: OpenAI will use that capital to buy Nvidia’s chips. Nvidia gets equity in OpenAI and OpenAI gets the hardware it needs to scale. It’s a self-referential loop as Nvidia invests in OpenAI, which then turns around and spends that money on Nvidia’s products.
Oracle is also in on the game, committing US$40 billion to purchase Nvidia chips for OpenAI’s Texas-based Stargate data centre. Oracle will lease the facility to OpenAI under a 15-year agreement, effectively financing its own future revenues."

Inflation Data in Focus
August’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, came in as expected. Core PCE, barring food and energy, rose at an annual rate of 2.9%, while the all-items index recorded a 2.7% increase year over year and a 0.3% monthly gain. These readings, though still above the Fed’s 2% target, reaffirmed expectations for two quarter-point interest rate cuts by the year-end, per the CNBC article.
Consumer Sentiment
Consumer sentiment for September, reported by the University of Michigan, was only slightly weaker than expected and held steady among wealthier households with larger stock holdings. The survey’s index of consumer sentiment recorded a reading of 55.1, just slightly below the Dow Jones consensus forecast of 55.4 (as quoted on CNBC).
The reading marked a 5.3% decline month over month and a 21.6% slump from the same period a year ago.Inflation expectations held stable, with the one-year outlook at 4.7% and the five-year at 3.7%, as quoted on the abovementioned CNBC article.
Upbeat GDP Growth Data
Thanks to stronger consumer spending, the U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly robust 3.8% pace in Q2 of 2025, marking an upward revision of second-quarter growth released by the government.
The Commerce Department said that gross domestic product (GDP) bounced back in the spring after a 0.6% decline in the first quarter, which had been hit hard by trade tensions. The new estimate is higher than the previously reported 3.3% growth (per AP news, as quoted on Yahoo Finance).
Fed Rate Cut to Address Weakening Labor Market
The Fed enacted its first rate cut of 2025 in September and also hinted at further cuts this year.At the time of writing, there are 87.7% chances of a 25-bp rate cut in the October meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.
Moderate Comeback of Tariff Tensions
In a trio of posts on Truth Social on Sept. 25, 2025, President Trump announced that the U.S. will roll out a host of tariffs starting Oct. 1. The measures will cover imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities, pharmaceutical products, and heavy trucks.

BOE's shares in Shenzhen gained 0.49 per cent to close at 4.12 yuan on Monday.
The company's push into robotics reflects China's position as the world's largest market for industrial robots last year.
According to a report released last week by the International Federation of Robotics, China accounted for 54 per cent of global industrial robot deployments in 2024.
The report said China installed 295,000 industrial robots last year - the highest annual total on record - with domestic firms selling more in their home country than foreign suppliers for the first time.

""As robotics in China is opening up new markets, there is no indication that robot demand in China will decrease,"" the report said. ""There is still a lot of potential in Chinese manufacturing for 10 per cent growth on average each year until 2028.""
A Morgan Stanley report published in June projected China's robotics market to grow at an annual rate of 23 per cent to US$108 billion by 2028 from US$47 billion in 2024, solidifying the country's dominant position in the fast-developing sector.
Founded in 1993, Beijing-based BOE's biggest customers include Apple and Huawei Technologies. The company had almost 100,000 employees as of last year.
Fellow Apple supplier Foxconn Technology Group in January signed a ""comprehensive long-term partnership"" with UBTech Robotics to deploy its robots in its factories.
Chinese fintech giant Ant Group, meanwhile, set up late last year an entity called Shanghai Mayi Lingbo Technology, with 100 million yuan in registered capital, to focus on the research and development of embodied intelligence (EI) technology and products. Ant is an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post."

The second edition of GlobalData’s ESG Executive Briefing states that carbon offset purchases are ramping up and that 2030 net-zero targets “are just about still achievable.” However, it adds that, while AI-fuelled emissions growth has begun to slow, Big Tech’s announced capital expenditure plans suggest this will be temporary, with data centre construction to accelerate.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
As such, the report says: “The key question for climate targets will be whether enough carbon offsets can be bought to match emissions in 2030 and beyond. In its 2024 reporting year, Microsoft massively increased its offset purchases, contracting an amount above its full-year Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.”
Microsoft is alongside Google, Meta and Apple in having committed to achieving carbon neutrality across their value chains by 2030. Its example demonstrates that purchasing carbon offsets at high volumes is feasible – but contracted offsets must still be delivered, and maintaining a pipeline of offsets to the high standards for purchasing set by Microsoft and Google poses a challenge.
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are another tool being employed by Big Tech in pursuing emissions targets. These allow firms to fund renewable projects in exchange for securing clean energy to help meet their sustainability goals.
“PPAs will continue, and there will be more for small modular reactors,” the report states. “Their ability to provide consistent power makes them a good match for data centres, which run 24 hours a day. Big Tech has already signed PPAs for small modular reactors, but most will not be up and running until 2030 or later.”

Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataGlobalData adds that other barriers to PPAs are tariffs on equipment made in China and delays in connecting new plants to power grids.
The report states that the long-term challenge for Big Tech will be reducing Scope 3 emissions.
“Expanding net-zero strategies to companies across the value chain will be needed to reduce Scope 3 emissions,” it explains. “Big Tech must help smaller suppliers sign their own PPAs for low-carbon energy.

The US has held discussions about that with Taipei to reduce the risks of over-reliance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview with NewsNation. It was the only way to effectively counter Beijing’s threats to invade a self-ruled island it views as its own, Lutnick argued.
“That’s been the conversation we had with Taiwan, that you have to understand it’s vital for you to have us produce 50%,” he said. The US aims to get to “maybe 50% market share of producing the chip and the wafers — the semiconductors — we need for American consumption. That’s our objective,” Lutnick said during the interview.
US officials have for years warned about an over-dependence on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and its giant ecosystem of suppliers, which together make and supply the vast majority of the world’s most advanced chips. That risk emerged particularly during Covid-era shortages that highlighted how semiconductors fueled industries from car-making to military technology and AI.
TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is one of the centerpieces of a US government effort to entice manufacturing back home.
It has pledged to invest $165 billion to ramp up production at its US sites. But shifting capacity en masse will require not just enormous capital but also the large-scale migration of scores of suppliers and partners that together comprise TSMC’s production chain.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Washington was weighing a broad plan to reduce its reliance on overseas semiconductors, saying companies must produce as many chips in America as they import from other sources or face additional tariffs. Lutnick didn’t elaborate in the NewsNation interview about how the US would convince Taipei to get behind his objective.
“We’re still fundamentally reliant upon you because we can’t live without the other half,” Lutnick said. “It will shock everybody how successful we are.”

Deciphering which businesses can sustain their high growth rates is a challenge for even the most seasoned professionals, which is why we started StockStory. Keeping that in mind, here is one growth stock with significant upside potential and two climbing an uphill battle.
Two Growth Stocks to Sell:
GXO Logistics (GXO)
One-Year Revenue Growth: +22.4%
With notable customers such as Nike and Apple, GXO (NYSE:GXO) manages outsourced supply chains and warehousing for various companies.
Why Does GXO Worry Us?
-
Core business is underperforming as its organic revenue has disappointed over the past two years, suggesting it might need acquisitions to stimulate growth
-
Incremental sales over the last two years were much less profitable as its earnings per share fell by 2.2% annually while its revenue grew
-
6× net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio makes lenders less willing to extend additional capital, potentially necessitating dilutive equity offerings
GXO Logistics is trading at $52.84 per share, or 19.3x forward P/E. If you’re considering GXO for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.
LendingClub (LC)
One-Year Revenue Growth: +17.3%
Pioneering peer-to-peer lending in the US before evolving into a digital bank, LendingClub (NYSE:LC) operates a marketplace that connects borrowers with lenders, offering personal loans, auto refinancing, and banking services.
Why Are We Wary of LC?
-
Customers postponed purchases of its products and services this cycle as its revenue declined by 8% annually over the last two years
-
Earnings per share have dipped by 8.8% annually over the past two years, which is concerning because stock prices follow EPS over the long term
-
Underwhelming 6.7% return on equity reflects management’s difficulties in finding profitable growth opportunities
At $16.54 per share, LendingClub trades at 17.8x forward P/E. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why LC doesn’t pass our bar.
One Growth Stock to Watch:
Braze (BRZE)
One-Year Revenue Growth: +22.2%
With its technology powering interactions with 6.2 billion monthly active users across the digital landscape, Braze (NASDAQ:BRZE) provides a platform that helps brands build and maintain direct relationships with their customers through personalized, cross-channel messaging and engagement.
Why Does BRZE Stand Out?
-
Billings have averaged 24.4% growth over the last year, showing it’s securing new contracts that could potentially increase in value over time
-
Platform has decent utility and becomes more valuable over time, as seen in its 110% net revenue retention rate
-
Projected revenue growth of 19.2% for the next 12 months suggests its momentum from the last two years will persist"

Not only is it trailing the other large tech stocks, it's trailing the market's gains, roughly flat year to date.
But don't give up on Apple so fast. It's had several moments over the past few decades where it lagged for years before booming again. And there are good reasons to be confident it can make another comeback. Here's one of them.
The user favorite
Apple's most popular product is the iPhone, and it accounts for around half of Apple's total sales. Customers consistently upgrade when there are new launches, and even people who hold on for years eventually need to get a new phone for one reason or another.
Nearly all U.S. adults own a smartphone today -- 91% according to Pew research. Apple accounts for more than half of U.S. smartphones, which is a massive moat that's not easily overcome, no matter how much technology today is changing. If it is changing, Apple is usually leading.
Recently, users and investors alike have been disappointed in how Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) initiative, Apple Intelligence, is coming along, or more accurately not coming along. But over the next five years, it's likely to have its own breakthrough, and coupled with the iPhone's advantages of quality and ease of use, it should keep customers close to the brand. iPhone sales increased 13% year over year in the 2025 fiscal third quarter (ended June 28), demonstrating that despite its size and market share, the iPhone can still generate high sales. As the AI race speeds up, look for Apple Intelligence to boost iPhone sales further and for Apple to make a healthy comeback."

The quantum computing threat to Bitcoin may be more urgent than some think, according to Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko.
""I feel like 50/50, within five years, there is a quantum breakthrough,"" Yakovenko said at the All-In Summit 2025 earlier this month. ""We should migrate Bitcoin to a quantum-resistant signature scheme.""
The debate over quantum computing’s potential threat to Bitcoin has intensified recently, spurred by advances such as Google’s Willow. The fear is that quantum computers will soon be able to run Shor's algorithm, which is widely believed to have the potential to break encryption systems, such as elliptic curve cryptography. Elliptic curve cryptography secures Bitcoin wallets.

While some argue that the threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography remains distant, Yakovenko cautions that the rate of AI advancement suggests otherwise.
""I would try to encourage folks to speed things up,"" he said, stressing that ideas were moving from research paper to implementation at an ""astounding"" rate. He also pointed to Google and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) moving to quantum-resistant stacks as a sign of the times.
But it will likely not be as easy for Bitcoin to upgrade as it is for Google and Apple. Bitcoin does not have the centralized management of Google and Apple. The network also lacks an established governance structure and a recognized development team that can push upgrades like most other blockchains.
The network’s less structured governance means that determining consensus on upgrades is challenging. While this ensures that the network is more reliable and adds to its decentralization lore, it can arguably be a handicap in urgent situations.

While Yakovenko warned of the risks posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin, he still hailed the network for its resilience against current threats.
""I think Bitcoin is resilient to these entities collapsing,"" he said in response to questions raised about how a collapse of Bitcoin treasury firms such as MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) could affect the asset.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-28T10:30:00,What's Next for These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks?,"These stocks have reacted to AI in surprising ways, but investors should also consider their future prospects.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=111abda5e2a8ad4549f1b47bcec353d7a65f179c612d73bb691e888586470f91,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/whats-next-for-these-3-ai-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/whats-next-for-these-3-ai-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/whats-next-for-these-3-ai-stocks/,fool.com,200,,"As tech investors have observed, artificial intelligence (AI) propelled many stocks higher since the release of OpenAI's GPT-4. Thanks to the gains sparked by this technology, several individual stocks and the stock indexes reached record highs in recent trading sessions.
This has to many AI stocks setting new all-time highs. Also, Grand View Research forecasts a 32% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the AI sector through 2033, leading to questions about what comes next, especially for individual stocks in this sector. With that question in mind, three analysts from The Motley Fool share their insights on some of the most critical AI stocks and where they are likely to go from here.
1. Nvidia will likely exceed $200 billion in sales this fiscal year
Jake Lerch (Nvidia): My choice is Nvidia (NVDA 0.27%). There's no doubt in my mind that Nvidia -- more than any other company -- has been the prime beneficiary of the AI revolution. After all, this is a company that, in just a few years, has risen to become the largest company by market capitalization in the world.
So, what are investors to make of Nvidia? What is the ceiling for the company? Or is there no ceiling at all?
Obviously, the answers to these questions revolve around the AI ecosystem and Nvidia's prime role within it. If the AI revolution continues to roll on, so will Nvidia. If AI investment slows or collapses, Nvidia's stock will tumble. Moreover, what if new competitors challenge Nvidia's enormous lead within the graphics processing unit (GPU) market?
First, there are legitimate concerns about the amount of spending on AI infrastructure -- and what return on investment (ROI) companies will get from it. Meta Platforms, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and many others are investing billions in AI infrastructure -- much of it in the form of Nvidia's advanced GPUs. These companies each have their own unique vision for utilizing their AI resources and their own ROI expectations.
For the moment, there is no sign that their ROI isn't measuring up. Indeed, the escalating scale of the investments suggests that ROIs are even better than expected.
Second, it's true that competitors will eventually close the gap on Nvidia. That is the nature of capitalism. However, the question remains how long that process will take to play out. According to estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance, Nvidia is expected to generate $206 billion in revenue for the fiscal year (the 12 months ending Jan. 27, 2026), and nearly $275 billion in the following 12 months.
So, competition will eventually emerge. Still, it is not expected to substantially impact Nvidia's growth over the next 18 months.
Nvidia remains the top dog in both the AI sector and the broader stock market. Overall, AI investment remains robust, suggesting that companies are reaping substantial benefits from their AI spending. Finally, Nvidia's competitors remain years off from fully challenging the company's strong sales growth. In short, Nvidia remains an AI stock superstar.
2. Investors must weigh company gains against stock growth in this stock
Will Healy (Palantir): Palantir Technologies (PLTR 0.27%) has been an AI company since its inception. The technology played a critical role in delivering analytical insights in the national security and commercial sectors.
More recently, the launch of its generative AI-based Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) undoubtedly supercharged these capabilities. Numerous customers from diverse enterprises reported eye-popping productivity gains. Amid such improvements, Palantir's stock is up by nearly 370% over the last year.
Unfortunately for bulls in this stock, its financials call into question the near-term direction of Palantir stock. In the first half of 2025, Palantir earned a net income attributable to common shareholders of $541 million, a 126% yearly gain.
While that is an impressive amount of growth by any measure, it fell short of the gains in the stock price. Consequently, Palantir reached stratospheric valuations. Even if investors can dismiss the 592 P/E ratio, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 131 is far removed from the S&P 500's average sales multiple of 3.4.
Does this mean Palantir's stock is headed for a crash, or at least a pause? Not necessarily, as it is always possible that it will beat expectations or find some other factor that will propel the stock higher.
The problem with these valuations is that they price Palantir stock for perfection. That means any hint of negative news could trigger a massive sell-off, making it extremely risky to buy the stock at current prices.
Amid that possibility, investors should probably refrain from putting new money to work in Palantir. Additionally, if one's risk tolerance does not lend itself to owning such an expensive stock, they should consider selling.
3. Don't write off Apple as an AI powerhouse just yet
Justin Pope (Apple): Iconic electronics titan Apple (AAPL 0.54%) has faced considerable criticism for its lackluster rollout of AI iOS features it had dubbed Apple Intelligence.
It was supposed to be an easy layup -- there are over 2.35 billion active iOS devices worldwide. Successfully bringing AI to Apple users would have almost assured the company's place as a top AI company, where next-generation technology would further enhance its already sticky ecosystem.
Unfortunately, Apple dropped the ball. The company has struggled to ship first-party AI features and has since delayed its launch of an upgraded Siri, Apple's virtual personal assistant, to a 2026 release date. But don't write Apple off just yet. The company continues to specialize in bringing refined, quality hardware products to market, allowing its iOS ecosystem to shine.
Apple just launched its latest iPhone models: the 17, 17 Pro, and Pro Max, as well as a new, slim-design model, the iPhone Air. According to early indications, Apple may be in for a strong hardware cycle. The CEO of T-Mobile recently noted that iPhone sales are at an all-time high. Industry experts also pointed out strong demand for the new iPhone lineup.
While Apple must ultimately deliver a working and compelling slate of AI features for its devices, it's clear that Apple's core hardware products haven't lost their fastball. That should give the company time to figure out AI and keep the stock on the radar of any investor looking for some AI upside, but would rather stick with a blue-chip winner versus rolling the dice on unproven or speculative AI stocks."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-28T09:30:00,3 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Millennial Investors,"Millennials are entering their prime earning years, making it a perfect time to consider introducing dividend stocks to their portfolios.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c933470b18b6b6ea9a10cb050a32110fc76af57722238cafd75e9f355a5fb6e3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/3-dividend-stocks-perfect-for-millennial-investors/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/3-dividend-stocks-perfect-for-millennial-investors/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/3-dividend-stocks-perfect-for-millennial-investors/,fool.com,200,,"There's a common idea that young investors should automatically gravitate to growth stocks and other riskier investments in the name of upside. Admittedly, young investors have a longer time horizon that affords them more time to endure volatility or recover from losses if an investment goes poorly.
But research from The Motley Fool also shows that investors like passive income as well. For instance, while millennial investors do typically favor growth stocks, 35% of those surveyed had an interest in dividend stocks, and young investors were more interested in real estate investment trusts (REITs) than older investors.
Millennials are entering their prime earning years and still have a long runway for compounding when they reinvest dividends.
As a result, now could be the perfect time for millennials to begin pivoting to dividend stocks. Here are three great examples of stocks that millennials can buy and hold, and reasonably expect increasing dividends for years to come.
1. Realty Income
This list starts with Realty Income (O 0.22%), one of the industry's largest and most successful REITs. Millennial investors should love the company's monthly dividend payment schedule. Not only does that represent steady passive income, but it's a frequent reminder of consistency, an essential trait for investing, especially among young investors who are still learning about what goes into building wealth over a long time horizon.
Realty Income acquires and leases single-tenant commercial properties, primarily to retail tenants, like convenience stores, restaurants, and other types of stores. Realty Income's real estate portfolio spans more than 15,600 properties and features net leases, in which the tenant is responsible for things like maintenance, taxes, and insurance. It has made Realty Income a steady and dependable company that has raised its dividend for 32 consecutive years.
The company's annual earnings typically grow at a mid- to low-single-digit percentage rate. That might not excite growth-minded millennials. However, Realty Income is an excellent example of what time and dividend reinvestment can do. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 over its lifetime when you look at total returns, which factor in reinvested dividends.
2. Phillip Morris International
You wouldn't think tobacco stocks like Philip Morris International (PM -0.85%) would have much relevance to young adults. Smoking rates have declined for decades. However, millennials are at the heart of new nicotine products, like oral nicotine pouches, which have exploded in popularity during the past several years.
Philip Morris International is the world's largest tobacco stock by market cap. It sells Marlboro cigarettes internationally, and owns the heated tobacco brand Iqos, as well as the leading nicotine pouch brand, Zyn. Iqos and Zyn are among a class of smoke-free next-generation products that are reshaping the tobacco industry for a post-smoking world.
Their surging popularity is driving growth at Philip Morris International, making it a stock millennial investors may identify with due to their exposure to Zyn and other similar products. Management recently raised the company's dividend by 8.9%, a vote of confidence in Philip Morris International's future.
3. Apple
Millennials experienced the rise of the iPhone, making Apple (AAPL 0.54%) arguably one of the most well-known brands among the millennial generation. The company doesn't innovate quite as much anymore, instead favoring annual iterative updates to its core iOS smartphones and accessories, of which there are more than 2.35 billion worldwide.
As for the stock, Apple has paid and raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years. That dividend should continue to grow for decades to come, given that Apple's dividend payout ratio is just 14% of this year's estimated earnings. Apple spends a ton of its profits buying back stock, but the company has done enough to make it clear that investors can count on that dividend to rise over time.
The iOS ecosystem is a huge competitive moat in a world where modern consumers depend on their devices routinely throughout their daily lives. If Apple can tap into artificial intelligence (AI) as an add-on to its existing products or for a new device, potentially its next iPhone-like breakthrough, it would further cement Apple, already a technology behemoth, as an obvious buy-and-hold forever stock for millennial investors."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-28T07:06:00,"Prediction: Wall Street's Most Valuable Public Company by 2030 Will Be This Dual-Industry Leader (No, Not Nvidia)","A historically inexpensive trillion-dollar business has the necessary catalysts to leapfrog the likes of Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft by the turn of the decade.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=01ab921205169f5e1e9233defe81cf842b023c369d5d3830b64fa050f0cbfef8,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-wall-street-most-valuable-company-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-wall-street-most-valuable-company-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-wall-street-most-valuable-company-2030/,fool.com,200,,"For much of the last 16 years, the stock market has been unstoppable. With the exception of the five-week COVID-19 crash in February-March 2020, and the roughly nine-month bear market in 2022, the bulls have been in firm control on Wall Street.
The catalyst for this ongoing outperformance primarily rests with Wall Street's trillion-dollar businesses. Think Nvidia (NVDA 0.27%) and Apple, as well as newer trillion-dollar club members Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is also known as TSMC.
All told, just 11 publicly traded companies have ever reached a $1 trillion market cap, not accounting for the effects of inflation, and 10 trade on U.S. exchanges. This includes all members of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" along with Broadcom, TSMC, and billionaire Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway.
While Nvidia appears to have the inside path to retaining its current title as Wall Street's most valuable public company by the turn of the decade, another Mag Seven member is ideally positioned to dethrone Nvidia and leapfrog the likes of Apple and Microsoft along the way.
Despite its AI dominance, Nvidia's spot atop the trillion-dollar pedestal is far from secure
As of the closing bell on Sept. 24, artificial intelligence (AI) titan Nvidia clocked in with a market cap north of $4.3 trillion. It's the first public company to have reached the $4 trillion mark, and is believed to have a chance to surpass a $6 trillion valuation, based on the price targets of Wall Street's most optimistic analysts.
This optimism stems from Nvidia's dominant position as the leader in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) deployed in enterprise data centers. Three generations of advanced AI chips -- Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and now Blackwell Ultra -- have enjoyed insatiable demand and extensive order backlogs.
Aside from clear-cut compute advantages, Nvidia's AI hardware benefits from a persistent lack of AI GPU supply. As long as enterprise demand overwhelms available hardware, Nvidia is going to have no trouble charging a premium for its GPUs and netting a gross margin in excess of 70%.
While these competitive edges would imply that Nvidia's spot atop the trillion-dollar pedestal is secure, historical precedent would beg to differ.
One of the prime threats to Wall Street's largest public company is that every next-big-thing trend dating back more than three decades has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion. This is to say that investors consistently overestimate the early adoption and real-world utility of next-big-thing innovations. Though AI has undeniable long-term applications, most businesses are nowhere close to optimizing these solutions at present, or have yet to net a positive return on their AI investments.
Competition is something that can't be ignored, either. Even with external competitors lagging Nvidia in compute ability, there's a very real possibility of Wall Street's AI darling losing out on valuable data center real estate and/or being undermined by delayed AI GPU upgrade cycles.
Many of Nvidia's largest customers by net sales are developing AI GPUs to deploy in their data centers. Though these chips won't be competing with Nvidia's hardware externally, they're considerably cheaper to build and more readily accessible. It's a recipe for Nvidia's competitive edge to dwindle in the coming years, and for Wall Street's AI kingpin to cede its title as the most valuable public company.
This will be Wall Street's most valuable public company come 2030
Although Apple or Microsoft would seem to be logical choices to reclaim the top spot that both companies have previously held, dual-industry leader Amazon (AMZN -0.69%) is the trillion-dollar stock that looks to have the best chance to become Wall Street's most valuable company by 2030.
The operating segment that typically introduces consumers to Amazon is its online marketplace. According to estimates from Analyzify, Amazon's e-commerce segment accounts for a 37.6% share of U.S. online retail sales. Amazon's spot as the leading e-commerce giant isn't threatened -- although its operating margin associated with online retail sales tends to be razor thin.
While Amazon's retail operations provide a face for the company, it's a trio of considerably higher-margin ancillary segments that'll be responsible for bulking up the company's operating cash flow in the years to come.
Nothing has more bearing on Amazon's long-term success than cloud infrastructure platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Tech analysis firm Canalys pegged its share of worldwide cloud infrastructure spend at 32% during the second quarter, which is nearly as much as Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud on a combined basis.
AWS has been growing by a high-teens percentage on a year-over-year basis, excluding currency movements. The thinking here is that the inclusion of generative AI solutions and large language model capabilities for AWS clients will only enhance the growth rate for AWS.
As of the June-ended quarter, AWS was pacing more than $123 billion in annual run-rate revenue. Most importantly, AWS is responsible for almost 58% of Amazon's operating income through the first half of 2025 despite accounting for less than 19% of net sales. Even if an AI bubble forms and bursts, application providers like AWS can weather the storm.
The other pieces of the puzzle for Amazon are advertising services and subscription services. When you're drawing billions of people to your site monthly, it's not difficult to command exceptional ad-pricing power.
It also doesn't hurt that Amazon has landed exclusive streaming partnerships with the National Football League and National Basketball Association. When coupled with e-commerce shipping perks and exclusive shopping events, Amazon has plenty of pricing power with its Prime subscription.
Finally, Amazon is historically inexpensive. From 2010 to 2019, Amazon closed out each year between 23 and 37 times trailing-12-month cash flow. Based on Wall Street's consensus, Amazon's cash flow per share is forecast to grow from a reported $11.04 in 2024 to $27.52 in 2029.
In other words, Amazon is valued at only 8 times projected cash flow in 2029, which means it can reasonably add $2.5 trillion to $4 trillion in market value from here and still be trading at a significant discount to its average cash flow multiple during the 2010s."

The sport’s popularity surged during the pandemic, when cooped-up viewers binged Netflix’s (NFLX) “Drive to Survive” series, but the sport’s growth has continued. Many attribute this to the leadership of Liberty Media (LLYVK), who purchased the sport from PE firm CVC Capital Partners back in 2017.
For decades, F1 had failed to tap into the huge US market, but that trend has reversed.
“If you look at when Liberty acquired the sport, the thing that we needed to do to grow was crack the code in North America. I think we've done that and are only getting started,” McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown told Yahoo Finance.
Brown said the three races here in the US — in Miami, Austin, and Las Vegas — are giving the sport a foothold in the country. That, plus a younger, more diverse audience and a spending cost cap that made teams more competitive has only enhanced the sport.
The result? F1 viewership in the US is on track to hit a record for the 2025 season, with an average of 1.4 million viewers per race, according to rights holder ESPN (DIS). The growth of the sport means it will likely garner a bigger price tag for its streaming rights next year, with Apple (AAPL) reportedly offering Liberty Media $150 million per year, well above the $85 million that ESPN pays for the current package.
Brown also noted that seven different drivers won multiple races, adding to the drama for viewers. “It's the first time in my 30 years of following the sport, seeing that level of competitiveness,” he said.
Brown had two of those winning drivers in his McLaren stable: Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris both won multiple races, catapulting McLaren to the overall team championship last year — its first since 1998.
Winning on track also means more money in the team’s coffers, as F1’s prize pool is paid out depending on success on the track, and it also means more money from sponsors like Dell (DELL), Google (GOOGL), and its new title sponsor, Mastercard (MA).
This also means teams like McLaren are becoming more valuable. Bloomberg reports that McLaren Racing is now valued at more than $4.1 billion following completion of a new stake sale, which would be a significant premium.
“I think I would say great value, not a premium,” Brown said with a smile, neither confirming nor denying the valuation but claiming it wasn’t “a million miles off.”
The McLaren share sale underscores continued investor enthusiasm about the sport, Brown said.
“You have racing teams now lined up trying to get in the sport, or writing checks,” he said. “[You have to spend] half a billion just to have the right to be a Formula One team, forget about what it costs to actually acquire a team where not long ago, a lot of teams were in trouble and you were buying them out of administration.”"

Instead, you'll want to find a company with an enduring business model, strong competitive advantage, and a clear path to long-term growth on the top and bottom lines. One stock that fits all three of those categories is Arm Holdings (ARM 0.31%), which is best known for licensing its CPU architecture to partners like Nvidia and Apple.
Why Arm is a good long-term bet
Arm has a unique business model in the semiconductor sector. Rather than designing chips or even manufacturing them, the company licenses its CPU designs, collecting money from both a licensing fee and then royalties when the product containing that license sells.
That's been a winning, high-margin business model for Arm, even if it means it doesn't collect as much revenue as it would if it were designing the chips entirely.
It also shows how the company is set up well for long-term growth. First, the company's CPU architecture is much better at conserving battery power than the competing x86 platform from Intel and AMD. That's why Arm has more than 99% market share of the smartphone market, and its market share is growing in data centers, where power is also at a premium.
Arm's royalties also last for a long time. In fact, half of the royalties it's collecting now come from designs that are more than 10 years old. The company continues to innovate, and it's now getting into chip design and more complex products like system-on-chip (SoC) licenses.
However, its technological advantage in CPU architecture and the strength of its royalty model should ensure that the company continues to grow. It has benefited from the AI boom and will continue to do so, but its advantages make it more resilient than many of its peers."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-27T08:45:00,Is The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund a Buy?,"With a 0.03% expense ratio and broad exposure to the full U.S. market, this boring fund keeps beating flashier alternatives by doing absolutely nothing special.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2b6635f8e867dbe1176882948dc399b86a471271d58b2792a834db1d135974e9,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/is-the-vanguard-total-stock-market-index-fund-a-bu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/is-the-vanguard-total-stock-market-index-fund-a-bu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/is-the-vanguard-total-stock-market-index-fund-a-bu/,fool.com,200,,"The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI 0.50%) might be the most boring investment on Wall Street -- and that's exactly why it works. While hedge funds chase the next big thing and retail traders bet on meme stocks, this exchange-traded fund (ETF) quietly delivers the entire U.S. stock market for 3 basis points. No stock picking. No market timing. No clever strategies. Just own everything and let American capitalism do the heavy lifting.
The fund's 12% year-to-date return won't make headlines, but it's beaten roughly 90% of actively managed large-cap funds over the past decade. That's the paradox of index investing: doing nothing special consistently produces special results. With 3,524 holdings spanning megacaps to micro-caps, the fund offers the ultimate set-it-and-forget-it exposure to U.S. equities.
Is this top Vanguard ETF a buy right now? Let's break down the fund's key features to find out.
The Magnificent Seven's boring wrapper
The fund's portfolio reads like a who's who of American corporate dominance. Nvidia leads at 6.49% of assets, followed by Microsoft at 6.05% and Apple at 5.57%. The top 10 holdings -- including Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- comprise about one-third of the fund. That concentration might seem risky, but it simply reflects market reality: These companies have grown so large that they dominate any market-cap-weighted index.
The beauty lies in what happens beyond the giants. The ETF holds everything from Broadcom at 2.25% down to thousands of small caps, each representing fractions of a percent. This breadth provides natural diversification across sectors, styles, and company sizes. When megacap tech stumbles, smaller value stocks might cushion the blow. When growth roars back, the fund captures those gains too. The 2% annual turnover keeps transaction costs minimal while ensuring the portfolio stays current with market changes.
The compound interest machine
At 0.03% annually, the fund's expense ratio approaches free. On a $10,000 investment, you pay $3 per year -- less than a fancy coffee. Compare that to the average actively managed fund charging 0.5% to 1%, and the math becomes compelling. Over 30 years, that seemingly tiny difference compounds into tens of thousands of dollars. Jack Bogle's simple insight -- costs matter more than almost anything else -- remains devastatingly true.
The fund's structure amplifies this advantage. As an ETF, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF trades throughout the day with tight bid-ask spreads, typically just a penny or two. Tax efficiency comes built-in through the creation-redemption mechanism that allows the fund to shed appreciated shares without triggering taxable events for remaining shareholders.
The case against excitement
The fund won't make you rich quickly. It won't beat the market because it is the market. During corrections, it falls with everything else -- no defensive positioning softens the blow. The fund's U.S.-only focus means missing international opportunities, particularly in emerging markets that might offer higher growth potential in the years ahead. And yes, owning 3,524 stocks means holding plenty of mediocre companies alongside the winners.
But these limitations double as strengths for most investors. The inability to beat the market eliminates the risk of underperforming it. The lack of international exposure keeps things simple and avoids currency risk. The broad diversification ensures you'll always own the next Nvidia or Tesla before they become giants. Studies consistently show that investors' biggest enemy is themselves -- trading too much, chasing performance, abandoning strategies during downturns. The fund's boring nature acts as a behavioral defense mechanism.
For investors seeking a core U.S. equity holding, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF remains an exceptional choice. It won't generate alpha or provide cocktail party bragging rights. But over decades, this simple, cheap, comprehensive fund will likely beat most alternatives precisely because it doesn't try to be special. Sometimes the best investment strategy is admitting you don't have one -- and letting the market do the work for you."

The business meeting also seemed unconventional — at least to the Taiwanese contingent. Mitchell’s daughter, Ella Cox, was 14 at the time and sitting in on her iPad. “They thought I was drawing but I was calculating the sales thinking ‘gosh, this is a lot of money’,” smiles Cox. “I was giving mum notes not to sell for such and such a percentage.”
Thirty years after Mitchell launched her skincare brand, the Shropshire-based business is co-run by mother and daughter, as the royal warrant company looks towards a future which has been made possible thanks to the £30m company success of the founder's bee venom creations and anti-ageing creams.

“Visualising my future has played a really big part,” says Mitchell as she approaches her 60th birthday. “I planned what I wanted to do; to be a mobile beauty therapist, make my skincare and sell it all over the world.”
Her beautician goals have netted her a fortune in what is a remarkable British success story. Mitchell is known as the 'Queen’s facialist’, with Camilla having first made contact from Clarence House 20 years ago — quite the accolade for someone who is self-trained.
Suffering from acne, she used to go home on the bus red-faced, but was able to quell the exposure by adding a chamomile desensitising product used for leg waxing to her face mask. “I thought I would pop that in and wouldn’t go home with a red face,” she says.
Mitchell later worked at a health club where she was asked if she wanted to lease a room, a former disabled toilet. She was soon doing £13,000 per month in sales, building a loyal client base and checking her homemade natural preservatives from her ""lab"", the boot of her car. It is a secret formula which has proved a business winner.
“My 'preservative' is that you don’t over-preserve the product so the bacteria believes it has time to grow so it doesn’t bother growing,” she reveals. “People don’t have allergic reactions to my products as there are no horrible preservatives in them.”
She did hit a major snag early on when she took her skincare concoctions to a production company. “They stole all my formulas and I cried for four days. After that I said I will make them better,” she admits.

You don't see them, yet they're the brains that power almost every electronic device that we interact with daily. And there's nobody better at manufacturing semiconductors than the appropriately named Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 2.66%), also known as TSMC.
TSMC is the world's leading semiconductor foundry by a large margin. It has around a 70% market share, while second-place Samsung's market share is only around 7%. The foundry model means that TSMC doesn't make chips for general sale. Instead, companies will design the chips they need for their products, and TSMC will use its manufacturing ability to bring them to life.
At the time of this writing, TSMC's market cap is around $1.4 trillion. To hit the $2 trillion mark by 2028, it would need to average around 14% annual returns over the next few years. You should never use past performances to predict future ones, but given the company's growth prospects and its 29% average annual returns over the past decade, I'm confident it can happen.
TSMC's role in the AI ecosystem
TSMC isn't your typical artificial intelligence (AI) stock in the sense that it has a generative AI app or other software people interact with. Yet its role in the AI ecosystem is as important as almost any stock you can name.
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Alphabet all design chips and other hardware that power data centers, which are essentially the backbones of training and developing AI models. Yet most of this wouldn't be possible without TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability.
When it comes to manufacturing advanced AI chips, TSMC is essentially the only go-to. Without it, you could make a valid argument that data centers would be less efficient, which means that AI training would be less efficient, which means many of the AI applications we interact with today would be less capable and scalable.
TSMC is improving its profit and margins
TSMC has long been an impressive moneymaker, but it has stepped it up a lot in the past few years. In the second quarter, it made $30 billion in revenue, which was up 44% year over year and close to 18% higher than the first quarter. If its third-quarter revenue falls between $31.8 billion and $33 billion, as it predicts, that will represent between 35% and 40% year-over-year growth.
In Nvidia's latest earnings report, it noted that it expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure through 2030. With TSMC being a key part of AI infrastructure, this should be music to the company's ears.
The revenue growth is impressive, but TSMC's expanding margins may be the most noteworthy. Since last year, its profit margin has expanded from 36.8% to 42.7%, gross margin has expanded from 53.2% to 56.8%, and operating margin has expanded from 42.5% to 49.6%.
These expanding margins are a testament to TSMC's ability to command premium pricing because of its advanced manufacturing ability, and its customers knowing that it's essentially their only choice if they want the most powerful chips.
TSMC is trading at a good value for long-term investors
TSMC is currently trading at around 23.5 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months. It's not ""cheap"" by most standards, but it also seems like a good value for a company that's as dominant as TSMC and has its growth potential.
TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability isn't something that can be easily caught up to and replicated because it takes many years of experience and billions invested into research and equipment. That gives it a competitive advantage that's likely to last for quite a while, especially because it's not easy for its customers to switch manufacturers without risking performance or reliability.
That edge gives me confidence that TSMC can enter the $2 trillion club within the next few years."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks in the Spotlight This Week. On September 24, UBS analyst David Vogt reiterated a Neutral rating and $220.00 price target on the stock. The rating affirmation follows analysis of iPhone 17 availability data across 30 global markets.
Based on UBS Evidence Lab data, wait times appears elevated for the base iPhone 17 model but muted for the other three. The firm believes that there is upside risk to iPhone builds driven by the iPhone 17 Base and Air variants. This aligns with recent reports that Apple suppliers are increasing production of the Base model.
Meanwhile, wait times for the Pro and Pro Max outside China are consistent with last year, while Air models are flat to down compared to the 16 plus.
According to the firm, the transition toward entry-level phone models may limit average selling price upside in the September’25 quarter. Tracking wait times is going to be a key metric, as they flattened or shortened around this time last year.
“UBS Evidence Lab data (>Access Dataset) that tracks iPhone availability across 30 geographies suggests elevated YoY wait times for the Base across key end markets, but relatively muted demand for the other three models. We believe that the data is consistent with our view that there is upside risk to iPhone builds, driven by the iPhone 17 Base and Air variants, as well as recent media reports indicating Apple suppliers are increasing iPhone 17 Base production. However, we flag that main adjustments to iPhone builds typically begin in November onwards. Further, we note that ex-China, wait times for the Pro and Pro Max are relatively consistent YoY, and flat to down for the Air vs the 16 Plus. Taking into account the implied price increases for the Air and Pro models, but an implied price decrease for the Base (by raising the starting storage to 256GB), initial demand mixing to the entry-level iPhone may limit ASP upside in the Sept-25 quarter in our view. Wait times will be important to track going forward as we note that they began to flatten or shorten at this time last year depending on the model and geography.”
Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

US stocks bounced after a three-day slide but still ending the week lower. For more on the train day takeaways, let's get to Yahoo Finances Jared Blikre. Jared.
Thank you. You know, I was going to start with a weekly recap, but the major indices really not doing that much. So I thought we'd just talk about Apple, which finally turned green this week in 2025 and it kind of came a uh it kind of came alive recently. And by the way, if you're into seasonality, October is supposed to be a really good month for Apple and the back half of September is when it starts. So here's the year to date. You can see it was negative today, but up a whopping 2%, but this is what it's done from the lows and you can see while Tesla and some of the others were just kind of rocketing out of there, it took Apple a little bit more time. And by the way, Tesla actually turned green last week. I mentioned that around the bell. So Apple has been lagging, but maybe it's going to fulfill its destiny, its history as being a leader in October. That remains to be seen. So we got some other concerns there, but let's just look at what happened with the Mag 7 this week. Amazon is another interesting story, down 5%. had some concerns with the FTC. Meta and Alphabet down, only Nvidia and Tesla in the green there. So the AI trade and tech kind of took a backseat this week, but we saw other things assert. So in my mind, it was just another case of rotation. We're about to finish the month of September and finally that negative seasonality rolls off and we can look forward to October, which is prime time crash season. Doesn't mean it always has to happen, but that's when you see some Vix uh Vix spikes, just saying.
So bottom line, Yes. stocks a little lackluster this week. Okay, what was on your radar?
I'll tell you what. Those metals, they are looking precious. And let's just take a look at some of the moves that we saw this week. and we talk about, I talk about gold quite a bit, even silver, but if we to look at the five day totals here, Platinum in the upper left, that's up 11.4%. Palladium, another metal I don't talk a lot about, that was up 9%. Then is silver up 5.8 and somewhere in here. Here's copper. We talked about copper the other day, 4%. So in this inflationary environment, and we are an inflationary environment because we're we learned PC is what, 2.8, 2.9% today. The Fed's target is 2% and the Fed is cutting rates. That is a great uh time to be buying metals, to own metals. and you know what, I had the chance to talk to Kenny Glick. This is our, we got, we had uh three clips from him in a row. This is the third day and we were talking about him with silver the other day. I thought this would be just perfect. Take a listen.
put a dead logo on a silver coin, I'm in, you know? So I I I if you want to own SLV or it's it's an easy way to own silver, but the easiest thing and again, if you like collecting silver coins, you know, they're called silver rounds. You don't have to buy the Eagles because the Eagles are the US government official coin. They have a little premium, but you could just buy one ounce rounds, you know, you get them for a dollar over spot and it's a it's a nice way, you know.
And if you're doing that your whole life, like storage, where are you putting all the storage?
Yeah. My mom's like, when are you coming to get all this stuff? I'm like, I just brought you more.
Yeah, he just brought more to his mom's house. Anyway, that's so you can silver actually, if you want to store a large dollar amount of silver, it's going to take up some space. So that's why I think investors turned to gold, platinum and palladium because much smaller there. Um, so I think we're done with metals for just the time being.
What about that crypto sell off?
Let's talk, let's talk about that. Um, Bitcoin has taken a beat, admittedly, not a big change from yesterday. Yesterday we were talking about that big drop. Uh, we saw some big time liquidations. But today, I just kind of wanted to talk about the price dynamics that have evolved um, in this President Trump term uh because we have a much more friendly SEC and I think it was in early 2020 was it 2025 or 24 that we finally got the spot Bitcoin ETFs. My brain uh, isn't keeping track of that. But my point is is that we have a lot of uh things kind of in a loop here. And so when you start de-leveraging in one, uh you got the futures, you got uh micro strategy, you got micro strategy that's levered, um, and it's just kind of crazy how much leverage is built into this already volatile trade. So the fact that, let's check out the five day total here. The fact that it's only down 5% is really not a big deal in the long term, in the big scheme of things. Again, I'm watching the 110 price level, give or take 1000 or two. I would love to see it dip down to like 107, 108 over the weekend and then just rocket higher um, and be about 112 or 113 by Monday. That would be a very bullish signal to me. But if we camp out by these lows too long, we're probably going to sink and we're going to have to chop around, maybe we test 100 again. And then we have Ethereum. Ethereum down 4.5%. Um, we still have a potential support level right here, about 4,000, that's a big psychological level. I think that holds in the near term, but if Bitcoin uh tests that 100,000 and especially if it slides below that, watch out because Ethereum could drop pretty quickly there. So Ethereum is not as levered as Bitcoin, but it definitely follows the same place uh playbook. And if you're keeping track of the whole board here, we didn't see a whole lot of green. uh a couple there, but for the most part it was kind of an off week. So I I do like to see breath in crypto and that's not really what we saw this week.
Finally, what's on the Jared Blikre radar for next week?
Jobs, jobs, jobs. And also be interested Monday, Tuesday to see how September closes out. We tend to see the biggest weakness at the end of the month and we're kind of there right now. We had a positive day, but uh that's just history. So we'll see what history says one week from now.
Thank you, buddy. Appreciate it."

The federal government’s decision to use taxpayer money to buy a stake in Intel has rankled many, including sworn free-market capitalist Kevin O’Leary.
If you ask him, Intel should suffer a very different fate.
“It's like a fish dying in the ocean. So Intel is a fish. It dies. It goes to the bottom. The slugs eat it,” the Shark Tank host tells Moneywise, arguing the company is best consumed by its competitors.

The $8.9 billion purchase of Intel (INTC) shares makes the embattled chip manufacturer, which has fallen behind its competitors amid the AI boom, a partially state-owned enterprise. That’s far more common in places like China and Europe, but it may not be a rarity in the U.S. for long.
Recently, the Trump administration bought an equity stake in MP Materials (MP), a rare-earth materials company, and took a “golden share” in U.S. Steel. There’s also been talk of buying stakes in defense contractors, like Lockheed Martin (LMT).
“I don't like governments picking winners and losers in any sector, ever,” O’Leary says.

Unfortunately for him, the administration is now reportedly considering shares in yet another company: a mining venture that could be seen as critical to national security.
Making Intel great again
The decision to give Intel taxpayer money did not originate with the Trump administration.
The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act signed by President Joe Biden awarded Intel about $8 billion in grants to support its manufacturing expansion plans and strengthen national security. It was also awarded $3.2 billion as part of the Secure Enclave program.
The company has been paid $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants but needed to meet certain milestones to receive the remaining $6 billion, which was looking unlikely.
What the Trump administration has done is rewritten the terms of the deal.
In an Aug. 25 post [1] captioned “The Art of the Deal: Intel,” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said the president decided it would be “fair” if “America had shares” in Intel in exchange for the monetary support, which in total comes to $11.1 billion."

Yet another compound growth story is unfolding in the world of big tech that it would be easy to overlook. With a market-leading cloud computing business, a high-margin advertising business, and a faster, automated logistics network that continues to lower costs, Amazon (AMZN -0.69%) may soon take the investing world by surprise. Here's why Amazon's market capitalization could cross $5 trillion by 2030.
Impressive financial performance
Amazon's recent financial results have been impressive. In the second quarter, revenues were up 12% year over year to $167.7 billion, while operating income surged 31% to $19.2 billion. Its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), saw revenues grow 17.5% to $30.9 billion, while advertising revenues were up 22% to $15.7 billion. Amazon has also generated a robust $18.2 billion free cash flow in the last four reported quarters.
Management expects revenues to fall in the range of $174 billion to $179.5 billion in the third quarter, including a modest positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
AWS Strength
Amazon is the leader in the global cloud infrastructure market with a 30% share, and AWS will continue to benefit from the transition of more IT work from on-premises infrastructure to cloud-based systems. Currently, an estimated 85% to 90% of IT spending goes to on-premises systems, but that mix is set to shift as the adoption of AI accelerates. AWS is also well positioned to capitalize on the increasing shift of enterprise AI spending from model training to inference workloads -- the real-time deployment of AI models. Eventually, inference is expected to account for nearly 80% to 90% of total AI costs as pilot projects advance into commercial use.
Generative AI inference is also expected to become a standard service, similar to computing, storage, or databases. We can expect that companies will prefer to run these workloads in the same cloud regions as their other applications and enterprise data. Since there are more applications running on AWS than anywhere else, and vast amounts of enterprise data are stored there, it could become the preferred cloud computing platform for inference workloads.
AWS is also pushing down its AI costs. Management claims that its custom Trainium2 chip delivers approximately 30% to 40% better price performance for inference than other chipmakers' GPUs. Anthropic is training its next Claude models on Trainium2, and Amazon Bedrock uses it for inference. The company is also working on the third iteration of the Trainium chip, which is expected to be even more effective for computing and inference workloads. Based on all that, the price-performance edge could become a long-term differentiator for AWS.
AWS clocked an impressive annualized revenue run rate of $123 billion as of the end of the second quarter. The cloud computing business also had an incredible backlog of $195 billion, up 25% year over year, giving it significant visibility into its future revenues. Additionally, management expects demand to keep outpacing available capacity. These conditions are expected to improve in the next several quarters.
Advertising business
Amazon's advertising offerings, spanning its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch, Fire TV, and live sports, help advertisers reach an audience of more than 300 million people in the U.S.
In June, Amazon partnered with Roku to give advertisers using the Amazon demand-side platform access to over 80 million connected TV households in the U.S. Amazon has also integrated its demand-side platform with Disney's real-time ad exchange, thereby giving advertisers direct programmatic access to premium ad inventory on platforms such as Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu. With access to customers' identity, Amazon's shopping signals, and premium streaming inventory, advertisers will be better able to effectively target the audiences they're aiming for. This, in turn, is expected to boost the advertising business in the coming quarters.
Improving retail margins
Amazon is focusing on improving its retail margins, too. It reorganized its U.S. logistics network around a regional structure, placing inventory closer to customers, increasing direct lanes, and enhancing product consolidation. All of this cut miles and human touches out of the process, speeding delivery and lowering costs. Combined with large-scale automation and robotics, including its DeepFleet AI system, the retail business is on a path to higher margins
How will Amazon become a $5 trillion company?
Amazon trades today at a cheap valuation of just 3.7 times sales. To become a $5 trillion company, it would not need to expand its valuation multiples to unsustainable levels.
If AWS continues to grow revenues at a low-to-mid-teens percentage as its capacity increases and inference workloads ramp up, advertising grows at a rate in the high-teens to 20% due to robust connected TV partnerships, and retail margins improve thanks to the benefits of the regional network and automation, Amazon will have a potent revenue mix and enhanced margins. While AWS and the advertising business will boost profitability, the retail segment will help reduce the company's cost to serve customers -- translating into higher profit margins, robust cash flows, and better visibility. That setup is far stronger than Amazon enjoyed when its valuation peaked at around 4.6 times sales earlier in the decade. Back then, its advertising business was smaller, its AI opportunity was limited, and its logistics were far less efficient.
Now, we can expect the company to be trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 5 to 7 by 2030, reflecting the blended effect of higher multiples for its cloud computing and advertising businesses, and lower multiples attributed to the slower growth of its retail business. The company can trade at even higher multiples if it continues its leadership in AI inference.
Analysts expect Amazon's revenues will be nearly $1.15 trillion in 2030. Assuming that P/S multiple expands to even 5, then we can expect Amazon's market capitalization to be almost $5.75 trillion by 2030 -- well above the $5 trillion mark."

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 6% in the afternoon session after the stock continued a multi-day rally amid reports that the U.S. administration was considering new measures to boost domestic chip production, alongside news of the company seeking strategic investments.
The potential government policy would require chipmakers to expand their U.S. production, possibly facing tariffs if they imported more chips than they made domestically. Such a move would benefit companies like Intel with a significant manufacturing presence in the U.S.
Adding to the positive sentiment, the company reportedly approached both Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) about potential investments or partnerships. These discussions followed recent multibillion-dollar investments from Nvidia and a 10% stake taken by the U.S. government, fueling optimism about the chipmaker's turnaround efforts. The session's gains extended a recent surge for the stock, which had risen more than 20% over several trading days on the news of potential outside investments.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $35.63, up 4.9% from previous close.
Is now the time to buy Intel? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 35 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 6.3% as reports surfaced that the company was pursuing an investment from Apple and it received a stock upgrade from Seaport Research.
The move continued a rally from the previous trading session, which was initially sparked by a Bloomberg report about the early-stage discussions between the two tech giants. Following these developments, Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg upgraded Intel's stock to 'Neutral' from 'Sell.' While the analyst's note expressed caution that Intel was “on the wrong path with a shrinking window,"" it also stated the stock would likely be driven by follow-on investments in the near term.
This potential investment from Apple followed a series of other capital infusions, including a reported $5 billion from Nvidia and $2 billion from SoftBank, as part of Intel's efforts to bolster its business.
Intel is up 76.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $35.63 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $692.72.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

The company’s AI division is using the app to quickly evaluate new features for Siri, Apple’s voice-powered assistant. That includes testing the ability to search through personal data, such as songs and emails, and perform in-app actions like editing photos, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative is private.
The software — code-named Veritas, Latin for “truth” — is meant for internal use, at least for now. Apple has no current plans to release it to consumers. The app essentially takes the still-in-progress technology from the new Siri and puts it in a form employees can test out more efficiently. The company also can gather feedback on whether the chatbot format has value.
Even without a public launch, the internal tool marks a new phase in Apple’s preparations for Siri’s overhaul, a high-stakes release that could reshape perceptions of its AI efforts.
The new Siri is now slated to debut as early as March after multiple delays. If the software works as promised, it could help propel Apple toward an AI comeback. If it falls short, the company risks slipping further behind smartphone rivals such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Samsung Electronics Co.
Competition over AI features is expected to ramp up next year, making it a more decisive factor in smartphone purchasing decisions. When Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 this month, the company notably avoided highlighting its in-house AI platform.
Apple had planned to release the Siri overhaul last spring but delayed the rollout after engineering problems caused the features to fail as much as a third of the time, Bloomberg News previously reported.
The internal Veritas app resembles most popular chatbots, letting users manage multiple conversations across different topics. It can save and reference past chats, follow up on earlier queries and support extended back-and-forth exchanges.
A spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.
The app is designed to test the revamped underlying system, code-named Linwood, that Apple has built to power the new Siri. That software relies on large language models — the technology underpinning generative AI — and combines work from Apple’s own Foundation Models team with a third-party model."

Mohan says carrier promotions make iPhones more affordable by bundling device financing with wireless service on one monthly bill, sometimes making the phone free with an eligible trade-in on select plans.
He highlights that buyers can spread payments over 24 or 36 months.
The analyst notes that, versus last year, subsidies on the new iPhone 17 family are about $100 higher to offset the iPhone 17 Pro’s higher entry price, which now starts at $1,099 for 256GB compared with the iPhone 16 Pro’s $999 for 128GB.
According to T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) management, iPhone activations are up by double digits across both new and existing customers.
Mohan adds that Verizon Communications Inc.’s (NYSE: VZ) commentary also points to strong upgrade activity within its installed base this quarter, which he believes could carry through to the iPhone launch window.
Finally, the analyst observes that current lead times show broader iPhone 17 shipping estimates extending versus last year, while Pro and Pro Max timing appears similar to last year.
Mohan says trade-in offers imply carriers are nudging upgrades on roughly a two-to-four-year cycle, since the richest credits, up to about $1,100, depending on provider, are reserved for newer models, typically iPhone 13 and later.
He adds that criteria have loosened, with all three carriers now taking devices in any condition, including cracked or non-working phones.
Mohan notes that even with trade-ins, customers still face upfront costs: an activation fee of $35–$40, plus taxes calculated on the phone’s full retail price.
He adds that opting for AppleCare+ raises the tab by $119/$139.
In a scenario using the highest available trade-in credits, Mohan estimates initial outlays of roughly $229–$234 for an iPhone 17 and $380–$385 for an iPhone 17 Pro Max.
As for carriers, Mohan points out a few strings attached: buyers must move to a specific unlimited tier, which can cost more than basic or lower-tier plans, and the promotional phone credits are applied monthly over the installment term. He says those terms typically run 24 months at T-Mobile and 36 months at Verizon and AT&T (NYSE: T)."

Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financials) is seeing encouraging early momentum for the iPhone 17, according to Evercore ISI, which said the new lineup could mark the start of a stronger-than-expected upgrade cycle.
Analyst Amit Daryanani cited results from a survey of nearly 4,000 consumers that pointed to solid demand, especially for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. About 56% of respondents said they planned to buy one of the two higher-end models, with many opting for larger memory configurations after Apple eliminated lower storage tiers.
That shift is helping average selling prices, Daryanani noted, while interest in the new camera, battery and display features was stronger than demand for artificial intelligence capabilities. Last year, Apple's focus on Apple Intelligence created a short-lived bump that ultimately disappointed.
The analyst kept an Outperform rating on the stock and raised his price target to $290 from $260. Shares slipped 0.8% in premarket trading Friday.
Not all models are seeing the same traction. The iPhone Air has lagged, with only 9% of consumers in the survey planning to buy it. Concerns about battery life and a single-camera design may be weighing on demand.
Beyond hardware, Apple's services business continues to grow. Four of five key segments tracked by Evercore, led by Apple Pay, showed strength in the latest data.
Daryanani said he expects this could be the start of a durable iPhone cycle, with early reports pointing to double-digit sales growth at T-Mobile and strong demand in China."

Interview Kickstart announced the expansion of its Machine Learning Course curriculum to address the growing demand for professionals skilled in AI technologies optimized for custom silicon architectures. The program responds to recent industry developments where major technology companies are investing heavily in proprietary AI chips, creating new skill requirements for machine learning engineers. For more information, visit: https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/machine-learning-course
The custom AI chip market has experienced significant growth as companies like Amazon, Apple, and OpenAI develop specialized hardware to reduce dependency on traditional GPU suppliers. Amazon's Annapurna Labs recently expanded production of its Trainium chip, which now powers AWS AI infrastructure for cost-effective computing solutions. OpenAI has partnered with TSMC to develop custom AI processors aimed at enhancing efficiency and reducing reliance on external hardware providers.
These developments have created demand for machine learning professionals who understand both software optimization and hardware-specific implementations. Technology companies report difficulty finding candidates with experience in deploying AI applications on custom silicon architectures that offer improved performance and energy efficiency compared to general-purpose processors.
""The shift toward custom AI chips requires machine learning engineers to understand hardware-software optimization in ways that weren't necessary just two years ago,"" said Rachel Martinez, Director of AI Curriculum at Interview Kickstart. ""Companies need professionals who can design AI solutions that leverage the specific capabilities of proprietary silicon rather than generic implementations.""
The expanded seven-month curriculum begins with foundational Python programming and progresses through classical machine learning, deep learning, and applied generative AI techniques. Students work on practical projects including smart retail analytics systems for customer segmentation and conversational AI tools using LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation frameworks.
The program includes specialized modules addressing deployment challenges specific to custom AI hardware environments. Participants learn to optimize machine learning models for different silicon architectures, addressing the performance considerations that have become critical as companies implement proprietary chip solutions."

Las Vegas, NV-based MP Materials is the largest producer of rare earth materials in the Western Hemisphere. It operates the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine and Processing Facility, the only rare earth mining and processing site of scale in North America. With a market capitalization of $13.7 billion, MP has established itself as the nation’s only fully integrated producer, spanning the supply chain from mining and processing to advanced magnet production.
Lakewood, CO- based Energy Fuels, with a market capitalization of $3.99 billion, is a leading producer of natural uranium concentrates. To diversify into rare earths, the company acquired several heavy mineral sand projects. Using its byproduct (monazite), UUUU is producing high-purity separated rare earth oxide neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) at commercial-scale at its White Mesa mill in Utah. It is also piloting separation of the “heavy” rare earth elements.
REEs are critical inputs across many existing and emerging clean-tech applications. For investors seeking to capitalize on future growth, the question is which stock they should put their bets on. To make an informed decision, let us analyze their fundamentals, growth potential and key challenges.
The Case for MP Materials
MP Materials’ second-quarter 2025 revenues surged 84% year over year to $57.4 million. The company produced 597 metric tons of NdPr, a 119% increase from the year-ago quarter. Rare earth oxides (REO) production increased 45% to 13,145 metric tons on higher recoveries from the continued implementation of Upstream 60K optimizations.
The Materials segment’s revenues increased 20% to $37.5 million on higher sales volumes and realized pricing. The Magnetics segment continues to ramp up commercial metal deliveries and generated revenues of $19.9 million in the quarter.
Despite the improvement in revenues, higher production costs and selling, general and administrative expenses led to a second-quarter loss of 13 cents, wider than the loss of 17 cents in the second quarter of 2024. Notably, the company’s strategy of producing and selling more separated products at Mountain Pass and the ramp-up of output of magnetic precursor products are expected to lead to higher costs this year.
In July, MP Materials announced a landmark long-term agreement to supply Apple AAPL with rare earth magnets manufactured in the United States, entirely from recycled materials. Also, in July, MP Materials entered into a public-private partnership with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) that will fast-track the development of a domestic rare earth magnet supply chain."

Apple’s new AirPods Pro 3, which retail for £219 ($249), come with a feature called Live Translation. To use this feature, one must have AirPods Pro 2, AirPods 4 with ANC, or AirPods Pro 3 and an iPhone 15 Pro or later running iOS 26.
Currently, the languages available are English (both British English and American English), French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. Later in 2025, Apple will add Italian, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese.
AirPods Pro 3 could be a game-changer
This feature could be a game-changer for international communication. This real-life Babel fish would make holidays abroad less daunting.
However; the technology raises an important question. Namely, is struggling with language not a big part of travelling abroad? Trying to communicate in a shop or asking for directions opens the gates to other forms of communication, such as eye contact, facial expressions, and hand gestures. Surely, this is all part of the travel experience. If we rely too heavily on our AirPods, are we going to lose these important skills?
In addition, making the effort to learn a bit of a language before and during a trip abroad provides a sense of achievement, as well as training the brain. A lot of English-speaking tourists already do not really bother to learn local languages because they assume locals will speak English. This attitude makes us less open to different cultures. Would this be enhanced if one could simply click a few buttons and feel like they are back in their home country?
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataA big part of learning is making mistakes. With new languages, this is especially true. We must acknowledge that we will make mistakes and struggle, but continue to try to communicate. This is the only way to progress and get better at said language.
Choosing the easy way out
If the option is there to just pick up our AirPods and save ourselves the embarrassment of attempting to speak a new language, we are most likely going to choose that easy way out. Always opting for the AirPods will not give us the opportunity to improve our language skills.
Phones can already be a mask to hide behind when in conversations. If you are on your phone, you can avoid eye contact with others. This creates a wall between people. Using this translation feature would ensure that phones are even more involved in our everyday conversations. Undoubtedly, the temptation to hide behind them will become even stronger."

Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial upgraded the price target following the company’s recent launch event and the expansion of its ecosystem. Feinseth pointed to Apple’s inclusion of new products this year and its services growth.
JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee also reiterates a Buy rating on AAP, however, without a price target. Chatterjee mentioned that Apple’s lead time following its initial iPhone 17 pre-orders on September 12, on average, has increased by four days across the lineup. This is driven by 7 days of expansion for iPhone 17, three days for Air, five days for 17 Pro, and two days for 17 Pro Max.
Apple’s lead times are tracking higher compared to the iPhone 16 cycle, as per Chatterjee. The analyst expects the base model, iPhone 17, to be the key force driving the highest upside surprise. As of September 23, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) average price target of $247.50, based on analysts’ estimates, implies a downside of almost 3.35% from current levels. Whereas, Tigress Financial’s price target of $305 indicates an upside of nearly 19.20% from current levels.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, and other electronic wearables and accessories. The company is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and personnel. Apple has introduced ‘Apple Intelligence’ to provide AI features across its lineup.

“By slashing red tape and transforming the planning system to get Britain building again we are investing in this country’s renewal and building an economy that works for working people,"" she added.

Sep 26 - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares climbed 8.8% on Thursday and 3% on early Friday, capping a strong run that has lifted the stock 37% since Sept. 17 and 69% year to date. The surge reflects renewed investor confidence as the company secures major outside backing and benefits from improving demand in its core PC market.
CEO Lip-Bu Tan has attracted significant commitments in recent weeks. SoftBank invested $2 billion, the U.S. government took a 10% stake, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) pledged $5 billion. Reports also point to potential talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on investment or partnership opportunities.
Separately, speculation has resurfaced around a possible joint venture with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) to operate some of Intel's foundry facilities.
Adding to momentum, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) said this week that PC demand is rebounding. The transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11 and rising adoption of AI-enabled PCs are expected to push PC unit growth higher in 2025. That trend directly supports Intel, whose PC business remains its largest source of revenue.
Is INTC Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average target price for Intel Corp is $25.08 with a high estimate of $43.00 and a low estimate of $14.00. The average target implies a downside of -26.21% from the current price of $33.99.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Intel Corp in one year is $23.35, suggesting a downside of -31.30% from the current price of $33.99."

Early talks are now ongoing on how to work more closely together. However, negotiations can still fall through.
Earlier this month, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) secured a $5 billion investment from chip giant Nvidia Corp.
The partnership would also cover the joint development of AI infrastructures and personal computing products that accelerate applications and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise, and consumer markets.
Additionally, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia will focus on seamlessly connecting their architectures using the latter’s NVLink, which would integrate the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Intel’s leading CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem to deliver cutting-edge solutions for customers.
For data centers, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) will build NVIDIA-custom x86 CPUs that NVIDIA will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market.
For personal computing, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) will build and offer to the market x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. The new x86 RTX SOCs will power a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs.

The subscription will cost £2.99 per month when purchased via web browsers or £3.99 per month through iOS and Android devices, with the price difference reflecting fees charged by Apple and Google. For each additional account in a user’s Meta Accounts Center, an extra fee of £2 per month on web or £3 per month on mobile will apply.
Meta emphasized that users who choose not to subscribe can continue using Facebook and Instagram for free with personalized ads, maintaining access to existing ad control tools like Ad Preferences.
The company is implementing this change following ""extensive engagement"" with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Meta noted that subscribers’ personal data will not be used to show them ads.
In its announcement, Meta contrasted the UK’s ""pro-growth and pro-innovation regulatory environment"" with the European Union, where the company claims regulators are ""overreaching"" by requiring a less personalized ads experience.
Meta highlighted the economic impact of its advertising technologies in the UK, stating they were linked to £65 billion in economic activity and over 357,000 jobs in 2024 alone. The company also cited that every pound spent on Meta ads drives an average of £3.82 in revenues for UK businesses.
The new subscription option will be rolled out to UK users aged 18 and over in the coming weeks.

The US technology giant said UK users aged over 18 will in the coming weeks see notifications allowing them to subscribe to Facebook and Instagram for £2.99 a month via web browsers, or £3.99 on Apple’s iOS or Android mobile systems, for the first Meta account, to stop seeing ads.
It stressed that while social media services are personalised, when someone subscribes, their personal data “will not be used to show them ads”.
Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta said the option was more expensive to subscribe on iOS and Android due to the fees that Apple and Google charge through their purchasing policies.
Users will still be able to choose to see personalised ads and access Facebook and Instagram for free.
It comes after guidance from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which said it welcomed the move by Meta.
In March, Meta agreed to stop targeting a UK campaigner with adverts based on her personal data in a legal agreement which avoided a trial in the High Court in London.
Human rights campaigner Tanya O’Carroll had filed a lawsuit against Facebook’s collection of personal details.
The ICO had supported her stance and at the time agreed that Meta was “processing Ms O’Carroll’s personal data for direct marketing purposes”.
It added that profiling related to those purposes meant Ms O’Carroll had the “absolute right to object to such processing” under UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules.
The ICO has since been engaging with Meta on the issue.
Meta said: “We’re making this change in response to recent regulatory guidance from the ICO.
“It will give people in the UK a clear choice about whether their data is used for personalised advertising, while preserving the free access and value that the ads-supported internet creates for people, businesses and platforms.”
It added that its ad-free subscription charges were “at a price that is one of the lowest in the market”.
An ICO spokesperson said: “We welcome Meta’s decision to ask users for consent to use their personal information to target them with ads.
“This moves Meta away from targeting users with ads as part of the standard terms and conditions for using its Facebook and Instagram services, which we’ve been clear is not in line with UK law.
“People must be given meaningful transparency and choice about how their information is used.
“At the same time, the ICO recognises that online platforms, like every business, need to operate commercially.”"

Dealmaking is the name of the game. Just ask Intel (INTC).
The unlikely Wall Street comeback kid received another boost this week as a potential deal with Apple (AAPL) has come to light. A legacy chipmaker left behind after the explosion of mobile computing and social platforms and, most recently, in the AI scramble, Intel is now in the earliest stages of an unexpected resurgence.
But it isn't a technological breakthrough that has reversed the company's fortunes. Instead, investors are flocking because of a succession of monumental deals: first from the federal government, then with Nvidia, and now, according to Bloomberg and others, chatter of a partnership with the iPhone maker — around five years after the two companies' very public break-up that even has its own Wikipedia entry.
Intel has approached Apple about securing an investment to bolster a business that's now a part of the administration's agenda: reviving domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The reported early-stage talks may not lead to an agreement, but they highlight Intel's turnaround strategy of dealmaking. Intel, according to the report, has also reached out to other companies about potential partnerships.
The news of the talks with Apple comes amid a hot streak of investments. SoftBank (9984.T), the Japanese tech giant, announced a $2 billion investment in Intel last month. And Nvidia, the tech company at the heart of the AI trade, unveiled plans to invest $5 billion in Intel, in a collaboration to develop chips for data centers and personal computers. Last month, the Trump administration agreed to buy a roughly 10% stake in the company, reigniting investor interest.
But similar to other marquee American brands, think Boeing or Apple, Intel's importance is bigger than its market cap.
It's hard to quantify what it means for a ticker to hold national security interests — there isn't a line item for contributing to US technological sovereignty, or being a future component in an international AI arms race. Nonetheless, the value is there. As the nation's last premier chipmaker, Intel's revival, as far as the White House is concerned, advances the dual aims of shielding strategic industries from foreign control and re-shoring some level of manufacturing capacity.
In the days following the government ownership announcement, observers speculated how the US stake might influence Intel's decision making or the broader tech industry. After all, the deal challenges free market principles around private sector management and the free flow of capital. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said any US investment in Intel would be aimed at helping the company stabilize its business, and that the government would not force other companies to buy Intel's chips."

His confident remarks reflected the company's determination to win over Chinese Apple fans, who placed a record number of pre-orders for the new iPhones two weeks ago, defying expectations of tepid demand due to weak consumer spending and heated competition from Chinese competitors like Huawei Technologies.

""The Xiaomi 17 Pro series represents the company's boldest attempt yet to position its flagship directly against Apple,"" said Chiew Le Xuan, mobility research analyst at Canalys.
""Beyond raw performance and pricing, Xiaomi is deploying a series of symbolic and strategic marketing moves ... clear signals that Xiaomi wants to be seen not just as an alternative, but as a peer rival to Apple in the premium segment.""

Xiaomi and its Chinese rivals have been strengthening their foothold in the 4,000 to 6,000 yuan (US$561 to US$841) segment while making inroads into the premium tier, according to Ivan Lam, senior analyst at consultancy Counterpoint Research.
The latest Xiaomi smartphone series reinforced that trend by ""boosting upgrades across critical specifications and introducing notable innovations"", he said, adding that the brand has got off to ""a good start"" with its strategy of ""bigger improvements with minimal price mark-up"".
In the second quarter, Xiaomi was the fourth-largest smartphone vendor in China, surpassing Apple, which ranked fifth, according to research firm IDC.
In an unconventional decision, Xiaomi jumped directly to the 17 series after launching the 15 line-up in October. Lu Weibing, president of Xiaomi's smartphone division, said last week that the new naming reflected significant enhancements in the Xiaomi phones rather than an attempt to ""ride on Apple's publicity""."

Since then, the biggest tech companies in the world have only grown bigger and wielded even more influence over the stock market.
Apple touched a $3 trillion market cap in early 2022 just ahead of the market downturn. It has since been joined (and surpassed) in the $3 trillion club by Microsoft and Nvidia.
The newer members have seen their fortunes rise on the back of growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia designs leading-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for AI training and inference. Microsoft is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, outfitting its huge data centers with GPU servers and renting capacity to AI developers, including generative AI leader OpenAI.
This month, another AI stock joined the $3 trillion club, but it could easily climb even higher over the next few years. Here's what investors need to know.
Say hello to the newest member of the $3 trillion club
On Sept. 15, Alphabet (GOOG 1.52%) (GOOGL 1.57%) entered the $3 trillion club after its shares received a boost from news about a friendly court ruling.
After the courts ruled that Alphabet violated antitrust law with its Google search engine and its stranglehold over the search advertising market, the company faced potential remedies that could have significantly hurt its earnings and operations. Some speculated that it would have to divest its Chrome web browser or Android operating system. Others thought the court might bar it from making revenue-sharing deals with other web browser owners that make it the default search engine.
But when the judge made his remedies ruling earlier this month, it was far more lenient: no required divestitures, and Alphabet could continue making deals as a default search engine as long as it didn't require exclusivity.
Not only was the ruling a boon for Alphabet's stock, it also meant Apple could hold on to a key component of its services business. Alphabet's biggest contract is with Apple, which makes Google the default search engine across its billions of devices (where legal). That nets Apple $20 billion per year in fees, which practically all goes toward its bottom line.
More importantly, the ruling lifts a huge overhang for the stock prices of both companies. And while Alphabet shares have already climbed substantially higher, they could continue climbing from here due to multiple factors.
What could drive the company to a $4 trillion market cap?
Alphabet's stock was weighed down by the potential remedies it faced, but that's not the only thing impeding the stock. Many fear that growing competition from AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Perplexity will eat into Google's market share. In fact, that was one of the main reasons the judge didn't come down harder on Alphabet.
But the impact of those search alternatives has yet to show up in Alphabet's financial results. Its Google search revenue accelerated last quarter, growing 12% year over year. And with AI features like its Overviews, Circle to Search, and Google Lens driving increased traffic and monetizing at high rates, that trend could continue as the company expands those features.
On top of that, AI is driving considerable growth for Alphabet's cloud computing business. It surpassed a $50 billion run rate in the second quarter, and its operating margin expanded to 21%. Operating margin could expand as Alphabet scales up its operations. Amazon, for example, has an operating margin for its cloud computing business of 37% over the last 12 months.
Alphabet's Other Bets could provide another catalyst for the stock. Specifically, its Waymo self-driving car business has made significant progress in expanding operations over the last two years, and its progress could accelerate over the next few years. It recently announced plans to enter Nashville, its 12th major market, and is testing its service in six other markets, including New York and Tokyo.
But here's what could be the biggest factor driving Alphabet to $4 trillion: multiple expansion. Even after the price appreciation that pushed the company's value above $3 trillion, the stock currently trades for just 25.7 times forward earnings estimates. Meanwhile, the other members of the $3 trillion club all trade for an average earnings multiple above 35.
If Alphabet's multiple expands to just 29 times forward earnings by the end of next year, the company will be worth well over $4 trillion based on current estimates for 2027 earnings."

- Shares of Intel extended their recent rally Friday following reports the company is soliciting an investment from Apple after winning a $5 billion pledge from Nvidia last week.
- Wall Street analysts said they see new developments bringing more gains in the near term, though they still have concerns about the company's fundamentals.
Not long ago, it was hard to find people who were excited about Intel’s stock.
But these days, even skeptics are finding it difficult to look away, with President Donald Trump's recent endorsement, a high-profile investment from Nvidia (NVDA), and rumors swirling about still more deals—leaving some investors wondering whether persistent concerns about the chipmaker’s business should be overlooked to get in on the action.
""We have been of the belief that Intel remains fundamentally challenged though have been terrified to short it,"" Bernstein analysts wrote Thursday. ""As much as we hate to admit it 'Trump wants the stock to go up' may in fact be a valid bull case for now (not one we are prepared to make but given everything that is happening we wouldn’t talk you out of it for now).""
Why This Matters for Intel Investors
Underpinning Intel's turnaround story are expectations that it will gain more clients for its chip manufacturing business, which the Trump administration has called fundamental to expanding America's domestic chip manufacturing and national security interests. Investors have pulled the shares higher lately, which some analysts suggest may be premature.
Intel's (INTC) stock climbed over 4% to close just above $35 Friday, after jumping nearly 9% Thursday. A report that Apple (AAPL) could be the struggling chipmaker's next big investor has extended a torrid run since the struggling chipmaker announced Nvidia's $5 billion pledge last week. The shares have added more than three-quarters of their value this year, though they remain well off their 2021 highs.
Seaport Research Partners analysts, who upgraded the stock to neutral from a bearish rating this week, said they expect the trend could continue—at least in the near term. ""The stock is likely to be driven by follow-on investments,"" they wrote, though signs of improving fortunes at Intel's foundry business are also vital. (Seaport said it remained ""cautious on the company's longer-term fundamentals."")
Nvidia's deal did not include commitments to using Intel's foundry, and a potential deal with Apple might not either. In a Thursday interview with CNBC, Deepwater Asset Management co-founder Gene Munster suggested that an investment in Intel might be more useful to Apple as a tool for currying favor with the Trump administration.

Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have overwhelmingly preferred to stick to the sidelines with ""hold"" ratings, with targets suggesting they see an eventual pullback in the stock. The Street's current consensus target, near $26, is roughly 28% below Friday's close, a measure of caution even as the shares have climbed.
For some analysts, it's less about momentum than what the latest news flow yields. If Intel can demonstrate a capacity to make parts that meet companies’ needs for scale, speed and cost, Bernstein said, “they will have customers lined up around the block to use them, and if they can’t no customer in their right mind would ever put any meaningful volume with them.”
And ""encouragement"" from the government, according to Bernstein, wouldn’t help. “More than money,” they wrote, “Intel needs customers.”

It came as Keir Starmer unveiled plans to introduce a mandatory digital ID card for all UK working adults to tackle illegal immigration and improve identity verification.

""I know working people are worried about the level of illegal migration into this country. A secure border and controlled migration are reasonable demands, and this government is listening and delivering,"" the prime minister said.
""Digital ID is an enormous opportunity for the UK. It will make it tougher to work illegally in this country, making our borders more secure.
""And it will also offer ordinary citizens countless benefits, like being able to prove your identity to access key services swiftly – rather than hunting around for an old utility bill.""
However, the move has sparked debate over privacy and surveillance concerns. The UK has only introduced compulsory ID cards during wartime, although they stayed in place for several years after Second World War.

Elsewhere, Donald Trump on Thursday night announced tariffs of 100% on medicines and pharmaceutical goods imported into the US, rattling markets in Asia overnight.
The US president also announced 25% tariff on imports of all heavy-duty trucks, 50% tariffs on kitchen cabinets, a 50% tariff on bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, with all the new duties taking effect from 1 October.
The tariffs do not apply to generic pharmaceuticals, and companies will be exempt if they have begun constructing new manufacturing facilities in the US.
He said the new heavy-duty truck tariffs were to protect manufacturers from “unfair outside competition” and said the move would benefit companies such as Paccar-owned Peterbilt and Kenworth and Daimler Truck-owned Freightliner.
He added: “We need our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong, for many reasons, but above all else, for National Security purposes!”
It comes despite controversy over the legality of his tariffs.
Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo Markets, said: ""The tariff news ought to add to the bearish narrative we've seen take hold in equity markets this week, but so far European equity markets are rising and US futures are a bit higher.""

US consumer sentiment falls
US consumer sentiment cooled in September, with the University of Michigan’s consumer morale index dipping to 55.1 points, down from 58.2 in August.
The survey found that Americans are frustrated with high prices, and more pessimistic about labour markets, business conditions and personal expectations. However, those who hold large stakes in the stock market are more positive.
Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu says:

UK economic growth subdued but not stalling, says PwC
UK economic growth is “subdued but not stalling”, according to economists at PwC, as they upgraded projections for the current year.
Experts at the accounting and financial services giant have said that UK gross domestic product (GDP) is now on track to grow by 1.3% in 2025.
It had previously pointed towards an increase of 1.1% for the year.
The new forecast was driven by a stronger than expected first half of the year, with growth of 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.3% in the second quarter.
PwC’s research indicated that growth was “flattered” by Government spending, with higher state consumption and investment in healthcare helping to support growth in the second quarter.
It suggested that household consumption moderated over the quarter, while investment fell as firms were impacted by economic uncertainty and rising costs.
Barret Kupelian, PwC UK chief economist, said consumer spending has been somewhat better than expected despite being broadly flat in recent months.
PwC’s research indicated that a “lasting recovery will require household spending and private sector activity to pick up”.

Meta to launch £3.99 subscriptions for Facebook and Instagram
Facebook and Instagram users in the UK will soon be able to avoid advertisements, if they agree to pay a monthly fee.
The Telegraph has the details...
The ad-free subscriptions, which will be introduced in the coming weeks, will cost £2.99 per month when purchased on the web or £3.99 from a smartphone.
Users can choose to continue to use Meta’s apps for free, but must agree to keep seeing adverts.
Meta said it would begin to notify all UK Facebook and Instagram users over the age of 18 that they have the option to subscribe to its apps. When someone subscribes, their personal information will not be used for advertising, it said.
The paid-for tier follows years of legal battles and wrangling between regulators and Mark Zuckerberg’s tech giant over online privacy.
In March this year, Facebook settled a legal dispute with a British Facebook user who had sued the tech giant over its targeted digital advertising. As part of the deal, it agreed to stop using her personal data.
Tanya O’Carroll had claimed Meta had breached rules with its “unfair terms”, including agreeing to hyper-targeted advertising in exchange for accessing its apps. She had claimed she had started seeing adverts linked to motherhood and pregnancy weeks after she found out she would be having a baby in 2017.
In the aftermath of the case, Meta said it was considering offering a paid subscription tier as an alternative.
Meta has previously launched other forms of subscriptions, including charging £9.99 for users who want to have their profile “verified”.

Oasis fans outspend Swifties in Supersonic Wembley spending surge
As the Gallagher brothers wrap up their UK tour with a final show at Wembley Stadium this Sunday, new analysis from Lloyds reveals that Oasis fans have delivered a significant economic boost to Wembley, outspending even recent mega-concerts from Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour and Dua Lipa’s Radical Optimism Tour.
The long-awaited reunion of the Gallagher brothers on 25 July 2025 sparked an 88% surge in spending compared to a typical Friday. Based on Lloyds’ customer transaction data, which has been extrapolated to represent projected consumer spending, analysts revealed that spending in and around Wembley reached £5.1m during the band’s first Wembley gig this year.
That figure surpasses the £3.7m spent during Taylor Swift’s 2024 Wembley opener and the £3.8mmillion generated by Dua Lipa’s 2025 show.
The reunion triggered a fan-fuelled economic surge that Lloyds has dubbed “Gallaghernomics” – proof that the enduring pull of Oasis outpaced even Swiftonomics and a nod to the economic power of nostalgia, with Oasis fans proving more willing to splash out than their younger pop counterparts.
The analysis was conducted by Lloyds Market Intelligence, which provides businesses with anonymised and aggregated data insights into consumer behaviour.
Enrique Del Rio, managing director at Lloyds Market Intelligence, said:

Daimler Truck shares fall after Trump announces truck tariffs
Germany's Daimler Truck (DTG.DE), which is one of the world's largest commercial vehicle manufacturers, saw its shares fall nearly 3% on Friday morning after president Donald Trump announced tariffs on heavy-duty trucks, adding to trade tensions that have hit the automotive sector hard.
Together with a barrage of tariffs in other sectors, including on pharmaceuticals, Trump said on Thursday the U.S. would impose duties of 25% on imports of heavy-duty trucks from October 1.
Daimler Truck's stock was down 3.3% after opening, making it the biggest decliner in Germany's blue-chip index. Shares in Volkswagen-owned Traton, were 2.8% lower.
Citi said a 25% tariff on trucks assembled in Mexico would likely have a 700-800 million euro ($818-$934 million) impact on earnings for Daimler Truck, although the group could be able to absorb around half of that in the near term via price increases.
Neither Daimler Truck nor Traton export to the United States from Europe as they have factories in the U.S. and sites in Mexico that are covered by the USMCA free trade pact.
Analysts at Bernstein said it had not been explicitly said that Trump's announcement would apply to the USMCA-compliant Mexican sites, but that they assumed it to be the case.

Starbucks to close some US and UK stores
Starbucks will cut around 900 US jobs and close its worst performing stores in the country, as well as shutting some in the UK as part of a cost-saving drive.
Most of the stores earmarked for closure are in North America, with the revamp set to reduce wait times and help revive sales. The US jobs set to be cut would be support staff roles.
It comes after the coffee chain announced in February it was axing 1,100 jobs and simplifying its US menu to help flagging sales in its home market.
Niccol said in a letter to employees that the stores marked for closure were ""unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance"".

Rise in UK fuel margins
New data has shown that UK fuel retailers are hitting British motorists with historically high profit margins.
The Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) reported that fuel margins raked in by supermarkets, and other fuel retailers, rose in the last three months, remaining “far” above historic levels.
Its data shows that supermarket fuel margins stood at 4% in 2017, but more than doubled to an average of 8.4% in the first half of 2025. Non-supermarket fuel margins were 6.4% in 2017, but the first half of this year averaged 9.8%.

Gold (GC=F) traded just shy of its record high on Friday, on track for a sixth weekly gain. The precious metal held near $3,782 an ounce, up 0.3% at the time of writing, and this week after peaking on Tuesday above $3,791.
It was supported by elevated geopolitical tensions, inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds, and a risk-off tone in broader markets.
It also comes as European diplomats warned the Kremlin this week that NATO is ready to respond to further violations of its airspace with full force, including by shooting down Russian planes.
Gold has climbed more than 40% year-to-date, with holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the highest since 2022. Banks including Goldman Sachs have previously said they expect the rally to extend.
After US Federal Reserve policymakers opted to cut borrowing costs earlier this month, there have been mixed signals about the next move, Reuters said. Michelle Bowman, the Fed’s top bank cop, said inflation was close enough to target to justify more rate reductions because the job market was weakening.
Silver has also performed strongly, topping $45 an ounce this week for the first time since 2011.

9 energy-efficient homes that keep running costs down
As temperatures drop, the cost of heating our homes is about to rise. On 1 October, the energy price cap will increase by 2%.
The average annual bill for a household that uses gas and electricity, and pays by direct debit, will be £1,755, compared with £1,717 for the same period last year.
Improvements such as topping up insulation and upgrading the boiler can help conserve energy and reduce bills. You could also move to one of these energy-efficient homes, where you’ll notice the difference straight away.

What the budget could mean for stamp duty and council tax
Even before chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the date of this year’s budget as 26 November, there was speculation as to how the property market would be affected.
Two taxes in particular were being talked about as needing reform: stamp duty land tax and council tax.
To get their take and predictions on what might happen to these taxes, as well as the property market in general, we spoke to six experts in the property world.
Stamp duty and council tax have been identified as areas in need of improvement for very different reasons. “Stamp duty is widely viewed as inefficient and distortionary,” explains Adrian Anderson, of Anderson Harris. “It discourages mobility (people staying in houses longer than they otherwise would) and imposes a big one-off cost.”
Twenty years ago, the rate of stamp duty buyers paid was much smaller than the value of their property; now, thanks to higher rates and rising property prices, particularly in London and the South East, it’s a significant chunk of what a buyer is expected to budget for.

JLR restarts spare part deliveries after cyberattack
Jaguar Land Rover is looking to restart deliveries of spare parts as early as next week to allow drivers of its cars to get vital repairs at garages.
In a letter to suppliers, seen by The Telegraph, JLR said its global parts logistics centre would reopen as soon as Monday to help mechanics get broken down Range Rovers back on the road.
“I am pleased to inform you that from Monday Sept 29, we will begin scaling up inbound capacity,” the letter said. “We kindly ask that you mobilise your teams in preparations to commence shipments from this date.”
It comes after JLR's production lines have been suspended since a cyberattack in August forced a shut down of its IT networks. Its factories remain closed until next month at the earliest.
It has already begun a ""phased restart"" of its operations with parts of its IT system back up and running. The company is ""working to clear a backlog of payments"" to suppliers as it now had increased its processing capacity for invoicing.

Asia and US overnight
Stocks in Asia were lower overnight, with the Nikkei (^N225) down 0.9% on the day in Japan as the Tokyo CPI print for September showed a downside surprise of +2.5% in the headline CPI (vs. +2.8% expected).
However, this was partly because the government expanded the entitlement for free childcare, and that was a policy specific to Tokyo that won’t apply nationwide.
Meanwhile the Hang Seng (^HSI) fell 1.3% in Hong Kong, and the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) was 0.7% down by the end of the session. In South Korea, the Kospi (^KS11) slumped 2.5% on the day, one of its worst days in nearly two months.
Across the pond on Wall Street, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.5%, posting a third consecutive decline for the first time in a month, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was also 0.5% lower.
The Dow Jones (^DJI) also slipped 0.4% on the day as president Donald Trump announced a new set of sectoral tariffs.
The decline on Thursday was a broad-based one, and there were bigger falls for the Magnificent 7 (-0.95%) and the small-cap Russell 2000 (-0.98%). Sentiment also wasn't helped by the prospect of a government shutdown next week, as funding is due to expire on 30 September, and there’s still no sign of a breakthrough between Republicans and Democrats.
Elsewhere, from 1 October, the US will impose a 100% rate on branded or patented pharmaceutical products, 50% on kitchen cabinets, 30% on upholstered furniture, and 25% on heavy trucks.

But years after the hype, the reality has been more muted.
Virtual reality VR headsets aren’t flying off shelves, and companies investing billions are still struggling to make the digital universe profitable. So is the metaverse dead, or could AI breathe new life into it?
Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms (META), via its Reality Labs division (formerly Oculus VR), has poured tens of billions into virtual and augmented reality development.
Yet recent financials underline the difficulty of turning that vision into profit, because by the end of 2024, Reality Labs had amassed almost $70bn (£52bn) in cumulative losses, and quarterly results have remained weak.
Estimates show that Reality Labs’ operating losses run into the billions, while its sales remain in the low hundreds of millions, a stark contrast to the massive capital invested. Developing VR, augmented reality (AR) and hardware remains an extremely expensive undertaking, even for one of tech’s largest players.
Developments in AI, however, could revitalise the concept of the metaverse and make it more commercially viable. By enabling human creators to earn royalties via micropayments when generative AI recombines their work, AI could turn virtual environments into a scalable creative economy.

Ken Jon Miyachi, founder of Bitmind, told Yahoo Finance UK that generative AI is drastically reducing the cost and time needed to build high-fidelity digital environments. Instead of large teams designing 3D assets, characters and narratives, AI can generate them on demand.
Miyachi said this makes the metaverse “less speculative and more commercially viable” and could enhance AR by identifying and adding context to the physical world.
However, he warned that AI alone isn’t enough for mainstream adoption. Robust infrastructure and hardware remain critical, and investors must focus on projects that provide real user utility.
""Investors need to understand how projects leveraging AI are providing real differentiation and user utility. There are security and authenticity risks. As the line between human-created and AI-generated assets blurs, ensuring provenance and trust will be essential. We expect standards like cryptographic watermarking and verification to become part of the metaverse technology stack,"" Miyachi said.

That's because NdPr is critical for making the super-strong magnets in electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, smartphones, robotics, defense systems, and more.
For years the U.S. has depended on foreign sources for rare metals like NdPr. But mining company MP Materials (MP -8.54%) is aiming to change that.
As the owner and operator of the only rare-earth metal mine and processing site in the U.S., the Mountain Pass mine in California, MP Materials is setting itself up to be the country's go-to for certain rare earth metals.
The stock has a lot of momentum -- up almost 350% on the year -- but can it go parabolic in three years?
Strategic partnerships, but a cash-bleed problem
MP Materials makes money by selling rare-earth concentrates and oxides, like NdPr oxide, and by producing permanent magnets for a myriad of markets, including electric vehicles.
In July 2025, MP got two huge votes of confidence. One was a multibillion-dollar package from the Department of Defense (DoD), which invested $400 million in MP's stock and agreed to buy NdPr oxide at a price floor of $110 per kilogram over the next decade.
The second was a $500 million partnership with Apple (AAPL 0.54%). A first-of-its-kind deal, MP will supply Apple with magnets for ""hundreds of millions"" of devices starting in 2027.
Both of these could set MP up for a strong three years to come. But let's not overlook the risks. MP isn't profitable, and it doesn't have the manufacturing capacity to meet high demand for super-strong magnets.
At its current price, MP trades at almost 83 times forward earnings, a rich valuation that looks more like tech than mining.
With a multiple like that, MP will need something big -- like the completion of its 10X facility -- to go parabolic by 2028. It's possible, but only invest if you can stomach losses, as volatility should be expected."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Taiwan is seeking to double its exports of chips and electronics to India over the next five to seven years as smartphone shipments from the country ramp up thanks to demand from the U.S., the head of the island's main trade body said.
India's smartphone exports to the U.S., which are currently exempt from elevated tariffs, jumped nearly 40% from a year earlier to $8.43 billion in the first five months of the fiscal year that started in April, according to industry estimates, driven largely by demand for Apple's iPhones.
""Electronic industries are driving the growth of trade between our two countries,"" said James C. F. Huang, chairman of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council, in an interview on the sidelines of the Taiwan Expo trade fair on Thursday. Huang is a former Taiwanese foreign minister.
""I believe in the next five to seven years, the trade and investment which we have in India can double.""
Major Taiwanese firms have to date invested about $5 billion in Indian manufacturing, according to Taiwanese officials. Last year, Powerchip Semiconductor joined with Tata Electronics in an $11 billion venture to build India's first chip plant to be driven by artificial intelligence. The plant, in Gujarat state, was part of a $10 billion government incentive scheme.
And earlier this year, Apple supplier Foxconn unveiled a $1.5 billion investment in its India unit as it shifted more production out of tariff-plagued China.
Huang downplayed concerns that higher U.S. tariffs on Indian goods could hurt Taiwanese businesses.
""I don’t think it’s going to affect Taiwan-India trade relations or investment relations,"" he said, pointing to India’s large domestic market and growing opportunities in petrochemicals, textiles and electronics.
Huang said several Taiwanese companies are investing in India, bringing in more components from Taiwan and building a local supply chain to support operations in the country.
Taiwan's exports to India topped $10 billion in 2024, led by chips, electronic components and machinery. Just five years earlier, the total stood at about $4 billion, according to data from the Indian government.
Like most countries, India has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but they have built a close commercial relationship. Government officials have said New Delhi is eager to draw more investment from the island, a major chip producer.

Two taxes in particular were being talked about as needing reform: stamp duty land tax and council tax.
To get their take and predictions on what might happen to these taxes, as well as the property market in general, we spoke to six experts in the property world.
Why stamp duty and council tax might be replaced
Stamp duty and council tax have been identified as areas in need of improvement for very different reasons. “Stamp duty is widely viewed as inefficient and distortionary,” explains Adrian Anderson, of Anderson Harris. “It discourages mobility (people staying in houses longer than they otherwise would) and imposes a big one-off cost.”
Twenty years ago, the rate of stamp duty buyers paid was much smaller than the value of their property; now, thanks to higher rates and rising property prices, particularly in London and the South East, it’s a significant chunk of what a buyer is expected to budget for.

Council tax is also touted as needing reform. “Changes to council tax are more likely than other reforms as these would be relatively easier to implement,” says Jeremy Leaf, London estate agent and a former RICS residential chairman.
“There are lots of anomalies and issues with the present council tax arrangements, not least that it is based on values which were set in 1991, with some in relatively inexpensive areas in the north of England paying the same as in expensive parts of London.”
With the government battling a financial black hole, council tax changes would be seen as low-lying fruit that could boost tax revenue with very little effort.
How might stamp duty change?
The main rumours around stamp duty involve it being replaced by a national property tax that owner-occupiers would pay every year. That said, none of our experts thought that this would be a serious option.
“It doesn’t make sense for Labour to get rid of stamp duty. Between April and June of this year, they made £4.6bn in revenue,” says Nathan Khider, owner of Nathan K Real Estate.
Instead, he believes that Labour will phase in a new property tax, to be paid along with stamp duty. “I think Labour could introduce putting a property tax on people after they have paid stamp duty. I don’t think that they care whether you have bought a property or not; if you have enough money to buy a property, you have enough money to pay your tax.”
Leaf says it’s more likely that stamp duty rates will be changed: “We are more likely to see some tinkering around the edges of the current commitments and maybe a pledge to change stamp duty eventually, but it is unlikely to happen on 26 November.”"

“The numbers that are being thrown around are so extreme that it’s really, really hard to understand them,” Einhorn said. “I’m sure it’s not zero, but there’s a reasonable chance that a tremendous amount of capital destruction is going to come through this cycle.”
OpenAI’s Sam Altman has said he wants to spend “trillions” on infrastructure over the “not very distant future,” while Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg has also talked about spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers. In February, Apple said it plans to spend $500 billion domestically over the next four years.
Einhorn drew a sharp line between the long-term importance of AI and the immediate economics of funding it. He said many projects will be built, but investors may not see the payoffs they anticipate.
At a panel discussion hosted by Simplify Asset Management at the New York Stock Exchange Thursday evening, Einhorn broadened his critique beyond AI spending. He pointed to weak job growth and stagnant productivity as signs that a recession may be looming.
“I’m a little bit more of the view that we’re heading into or have been in a recession,” he said. “Jobs aren’t growing and the workweek is shrinking and productivity is not that great.”
He also reiterated his longstanding claim that markets are fundamentally broken, a condition he argued has eroded the investment process itself.

The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.5%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.38%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.5%.
Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had gained 9.47% outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.21% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.74%.
The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.74, marking a 6.1% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $101.13 billion, reflecting a 6.53% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.
For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.36 per share and a revenue of $412.1 billion, representing changes of +9.04% and +5.39%, respectively, from the prior year.
Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.
Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.07% higher within the past month. Right now, Apple possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
With respect to valuation, Apple is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 34.29. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 13.27 for its industry.
It is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.62. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Computer - Micro Computers was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.52 at yesterday's closing price."

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
All right, now time for some of today's trending tickers. Ya Finance is Ali Canal join me here to take a look at Intel, Tesla, talk a little Starbucks. Let's start with Intel.
Seaport research upgrading that stock to neutral. It's coming amid reports that Intel is in talks with Apple to invest in the company. So this one Ali Seaport uh does go to neutral.
Basically saying they're cautious on the long-term fundamentals but um they say in the near term the stock is likely to be driven. They say by follow on investments and the potential for a stop gap solution for the Fabs. What do you think?
Right. So the near-term catalyst is the focus on for this upgrade. Uh and you know, Intel, it's been in the news a lot recently. We have the Nvidia partnership, Nvidia committing $5 billion dollars, the White House taking a 10% stake in the company. And then you mentioned Josh that report that maybe Apple could invest and there could be a closer collaboration there. Now this is a potential revival of a partnership that Apple moved away from in 2020 when it launched its own chips.
So that in combination is lifting shares of Intel uh today, this afternoon. But for Intel, I just think there's a long road ahead and that upgrade did acknowledge that that over the long term, it's going to be difficult for this company to really catch up to where the others are in this AI race. It's just been behind the eight ball for so long. However, you do have that support now from the government that really wants to bring as much on-shoring as they can to really boost this AI boom.
Yeah, if you saw more direct investments in Intel, I don't know how much that would really be about Intel or is it about also a great way to stay on Trump's good side.
You know, you like Intel, we like Intel. And we've seen billion could be worth it. You know.
Yeah, all these tech executives have been seen at the White House in recent months so.
Yeah, for sure. All right, let's turn two now. Tesla the EV makers seeing uh European sales sliding in August. Our own Prosian has this story for us pointing out uh Tesla here Europe sales drop over 20% in August compared to a year ago, marking the eighth straight month of declining Tesla sales in Europe.
Yeah, that means Tesla's market share is just 1.2% in Europe. That's down from 2% one year ago. And if you compare that to Chinese competitor BYD, they posted a nearly 200% surge in August. So the competition is essentially non-existent. And actually that that might be a 200% surge year to date here. But regardless, Tesla has really struggled in Europe, especially amid these Chinese competitors. Uh shares, I will say, are up around 20% over the past month. This comes after Elon Musk pledged to buy $1 billion worth of stock back.
Year to date though, we are still only up around 5% and it's certainly been a big laggard compared to those other Mag 7 names. And you know, in the US, Tesla did have that first mover advantage. It it it does well in the US. There have been more competition competitors here you could say with some of the big three introducing their own EV models. But Tesla needs to make sure that they can get the car profits right. Because even though over the long term, the Bulls are sort of hanging their hats on robo taxis, uh the promise of autonomous driving. In the interim, this they need to sell cars. And that has to happen both in the US but also especially in Europe and that just seems to be a harder and harder reality for this company to achieve.
Yeah. Now Musk did warn after Q2 earnings that Tesla was in for a said a few rough quarters. And Pros does remind us Tesla will actually give investors the official update of its overall third quarter numbers that's coming next week.
All right, finally, Starbucks announced plans to close unprofitable locations and cut corporate jobs. So, uh this one CEO Brian Nickel making moves, Aly plans to limit 900, these would be non- retail roles, close open positions. This is all part of this $1 billion restructuring effort. We will continue to carefully manage costs and stay focused on the key areas that drive long-term growth, he writes. Uh and this does come after the company already laid off about 1,100 employees.
Yeah, CEO Brian Nickel making moves. He was a former CEO of Chipotle. Now he's at Starbucks and he was specifically brought in to revamp the uh the the really the future of this company that's really just struggled. I mean, underperforming especially with those stores, posting its six straight quarter of falling US same store sales. So, Brian Nickel hoping to reverse that. It's a $1 billion restructuring plan. You mentioned 900 corporate jobs will be eliminated. They're going to reduce the North American footprint by about 1%. And those stores that I mentioned that are underperforming, they'll be shut down as well. And this does bring up a good point to me because even walking around New York City, you see so many Starbucks every single block. And and maybe there is a need to focus on more quality over quantity and that seems to be the playbook of Brian Nickel at this moment in time. Uh they are going to be reinvesting in 1,000 remodels and rolling out a new lower cost prototype store with more seating and drive-through options by 2026. So optionality for the consumer as well.
Yeah, September 9th marking one year for Nickel now at the helm of the company. And he's got his work cut out for him. In his latest quarterly results, Starbucks did post its sixth straight quarterly drop in US Team store sales. That stock is down about 10% from here.
It's been brutal. Brutal, brutal journey for Starbucks.
All right. Thank you Ally. I appreciate it."

The chipmaker also got a $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank Group in August.
Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been trying to bring in partners as part of a turnaround at the ailing chipmaker.
Once the chip industry's flag bearer that claimed to put the ""silicon"" in Silicon Valley, Intel has struggled to compete in the booming AI race, falling behind peers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
Intel has invested billions of dollars in setting up a contract manufacturing business that has struggled to compete with TSMC and barely attracted external customers.

Last month, the federal government invested a cool $8.9 billion to own roughly 10% of the chipmaker's equity. Closely following that, Asian tech conglomerate SoftBank bought into the company with a $2 billion investment. Finally, in September, Nvidia piled in with a $5 billion stock buy.
Now, apparently, Apple (AAPL 0.75%) might be reaching for its wallet, too.
Together again... maybe
On Wednesday, Bloomberg, citing unnamed ""people familiar with the matter,"" reported that Intel approached Apple regarding such an investment. Officials from the two tech giants also talked about potentially working together. The article didn't state how much Apple is being asked to invest, or what form future collaboration could take.
The report's sources did say that these discussions are at an early stage. As such, it's possible they won't result in any kind of agreement. Additionally, those folks said Intel also contacted other enterprises about investments and partnering up. No names were given, but if this is accurate we can safely assume these are sizable and well-capitalized peer tech companies.
Neither Intel nor Apple commented on the report, and there has been no official word from either following publication.
Previously partners
The pair had a lengthy business relationship in the recent past.
Most notably, in 2006 Intel started manufacturing processors for Apple computers, but over time the latter decided it was more advantageous to bring such critical components in-house. The transition from third-party to homegrown began in 2020, and Apple discontinued the last Intel-powered machine in 2023.
Since then Apple bobbled along, effectively defending its position as a relatively high-end smartphone maker (so far this decade its iPhone has maintained global market share in the high-20% range against the more ubiquitous Android devices).
Intel's fortunes, however, declined. The PC market that was its bread and butter for many years hasn't been an inspiring source of growth lately -- annual worldwide shipments have fallen more than they've risen since 2015, and that takes into account a COVID-fueled spike in 2021.
Meanwhile, the company has been slow and ineffective in embracing powerful, next-generation processors that can handle the heavy demands of artificial intelligence (AI) technology (in contrast to the prescient Nvidia, which is now a powerhouse in the segment). And a long-promised effort to be a chipmaking business for others (or ""foundry"" in industry parlance) hasn't gotten much traction.
Money can't solve every problem
In the wake of the report, Intel's share price shot up by 6% and Apple's sagged by 1%. That's telling me the tech investing hive mind thinks any potential tie-up would be a win for Intel. For Apple, not so much.
That stands to reason. Intel's major troubles are daunting and deep, and not the kind that can easily be wiped away by infusions of cash (even large ones). That said, getting billions from companies and governments gives Intel at least a fighting chance at tackling the problems and becoming prominent again. So why not accept a fat bag from Apple for a chunk of stock?
It's harder to see any real advantage for the iPhone maker, though. It probably doesn't desire any kind of development or manufacturing partnership with Intel; it expended much time, capital, and resources in that proprietary chip effort, after all.
Besides, it has what appears to be a fine relationship with the most successful third-party chippie in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which cranks out those Apple processors. As far as I can tell, there's no reason to rock this boat.
A different motivation might lie in the political realm. One of the top Trump administration goals is to bring manufacturing, especially that of the tech variety, back into this country. To that end, in April Apple promised to add $100 million to its investments in this country, adding to an existing $500 billion pledge.
Putting a few of those bucks into Intel would help satisfy this commitment. However, in the announcement, CEO Tim Cook said the extra funding would include ""new and expanded work with 10 companies across America. They produce components that are used in Apple products sold all over the world.""
This sounds very much like it's aiming to channel money to existing business partners, not ones it divorced years ago.
Wisest not to count on it
Ultimately, if I were a betting man I wouldn't place any money on Apple placing money on Intel. Yes, like Nvidia the company has piles of cash in its treasure chest (over $30 billion at the end of its latest-reported quarter), but it didn't become the behemoth it is today by spending vaguely or casually. There seems to be, at best, little for it to gain with any level of Intel buy-in.
Yet in the tech world, far more oddball investments have been made, some of which were even successful. So these Intel-Apple discussions are worth monitoring for shareholders of both companies, because one never knows. Still I, for one, am not expecting a reunion of the pair."

(Reuters) - Intel has approached Apple about securing an investment in the struggling chipmaker, Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 24, citing people familiar with the matter.
The iPhone maker and Intel have also discussed how to work more closely together, the report said, adding that the talks are at an early stage and may not lead to an agreement.
Intel declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The report comes days after Nvidia announced it would invest $5 billion in Intel for a roughly 4% stake in the company.
Nvidia's pact with Intel includes a plan for the two companies to jointly develop PC and data center chips, but crucially, will not involve Intel's contract manufacturing business - or foundry - making computing chips for Nvidia.
Intel is in the middle of investing $28 billion into two microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany. The factories were to originally open this year, but now may not be completed until 2030 or later.
Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been trying to bring in partners as part of a turnaround at the ailing chipmaker.
Once the chip industry's flag bearer that claimed to put the ""silicon"" in Silicon Valley, Intel has struggled to compete in the booming AI race, falling behind peers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
The investment from Nvidia came just weeks after the White House engineered an extraordinary deal for the federal government to take a 10% stake in Intel, an agreement that would ensure the company receives about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the U.S.
Intel also received another $2 billion equity investment from SoftBank Group last month.
The cash infusions in Intel have pushed up investor sentiment, with the stock climbing more than 40% since mid-August.
The reported investment from Apple would come as another vote of confidence for Intel. Apple had been a longtime customer of Intel before it transitioned to using its own custom-designed silicon chips from 2020.
For Apple, which relies heavily on Intel's rival TSMC to manufacture its chips, the new partnership would allow it to diversify its chipmaking supplier base - a move that could be valuable if geopolitical risks in Taiwan worsen due to China's role in the region.
The potential investment in the United States would also help strengthen Apple's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. While much of Apple's supply chain remains international, the company has committed about $600 billion to domestic initiatives over the next four years.
In response to a Reuters query on whether the Trump administration had conversations with Intel or Apple about an investment, and if it would support such a deal, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, ""The U.S. Government is not involved in Intel's day-to-day operations.""
""The taxpayer has an equity stake in Intel succeeding, and the Administration supports iconic American companies like Intel doing what's best to cement American tech dominance.""
Striking lucrative partnerships and persuading outside clients to use Intel's factories remain key to its future. The Santa Clara, California-based company has also reached out to other companies about possible investments and partnerships, according to the Bloomberg News report.

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 6.3% in the morning session after reports surfaced that the company was pursuing an investment from Apple Inc. and it received a stock upgrade from Seaport Research.
The move continued a rally from the previous trading session, which was initially sparked by a Bloomberg report about the early-stage discussions between the two tech giants.
Following these developments, Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg upgraded Intel's stock to 'Neutral' from 'Sell.' While the analyst's note expressed caution that Intel was “on the wrong path with a shrinking window,"" it also stated the stock would likely be driven by follow-on investments in the near term. This potential investment from Apple followed a series of other capital infusions, including a reported $5 billion from Nvidia and $2 billion from SoftBank, as part of Intel's efforts to bolster its business.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 34 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 22 hours ago when the stock gained 4.9% as reports surfaced that the company approached Apple about a potential investment. According to people familiar with the matter, the talks were in their early stages and also covered how the two tech companies could work more closely together. While an agreement was not certain, the discussions were part of Intel's efforts to bolster its business.
Intel is up 64.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $33.35 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $667.83.

Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground in recent trading, in the third straight day of losses as investors digested several economic indicators. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all lower.
CarMax (KMX) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the biggest used car retailer posted weaker-than-expected results. Vehicle sales fell and CEO Bill Nash called the quarter “challenging.”
Oracle (ORCL) shares also declined after Rothschild Redburn analysts initiated coverage with a “sell” rating, saying the market is overestimating the cloud software company’s revenue outlook.
Shares of Intel (INTC) surged following a report the chipmaker is looking for an investment from iPhone maker Apple (AAPL). Apple shares ticked slightly higher.
IBM (IBM) shares gained after financial partner HSBC (HSBC) said the two have shown evidence that quantum computing can improve predictability of bond trading outcomes. U.S.-listed shares of HSBC fell.
Lithium Americas (LAC) shares added to yesterday’s jump on indications the Trump administration is looking to take a stake in the lithium miner.
Oil and gold futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was up. The U.S. dollar increased versus the euro, pound, and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower."

Apple (AAPL, Financials) is pressing European regulators to roll back the bloc's new Digital Markets Act, arguing the law has slowed product updates and made devices less secure for consumers.
The company told the European Commission this week that the law has forced it to delay several new features in the region, including iPhone-to-Mac mirroring, live translation for AirPods, and certain location-based tools in Maps. Apple said the DMA's interoperability requirements have created engineering challenges that could expose users to scams, malware and unwanted apps.
A commission spokesperson reiterated that the law requires gatekeepers such as Apple to open their platforms to competitors, saying compliance is not optional.
Apple, which sells millions of devices in the EU, said its proposed safeguards were rejected by regulators and that it cannot meet all DMA obligations without compromising data security. It's become clear that we can't solve every problem the DMA creates, the company said.
The European Union is looking into how well the law worked during its first year in place. The review's results could affect how Apple and other big internet companies' platforms work in the European market in the future."

That's according to Charles Schwab (SCHW) CEO Rick Wurster, who repeated the adage ""it's about time in the market, as opposed to timing the market"" on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.
Wurster explained that clients often call asking if now is the moment to cash out after the market's relentless climb. In most cases, he pushes back on the urge to jump in and out of stocks.
""The hard part about timing the market is you've got to be right twice,"" he said. ""You've got to get out at the right time, and then you've got to be able to get back in at the right time, and that's very hard to do.""
The market's massive rally has been driven by a handful of Big Tech names known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" Strong earnings, hefty cash flows, and surging demand for artificial intelligence have propelled Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) to record valuations, helping push indexes to new highs.
As of Wednesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up nearly 13% year to date, while the Nasdaq (^IXIC) has gained over 16%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) has lagged slightly, rising above 8% over the same period.
""Their fundamentals have been so strong,"" Wurster said. ""There's real robustness to their businesses. So I think that's been fueling the market higher, and our clients love it.""
He added that Schwab's investors are also more active than in recent years. ""Our clients are really engaged,"" Wurster noted, with trading up 30% compared to last year. Margin balances are at an ""all-time high,"" he said, and more customers are using options to ride the rally.
That enthusiasm, however, comes with caution.
""I would describe our clients as happy because their balances have never been higher, but a little bit nervous about the elevation of the market,"" Wurster said, describing his recent visits to 15 Schwab branches across the country.

Also on investors' minds are the Federal Reserve's next moves, including forthcoming rate cuts. In part, that may be why markets are continuing to hit new highs, Wurster added.
That nervousness isn't misplaced. RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas previously told Yahoo Finance that the market's rally has been unusually concentrated, or what he described as ""frothy,"" with just a few megacap stocks accounting for much of the gains. If those leaders stumble, the broader indexes could quickly give back ground."

The US company reiterated its opposition Thursday to the sweeping rules, which the EU implemented last year to protect consumers and ensure that big tech firms don’t abuse their dominance of internet spheres from mobile apps to search engines. In a blog post, the iPhone maker stressed it was complying but urged regulators to look more closely at their impact on people and companies across the region. Apple went further in remarks submitted separately to the European Commission, asking the watchdog to repeal or scale back the regulation.
Apple has previously made clear its opposition to the Digital Markets Act, which lays out a series of dos and don’ts for the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google Search, Apple’s Safari, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook among others. It’s intended to head off competition violations by tech firms before they take root, and fines for violations can be as much as 10% of global revenue — or as much as 20% in the case of repeated breaches.
“It’s become clear that the DMA is leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU. It’s exposing them to new risks, and disrupting the simple, seamless way their Apple products work together,” Apple wrote in its blog post. “The DMA also isn’t helping European markets. Instead of competing by innovating, already successful companies are twisting the law to suit their own agendas — to collect more data from EU citizens, or to get Apple’s technology for free.”
Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Tariffs: QuickTake
Apple singled out the danger to users from being forced to host external payments services and allow sideloading — or the downloading of apps from third-party marketplaces. That may expose iPhone users to malware or scams, it argued. Allowing other companies to request user data — as stipulated under the Act — may compromise sensitive information, it said.
The commission said it will not repeal or change the DMA in response to Apple’s complaints.
“Apple has contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application,” the European Commission’s spokesperson for tech sovereignty, Thomas Regnier, told reporters on Thursday. “We get it that companies want to defend their profits at all costs, but that’s not what the DMA is about — the DMA is about giving consumers in the EU more choice and giving our businesses the possibility to compete fairly.”"

We recently published Trending Analyst Calls: Top 10 Stocks. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Laura Martin from Needham said in a program on CNBC earlier this month that Apple is losing its ability to raise prices and the company is “not innovating.” The analyst warned that it would become difficult for the company to maintain its installed user base.
“They’ve gone on to defense. If you don’t have innovation, you can’t raise price. And as the genius that just spoke said, they aren’t raising price. One model has a $100 increase. That’s bad because they’re including a lot of cool stuff. What we heard is 90 minutes of cool stuff they’re including for no price increase or sneaky price incluses on memory. That’s all bad. That’s because they’re not innovating. And by the way, their major competitor called Android is backed by Google Gemini’s LLM. So they’re going to be able to raise prices faster or if Google decides on Android not to raise prices, it’s going to have a better product in two or three years while Apple sits around and doesn’t innovate. So it will get ever more expensive for Apple to maintain its installed base of customers.”

Apple can only do so much in innovation to revolutionize its iPhone each year. A UBS survey shows that the iPhone upgrade cycle has reached 35 months in the US. A separate report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners says about 63% of iPhone users keep their smartphones for more than two years. Apple is losing its pricing edge as it has to put a cap on its price tags to compete in key markets like China. Samsung, Xiaomi and other companies can launch advanced hardware and software features to compete with Apple and keep the company under pressure in Asia.
Renaissance Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined in the quarter. Despite reporting solid operating results, the stock came under pressure over concerns about decelerating iPhone sales, China growth headwinds, and underwhelming details for Apple’s long-awaited AI strategy. Tariffs were also an unexpected negative surprise, with Apple quantifying a sizable $900M cost impact. Moreover, the latest development in the Apple vs. Epic Games lawsuit resulted in a ruling that Apple had violated an earlier injunction, questioning Apple’s absolute control over its App Store.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock."

While Tether and Circle’s USDC are the clear leaders right now, it’s very possible a yet-to-be-released stablecoin could emerge as the long-term winner. That’s according to Austin Campbell, a professor and former executive at stablecoin firm Paxos, who shared his thoughts on the latest edition of Fortune’s Crypto Playbook (available on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube).
Stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC and Tether have long been popular among crypto traders as a form of settlement, but a series of high-profile acquisitions and IPOs—as well as Congress passing comprehensive legislation this summer to regulate the technology—have catapulted them into the mainstream. Now, big tech firms and banks alike are exploring integration, while new challengers are entering the market every week.
According to Campbell, there is fierce competition between entrenched stablecoins like Tether and new entrants like Agora—whose appeal lies in the fact that their value doesn’t fluctuate like Bitcoin or Ethereum—but that doesn’t mean a new contender can’t take the throne.
On the latest episode of Fortune’s Crypto Playbook podcast, Campbell compared the current moment in stablecoins to the 1990s for the internet, when services like AOL and Netscape were just getting started. “The stablecoin that will probably dominate the future has not been created yet,” he said. “It’s my prediction.”
While many crypto proponents make a similar argument for blockchain technology as a whole, Campbell has more claim to the potential growth for stablecoins. Congress’s passage of the Genius Act in July is one catalyst, along with their clear use case over traditional payment rails, with stablecoins touting lower fees and faster transaction speeds. “The lesson of the internet has been … consumers writ large win, and intermediaries just get destroyed.”
He pointed to payment firms from Mastercard and Visa to Stripe embracing stablecoins, even though their adoption might upend existing business models. But unlike other corners of the crypto industry, from NFTs to decentralized finance, the presence of established firms might make stablecoins more appealing to companies that would otherwise shy away from the volatile industry. “It does seem like a chicken-and-egg problem to some degree, where you have to convince people to come on board,” Campbell said. “But if you have a major company like Stripe putting so many resources into it, obviously that could create demand.”"

The Xiaomi 17, which will be offered in Pro and Pro Max models just like Apple’s marquee series, starts at 4,499 yuan ($631.20) for the most basic model, rising to 5,999 yuan at the top end, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Lei Jun said via a livestreamed event on Thursday. That’s more than $100 cheaper than the base iPhone 17, introduced just weeks before during Apple’s annual product launch event.
Lei is going after longtime foe Apple in the most direct fashion, shifting Xiaomi’s branding and timing to measure his products against the US company’s best. In a two-hour online presentation, the CEO orchestrated a side-by-side comparison with the iPhone on battery life, display quality and camera capabilities.
On Thursday, Lei also pitted his cars against Tesla’s, singling out the Model Y. Xiaomi is riding high after a successful initial expansion into electric vehicles helped triple its market value over the past year. He again sketched out his company’s years-long research effort into unlikely arenas from cars to chips. The 55-year-old entrepreneur has previously outlined plans to create AI models and spend $7 billion developing its own mobile processors, part of a broader effort to drive Xiaomi beyond the consumer gadgets it’s known for.
Lei, who has called EVs his last big entrepreneurial venture, is trying to transform and elevate a company that started out by undercutting the iPhone. “We’ve undergone a profound transformation over the past five years and today a completely new Xiaomi stands firmly in front of a new era, ”Lei said of Xiaomi’s evolving business portfolio.
Beijing-based Xiaomi is aggressively pushing for a bigger slice of the premium segment. But confronting Apple means taking on a US company that controls 62% of premium smartphone sales globally, comprising handsets costing $600 or more. Xiaomi has only a single-digit share, according to Counterpoint Research.
Now worth close to $200 billion as investors bet on its expansion into EVs, Xiaomi has carved out a space for itself in a market dominated by Shenzhen-based BYD Co. and Elon Musk’s Tesla. By the June launch of its second car, the YU7 SUV, Xiaomi’s first model was outselling the Tesla Model 3. That was slightly more than a year after the first deliveries started in the spring of 2024."

Big Tech hasn’t been happy with that, of course, and now Apple’s come out swinging against the regulation. The company on Thursday blamed the EU’s enforcement of the DMA for delaying the launch of some features in the EU, saying the rules are “leading to a worse experience” for Apple customers in the bloc by exposing them to new risks and reducing choices.
The iPhone maker also called on the European Commission to repeal the DMA until “a more appropriate fit for purpose legislative instrument is put in place,” the Financial Times reported.
Because the DMA requires companies to build in interoperability with third-party devices and applications, Apple claims it has to delay some features in the EU, including its new live translation feature for AirPods, iPhone mirroring on Macs, and the visited places and preferred routes feature on Maps. The list of delayed features will “probably get longer,” the company said.
As the company frames it, the DMA’s interoperability requirements are hard to square with the company’s commitment to user privacy. The law requires companies to open up their ecosystems to competitors by making proprietary apps and features compatible with third-party hardware and software. But Apple says its teams are hard-pressed to find a way to do so without compromising user data.
“We’ve suggested changes to these features that would protect our users’ data, but so far, the European Commission has rejected our proposals. And according to the European Commission, under the DMA, it’s illegal for us to share these features with Apple users until we bring them to other companies’ products. If we shared them any sooner, we’d be fined and potentially forced to stop shipping our products in the EU,” Apple wrote in a blog post.
Apple’s post comes a few months after the EU fined the company more than $550 million for breaching the DMA by requiring app developers to transact payments for apps and services within Apple’s ecosystem. The company has appealed the decision.
Apple also argues that letting users install apps from third-party app stores and use other payment mechanisms, as the DMA requires, is increasing the likelihood of scam, malware and fraud risks to its users.
“It’s been more than a year since the Digital Markets Act was implemented. Over that time, it’s become clear that the DMA is leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU. It’s exposing them to new risks, and disrupting the simple, seamless way their Apple products work together. And as new technologies come out, our European users’ Apple products will only fall further behind,” the company wrote."

Later today, Trump is expected to sign into law a deal allowing the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to a group of U.S. investors, including Oracle (ORCL).
Well, the first thing you need to know is that Intel has approached Apple about securing investment in the struggling chipmaker.
According to Bloomberg, the two have discussed how to work more closely together as well.
Well, the news has sent Intel shares higher in the pre-market, well over 3% in fact.
Now, remember that Intel is now partially owned by the US government and just last week, Nvidia made a $5 billion investment in Intel.
And also Japanese tech giant Softbank announced a $2 billion investment just last month.
Now, Apple switched to in-house processors 5 years ago, and it does seem pretty unlikely that it will switch back to Intel.
Okay, the next thing you need to know is that the Trump administration last night said it was formally implementing the US trade agreement with the European Union,
confirming that a 15% duty for EU autos and auto parts began on August the 1st.
Now the tariff drop from 25% to 15 will ease worries in the industry that had been waiting for the long long- delayed confirmation in order to make sourcing decisions.
Now, shares of German car makers, well, unsurprisingly, they were all higher.
Now, Washington also listed tariff exemptions for generic pharmaceuticals, aircraft and aircraft parts.
And the last thing you need to know is that later today, President Trump is expected to sign into law a deal allowing the sale of TikTok's US operations to a group of US investors including Oracle.
The popular site is currently owned by Bitedance, a company operating out of Beijing.
Now, under the agreement, Bitedance will hold less than 20% of the stock of the new company.
Now, this deal is an important part of the US-China trade negotiations."

The chipmaker has raised billions from Nvidia, SoftBank, even the government. Now it's courting an old partner
David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images
Intel’s turnaround effort has finally come to the front door of Silicon Valley’s most powerful customer: Apple.
The struggling chipmaker has held several rounds of talks with the iPhone maker about a potential investment, according to people familiar with the matter and reporting by The New York Times, among other major outlets. The discussions, which took place both before and after the U.S. government bought an almost $9 billion stake in Intel last month, may or may not lead to a deal — but they do point to how urgently Intel has been looking for lifelines.
Neither Intel nor Apple has confirmed the talks. Still, hope flared on Wall Street, with shares of Intel rising about 2% heading into Thursday’s market open. For institutional and individual investors, the all-important question is whether Apple sees Intel as a bet worth making — or one too risky to touch.
Old flames
Intel and Apple have a historic relationship. Intel used to be a primary supplier for Mac computers, and the two companies codeveloped Thunderbolt technology. But their arrangement began to wane in 2020, and was finally phased out as of 2023. Apple, which currently relies on TSMC to manufacture its custom chips, has in recent years resisted shifting production to Intel because of the lag in its technology.
Once the dominant name in chips, Intel has missed major waves of innovation, from smartphones to AI. As rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Nvidia pull ahead, Intel has struggled to produce the most advanced chips and attract customers to its manufacturing business.
Now, in an effort to raise cash to fund its turnaround, Intel has been courting healthy, wealthy partners.
In recent weeks it secured $5 billion from Nvidia, along with a promise to co-develop a new AI chip, and $2 billion from SoftBank, majority owner of the chip designer Arm. The U.S. government’s purchase of Intel shares was its most dramatic intervention in a company since the 2008 auto bailouts. It's helped fuel a 50%-plus rise in Intel’s stock price since August.
U.S. government’s role
The U.S. government, led by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, has been pushing for alliances that would shore up Intel as the last American manufacturer of cutting-edge chips. The same reasoning was behind the government’s recent taking of a $9 billion stake.
“This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge,” Lutnick wrote on X at the time of the announcement. In recent years, chips have increasingly come to be seen to be a national security interest as well as a key economic pillar in that they allow for development of market-leading AI, among other tech initiatives."

INTC - Intel Corp. (INTC, Financial) has approached Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) about a potential investment as part of efforts to revive its semiconductor business, according to people familiar with the matter.
The discussions are said to be preliminary and may not result in a transaction, according to a Thursday press release.
The chipmaker's shares surged about 6% on upon the report, reflecting investor optimism. The boost comes on the heels of recent capital infusions: Nvidia committed $5 billion, SoftBank put in $2 billion, and the U.S. government has taken a 10 % stake.
Talks between Intel and Apple reportedly also include broader collaboration beyond just investment, but neither side has confirmed specifics.
Apple ceased using Intel-designed processors several years ago, opting instead for its in-house ARM-based chips, a transition completed in 2023.
Analysts caution that converting strategic talk into a binding agreement will be challenging. Still, Apple's backing could lend fresh momentum to Intel's turnaround in a competitive semiconductor landscape."

Here's what you need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Lower After Two Straight Losing Sessions
Stock futures are pointing a lower open for major indexes after two days of declines as investors prepare for the release of key economic data reports to finish off the week. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were recently down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.2%. Gold futures edged higher to $3,785 an ounce to stay near record highs, while bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $111,500, little changed from yesterday afternoon. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects mortgage rates and a variety of other consumer borrowing costs, edged higher to 4.16%.
2. Costco Set to Release Earnings Report
Costco Wholesale (COST) will release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell today, with some analysts expecting volatility in the stock. The update comes after some investors were shaken in the spring by signs that sales growth had decelerated. The company has already reported that fourth-quarter sales rose 8% compared with the year-ago quarter. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect the retailer to report that profits grew to $2.6 million in the fourth-quarter, up from $2.4 million a year ago. Costco shares, which have gained 3% since the start of the year, were slightly higher in premarket trading.
3. Jobless Claims, GDP Revisions Come Ahead of Tomorrow’s Inflation Data
Data on economic growth, jobless claims and housing sales are in focus this morning ahead of a highly anticipated inflation report that's set to be released Friday. The jobless claims numbers, which are expected to show a slight increase, are being closely watched by investors after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week amid signs that the labor market is weakening. Revisions to second-quarter gross domestic product are expected to show that growth held steady at 3.3%, while existing home sales are estimated to have declined slightly. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak today, ahead of the release tomorrow morning of the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.
4. Intel Shares Continue Climbing on Report it Seeks Apple Investment
Shares of Intel (INTC) continued gaining ground this morning following a report the chipmaker is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL). Intel shares rose more than 6% on Wednesday after Bloomberg News reported on talks between the companies, which also centered on other ways that Apple could help the beleaguered chipmaker. The report comes after Nvidia (NVDA) last week agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a deal that will see the two companies co-develop chips for data centers and PCs. Intel shares were up nearly 2% in recent premarket trading. The stock has gained more than 50% year-to-date, but remain well off its historical highs. Apple shares were little changed ahead of the bell.
5. Starbucks Announces Layoffs, Store Closings Amid Turnaround Effort
Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off around 900 employees in its corporate offices and closing some stores as CEO Brian Niccol continues to implement his “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan. Niccol said in an update Thursday that the total number of stores was expected to decline by about 1% in 2025 after the closures. He said that laid-off employees in corporate offices would receive severance packages, while employees at closed stores could also receive severance if they are not transferred to other nearby stores. The moves come as analysts have praised the coffee chain’s efforts to revive sales amid sluggish customer traffic. Starbucks shares were flat in premarket trading."

Upon that deal’s expiration, Trump agreed to one more 90-day hiatus to continue negotiating with China, as reported by AP News.
America and China now have until Nov. 10, 2025 to agree to a new trade deal; otherwise, Trump has threatened an incredible 145% tariff upon one of our biggest trade partners. A number of American retailers would then be forced to raise their prices, as the Chinese exporters would be forced to do the same to offset the step tariffs, potentially leaving American consumers to pay the difference. Here are two major holiday gifts you should buy now to avoid paying more later.
Items From Apple and Playstation
The Nov. 10 timing couldn’t be more precarious, as it falls just over two weeks before Thanksgiving — right in the middle of America’s holiday shopping season. If negotiations fall through between America and China, a number of popular products could see a devastating spike in costs in the middle the country’s busiest shopping period.
For shoppers who can afford it, now may be the time to do some serious holiday shopping on a number of crucial products that come from China, just in case one of Trump’s biggest tariffs yet hits a crucial trade partner. Specifically, two of the hottest products from Apple and Playstation.
As ABC News reported, the cost of the $1,199 Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max (256 GB) could increase by nearly $1,000 if the tariff hammer falls. iPhones are already rather expensive; come tariff-time, they could become prohibitively so.
Meanwhile, extremely popular video game system PlayStation 5 currently retails for $499.99. However, the PS5 could cost anywhere between $600 and $1,100 in the event that US-China trade negotiations fail, per the Center for American Progress.
If You Fail To Plan, You Are Planning To Fail
While it’s always important not to panic in the wake of economic news, it also never hurts to prepare. If you plan on purchasing an iPhone or PS5 for the holidays (or just for yourself) and can affordably do so now, it may be best for the early bird to beat the tariff effects.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Qualcomm on Wednesday announced a suite of new chips for PCs and phones, including a PC chip with a new security feature for businesses that analysts say is likely the first of its kind.
San Diego-based Qualcomm is one of the world's biggest sellers of the chips at the heart of mobile phones, connecting them to wireless data networks. But for the past two years, the company has been pushing into the PC market, where it competes against Apple to sell energy-efficient chips for laptops and PCs that run the Windows operating system.
Qualcomm's newest laptop chip, called the Snapdragon X2 Elite, which it said will start shipping next year, will include a new feature called Guardian aimed at corporate buyers of desktops and laptops.
Kedar Kondap, senior vice president of gaming and compute at Qualcomm, said during a keynote presentation Wednesday that the feature will allow corporate information technology departments to securely connect to the machines to install updates or provide tech support, even if the machine is turned off.
Intel, which still has the majority of the market for corporate computers, has had similar features to help businesses manage fleets of PCs for more than a decade. But Qualcomm plans to pair its security features with its modem chips that connect to 5G and mobile networks, meaning that the corporate owner of a machine will be able to keep tabs on it nearly anywhere in the world with cell reception.
""Nobody else can offer something like that,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of technology consultancy Creative Strategies. ""I can actually see that being attractive for a portion of the workforce and something that will get stronger interest in Qualcomm for enterprise fleets.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped 0.4%, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also around 0.5%. Big Tech stocks took hits, with Oracle (ORCL) adding to recent losses and Tesla (TSLA) off over 4%.
Markets are putting the brakes on stocks' recent record-breaking rally amid debate over whether AI fervor is stretching valuations too much.
At the same time, the uplift from the Federal Reserve's switch to lowering rates is fading, as signs of division among policymakers dent hopes for another two cuts this year.
In a positive sign for the labor market, jobless claims data released Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment dropped to 218,000 for the week ending Sept. 20 from 232,000 previously. Continuing claims also fell slightly to 1.92 million.
Meanwhile, US second quarter GDP rose to an annualized pace of 3.8%, rebounding from a 0.6% decline in Q1 and well above estimates for a 3.3% rate of growth.
That sets the stage for Friday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The PCE print for August is expected to show an easing in price pressures, which could make a case for a shift in rate policy.
In corporates, Costco (COST) is expected to report its quarterly results after the bell on Thursday. Investors expect to see a jump in sales as shoppers pursue deals amid economic uncertainty.

Stocks fall for third session in a row as Oracle drops, Fed division casts doubt over future policy
Stocks retreated for a third day in a row on Thursday as Wall Street markets assessed division among Federal Reserve policymakers while better-than-expected economic data put expected rate cuts at risk.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped 0.4% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid around 0.5%. Tech stocks declined as Oracle (ORCL) slid on the heels of an analyst Sell rating.
A better-than-expected GDP print released this morning, along with a drop in jobless claims, made the Federal Reserve's policy decision for next month less predictable.
Investors will examine the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, on Friday.

Intel jumps nearly 10% as chipmaker seeks Apple investment
Intel (INTC) stock was up 10% on Thursday afternoon as investors cheered the chipmaker's attempt to seek investments from iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) in order to work closer together, though Wall Street is wary of such a collaboration.
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said it's unlikely a tie-up (beyond an investment) would materialize anytime soon.
Rasgon said it's ""unlikely"" Apple would collaborate with Intel to co-design a chip for its computers or shift to producing its in-house chips in Intel's factories rather than TSMC's, writing ""a foundry agreement with Intel seems very premature.""
Intel passed on an offer to make chips for Apple's first iPhones in the early 2000s.
Apple moved ahead with its own Arm-based (ARM) chips for personal computers that are manufactured by Intel's contract manufacturing rival, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM).

Tesla stock drops after Europe sales collapse in August
Tesla stock (TSLA) fell 3% after the company's EV sales declined in Europe for the eighth straight month.
Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports that, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell to just 14,831 units in August, a 22.5% drop compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region rose 26.8% in August.
Sales fell sharply in Sweden and Denmark, whereas Norway offered a lone bright spot, with sales up nearly 22%.
Tesla's pains in Europe have grown as stiff competition from Chinese EV makers and the unpopularity of CEO Elon Musk have hurt the brand. A new survey from research firm Escalent found that car buyers in Europe were more likely to consider purchasing a vehicle from China than from the US, with the US's tariffs and trade policies playing a role.
Despite a rough 2025, shares remain positive year to date, though Tesla's 6% gain since the beginning of the year trails the S&P 500's 12% return so far.

Intel needs 'capability' more than money: Analyst
Intel (INTC) is reportedly in talks with Apple (AAPL) to have the iPhone maker invest in the company and for the two companies to work more closely together. But Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said it's unlikely a collaboration (beyond an investment) would materialize anytime soon.
He noted that Apple moved from Intel's chips years ago to make its own Arm-based (ARM) chips for personal computers (PCs) that are manufactured by Intel's contract manufacturing rival, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM).
Intel also famously passed on an offer to make chips for Apple's first iPhones in the early 2000s.
Rasgon said it's ""unlikely"" Apple would collaborate with Intel to co-design a chip for PCs or shift to producing its in-house PC chips in Intel's factories rather than TSMC's, writing ""a foundry agreement with Intel seems very premature.""
Intel designs computing chips and leads the market for CPUs (central processing units) for data centers and PCs, but its market share has eroded in recent years as AMD (AMD) and Arm have gained ground.
Intel has always produced chips for itself, but its internal manufacturing business began to fall behind technologically over the past decade. In 2021, the company opened that business to outside customers, launching Intel Foundry Services, in a bid to breathe new life into its factories.
That hasn't worked so far: Intel Foundry Services' losses ballooned to $13 billion in its 2024 fiscal year from $7 billion in 2023, and those losses helped send Intel's stock plunging 60% last year.
Last week, Nvidia (NVDA) announced it would take a $5 billion stake in Intel, following the US government's $9 billion investment in the struggling company in August.
""Hence what Intel really needs is CAPABILITY, which would allow them to attract customers that would allow them to fill the capacity that the money might help them build,"" Rasgon wrote. ""But their capability issue have nothing to do with money; they will have to figure that out on their own.

Oracle extends losses as Redburn analyst initiates coverage with Sell rating
Oracle (ORCL) shares fell more than 4% Thursday as Alex Haissl, an analyst with investing firm Rothschild & Co Redburn, initiated coverage of the stock with a Sell rating.
Haissl said Oracle’s recent five-year revenue guidance for its cloud business (OCI) that sent the stock soaring is a risk, writing that ""the market is already pricing in a risky blue-sky scenario that is unlikely to materialise,” per Bloomberg. He set a $175 price target on the stock, while shares traded around $297 on Thursday.
The decline in Oracle shares follows a nearly 2% dip from the previous trading session as the software giant sold $18 billion US investment-grade bonds.
Oracle's bond sale came as the rising AI cloud firm rushes to build AI infrastructure for its clients, which range from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and Meta (META) to Elon Musk's xAI (XAAI.PVT). As of this summer, Oracle was leading a record data center leasing pipeline in the US as tech giants go all in on AI infrastructure, according to TD Cowen analysts.
Earlier this week, Oracle was named as an investor to take part in the US-China TikTok deal, and the company also named two new co-CEOs in an executive leadership shake-up.

US economy rebounds in Q2 at 3.8% annualized rate
Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Thursday showed the US economy grew at its fastest pace since 2023 in the second quarter.
Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.8%, a dramatic rebound from the 0.6% drop in the first quarter and above estimates for 3.3% growth.
The effects of the Trump administration's trade policies have skewed GDP readings somewhat. For instance, the first quarter decline primarily reflected a surge in imports, which are subtracted from GDP, the Commerce Department said.

US jobless claims unexpectedly dip
Jobless claims in the US unexpectedly fell to 218,000 in the week that ended Sept. 20 from 232,000 the previous week, according to data from the Department of Labor released Thursday morning.
The 218,000 initial unemployment insurance claims were also lower than the 221,000 claims in the same week last year.
Economists tracked by Bloomberg had expected jobless claims to rise to 233,000 last week amid widening cracks in the labor market. Those cracks have featured heavily in discussions over the Fed's path to interest rate easing, as officials on the central bank's board of governors have expressed dissenting opinions over such rate cuts moving forward.

- Intel is seeking an investment from Apple after recently securing a $5 billion commitment from Nvidia, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.
- Apple was once a big customer for Intel, though the iPhone maker has migrated away in favor of using its own processors in its devices in recent years.
Intel has reportedly set its sights on a deal with Apple, a move that could further boost the struggling chipmaker.
Shares of Intel (INTC) surged over 6% Wednesday following a Bloomberg report that it's solicited support from the iPhone maker. Neither company responded to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. Shares of Apple fell less than 1%.
Why This Matters for Intel Investors
Wall Street analysts broadly believe Intel likely needs more funds and foundry commitments from customers to succeed with its turnaround plan. Investments from Nvidia and the U.S. government have helped that process along, and one from Apple would mark another step. The stock has clambered higher this year, but it's well off past highs, a reminder that there's plenty of work yet to do.
With Wednesday's gains, Intel's stock has added a quarter of its value in the week since Intel announced a $5 billion investment from and chip-development partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). The raft of events have excited investors, with the Nvidia news seen as a vote of confidence from the world's most valuable company.
Still, the stock remains well off its highs, with most Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha sticking by ""hold"" ratings while waiting for evidence of more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other firms and which is central to maintaining support from the U.S. government—itself now a major shareholder.
A deal with Apple could help Intel's case, particularly if it came with foundry commitments. Nvidia's did not, raising speculation about whether a foundry deal could come later or whether the lack of one underscored Intel's challenges in convincing customers.
""If Intel can prove they can deliver they will have customers lined up around the block,"" Bernstein analysts wrote last week. ""If they can’t, no customer in their right mind will put any meaningful volume there.""
New partners might also see a deal with Intel as a way to gain political goodwill, Bernstein said. That may hold some appeal to former Intel customer Apple, which has shown some signs of inroads with the Trump administration, last month winning pledges of tariff exemptions based on its recent investments in U.S. manufacturing."

- Supporting Data: The CFPB has terminated dozens of enforcement actions and introduced only two new ones since President Trump returned to office.
- Expert Quote: ""It's striking, the numbers,"" said Amanda Fischer, COO of Better Markets. ""They're not bringing anything new.""
As the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau scraps its consent orders in case after case, many employees at the agency now expect it to drop all pending enforcement actions and investigations that are not yet public.
People currently working at the embattled regulator told American Banker that the CFPB is hurrying to close existing enforcement actions that are currently in litigation as well as investigations. The bureau is expected to run out of money soon and is looking to issue a furlough, according to CFPB employees who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.
Last week, the CFPB terminated Biden-era consent orders against U.S. Bank and Apple. In both cases, the decisions ended oversight and compliance requirements that had been set to continue for several more years — four years for Apple, three years for U.S. Bank.
""I think it's part of a wider trend that the bureau has initiated since the inauguration, which is to indiscriminately allow the financial services industry to escape any sort of ongoing bureau oversight,"" said Amanda Fischer, chief operating officer of the progressive nonprofit Better Markets.
In December 2023, the CFPB
And in October 2024, the CFPB
Both U.S Bank and Apple have paid the penalties they owed, the CFPB noted in its termination orders. Neither document offered any reasons for voiding the rest of the punishment, but stated that the agency has the statutory authority to do so.
The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.
The two terminations of enforcement actions are part of a much broader pattern, while the mass closing of pending investigations is a significant change. There are far more investigations than pending enforcement actions, which are not public, experts said.
Since the start of President Trump's second term, the CFPB has dismissed or withdrawn dozens of pending enforcement cases, comprising
""It's striking, the numbers,"" Fischer said. ""They're not bringing anything new.""
The regulator has recently been grappling with massive budget cuts. In July, Congress passed a Republican-backed spending bill that cut the CFPB's funding almost in half. Earlier this month, the agency warned employees to expect possible layoffs.
""The CFPB must continue to evaluate workforce optimization opportunities to align with congressionally-mandated funding levels since the bureau's transfer cap from the Federal Reserve was revised from 12% to 6.5% per year,"" read an internal email
This was not the first time the bureau faced a threat to its headcount. In April, the Trump administration fired close to 1,500 of the CFPB's workers, or about 90% of its staff, before a federal court
""The fact that they tried to fire everyone overnight with little notice, I think, is a tell that they don't want the bureau to exist anymore,"" Fisher said. ""It's just clear that this is part of an all-out assault.""
Neither Apple nor U.S. Bank replied to American Banker's request for comment by the time of publication."

Shares of Intel gained as much as 7.9% in New York trading on Thursday. They had jumped 6.4% the previous day after Bloomberg News first reported on the discussions. Apple rose less than 1% to $253.71 on Thursday.
Such a deal would follow a $5 billion investment last week by Nvidia Corp., which plans to work with Intel on chips for personal computers and data centers. SoftBank Group Corp., the Japanese tech giant seeking to expand further in the US, announced a $2 billion investment in Intel last month.
Intel also has reached out to other companies about possible investments and partnerships, the people said.
A deal with Apple, a longtime Intel customer that switched to in-house processors in the past five years, would represent further validation of the chipmaker’s turnaround bid. Still, it’s unlikely that Apple would switch back to Intel processors in its devices. The iPhone maker’s most sophisticated chips are now produced by partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
A representative for Intel declined to comment. An Apple spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan is attempting a comeback with the backing of the federal government. In an unconventional deal brokered by the Trump administration in August, the US acquired a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker. Intel is seen as a critical piece of efforts to reinvigorate domestic production — a priority for the White House.
Even with financial support, Intel’s challenges remain daunting. The Santa Clara, California-based company has lost its long-held technological edge and ceded market share to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Moreover, Intel has struggled to capitalize on booming sales of artificial intelligence gear — a specialty of Nvidia."

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground for a second consecutive session Wednesday, reflecting pressure on the tech sector and despite outperformance from energy names. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost around 0.3%, while the Dow ended 0.4% lower. Read here for Investopedia's comprehensive market coverage.
Intel (INTC) stock jumped 6.4%, lifted by an afternoon report from Bloomberg that the company had discussed Apple (AAPL) buying a stake. The latest move higher for shares of the chipmaking giant also came after Micron Technology (MU) raised it outlook for PCs and traditional servers, two of Intel's key markets. Intel stock has gained more than 25% over the past month amid a string of high-profile investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank (SFTBY), and Nvidia (NVDA). Micron's stock fell nearly 3%, while Apple's was off less than 1%.
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) shares tumbled 17%, more than any other stock in the S&P 500 on, after the mining giant lowered its forecasts for quarterly copper and gold sales. Issues at Freeport's Indonesia unit weighed on its outlook; .the company declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine after a mud flow partially blocked access to the underground facility, resulting in fatal injuries to two workers.
Shares of Axon Enterprise (AXON) fell 10% after the provider of less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement technology announced the acquisition of Prepared, an emergency communications platform powered by artificial intelligence. Needham analysts reiterated their ""buy"" rating on Axon stock but noted the complexities involved in a potential return to the computer-aided dispatch market. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Axon stock with a bullish ""overweight"" rating.
Xcel Energy (XEL) said it agreed to settle litigation related to the devastating 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado. Although the electric utility reaffirmed its belief that its equipment did not cause the fire, it will pay roughly $640 million to settle lawsuits involving more than 4,000 plaintiffs who sued for damages. Xcel Energy shares rose 6.7%, logging the benchmark index's top performance in the midweek trading session.
Shares of health insurer Centene (CNC) gained 5.8%. Centene's managed health subsidiary Meridian Health of Illinois said it paid providers $15 million in value-based care incentives for improving health outcomes for its Medicaid members. Reductions in emergency room visits and inpatient readmissions under this initiative bode well for Centene's goal of reining in medical costs.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 33 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 2.8% as investors continued to react positively to a recent announcement that competitor Nvidia planned to invest $5 billion in the company and collaborate on new products.
The major investment from the leading AI chip company also included a partnership to work on AI and data centers. This news was seen as a lifeline for Intel, which had been falling behind rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. The developments breathed new life into the company.
Intel is up 55.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $31.50 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $640.76.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Citing people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the talks are private, Bloomberg reported that the companies have also discussed closer collaboration.

The iPhone maker and Intel have also discussed how to work more closely together, the report said, adding that the talks are at an early stage and may not lead to an agreement. Shares of Intel closed 6% higher after the news.
Intel declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The report comes days after Nvidia announced it would invest $5 billion in Intel for a roughly 4% stake in the company.
Nvidia's pact with Intel includes a plan for the two companies to jointly develop PC and data center chips, but crucially, will not involve Intel's contract manufacturing business - or foundry - making computing chips for Nvidia.
Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been trying to bring in partners as part of a turnaround at the ailing chipmaker.
Once the chip industry's flag bearer that claimed to put the ""silicon"" in Silicon Valley, Intel has struggled to compete in the booming AI race, falling behind peers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
The investment from Nvidia came just weeks after the White House engineered an extraordinary deal for the federal government to take a 10% stake in Intel, an agreement that would ensure the company receives about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the U.S.
Intel also received another $2 billion equity investment from SoftBank Group last month.
The cash infusions in Intel have pushed up investor sentiment, with the stock climbing more than 40% since mid-August.
The reported investment from Apple would come as another vote of confidence for Intel. Apple had been a longtime customer of Intel before it transitioned to using its own custom-designed silicon chips from 2020.
For Apple, which relies heavily on Intel's rival TSMC to manufacture its chips, the new partnership would allow it to diversify its chipmaking supplier base - a move that could be valuable if geopolitical risks in Taiwan worsen due to China's role in the region.
The potential investment in the United States would also help strengthen Apple's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. While much of Apple's supply chain remains international, the company has committed about $600 billion to domestic initiatives over the next four years.

A new app offering to record your phone calls and pay you for the audio so it can sell the data to AI companies is, unbelievably, the No. 2 app in Apple’s U.S. App Store’s Social Networking section.
The app, Neon Mobile, pitches itself as a moneymaking tool offering “hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year” for access to your audio conversations.
Neon’s website says the company pays 30¢ per minute when you call other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to anyone else. The app also pays for referrals. The app first ranked No. 476 in the Social Networking category of the U.S. App Store on September 18 but jumped to No. 10 at the end of yesterday, according to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures.
On Wednesday, Neon was spotted in the No. 2 position on the iPhone’s top free charts for social apps.
Neon also became the No. 7 top overall app or game earlier on Wednesday morning and became the No. 6 top app.
According to Neon’s terms of service, the company’s mobile app can capture users’ inbound and outbound phone calls. However, Neon’s marketing claims to only record your side of the call unless it’s with another Neon user.
That data is being sold to “AI companies,” Neon’s terms of service state, “for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.”
The fact that such an app exists and is permitted on the app stores is an indication of how far AI has encroached into users’ lives and areas once thought of as private. Its high ranking within the Apple App Store, meanwhile, is proof that there is now some subsection of the market seemingly willing to exchange their privacy for pennies, regardless of the larger cost to themselves or society.
Despite what Neon’s privacy policy says, its terms include a very broad license to its user data, where Neon grants itself a:
…worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to sell, use, host, store, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform (including by means of a digital audio transmission), communicate to the public, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, create derivative works as authorized in these Terms, and distribute your Recordings, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels, in each instance whether now known or hereafter developed.
That leaves plenty of wiggle room for Neon to do more with users’ data than it claims."

Another policy that lands hardest on the people least able to absorb it: entrepreneurs and small businesses. Last week, the President issued a proclamation requiring a $100,000 payment for each new H-1B visa petition. The intent is to protect American jobs. That’s a worthy goal, but if you subtract out politics and look at this from the ground level, the effect is devastating for smaller, fast-growing companies outside of major metro areas.
For Apple, Microsoft, or Google, $100,000 is peanuts. These companies already pay engineers $200,000 or $300,000 a year. Adding another $100,000 to bring on a skilled worker doesn’t move the needle for them. But if you’re running a small technology company in a city like Raleigh, Austin, Atlanta, or Denver, it’s a completely different story. The average salary for a software engineer in these places is closer to $130,000 to $150,000. Adding another $100,000 is like doubling the cost of an engineer. For a startup, that makes the H-1B untenable. It’s crippling. It’s the difference between hiring and not hiring.
I’ve lived this so I can say with certainty that for smaller, entrepreneurial ventures, every dollar matters. One new tax, one new rule, one new fee could knock these smaller companies out. That’s the daily reality for small business owners all over the country.
This is why the H-1B proclamation will have unintended consequences. It doesn’t just make life harder for entrepreneurs. It tilts the playing field further in favor of the biggest companies. They can keep hiring. They can keep attracting the best global talent.
And the irony is that small businesses are the real job creators. They are where new ideas come from. More than 60% of new jobs are created by small businesses, not large ones. They are the ones taking risks, building teams and creating opportunities in communities outside Silicon Valley. Here’s yet another example of a policy written as if the entire economy looks like San Francisco. It doesn’t.
There’s a simple fix here. Scale the fee based on company size or revenue. Let large companies pay the full amount. Let smaller companies pay less. That way, you discourage abuse of the visa system without shutting small businesses out of the talent pool. Because, at the end of the day, we want policies that protect American jobs, yes. But we also want policies that protect American entrepreneurs and American innovation, our most important strategic asset over the past 250 years.
If we keep building walls that only the biggest can climb, we’ll get an economy dominated by a few giants. Less competition leads to less innovation. Entrepreneurs deserve better. And, if we want the next generation of great American companies to come not just from Silicon Valley but from Raleigh, Atlanta, or Austin, we don’t need even more policies that crush them before they even get off the ground."

A Ryanair shake-up, due to take effect in November, will result in 40 million Ryanair customers who use paper tickets being forced to carry passes on a smartphone, which campaigners said will make travelling harder for older passengers.
Silver Voices, an over-60s lobby group, branded the decision a “disgraceful move” and said the low-cost airline was putting profit ahead of the well-being of customers.
Age UK said it will disadvantage the four million Britons who have never used the internet and the millions more who lack an Android or Apple mobile phone.
On Wednesday, Ryanair said it will adopt digital-only ticketing from Nov 12, meaning “passengers will no longer be able to download and print a physical paper boarding pass”.
It said that travellers “will instead need to use the digital boarding pass generated in their ‘myRyanair’ app during check-in to board their Ryanair flight”.
Ryanair, led by Michael O’Leary, will become the first major European airline to ban paper passes, which are still accepted at British Airways, easyJet, Jet2, Wizz Air and TUI.
Impact on customers
Dennis Reed, director of Silver Voices, accused Ryanair of seeking to “cut costs and cut corners without caring about the impact on their customers”.
He said: “It’s a disgraceful move. They are effectively saying they don’t want older people as passengers. There’s a strong argument to say that it’s discriminatory.”
He argued that many older people do not have smartphones, while those who do may not know how to download an app or have the physical capacity to manipulate a small device, whether due to eyesight issues, arthritis or some form of disability.
He added: “This is going to cause chaos. If somebody goes to the airport to catch a Ryanair flight without the app, what are they going to do? Turn them away?
“It’s also going to isolate older people from society, which is what businesses that go completely digital do.
“I really would urge them to reconsider. I, for one, will not be flying with Ryanair, and I would urge other people to take the same action.”
Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said companies should not ignore those with limited digital skills when updating their ticketing processes.
She said: “There should always be an alternative way of booking and showing tickets that does not disadvantage those who aren’t online.”
Ryanair originally planned to scrap paper boarding passes over the summer but shelved the idea amid concerns that it would create confusion and delays at the busiest time for travel."

(BRK.B) has been rebalancing its investment portfolio to have income-generating and geographically diverse holdings. This conglomerate has sold its stake in Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD. This marks the end of a 17-year-long bond with BYD. Berkshire first invested in BYD in 2008, but had started trimming its stake since 2022. It is likely that Berkshire is lowering its exposure to China’s increasingly competitive EV sector amid geopolitical uncertainties.
This apart, Berkshire has lowered its stakes in Apple and Bank of America. While it started selling Apple shares in 2023, it started trimming its stake in Bank of America in the latter half of 2024. It appears that Berkshire is intentionally reducing concentration risk.
On the other hand, Berkshire has been steadily increasing its stake in Japanese firms since initiating investment in July 2019. Lately, Berkshire has increased its stake in Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui Corp. This apart, Berkshire has stakes in three other Japanese firms — Itochu, Marubeni and Sumitomo. Corporate governance reforms have enhanced transparency and capital efficiency, making Japanese companies more attractive to foreign investors. Meanwhile, Japanese companies trade at relatively modest valuations compared to U.S. companies, making them attractive picks.
These strategic moves underscore Berkshire’s intention to ensure uninterrupted cash flow generation, which in turn can be deployed in share buybacks as well as opportunistic investments.

A couple of months ago, the founders behind YC-backed social app Candle were in “pivot hell,” cycling through more than a dozen ideas after joining Y Combinator’s Fall 2024 batch, while the clock on their seed money ticked down.
Alex Ruber, previously an engineer at Apple, and Parth Chopra, formerly an engineer at Asana and Twitter, had built multiple projects together, including Encore, a conversational AI shopping tool that got them into YC and with which they raised $2 million.
However, while the tech worked, the unit economics didn’t, according to Ruber.
“The secondhand shopping space is a tough market to begin with,” Ruber told TechCrunch in an interview. “To win, you either become like Google Shopping or build a really strong marketplace like Whatnot or eBay. That wasn’t a target we wanted to pursue.”
What followed were months of rapid experiments between last December and April, with pivots around ideas in areas like fashion and sports, none of which stuck. “We tried more than 10 different ideas in the span of four or five months,” Ruber said.
The pressure began to strain their own relationships with friends and partners, a familiar story for many early-stage founders. Ironically, that tension sparked the idea that would finally click.
The first version was simple: a swipeable deck of questions designed to spark conversations with their partners. Then an intern, now marketing lead at the startup, shared a TikTok about the app that went viral, unexpectedly gaining traction in Europe.
Downloads surged, feedback poured in, and the team leaned into the momentum. That early prototype has since evolved into Candle, a lightweight, gamified app that helps couples and close friends stay connected.
Six months after launch, Candle has grown to 300,000 users, including 150,000 couples. The company says more than 250,000 are active each month, with a DAU/MAU ratio of around 50%, a strong signal of engagement for a consumer social app and an early sign of daily habit potential. Candle has also ranked in Apple’s App Store top 25 multiple times.
Candle’s wedge is sustaining existing relationships with small, daily prompts and games rather than helping people find new ones. Users answer quick questions, compare results, share photos, and keep a “streak” that shows how consistently they’ve checked in. The mechanics are textbook mobile engagement aimed at Gen Z and young millennials.
In another atypical move for a consumer social app — but one more common among newer AI-native products — monetization has come early. Candle’s monthly revenue recently crossed $150,000, implying an annual run rate above $1 million."

(Reuters) -AI startup Modular said on Wednesday it raised $250 million in a funding round valuing it at $1.6 billion, as it aims to challenge Nvidia's software stranglehold on the AI computing market.
The funding, which nearly tripled the company's valuation from two years ago, was led by U.S. Innovative Technology fund. DFJ Growth and all existing investors, including GV, General Catalyst and Greylock also joined the round.
Founded in 2022 by veteran engineers at Apple and Google, Modular's platform is designed to allow developers to run their AI applications across a variety of computer chips without having to rewrite code for each one. It now serves cloud providers such as Oracle and Amazon, as well as chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.
Nvidia controls over 80% of the high-end AI chip market, partly thanks to its proprietary CUDA software, which locks over 4 million global developers into its ecosystem.
Modular says it has adopted what it calls a ""Switzerland"" strategy to be a neutral software layer.
Chris Lattner, co-founder and CEO of Modular, said the goal is not to defeat the market leader. ""What we're focused on is not like pushing down Nvidia or crushing them. It's more about enabling a level playing field so that other people can compete,"" he said.
It plans to sell the software directly to enterprises on a consumption basis and through revenue-sharing partnerships with cloud providers.
The company's strategy has attracted investors betting on a multi-vendor future for AI hardware. Sam Fort, partner at DFJ Growth, compared Modular to ""VMware for the AI era"", which supported companies to work across CPUs.
""Modular is trying to create the AI hypervisor that will allow you to port workloads across different vendors,"" Fort said.
The company, with about 130 employees, plans to use the new capital to expand its engineering and go-to-market team. The funds will also help the company expand from its current focus on AI inference into the AI training market.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops products that power wireless connectivity, computing, and edge artificial intelligence (AI). Its technologies are widely used in cellular and networking infrastructure, automobiles, smartphones, smart audio devices, and other connected applications.
QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 13.79, which is relatively inexpensive compared to the technology sector average of 29.8. This discount reflects the company’s heavy dependence on the smartphone market, which is no longer expanding at the pace it once did. Adding to the challenge, major customers like Apple and Samsung are increasingly designing their own chips, making them both clients and competitors.
That said, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has always grabbed the attention of income investors because of its stable dividend history. The company has raised its dividends for 21 consecutive years, which makes QCOM one of the best stocks for a dividend stock portfolio. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.13%, as of September 21.

Corning is witnessing healthy traction in the consumer electronics segment. Apple, Inc. AAPL is set to invest $2.5 billion to develop all of iPhone and Apple Watch’s cover glass in Corning’s Kentucky manufacturing facilities. The investment is part of Apple’s broader strategy, a $600 billion multiyear investment plan in the United States. GLW is steadily expanding its Kentucky facility to create the most advanced glass production line and match Apple’s requirements. Apple’s competitor and another major smartphone manufacturer, Samsung, has also deployed Corning’s most advanced Gorilla Glass across its flagship smartphones. The company’s comprehensive client base also includes prominent players like OnePlus, Google, Xiaomi and others.
Major telecom company Lumen has accelerated the deployment of its network infrastructure in the United States. The company is leveraging Corning’s next-generation fiber optic cable in the venture. AT&T is also utilizing Corning’s next-generation fiber, cable and connectivity solutions to support its fiber network expansion across the United States. Corning has also entered into a multi-year collaboration with semiconductor giant Broadcom, Inc. AVGO. Broadcom is set to integrate GLW’s optical components for Broadcom’s Bailly CPO system. This will allow Broadcom to match the fast-growing connectivity and power efficiency requirements of large-scale AI Clusters.
Its U.S.-made solar products are also gaining solid market traction. T1 Energy Inc. recently opted to deploy Corning’s solar components to boost the reliability of its solar supply chain with U.S.-made solar components.
Corning has a strong manufacturing footprint in the United States and it has been steadily expanding its U.S. manufacturing capacity. The company is now reaping the benefits of this strategy. Amid growing geopolitical volatility and trade uncertainties several companies are looking to source domestically produced components to reduce supply chain uncertainty.
Other Tech Companies Benefiting From a Diverse Portfolio
Jabil, Inc.’s JBL focus on end-market and product diversification is a key catalyst. The company’s target that “no product or product family should be greater than 5% operating income or cash flows in any fiscal year” is commendable. Despite weakness in the network, electric vehicle and renewable energy end markets, Jabil is benefiting from strength in AI data center infrastructure, capital equipment and warehouse automation markets. Such diversifications increase reliability of Jabil’s earnings and revenues, thereby driving returns for investors in the long haul.
International Business Machines Corporation IBM also boasts a comprehensive portfolio. Its leading-edge innovations, hybrid cloud and AI solutions are utilized by clients across 175 countries in the world. IBM has a strong presence across multiple industries, including financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, retail and more.

“Amazon’s strength is in convenience of delivery, and it’s no surprise that as one door closes, many more van doors are set to open, with the US firm announcing greater access to groceries for its Prime members and plans to offer fresh goods via its online shop window from next year,"" Hewson added.

UBS Evidence Lab data tracking iPhone availability across 30 geographies shows “elevated YoY wait times for the Base across key end markets, but relatively muted demand for the other three models.”
The firm said the data supports its view that there could be “upside risk to iPhone builds, driven by the iPhone 17 Base and Air variants.”
Even so, UBS warned that “initial demand mixing to the entry-level iPhone may limit ASP upside in the Sept-25 quarter.”
The analysts pointed to Apple’s pricing strategy, noting that “taking into account the implied price increases for the Air and Pro models, but an implied price decrease for the Base (by raising the starting storage to 256GB),” the overall effect could weigh on revenue per unit.
In the U.S., UBS found wait times for the 17 Base at about 18 days, compared with 11 days for the iPhone 16 Base and 13 days for the 15 Base. By contrast, higher-end models saw flatter or shorter wait times.
The 17 Pro Max, for example, was at ~25 days versus ~24 days for the iPhone 16 Pro Max and ~42 days for the iPhone 15 Pro Max.
In China, the 17 Base wait time is said to have reached ~25 days, up sharply from ~9 days for the 16 Base and ~11 days for the 15 Base. UBS suggested demand there may be “driven by subsidies,” while the availability of the Air variant remains limited.

WACO, Texas, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VoIP-Pal.com Inc. (OTCQB: VPLM) announced it has filed and served two amended antitrust lawsuits—one individual and one nationwide class action—against Apple, Google, and Samsung. These filings expand the Company’s litigation portfolio to four active cases, joining earlier actions against AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Link to all complaints.
The suits allege a common Sherman Act § 2 violation—tying cellular calling and texting to Wi-Fi Calling in order to lock out competition and inflate profits. The actions are pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and can be viewed through the following links: 1:24-cv-03051; 1:24-cv-03054; 1:25-cv-01843; and 1:25-cv-01970 (two direct actions and two nationwide class actions).
According to the filings, carriers provide the “key” (SIM/eSIM entitlements and IMS/E911/QoS profiles) while Apple, Google, and Samsung enforce the “lock” through operating-system and firmware rules. Native Wi-Fi Calling only works when validated by a carrier key, preventing subscribers from using independent providers on their own devices. Rivals like VoIP-Pal are denied parity—unable to trigger the default dialer, appear in call logs, or access emergency and quality-of-service functions—leaving consumers stuck with degraded “app-mode” alternatives.
The impact is nationwide. More than 373 million U.S. mobile subscribers already fund broadband and Wi-Fi capable of carrying these calls, yet still must buy tied bundles to unlock native calling. A family of four may pay about $220 per month under the current structure, compared to a potential stand-alone alternative as low as $20 per month. Plaintiffs allege this “no bundle, no native” rule preserves over $560 billion in annual gross profits for defendants while foreclosing competition.
Emil Malak, CEO of VoIP-Pal, said:
“Our 6,000 shareholders and millions of mobile subscribers want something simple—choice and fairness. Families shouldn’t have to pay twice. Since beginning this journey in 2005, we’ve secured more than 40 patented technologies in the VoIP field. We intend to responsibly monetize those innovations while protecting our shareholders’ rights and every consumer’s right to choose stand-alone Wi-Fi Calling.
By commandeering subscribers’ own devices and Wi-Fi, defendants are enforcing a ‘no bundle, no native’ rule that denies consumers true choice. Through this litigation, we are standing up for consumers, defending our investors, and working to restore real competition in the marketplace. We have been engaged in litigation for more than a decade, and we sincerely hope the Defendants and their directors will join us in pursuing a fair solution that benefits consumers and shareholders alike.”"

Apple Investment Narrative Recap
For anyone considering Apple shares, the core belief is in the company’s ability to maintain its premium brand, drive hardware and services revenue, and deepen ecosystem engagement, even as device cycles mature. The robust demand for the iPhone 17 lineup, as seen with Cox Mobile’s launch, affirms Apple’s near-term product catalyst, but does not materially reduce overarching risks like global tariff pressures and the pace of AI innovation, both of which remain central to the investment debate.
Among recent developments, the iPhone 17’s release, with its advanced features and production ramp-up, stands out as most relevant to Apple’s key near-term catalyst: driving upgrade cycles in both premium and entry segments. While this addresses immediate growth momentum, questions linger about whether new models and incremental updates can offset challenges from lengthening replacement cycles and mounting international cost threats.
But even as new product buzz dominates headlines, investors should not overlook the implications of escalating tariff-related costs and global supply chain exposures...

NEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Braavo Capital, the leading funding partner for mobile app businesses, is celebrating a decade of fueling innovation and growth in the global app economy. Since its launch ten years ago in September of 2015, Braavo has provided app developers and publishers over $2 billion in equity-free financing, transforming how app businesses leverage capital and scale in today's fast-paced consumer app economy.
Early Bet on Subscription Apps
Braavo first recognized the power of mobile subscriptions long before they reshaped the app industry. Shortly after launching, Apple expanded its in-app subscription feature across all app categories. Braavo moved quickly to pioneer factoring and revenue-based financing solutions for subscription app developers and publishers adapting to increased competition and the need to invest in paid user acquisition. Early funding from Braavo meant companies could reinvest capital and scale without dilution – which led to partnerships with some of the fastest-growing subscription apps over the years, including the likes of Blinkist, BetterMe, Prisma Labs (Lensa AI) and Lifesum.
The Engine Behind Braavo's Success
Under the hood, Braavo's business insights platform has been the foundation of its ability to consistently back emerging industry leaders. By unifying app store subscription reporting and leveraging predictive analytics, Braavo turned data into sharper capital decisions and market-shaping growth bets. By connecting paid user acquisition directly to recurring revenue and retention, Braavo not only financed with conviction but also accelerated the growth of mobile businesses that went on to shape the app economy itself.
Scaling the Web2App Revolution
Over the last five years, the industry has shifted beyond selling on the app stores toward direct, higher-margin web subscriptions, much of it driven by regulatory changes and market demand for more precise control over customer conversion and attribution. Braavo anticipated this transformation early on and launched Braavo Growth Ventures (BGV) – an end-to-end subscriber acquisition platform built to help apps acquire and monetize web subscribers profitably at scale. To date, BGV has invested in over 40 companies through its web2app portfolio, fueling the industry's latest transition to multi-platform growth and positioning its partners to lead the next decade's biggest growth opportunity.
A Profitable, Long-Term Partner
In 2024, Braavo raised its Series B to continue investing in web2app growth and to deepen its partnerships with founders via Braavo Growth Ventures. Just one year later, BGV also reached profitability, underscoring the company's financial discipline and rigorous approach to sustainability. ""Profitability means stability – for us and for the founders we support,"" said Mark Loranger, CEO of Braavo Capital. ""It shows that we're focused on alignment with our portfolio companies – both today and well into the future. In an unpredictable market, that reliability is exactly what founders need."""

He argued that Trump's new H-1B policy risks forcing promising entrepreneurs to launch businesses in other countries.
""I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term,"" the “Shark Tank” star wrote, adding that the U.S. should not spend resources training top foreign students only to ""kick them out.""

He suggested that graduates of schools like MIT and Harvard should automatically be allowed to stay in the country, marry and build companies. ""Why train them and kick them out?"" O'Leary asked.
Trump Administration Defends The Policy
The Trump administration announced Friday that companies would now be charged $100,000 for each H-1B visa petition, a sharp increase from current fees.
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the charge is a one-time filing fee for new applicants, not an annual tax. Renewals and existing visa holders will not be affected.
Administration officials say the move will prioritize American workers and reduce reliance on immigrant labor. They also announced a new $1 million ""gold card"" residency program for wealthy investors.

Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Gold is hovering near record highs as investors weigh mixed signals from the Fed on inflation and jobs.""

Britzman said: ""Powell’s cautious tone was echoed by divided views across the committee, keeping rate cut expectations alive ahead of August’s PCE print, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation.

How they perform can serve as a gauge of how the overall sector is doing. And with deep pockets, if they're doing well and spending a lot of money, that can result in a lot of growth for the overall economy.
Some of those stocks, however, have been doing far better than others. The weakest performer in the Magnificent Seven over the past couple of years has been Apple (AAPL 0.75%). The tech giant yields significant power as its iPhones are often seen as status symbols all over the globe. And the business still generates mammoth profits.
But Apple stock has nonetheless been a relatively lackluster buy of late. Could that change, and is it an underrated buy right now?
Why have investors been down on Apple's stock?
Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with its market cap hovering around $3.8 trillion. And yet, it has been an underperforming stock to own in recent years. Since 2023, it has nearly doubled in value, but given the growth in the tech sector, investors would have been better off going with any other stock in the Magnificent Seven over that time frame.
Apple has done better than the S&P 500 (which is up around 74%) over that stretch, but at a time when tech stocks have been soaring, the company has been a laggard rather than a leader.
But it's not exactly a surprise, given that the company hasn't been developing its own chatbot, and it has delayed the rollout of artificial intelligence (AI) features for its iPhones. Its focus on safety and privacy is practical, but it hasn't been winning over growth investors. The concern is that Apple isn't much of an innovator in tech these days. And with its massive ecosystem and the roughly 1.4 billion iPhone users in the world, it may not see a whole lot of incentive in rushing new products and services out.
Does Apple's valuation deserve a trim if it's no longer a top tech stock?
Apple has a phenomenal business, and it is highly profitable. Over the trailing 12 months, its net income has totaled nearly $100 billion, which translates into an impressive 24% profit margin as its revenue over that stretch totaled $409 billion.
But if the company isn't growing at a fast pace and its growth prospects don't change drastically, it calls into question whether the premium the stock trades at is warranted. Currently, Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 37. And yet, the company's sales over the past three quarters have totaled $313.7 billion, representing a modest year-over-year increase of just under 6%.
At that kind of growth rate, I believe the stock should be trading at a P/E multiple of far less than 30. While AI is the big wildcard for the business, which could trigger upgrade cycles in its iPhones and unlock more growth, it's still a big question mark moving forward. If Apple can prove its doubters wrong and be a winner in AI, then the stock may be due for a rally, but there's little reason to expect that will be the case at this stage.
Apple has a terrific business, but investors shouldn't overlook its high valuation
There's no denying Apple's dominance in the smartphone market. But given all the question marks around its future and how competitive its iPhones will be with other AI-powered phones, the stock should arguably be trading at a discount rather than a hefty premium, as it is now. It may not be easy to switch from an iPhone to another phone brand, but over time, consumers may get frustrated with lackluster innovation.
Apple hasn't been a leading innovating company for many years, and the AI boom is simply highlighting what kind of a laggard it is in tech these days. And if it can't quickly convince investors that it's on the right track, the stock may continue to underperform its peers, and the bigger danger is that it may be due for a sizable correction.
The stock's high valuation is a problem as it leaves minimal-to-no margin of safety if you decide to invest in Apple today. And that's why, at least for the time being, I wouldn't buy the stock and instead take a wait-and-see approach with it."

Today's Featured Research Reports
Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past year (+13.3% vs. +13.1%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. AAPL now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. Both paid accounts and paid subscriptions grew double digits year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025.
Apple TV+ viewership has soared double-digit year over year. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2025) net sales to grow mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. AAPL expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter.
However, gross margins are expected to be 46-47% in Q425, including a tariff impact of $1.1 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern for investors.

But the impact of miscarriage can go beyond the emotional. Research shows that women who have had a miscarriage pay a financial penalty in the workplace – and lose up to £4,000 when compared with their peers.
Research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Miscarriage Association explored monthly earnings and employment following miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, stillbirths and neonatal deaths in England between April 2014 and December 2022. A miscarriage was associated with a £4,101 drop in earnings over the same period, with the likelihood of employment reduced for 1.5 years. An ectopic pregnancy resulted in earnings losses of £2,040 over 3.5 years.
For those who experienced a stillbirth, the financial impact was even greater, with earnings falling by as much as £13,581 over at least five years. Women who lost a baby also saw reduced income, losing up to £12,441 during the same period. But why does such a devastating loss continue to affect women’s pay for so long afterwards?
Vicki Robinson, chief executive of the Miscarriage Association, says the findings point to an extension of the so-called motherhood penalty. “The data confirms that pregnancy loss can have a lasting impact across all areas of a woman’s life, including her finances and employment,” she says.
“We’re already familiar with the unacceptable motherhood penalty. Now we are seeing evidence of a pregnancy loss penalty too. The stats clearly show the reduction in income is not purely due to time taken off to recover from the physical impact of pregnancy loss, but a sustained decrease in salary in the five years that follow.”

There are likely many factors at play. However, Robinson says, there is a very real likelihood that women who experience pregnancy loss face discrimination. “It may be because their employer is expecting them to go off on maternity leave at some future point. And so, they lose out on promotions or other opportunities, while their colleagues move ahead,” she says.
Although it is essential that women and those who experience miscarriage are supported by their employers, this can also have an unexpectedly detrimental effect on their earnings.
“We’ve heard from women who have had excellent support at work following their loss but are then reluctant to change employers or seek better-compensated roles elsewhere for fear of losing that support if they unfortunately experience another loss,” says Robinson."

The collaboration gives Japanese publishers a proven pathway to global growth and provides international publishers with a seamless entry into one of the world's most important gaming markets.
Around the world, game publishers are moving beyond closed app store ecosystems. Players want more choice and value, while publishers seek stronger direct connections with their communities. Regulatory changes are accelerating this shift. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which took effect in March 2024, designates Apple and Google as gatekeepers and requires them to allow alternative payment methods and third-party marketplaces. In the United States, antitrust scrutiny and landmark cases have fueled debate on app store competition. South Korea's Telecommunications Business Act amendment (2021) became the first law to require support for alternative billing systems, while Japans's Act on Promotion of Competition for Specified Smartphone Software will come into effect in December 2025.
These changes are creating a more open environment where publishers can adopt out-of-app and web-based monetization models. By selling content directly, publishers avoid the high fees charged by primary app stores. The savings can be reinvested into new user acquisition, loyalty programs, new content, and more competitive pricing, delivering greater value to players.
At the center of this model is Coda's Merchant of Record (MoR) framework, which allows publishers to scale globally with confidence. Acting as the legal seller in each market, Coda manages payments, compliance, fraud protection, tax settlement, and billing across more than 65 markets and over 400 payment methods. This simplifies operations for publishers and allows them to focus on creating content while Coda ensures seamless global execution.
The partnership with Digital Garage combines Coda's international scale with AppPay's trusted domestic reach. Japanese gamers will benefit from a broader catalogue of international titles, more payment options, and loyalty programs that enhance player experiences. For Japanese publishers, the collaboration offers a clear pathway to global expansion, with Coda providing the MoR model and Digital Garage adding domestic services such as marketing, multilingual support, website development, and analytics. For global publishers entering Japan, AppPay offers a familiar and reliable platform backed by Digital Garage's payments infrastructure, which handles more than ¥7.5 trillion annually, enabling secure and efficient entry into the market."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-24T00:15:00,"Prediction: This AI Stock Will Join Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in the $3 Trillion Club by 2026",Amazon will benefit big time from data center spending.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a12bc481f5741bc9d5a283b9ded4452763f9f17663dca2ec553bcca04b15b15d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,fool.com,200,,"All everyone wants to talk about is Nvidia. The computer chip company is now the largest stock in the world by market capitalization, quickly joining the $3 trillion club along with Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Investors are betting with their wallets that the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power will drive huge earnings growth for the likes of Nvidia.
They are forgetting one company that will be an underrated beneficiary of AI growth: Amazon (AMZN -0.50%). The company has a cloud and computer chip deal with start-up Anthropic, as well as numerous ways to benefit from AI in its media business.
At a market cap of $2.5 trillion today, I think it is an easy hurdle for Amazon to surpass a $3 trillion market cap by sometime in 2026, if not by the end of this year.
Here's why.
AWS and Anthropic
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the original cloud computing juggernaut. In the age of AI, the market is feeling like it is left behind. Alphabet has its own AI infrastructure to build with Google Cloud, while Microsoft won a huge partnership with OpenAI to drive growth for its cloud business. Now, even Oracle is winning contracts from OpenAI in a reported $300 billion deal.
While it would have been nice to see AWS win some of these deals, the division is much more focused on generating positive return on investment than other players, which is likely why Oracle won the recent deal from OpenAI.
Anthropic is AWS' bet as an AI partner, and it is currently flying under the radar. Anthropic is an AI software provider focused on the enterprise and coding markets. Its revenue is exploding higher, growing from annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 billion at the start of this year to $5 billion as of its latest update. AWS is Anthropic's key cloud partner, where it plans to spend billions of dollars to train and run its AI systems. The partnership is so deep that Anthropic is now working with Amazon to build custom computer chips to compete with Nvidia.
Revenue at AWS grew 17% year over year last quarter to an ARR topping $123 billion, although it is growing slower than competition like Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. However, with Anthropic hitting a growth inflection, AWS' revenue should start to accelerate in the coming quarters. With fat operating margins of 37% over the last 12 months, AWS can be a strong contributor to Amazon's consolidated earnings growth through the next few years.
Bringing AI to e-commerce
Not only will AWS earnings benefit from AI, so too will Amazon's e-commerce and media business. Specifically, it will help with its fast-growing advertising segment. Advertising revenue is currently growing 22% year over year and likely has fantastic profit margins.
This week, Amazon released a new agentic AI tool for building advertisements. In the creative studio, even small businesses can now build robust advertisements that will go on the Amazon marketplace, Prime Video, and other Amazon partner platforms. This will greatly expand the addressable market for Amazon's advertising services. With so many small businesses around the world selling on the platform, Amazon is the perfect advertising platform that can connect sellers to willing buyers of its products.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Amazon can deploy AI for robotics, delivery systems, and customer search to improve the value proposition and efficiency of its e-commerce ecosystem. Altogether, it should help retail expand its profitability, which still has a lot of room to grow with just 7.5% profit margins over the last 12 months.
Why Amazon will join the $3 trillion club
Amazon's market cap will surpass $3 trillion shortly because of the huge potential for earnings growth in the next few quarters. The company's EBIT -- earnings before interest income and taxes -- shot up to $77 billion in the last 12 months on margin expansion. As revenue growth at AWS accelerates and margins keep expanding in North American retail due to advertising, investors should see trailing-12-month EBIT cross $100 billion at some point in 2026.
For a high-quality business like Amazon, a multiple of 30 times its trailing EBIT is entirely reasonable. It actually trades at a higher multiple than that right now. Thirty times EBIT on $100 billion in earnings is a $3 trillion market cap. That is the math behind my Amazon prediction, and why I think it is now the best AI stock to add to your portfolio today."

Right, Apple shares erasing losses for 2025. Last week the tech giant turning green for the year in the days following the release of its newest products including the new iPhone 17. For a closer look at the Apple story right now, let's get to the senior media and Internet analyst Laura Martin. Laura, let's just start uh with your reaction to uh what we saw from Apple a couple weeks ago now, their new product lineup. Um and I I think I think we agree on kind of how I felt coming out of that presentation.
Yeah, very um, very lukewarm, no innovation. I think they're under pricing pressure, which is why you saw them raise no price except for the Pro. One of their models went up by $100 because they introduced a new tier. But really they're under pricing pressure and they've elongated because there's no reason to buy a new iPhone. Um, the only reason people are buying a new iPhone is because their iPhone is now seven years old or six years old and they want, you know, they just need to get a new iPhone or leave the ecosystem. So all of that is elongating replacement values and lowering the potential earnings of Apple.
And I'm curious, you know, how you've thought about um the lack of an AI story, let's say around Apple and how much that to you matters around the story, um or is this kind of like elongated, less exciting hardware replacement story just going to be very difficult to overcome, you know, no matter what your AI strategy ends up being.
Right. So, I mean, I think I think the problem is that their biggest competitor is Android, which is owned by Google, which as you know is integrating its LLM called Gemini into every product it has including of course Android. So while Apple has an outstanding defensive moat around its installed base, the fact that they can't raise price anymore, that that people aren't replacing their iPhones. It used to be every four years. Now it's like six and seven years. All of that makes it scarier because if Android rushes ahead, there will be a breaking point at which, a year from now, three years from now, people will start leaving the iPhone ecosystem because Apple is falling further and further behind from their primary competitor, which is Android.
Now, uh you're hold rated on the stock. I'm curious when you're meeting um with clients, with investors, like is this a stock that one, either people buy and they're just kind of wishing it to go higher, or two, is it a name that like people want to overweight, but they just can't get there? Like what's the what's the reaction, um the the sentiment I guess in those conversations around the Apple story today?
Right. So I would say the two primary holding groups of Apple today are A, defensive, meaning some people think that generative AI is really overhyped. And if you think generative AI and the returns on capital for all the investment other companies are doing on generative AI, then Apple is exactly the right place to hide because they're spending $12 billion this year on CAPEX, while Amazon and Google and meta are spending 85 billion to 100 billion this year on generative AI with absolutely no incremental revenue that's identifiable, linked to that spending. So if you don't believe in generative AI and the future of retooling the American economy, then Apple is a big reason to own that because they have free cash flow, they're shrinking their share base with their free cash flow, they're deleveraging. So, um, I would say that's one group of Apple holders. And then the Apple is heavily retail owned and I think the other uh reason is the ecosystem that people cannot imagine trading in their iPhone ecosystem for an Android and that then they take that anecdotal feeling about they have and they just stay in Apple because it really does have a very powerful ecosystem."

Today's Featured Research Reports
Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past year (+13.3% vs. +13.1%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. AAPL now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. Both paid accounts and paid subscriptions grew double digits year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2025.
Apple TV+ viewership has soared double-digit year over year. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2025) net sales to grow mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. AAPL expects the Services year-over-year growth rate to be similar to that of the June quarter.
However, gross margins are expected to be 46-47% in Q425, including a tariff impact of $1.1 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern for investors.

Shares of Eli Lilly have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (-2.9% vs. +2.5%). The company’s data from phase III studies on its weight-loss pill orforglipron was mixed. Declining sales of Trulicity, rising pricing pressure on some drugs and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds.
Nevertheless, demand for Lilly’s popular GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound remains strong, making them the company’s key top-line drivers. Launches of these drugs in new international markets and improved supply from ramped-up production led to strong sales in the first half of 2025.
Lilly’s other new drugs, like Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca, are also contributing to its top-line growth. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in obesity and diabetes.

The company’s position is strengthened by its strategic acquisition of Hess, which boosts long-term production and free cash flow. Chevron also demonstrates strong operational performance with record production from its U.S. Permian Basin assets and significant projected growth from its GoA and Tengiz projects.
A robust financial structure, a high investment-grade rating, and an attractive dividend yield further support Chevron's stability. However, several factors temper this positive outlook. Upstream earnings fell despite record production, primarily due to lower oil prices.
Meanwhile, geopolitical complexities in international operations add a layer of risk. Furthermore, the stock's high valuation relative to its peers suggests limited near-term upside. Given these conflicting positive and negative points, a neutral stance is advised.

Shares of Monarch Cement have gained +8.6% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry’s gain of +19%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $852.03 million maintains strong shareholder returns, with $11.3 million in dividends paid out for the first six months of 2025, supported by $9.5 million in equity gains and $1.8 million in affiliate earnings.
With no long-term debt and $34.2 million in cash, liquidity and reinvestment flexibility remain ample. Retained earnings rose to $375.1 million, while equity expanded to $410.5 million, funding a $40.1 million capex program. Geographic diversification offsets volume pressures, with cement price increases driving revenue resilience.
The Humboldt plant secures more than 50 years of reserves and structural cost advantages. A 49% JV stake in RMCMO enhances returns while limiting capital intensity. Improved investing cash flows reflect disciplined asset monetization. Strong brand, logistics and infrastructure exposure underpin durable pricing power and long-term competitive positioning.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said the AI space is already being ruled by a group of “big four” players.
The 69-year-old investor said OpenAI, Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and Google’s Gemini are competing for dominance—and the competition is fierce. She noted, ultimately, the four current competitors could be narrowed down to two.
“The number of companies competing, truly competing, in the large language model space has shrunk,” she told Bloomberg.
The recent “acquihires” conducted by OpenAI and Meta, which is not in Wood’s big four, are also examples of the AI space getting smaller and of “other companies not making it,” she said.
ChatGPT maker OpenAI has been one of the most prolific buyers in the startup space this year. In 2025 alone, the company shelled out $6.4 billion to acquire io, the hardware startup from former Apple designer Jony Ive, as well as $1.1 billion to buy product-development platform Statsig. These deals come as the company has also “acquihired” top talent from startups, including the team behind coding assistant company Alex.
Meta, for its part, conducted its own high-profile acquihire earlier this year when it committed about $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in startup Scale AI and brought on its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, as its first-ever chief AI officer.
When it comes to AI consolidation, “the process has started,” said Wood, but the final result is still not in.
“Let’s see over time how they leapfrog one another, and they are doing that regularly,” she said.
ARK Invest’s star ARK Innovation ETF is up 47% year to date as of Tuesday, thanks in part to the stellar performance of its top holdings in 2025, including Roku, Coinbase, and Roblox. Its top holding, Tesla, is up a comparatively lower but solid 8% over the same period despite tumult earlier this year.
Wood, who earlier this year warned of stalling growth, has changed her tune and pointed to the possibility that inflation rates could drop to zero in the coming years as AI-driven productivity increases push inflation down. These productivity increases, however, have come hand in hand with higher unemployment and a Fed rate cut last week, which Fed Chairman Jerome Powell justified partly because younger people are struggling to find jobs.
Wood countered that these productivity increases could be good for the AI sector as a whole since companies are cutting back on employees but also increasing the money they put into AI services.
“They’re willing to pay $20 a month. Some are willing to pay $200 a month, and those who are replacing PhDs, they’re willing to pay $2,000 a month or more,” she said.

Paul Atkins outlines regulatory changes to allow retail investors access to previously restricted private funds
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Paul Atkins said Tuesday that the Trump administration’s plan to open 401(k) retirement accounts to private market investments would give ordinary Americans safe access to opportunities that are currently restricted.
Atkins said that the SEC will work with the Labor Department to broaden access to investments in private funds for ordinary investors who currently wouldn't meet regulatory thresholds that would provide them access.
""Individual investors need to be diversified and the private markets have developed so much because there's a lot of capital available in the private markets,"" Atkins said Tuesday on FOX Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria.""
""And frankly, it's uncool to be a public company, or it has become so, and I want to make IPOs great again,"" Atkins said. ""Thirty or so years ago, when I was a young lawyer starting out in New York, companies like Apple and Microsoft – they had to go public to get capital to build their companies and new products.""
TRUMP SIGNS ORDER TO OPEN 401(K)S TO PRIVATE MARKETS: WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUR RETIREMENT
""Today it's [the] opposite. Companies can stay private longer, and there being so many issues in the public markets between litigation and the short-termism that we were talking about before, the weight of the regulatory apparatus on reporting and that sort of thing, compliance,"" Atkins said.
""Then finally, the weaponization of corporate governance, so those issues have really decreased the attractiveness of being a public company,"" he said. ""We aim to make that better again.""
Currently, investments in private companies are limited to people who satisfy the ""accredited investor"" threshold. The rule aims to protect unsophisticated investors from financial risks associated with investments in private companies, which can be illiquid and aren't subject to public financial reporting requirements.
SENATE CONFIRMS TRUMP'S SEC CHAIR PICK PAUL ATKINS
The rule stipulates that qualified accredited investors must have a net worth over $1 million excluding their primary residence, or income over $200,000 individually (or $300,000 as a couple) in each of the past two years, with the reasonable expectation of the same in the current year.
It also includes professional criteria to satisfy the rule, including investment professionals with Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82 licenses, executives of the company selling the security, or family clients of family offices and knowledgeable employees of a private fund they want to invest in.
Atkins explained that private market investments can help investors diversify their portfolios as public markets become more concentrated, noting the rise of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that have driven much of the market's gains in recent years.
LABOR SECRETARY UNVEILS UNPRECEDENTED PLAN TO SLASH 63 'OUTDATED AND BURDENSOME' RULES
""We only have half the number of public companies as we had 30 years ago, and if you look at the S&P 500 it's rather top-heavy with respect to the 'Magnificent Seven,'"" Atkins said. ""What industry are they in? IT basically, technology, and we saw what has happened in the past when the market gets too concentrated.""
The SEC chairman noted that work remains to be done in putting up regulatory guardrails for opening private market investments to retail investors before they will be available as options in their retirement plans or other investment accounts.
""The key word here is diversification, and so we have to put in guardrails for retail investors to have exposure to these sorts of investments because they can be illiquid, the valuations can be off,"" Atkins said. ""There are a whole host of things – where the retail investor fits in the capital stack of the company, and then finally what the liquidity is of the investment.""

""We have to put guardrails around them, have 'most favored nation status' for those sorts of investments. Their advisors will obviously have fiduciary duty and that sort of thing. So we'll put the protections in to make sure that we guard against bad outcomes to the extent that we can,"" Atkins said."

Huge AI Deals Keep Markets at Record Highs
We started out this opening trading week looking one way — pending reports on home sales, services PMI, durable goods, etc. — and ended it looking quite the other: tech, AI investment and iPhone sales growth. The more things change, the more they stay the same...
The Dow grew a modest +66 points, +0.14% Monday, bested by the S&P 500's +29 points, +0.44%, the Nasdaq +155 points, +0.69%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 +14 points, +0.59%. All four were at new record closing highs. Bond yields continued to creep slowly higher (even with the specter of lower interest rates on the horizon), +2 basis points (bps) on the 10-year to 4.15% and +3 bps on the 2-year to 3.61%.
NVIDIA's Jensen Huang Announces ""Largest Computing Project in History""
The biggest news of yesterday revolves around a familiar theme: NVIDIA's partnership with a smaller AI company for the continued buildout of the reach and scope of future artificial intelligence. NVIDIA announced up to a $100 billion investment in Sam Altman's OpenAI to build out data centers in a 10-Gigawatt project. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang called it, ""The largest computing project in history.""
OpenAI is the parent company of ChatGPT, the widely utilized AI service. The company remains private at this time, but was seeking a secondary share sale worth $500 billion last month. Yesterday's announcement brings this valuation far higher, and another orbit from where analysts had considered it, around $147 billion back in October of last year.
For NVIDIA, this follows major deals with AI service providers like CoreWeave, Nebius and Lambda, though this $100 billion enterprise is a big step beyond, even for NVIDIA. The GPU giant looks to have gained $145 billion in market capitalization MONDAY, pushing the stock up +4% to an overall record-high market cap of $4.5 TRILLION.
iPhone 17 Powers Apple, Rather Unexpectedly
When the new iPhone 17 was unveiled just 10 days ago, it was largely met with yawns and complaints that its advances had little ""wow factor."" However, the sleek design along with pent-up demand for iPhone upgrades have found the sweet spot for the phone, which is tracking +10-15% above the iPhone 16 at this point of the last cycle."

The 100‑day clock
Buffett told shareholders at the May annual meeting he intends to retire as CEO at the end of the year, recommending Abel as the next chief, a timeline now at roughly 100 days as of Sept. 23. Remarks and post‑meeting summaries also highlighted a record cash war chest and a well-telegraphed transition plan that preserves Berkshire’s culture while empowering Abel on capital allocation.
Big shifts coming
Expect more active trading from Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, whose gradual position builds and trims have been more frequent than Buffett’s traditional “enter-or-exit” style, a pattern likely to become more visible in future 13F filings. A renewed focus on healthcare is anticipated given relative sector valuations and the team’s appetite for bargains beyond financials and consumer staples. The most closely watched change: the eventual disposition of one or more core holdings beyond Buffett’s “indefinite” list, with Apple and potentially Bank of America flagged as candidates for further reductions.
Apple is the fulcrum
Berkshire has already sold down a large portion of its Apple stake, with Fortune reporting the holding was more than halved by mid‑2024 and then cut again into Q3 2024 as cash swelled to record levels. By late 2024, Berkshire’s Apple position was valued at roughly $69.9 billion after additional sales, down sharply from roughly $174.3 billion at the end of the prior year. Fortune linked Berkshire’s selling pace and record cash pile to expectations for higher capital gains taxes, a policy risk that could continue to influence timing of any further Apple trims.
What prior Fortune reporting shows
Fortune has documented Berkshire’s steady Apple selling alongside a cash stockpile that hit all‑time highs, underscoring a strategic priority to preserve flexibility amid limited “fat pitch” deals and rising policy uncertainty. In Q3 2024 earnings coverage, Fortune noted Berkshire kept unloading Apple as cash rose above $325 billion, framing the Apple reductions as consistent with Buffett’s willingness to rebalance large positions and wait for better opportunities.
Why more Apple sales are plausible
The post‑Buffett team may continue diversifying away from a single outsized holding, especially with Apple’s valuation far above the forward multiple Berkshire paid when it began buying it in 2016. Independent tracking and market coverage detail additional trims in 2025, suggesting the rebalancing is an ongoing process rather than a one‑off event."

The updated sleek design avoids Bendgate 2.0, but drop damage remains a costly risk for consumers
BRISBANE, Calif., Sept. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Apple's new iPhone Air, its thinnest model yet, passed bend tests, but still shatters when dropped, according to Allstate Protection Plans' latest Breakability Test. The independent evaluation used robotic testing equipment to evaluate how the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro withstand everyday accidents.
The iPhone 17 lineup features Apple's biggest physical redesign in years, including a new rectangular camera housing on iPhone Air and 17 Pro models, designed to accommodate more advanced camera systems and 4K video recording in the Pro models plus other major components in iPhone Air. With iPhone Air's ultra-slim profile, Allstate Protection Plans set out to test whether the device would be vulnerable to both bending and breakage.
Allstate Protection Plans' Breakability Drop and Bend Tests of the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air can be viewed here and includes the following results:
Drop test results: How the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro performed
Facing the Allstate Protection Plan's DropBot, which drops devices 6 feet onto a sidewalk, both iPhones showed improved durability when dropped back-down but still suffered significant damage when dropped face-down.
-
Face-down drop tests (6 feet): Both iPhone Air and 17 Pro shattered after one face-down drop from 6 feet. While both models remained fully functional, the damaged Ceramic Shield 2 front displays were too sharp to use with bare hands. Both iPhones would need their front screens replaced to be usable again.
-
Back-down drop tests (6 feet): iPhone 17 Pro survived one back-down drop from 6 feet with only cosmetic damage, including minor scuffing on its camera housing and along frame edges. iPhone Air cracked across its rear panel after one back-down drop but was otherwise fully functional. These results are a big improvement from previous glass-back iPhone models, and most likely due to the new Ceramic Shield rear panels on iPhone Air and 17 Pro.
No Bendgate 2.0: iPhone Air survives the BendBot
iPhone Air's slim design raised concerns of another Bendgate, which plagued iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge devices. But BendBot, which applies controlled pressure to measure breaking points, discovered bending isn't an issue.
-
iPhone 17 Pro bent at 200 pounds of pressure and was fully functional after our bend test. iPhone Air bent at 190 pounds of pressure and was also fully functional after our test. Though both models bent at fewer pounds of pressure than iPhone 17 Pro Max (240 pounds), they were still well above industry standards for bend durability and the stresses most users would encounter in everyday use.
-
Though iPhone Air is 35% thinner (0.22-inch depth) than iPhone 17 Pro, it was nearly just as durable in our bend test. This may be due to added reinforcement from its rectangular camera housing and titanium frame."

What to Know in Tech: iPhone Sales Deliver, AI Dominates
2025 is a perfect example of how Wall Street is bent on fooling the masses. Following the Trump Administration's 'Liberation Day' tariffs, the major US equity indexes fell into bear market territory, led by tech stocks.
Meanwhile, several prominent Wall Street pundits called for a 'Black Monday' type correction – a reference to the 1987 stock market crash, where the S&P 500 Index dropped 20% in a single session. However, not only has the stock market not crashed, Wall Street bulls have enjoyed one of the most robust intra-year turnarounds in history, with the Nasdaq 100 Index 29% off its lows!
Not only have tech stocks not crashed, but they have led the market on the way up, mirroring what occurs historically in robust bull markets like 2025. Below are some of the most important tech headlines currently:
Nvidia Invests $100B into OpenAI
Today, Nvidia announced that it is investing $100 billion into 'ChatGPT' parent company OpenAI to provide 10GW of computing capacity. CEO Jensen Huang said:
""This is the biggest infrastructure project in history. Computing demand is going through the roof for OpenAI. Every person I know uses ChatGPT.""
Data center infrastructure stocks like CoreWeave and Nebius rallied strongly on the news.
Apple: New iPhone Sales Impress
Apple has been one of the most doubted stocks of 2025, and for good reason. With much of its manufacturing in China, the company was one of the most impacted by President Trump's tariffs. Meanwhile, the company was seen by Wall Street investors as a laggard in the cutthroat race for AI supremacy.
Nevertheless, AAPL shares have rallied strongly amid tariff exemptions and a key partnership with OpenAI to integrate the wildly popular 'ChatGPT' large language model into its operating systems. Monday, T-Mobile US announced that it had its 'biggest weekend' ever in terms of iPhone sales, with 75% of the sales being the expensive iPhone Pro and Pro Max.
Nvidia Investment Gives Intel Life
Last week,Nvidia, the leading AI chip company, announced that it will invest $5 billion inIntel stock and collaborate on AI and data centers. Intel jumped more than 20% on the news, printing its highest level since mid-2024. Intel, once the undisputed leader in the semiconductor industry, has largely been left behind as it has fallen behind companies like AMD and NVDA. However, the deal with Nvidia breathes new life into the company."

While the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12% so far in 2025, major semiconductor exchange-traded funds are by far outperforming the market.
And while companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom are having solid years, they need a company to actually fabricate the semiconductors that they're designing. That's where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.63%) comes into play, and why it's one of the most consequential stocks on Wall Street right now.
About TSMC
Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest independent semiconductor foundry. It makes advanced semiconductor chips for multiple companies, including Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, AMD, and others. The company says it used 288 different process technologies to produce nearly 12,000 products in 2024, proving its broad capabilities to literally any type of client.
According to research by The Motley Fool, 60% of the company's revenue comes from manufacturing its specialized 3 nanometer (nm) and 5nm chips. The transistor sizes are important -- a nanometer is 1 billionth of a meter, so the more transistors TSMC can squeeze into a semiconductor chip, the faster it can work.
Back in the second quarter of 2022 -- which is not that long ago -- TSMC earned 30% of its revenue from 7nm chips. But now it gets a full 36% of its revenue from 5nm chips and 24% from 3nm chips, according to The Motley Fool's research.
TSMC is one of four companies that make 3nm chips at scale, in addition to Samsung, Intel, and Xiaomi. TSMC and Samsung already have plans to mass-produce the 2nm process in 2025.
To say the chips are in high demand is an understatement. TSMC announced that its revenues in August were $11.13 billion, up 33% from a year ago and up nearly 4% on a sequential monthly basis.
The company is investing $165 billion into building new production facilities in Arizona to fabricate semiconductors domestically, which will help it get around any trade issues between Beijing and Washington.
Other ways that TSMC makes money
While the high-powered 5nm and 3nm chips make up the lion's share of TSMC's revenue, it also has other sources:
Smartphones (27%): TSMC's semiconductors helped make 5G smartphones function. 5G was one of the biggest developments of the smartphone industry in this decade, allowing customers to access the internet with connections as speedy as a broadband connection. 5G's higher data speeds allow for high-resolution video, real-time gaming, and quick downloading speed.
While the percentage of TSMC's revenue stream involving smartphones fell from 33% to 27% in the last year, this is still a critical space for TSMC. Apple highlighted the company's partnership with the fabricator in August when it announced a $600 billion commitment to manufacturing in the U.S.
Internet of Things (5%): TSMC's revenue from Internet of Things devices fell from 6% to 5% in the last year. This involves a variety of products including smart home devices, smart city devices, and wearable technology. Examples include smartwatches, industrial sensors, medical monitors, lighting, speakers, and robotic vacuums that don't need high-powered 3nm or 5nm chips to function.
Automotive customers (5%): This includes companies like Tesla, which are working to make autonomous driving a reality. This also involves creating chips for electric vehicles, driver assistance systems, and in-car infotainment systems.
The bottom line
TSMC is continuing to advance its technology to create smaller transistors in order to fabricate more powerful chips, and as long as it continues down this path, it will remain the world's top and most significant chip fabricator. That gives it an essential position in today's AI-driven stock market, making Taiwan Semiconductor stock for investors to consider."

The White House announced Friday that Trump had signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. In response, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reportedly emailed their employees telling those with H-1B visas to stay in the United States and avoid foreign travel for now — and if they’re already traveling, to try to return before the proclamation takes effect at 12:01am Eastern on Sunday.
Business Insider published the memos from Amazon and Microsoft, while Sources published a similar memo from Google. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to Amazon and Google.
According to government data, Amazon employees have received the most H-1B visas so far this fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, then Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, with Google ranked sixth.
Meanwhile, a White House official told Axios that the fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing H-1B holders or renewals. And White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation.”

It recently topped 6,600 as of the end of Monday's close, marking its latest record. The growth has been strong, even despite economic uncertainty this year.
But a lot depends on how well the growth prospects for artificial intelligence (AI) continue to be, as companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and other tech giants make up sizable positions in the S&P 500 and have been thriving due to enhanced opportunities as a result of AI. For some investors, that can make investing in the S&P 500 a less-than-ideal situation given this heavy exposure.
An alternative option may be trying to track not simply the S&P 500 but the broader stock market as a whole, giving investors a more diversified investment. The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI 0.55%) attempts to accomplish this. Could it be a better investment moving forward than simply mirroring the S&P 500 through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 0.45%)?
Historically, the returns haven't been all that different
Over the past five years, when including reinvested dividends, the total returns of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF have been 109% (as of Sept. 15). By comparison, investing in the Vanguard fund has yielded a total return of 103%. To put that in terms of dollars, a $10,000 investment would have grown to approximately $20,900 by tracking the S&P 500 and to $20,300 if you'd invested in the Vanguard fund.
In theory, it shouldn't be a surprising conclusion given that the S&P 500, which tracks the leading 500 companies on U.S. markets, will be a good indicator of how the overall market is doing. If the index is performing well, other stocks are likely to follow. But by investing in the best stocks, it's likely to do better amid favorable market conditions.
However, what if that isn't the case, and you're worried about high-priced stocks that could weigh on the S&P 500 and limit its returns in the near future?
Is tracking the S&P 500 still the better option if you're bracing for a slowdown in the market?
The last prolonged crash in the market took place back in 2022. At the time, inflation was getting out of control and companies that had scaled too aggressively due to strong pandemic-fueled demand realized they needed to cut back, and job cuts followed. That year, the S&P 500 tanked and the SPDR ETF's total returns were -18.2%. But the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund didn't fare any better. In fact, its total returns were -19.5%.
The Vanguard fund has a position in more than 3,500 stocks, which is far more than the 500 that the SPDR ETF tracks. But due to the significant market caps of leading tech companies, they are still going to be the driving force in how both ETFs perform. The top three stocks in the Total Stock Market ETF are Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. Together, they combine for 18.1% of its entire portfolio. By comparison, those three stocks, which are also the largest holding in the SPDR ETF, combine for 20.8% of its portfolio.
While there is a bit less exposure to those stocks in the Vanguard fund, it's not a drastic difference. The Total Stock Market fund has a position in a lot of stocks, but the vast majority are incredibly small. After the first 200 stocks, you're looking at stocks that account for less than 0.1% of its entire portfolio. And the 500th largest position in the ETF accounts for just 0.02%.
While it may be tempting to assume that with an ETF that tracks the entire stock market you're going to get a safer and more diversified investment than the S&P 500, that's not necessarily the case.
How can investors reduce their risk in the market?
The S&P 500 index is a gauge for how the overall market is doing, and thus, trying to simply track more stocks such as through the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF may not be a better option, or even a safer one.
If your goal is to minimize your exposure to tech stocks and have a safer mix of stocks than what the SPDR S&P 500 ETF offers, you may want to consider ETFs with specific goals in mind. The Vanguard Value Index Fund focuses on value stocks, and the Invesco S&P 500 Revenue ETF tracks the S&P 500 but weighs the stocks based on revenue rather than market capitalization. These are just a couple of examples of the ways you can potentially reduce your portfolio's risk if you're concerned about high valuations."

In the past decade, the consumer electronics giant's shares are up 723% (as of Sept. 17), while the e-commerce juggernaut's shares have climbed an even better 777%.
These are two of the most valuable enterprises on Earth. But which of these dominant tech stocks is the best one to buy today?
Apple's strong brand supports huge profits
Apple is a phenomenal company. I don't think there are many people who would argue with that statement. There are three key reasons why investors should think this way.
The first reason Apple is a great business is because of its powerful brand, which resonates so well with consumers across the globe. Apple's products and services are extremely popular and user-friendly, supported by the company's successful history of innovation that includes adding new features and devices to the mix. This also aids ongoing pricing power.
Apple's ability to seamlessly blend hardware and software is what creates its robust ecosystem. This is another reason to appreciate the business. The ecosystem is what essentially locks users in, discouraging them from switching to competing products and services. This helps Apple generate recurring revenue from its suite of services.
Apple doesn't struggle when it comes to profitability. It generated net income of $23.4 billion just in the last quarter (Q3 2025 ended June 28). And in the past decade, the company's net profit margin has averaged a superb 23%. This gives the company the financial horsepower to return lots of capital to shareholders, mainly through stock buybacks that totaled $21 billion just in the last fiscal quarter. Apple's financial strength is a third reason investors will like this business.
AWS is Amazon's most promising segment
Amazon is also a high-quality business. I believe there are also three reasons that support this perspective.
For starters, Amazon operates in multiple growth markets. It not only benefits from the popularity of online shopping, the area that it's a dominant player in, but it's also involved in streaming entertainment and digital advertising. Many investors might not realize that Amazon generated $15.7 billion just in ad revenue in Q2, up 22% year over year. This introduces a high-margin revenue stream.
Another growth engine, which is another reason to admire this business, is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cloud computing has been a major growth industry in the past decade, and it should continue going forward. This is especially true as companies not only move IT spending off-premises but start to invest significant resources into developing artificial intelligence. AWS generated more than half of Amazon's entire operating income last quarter, a share that will probably rise in the future.
The third reason why Amazon is a wonderful business is because it's proving that it can scale up in a profitable manner. Credit goes to running the business with a focus on operational efficiencies, which is exactly what CEO Andy Jassy has done in recent years. Amazon's Q2 net income was 250% higher than in the same period five years ago.
The best opportunity
Apple and Amazon are two of the best businesses on the face of the planet. Companies obviously can't get their market caps measured in the trillions of dollars without doing some things right. But which is the better stock to buy right now?
I believe that title goes to Amazon. It has better growth prospects, as it operates in numerous industries that have meaningful expansionary potential over the long term. Slower growth, particularly in the retail operations, can be offset by the gains with AWS and digital advertising. Amazon might also enter new markets in the future.
Plus, its valuation is reasonable at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30.1. Amazon is positioned better to produce a higher return over the next five years."

The company’s direct integration with Apple Pay now lets iPhone users across the U.S. tap into flexible payments right at the point of sale. This widens Affirm’s reach into everyday purchases. In addition, Affirm announced new deals with ServiceTitan and Vagaro, unlocking exposure to thousands of contractors and nearly 100,000 wellness, beauty, and fitness businesses. For investors, these moves combine to form a powerful expansion story that extends far beyond the fintech’s original e-commerce roots.
This string of announcements appears to have sparked new momentum in Affirm’s stock. Over the past month, shares have surged by 16%, building on a strong run this year in which the price more than doubled. While Affirm recently faced competitive pressure, including losing its Walmart exclusivity, the company’s ability to land fresh deals and roll out innovative integrations like Buy Now, Pay Later within Apple Pay is helping shape a more optimistic narrative. Together with annual revenue growth of nearly 20% and a massive three-year return, it seems that markets are rethinking Affirm’s risk and growth profile.
But with so much expansion happening now, investors have to ask: is Affirm still trading below its true worth, or have this year’s gains already captured the upside from its bigger network?
Most Popular Narrative: 3% Undervalued
The prevailing narrative suggests Affirm Holdings is trading modestly below its estimated fair value, reflecting optimism about its growth prospects amid recent partnerships and financial momentum.
Adoption by a growing base of merchants and consumers, combined with expansion into new geographies (notably the imminent U.K. entry via Shopify), positions Affirm to capture larger volumes as e-commerce and embedded finance become increasingly central to global retail. This trend is likely to drive top-line revenue growth.
Want to know what is fueling this bullish valuation? There is a crucial set of financial forecasts for both profits and revenue that sets an ambitious target. The real surprise lies in the bold assumptions baked into the future growth and margins. Curious how high those numbers are, and if they justify one of the market’s most aggressive multiples? Keep reading to see what could be behind Affirm’s surging fair value.
Result: Fair Value of $95.03 (UNDERVALUED)

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Are Tracking Closely. On September 18, Oppenheimer reiterated the stock as “Perform”. The rating follows the launch of Meta’s Ray-Ban Display smart glasses. The firm reassured that Meta’s smart glasses are not a threat to Apple.
Meta’s $799 Ray-Ban Display features an in-lens display and an EMG wristband for gesture control. However, Oppenheimer contends that the innovation does not yet represent a significant challenge to Apple’s tightly integrated hardware ecosystem.
“The obvious questions for Apple investors are: 1) is Meta Ray-Ban Display a threat to Apple’s ecosystem around iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch? And 2) is Meta leapfrogging Apple in smart glasses design? Upon closer inspection of Ray-Ban Display’s specification and discussion with MR supply chain contacts, our answer to both questions is no.”
Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

While Pro and Pro Max models are seeing delays broadly in line with or shorter than last year, extended waits for the base model and the absence of the new Air variant in China suggest that product mix, rather than pure consumer appetite, is influencing availability.
“On balance, wait times in the US suggest demand for the Pro and Pro Max is more muted than the 16,” UBS analysts said, adding that year-over-year comparisons are “more meaningful in determining underlying demand.”
In the United States, the iPhone 17 Pro Max faces waits of about 26 days, compared with 27 days for the iPhone 16 Pro Max and 39 days for the iPhone 15 Pro Max.
The 17 Pro sits at 12 days, shorter than the 18 days for the 16 Pro and 23 days for the 15 Pro.
The newly launched iPhone 17 Air averages nine days, nearly identical to the 16 Plus at eight days. The 17 Base, however, stands out with 13 days, up from eight for the 16 Base and nine for the 15 Base.
Europe and Japan show similar dynamics. In Europe, the 17 Pro Max’s wait holds at 24 days, matching the 16 Pro Max but below the 37 days seen two years ago.
The 17 Base averages 17 days, more than double the 16 Base at eight days. In Japan, the 17 Pro Max sits at 25 days, just under the 28 days for the 16 Pro Max, while the 17 Base extends to 24 days, well above the 15 days recorded a year earlier.
China tells a different story. With the iPhone 17 Air not yet approved by regulators, comparisons are skewed.
Still, wait times for the 17 Pro and Pro Max there hover around 25 days, seven to 10 days longer than a year ago.
The 17 Base is also showing a more than two-week increase compared with the 16 Base.
UBS flagged that changes in Apple’s launch lineup are distorting the picture. The iPhone 17 cycle began with seven models listed on Apple’s website, compared with nine at the same point last year.
The 17 Base also holds its $799 starting price but now begins at 256GB of storage, up from 128GB. These adjustments, the firm said, could be shifting customer behavior.
“At the low-end, the Base’s wait time of ~13 days vs ~8 last year could suggest consumers are spinning down the price curve given the higher price points of the three other models, a potential negative for ASPs and GM if the trend continues,” the brokerage said.
UBS added that higher-end demand is holding steady but that year-over-year comparisons remain “distorted” by both lineup and geographic differences."

Just don't deny Warren Buffett's market-beating results. Shares of his company -- conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway -- have reliably outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.53%) since he took the helm back in 1970. Investors only needed to remain patient enough to let time do the bulk of the genius investor's work.
The thing is, he's as good at his job today as he's ever been. That's why you'd be wise to poach a few of his picks while you still can before Buffett steps down as Berkshire's CEO at the end of this year.
With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings that would be great additions to almost anyone's portfolio right now.
Apple
Anyone keeping tabs on Apple (AAPL 0.75%) of late almost certainly knows it's been a challenging year for the company. What was supposed to be a solid 2025 fueled by demand for its AI-capable iPhones and its custom-built artificial intelligence (AI) solutions has been anything but solid. As it turns out, not only were Apple's suite of AI tools a disappointment, consumers aren't exactly clamoring for handheld access to such technology anyway. That's a big reason this stock's still down from its late-December peak even with its bounceback from April's low.
It's also worth noting that Berkshire has been paring back its stake in Apple since early last year, and by quite a bit, from more than 900 million shares then to only 280,000 now. Although it's not clear if Buffett and his lieutenants culled the bulk of their Apple position specifically because of Apple's AI headwinds, it is clear Berkshire's chiefs no longer felt comfortable holding such a big stake in the company.
Well, good news for faithful Apple shareholders is on the horizon. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives recently noted, ""We believe that iPhone 17 [the newest iteration of the smartphone] preorders will be up 5%-10% vs. last year as we estimate that roughly 20% of the 1.5 billion users worldwide have not upgraded their phones over the past four years.""
This jibes with similar optimism from JPMorgan (JPM 2.10%) analyst Samik Chatterjee as well as analysts with Morgan Stanley (MS 5.50%). This suggested demand also indirectly indicates faith in Apple's top-down overhaul of its AI-powered digital assistant -- which flopped last year -- will be ready when it's re-released early in the coming year.
It's also possible that consumers just weren't ready to embrace first-generation AI technology and were simply waiting to see what it was and how it worked. Even Apple's die-hard fans could have been looking to sidestep the bumps in the road that any new tech tends to run into.
Whatever the case, after a tough year, Apple appears to be getting back to its old impressive self.
For what it's worth, despite all the recent selling, Apple is still Berkshire Hathaway's biggest stock holding, occupying more than 20% of its portfolio of publicly traded companies.
Kroger
Kroger (KR -0.23%) will never be a high-growth name, for the record. The grocery industry is just too mature and too competitive.
Not every investment has to be a growth stock, though. You could still do well with a dividend-paying value name like this one.
Kroger is, of course, one of the nation's biggest grocery chains, operating 2,731 stores that serve more than 11 million customers every day. Last year, it turned in a net operating profit of more than $3.8 billion and net income of nearly $2.7 billion, which is huge by grocery store standards.
But still -- groceries? Don't dismiss the way this company is modernizing (and even digitizing) this old brick-and-mortar business. For instance, while its same-store sales grew 3.4% year over year during the second quarter of 2025, its online sales improved by 16%. That's business which could have easily been lost to rival Walmart or in some instances even lost to Amazon. Indeed, e-commerce now accounts for about one-tenth of Kroger's revenue.
In the meantime, Kroger is monetizing its online presence in an even more creative way -- through advertising. National brands can now pay the grocer for more prominent promotion at Kroger.com.
Perhaps the most meaningful way Kroger builds long-term value for shareholders, however, is with its dividend paired with stock buybacks. The forward-looking yield of 2% isn't exactly thrilling, but it's based on a dividend payment that's now been raised for 19 consecutive years at an average annualized growth rate of 13%. At the same time, persistent stock repurchases have whittled down the number of outstanding shares of Kroger from roughly 1.6 billion as of 2000 to less than 700 million now, with another $2.5 billion just waiting to be spent on buybacks before the end of this year.
This might help put things in perspective: Between the buybacks, reinvested dividends, and the stock's simple price appreciation, over the course of the past 20 years, an investment in Kroger stock would have outperformed the same-sized investment in an S&P 500 index fund.
BYD Company
Finally, add BYD Company (BYDDY 2.82%) to your list of Buffett stock picks that just might belong in your portfolio as well.
You may think you've never heard of it, but you're probably more familiar with it than you realize. Remember the electric vehicle (EV) company that became bigger than Tesla (as measured by unit sales) early this year? That's BYD. You've just heard little about it because the Chinese company primarily serves the Chinese market.
That's changing, though. While you still can't purchase a BYD-made EV in the United States, registrations of BYD vehicles in Europe soared more than 200% to 13,503 in July of this year, extending a growth streak that's most definitely taking a toll on Tesla's share in the EV-receptive market.
In fact, the company's so confident of this continued growth that it's committed to manufacturing all of its EVs intended for European drivers within Europe by 2028. Indeed, BYD is aiming to sell half of its cars outside of China by 2030. With a fleet of seven massive cargo ships that can each carry thousands of vehicles, it could do it regardless of where these cars end up being manufactured.
Although U.S. consumer interest in EVs is only lukewarm (at best), the International Energy Agency predicts the worldwide number of EVs will quadruple between the end of last year and 2030.
It's admittedly not Buffett's usual kind of stock pick. He's frequently touted the value of America's capitalistic economy and the ingenuity it inspires, and tends to limit his holdings to U.S. stocks. For the record, it's not as if Berkshire owns a massive number of BYD shares. Its 162.6 million shares are only worth about $2.3 billion at this time or less than 1% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.
The fact that Buffett made the unusual trade in the first place back in 2008 and has since stuck with most of the position this whole time, however, speaks volumes about its potential."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-21T06:00:12,'This wasn't a get rich quick scheme - it took years for Nails.INC to become a £30m business',Thea Green founded British nail brand Nails.INC in 1999 after bringing the salon concept to the UK. The company is valued at £30m.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=edbc6e165203d259419070c278db408ae2c1578d359c55b43f9963abe099ac19,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/nails-inc-fashion-beauty-products-050012362.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/nails-inc-fashion-beauty-products-050012362.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/nails-inc-fashion-beauty-products-050012362.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Thea Green admits that she's not one to get nostalgic in business as she charts the success of her British brand Nails.INC, its 25-year journey and the current move to break the US market. Yet the entrepreneur fondly recalls opening the first innovative nail bar concept in London as an “unbelievable experience”.
Back in the late 1990s, Wirral-born Green was travelling back and forth to the US as a fashion editor for Tatler when she noticed that the UK was shorn of the speedy and efficient nail bars proliferating New York. A light-bulb moment prevailed when she also realised a gap in the market to use high-quality nail products.
With £250,000 from private investors and an early business partner in tow, Green, then aged 23, opened the doors to her South Molton Street store in 1999 and went one step ahead from the off by launching a product range as well as a service business.

For the first 12 months, lunchtimes saw women queuing 45 minutes for a 15-minute manicure with an entry price of £10, while Nails.INC products were immediately stocked in department stores.
Green, 49, admits that her knowledge was “postage stamp size”. She had to quickly understand wholesale, retail, staffing, stock manufacturing, shipping and running a retail operations business.
But having worked in magazine journalism, she knew what customers wanted while she also kept abreast of future beauty trends. Today, company turnover is projected to hit £32m in 2025 — a £12m increase from 2023.
“I had an unwavering belief that the customer wanted to have their nails done the same way that a US customer would want to,” says Green. “That they would be no different in the UK, that women needed to save time with incredibly busy lifestyles but still wanted to look good.
“A few different nail bar chains opened within months of us. So it was definitely the right time that the consumer in the UK wanted this US trend. The only difference between us and them was that we had a range whereas the others remained a salon and service business.”
Nails.INC grew its concessions at House of Fraser and Debenhams and began to spread its customer base over multiple stores. By 2014, it had 50 salons in the UK, exported own-brand products to over 30 countries and had also launched in the US.

Its salons were loss making in the early days. Green says that once they became profitable, the economics then changed, cost of goods rose and the firm also saw a drop in footfall at department stores. In recent years consumers have upskilled to learn nail polish at home, while Nails.INC launched a new make-up business, Inc.redible, in 2017."

The iPhone 17 Pro Max with 2TB of storage costs exactly $1,999, coming in more expensive than most laptops. It's the first time any iPhone has reached this shocking price point. And while Cook says it's not about tariffs, his own company's moves suggest otherwise.
Cook's tariff defense doesn't add up
Cook insisted the price hikes have nothing to do with President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. But Apple's own numbers tell a different story.
During the June quarter, Apple took an $800 million hit from tariff costs, Cook revealed during the company's earnings call. For the September quarter, that number could jump to $1.1 billion, Cook said.
To avoid these costs, Apple has been moving iPhone production out of China. The company now makes phones in India and Vietnam, countries with lower tariffs. Cook also announced Apple will invest $600 billion in U.S. manufacturing over four years.
""We can't be everywhere. I wish we could, but we are putting $600 billion to work in the next four years,"" Cook told CNBC. ""And so it is an extraordinary commitment"" [1].
He called this a ""domino effect"" that would bring more companies to build in America. But experts doubt Apple will ever make iPhones in the U.S. The math just doesn't work on pricing alone, not to mention logistics.

HP Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder in HP today, you need to believe the company’s strength in AI-driven PCs will offset competitive and structural headwinds facing its Print business. The recent news of growing AI PC shipments is a positive for HP’s most important short-term catalyst, the Windows 10 refresh cycle, and has not materially altered the main risk, which remains persistent margin pressure from intensifying competition in both PC and print hardware segments.
Of HP’s recent announcements, the August unveiling of new AI-powered gaming hardware is closely tied to the AI PC momentum discussed in the latest shipment data. This move supports the ongoing shift toward premium, higher-margin devices and recurring service models, both of which are emerging as central catalysts for revenue and profitability in the near term.
However, even with AI PC growth, the risk of prolonged price competition and ongoing declines in traditional Print revenue remains something investors should not overlook, especially as...

It noted how the recent Google remedies decision have eliminated an overhang for Apple and also paved way for the company to leverage Gemini’s AI technology.
“We are positive on Apple to continue to drive strong EPS growth from its expansion of its user base and share buybacks but note significant risks ahead, notably in AI and in new devices. That said, one of the key risks – the Google DOJ remedies – has reached a resolution favorable to Apple, eliminating an overhang and potentially clearing a path for partnerships in AI.”
Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

It's a powerful consumer brand with global reach. And it is one of the most innovative businesses around.
Shares haven't done well this year, as they are down 5% (as of Sept. 16), which lags the overall market. However, Apple is still getting attention these days.
Here's why everyone is talking about this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock.
Apple's updates continue
On Sept. 9, Apple held an event to reveal fresh updates to some of its products. The most anticipated of these was the iPhone Air, a slim version of the smartphone that the business calls the ""thinnest iPhone ever."" iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max were also announced, with key features being better battery life, cameras, and displays. Customers also received news of AirPods Pro 3, which can do live translation, as well as two new Apple Watch models.
Anytime Apple holds an event like this, there is typically a lot of buzz leading up to it. However, based on the stock's immediate reaction, with it being down a few percentage points in the days following the event, the market didn't appear to be that enthusiastic about what they heard.
Some of the most notable features Apple introduced are already offered by other companies. Slimmer phones have hit the market before. Alphabet started selling earbuds called Pixel Buds that provided live translation in 40 languages as far back as 2017. The Apple AirPods 3 will work with five languages to start, with four more by year end.
No one will deny that Apple is one of the most successful businesses ever. Its strategy rests on not being the first to introduce something, but by taking its time, focusing on the user experience, and aiming to be the best. The trend hasn't changed, and it has worked out well in the past.
Should you buy Apple stock?
Whenever Apple introduces new products or services, investors should think about how this could affect the company's financial performance. Ideally, the best outcome is that consumers flock to buy these devices, pushing up revenue and earnings in a meaningful way. It would be even better if they led to a surge in services revenue, which is recurring in nature and sports a much higher gross margin.
I'd agree that the iPhone Air is a noteworthy product launch, as it's not every year that the company introduces a totally new form factor. This could draw excitement from consumers, potentially leading to a boost in iPhone sales in the coming quarters. It wouldn't be a surprise to see the iPhone Air registering strong demand.
However, this doesn't mean the stock is a smart buy right now. It's hard to expand meaningfully with over $400 billion in trailing-12-month sales. Wall Street expects slower growth in the years ahead. After revenue rises 6.2% in fiscal 2025, it's expected to increase by 5.2% and 6% over the following two fiscal years, respectively.
Apple's installed base of products, above 2.3 billion (as of Q1 2025) and hitting new records with each passing quarter, is already a gargantuan sum. In particular, the iPhone seems to be ubiquitous. And product refreshes usually come with marginal improvements that don't force consumers to believe that they constantly need to upgrade to the newest iterations, even with a new design. In the latest fiscal quarter, 47% of Apple's entire revenue base came from the iPhone, so the company's success still depends on it.
That muted revenue outlook isn't discouraging on its own. But with the stock trading at a steep price-to-earnings ratio of 36.2, investors might be hoping for better growth potential in order to justify adding Apple to their portfolios today."

Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) provides financial services, including banking, lending, investment, and mortgage solutions for individuals, businesses, and institutions. During the September 9 episode, Cramer praised the firm’s CEO, as he said:
“Now we gotta go down to the companies that have been buying back stock at a 4% clip annually to find the two that I want to pound the table on right here and right now: Wells Fargo and Apple. Wells spoke today at a conference. I liked everything I heard. Here’s what we told club members: ‘Wells has bought back $5.5 billion of its stock so far this quarter. That’s the most the bank has bought back in a single quarter all year.’
A huge, and by the way, that is a huge sign of confidence from CFO, Michael Santomassimo, who said that he’s seeing green shoots now that the Feds removed the asset cap penalty on Wells. I’d be a buyer if we didn’t already own so much of it for my Charitable Trust. And I know Charlie Scharf is on tomorrow morning. I want to listen to him. He’s the CEO and he’s terrific.”

- The new store is seen by many as a symbol of Detroit's ongoing revitalization.
- Hundreds of customers lined up for the opening, which coincided with the release of the new iPhone 17.
Apple CEO Tim Cook made a surprise appearance in Detroit on Friday, Sept. 19, thrilling a crowd of hundreds who had lined up to check out the new downtown Apple Store.
Amid loud cheers and clapping, the famous tech executive opened the front doors of the store for business at 5 p.m. He then lingered outside for several minutes, shaking hands and posing for selfies as customers streamed in.
There were several hundred people waiting in line to enter the new store at 1430 Woodward Ave., next to the Shinola Hotel. The arrival of a downtown Apple Store has been a long-awaited event in the city and is viewed by many downtown boosters as a further demonstration of Detroit's comeback after years of struggles and the 2013-14 municipal bankruptcy.
Robert Pawlowski, 20, of Southgate, was among the lucky several dozen store visitors who had a chance to meet and exchange words with the Apple CEO.
""One thing I can cross off on my bucket list is meeting Tim Cook,"" he said. “I got a selfie and I shook his hand.""
Those in line for the new Detroit store included a mix of Apple customers who were eager to buy the new iPhone 17, which had its in-store release date Friday, along with those simply curious to see the new store.
Aaron Murphy, 32, who lives downtown, said the new store means that he no longer has to drive to Troy to visit the Apple Store in Somerset Collection mall.
“I crack the screen on my phone a lot, so I’m out there a lot,"" Murphy said.
Also in line was Kenera Colley, 31, who moved to downtown Detroit from Texas this summer. She said she joined the Apple Store line just to experience the excitement and see what was going on.
""I love Detroit — it's growing on me!"" she said.
Another high-level Apple executive at the grand opening was Deirdre O'Brien, the company's senior vice president of Retail + People.
Asked by the Free Press whether the company has any plans to replace the Apple Store that recently closed at The Mall at Partridge Creek in Macomb County, she offered an emailed response:
""We loved serving our customers in Partridge Creek, and while we don’t have anything to announce today, we are always looking for opportunities to connect with even more customers in Michigan.""
O'Brien also explained why Apple decided to put a store in downtown Detroit.
""Apple Downtown Detroit, our first downtown store, has been years in the making and marks a historic moment for the company,"" she said in the email.
""Detroit has a special place in our hearts: as the home to an Apple Developer Academy in partnership with Michigan State University, as well as the Apple Manufacturing Academy, which we recently opened right here in downtown. We couldn’t be more excited to be expanding our investment in the city with opening of this new store.""

- Reports describing potential terms of Paramount Skydance's possible bid for Warner Bros. Discovery helped drive gains for both stocks.
- Apple shares advanced as the iPhone 17 went on sale around the world, with reports of strong demand.
- DexCom shares declined after a report of alleged accounting issues and problems with the company's glucose monitoring device.
The buzz reheated Friday around a possible media mega-merger, helping lift shares of the companies involved, while a report from a short seller sent shares of a medical device manufacturer sharply lower.
U.S. equities continued their rally in the wake of this week's interest-rate cut and as investors eyed progress on U.S.-China trade talks. The S&P 500 added 0.5% to secure a record closing high for the second straight day. The Dow and the Nasdaq also built on the prior session's records, gaining 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.

Paramount Skydance (PSKY) shares advanced 5.8%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, as reports outlined some terms that could be included as the company weighs a potential bid for fellow entertainment giant Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). If it comes to fruition, the massive media deal would preempt WBD's previously announced plan to separate its streaming and studio operations from its TV business. According to CNBC, the possible offer could be around 70% to 80% cash, with the backing of Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison. WBD shares were up 3.4%.
Shares of Boston-based utility company Eversource Energy (ES) jumped 4.9%. As colder temperatures approach. Eversource asked the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities for permission to raise prices by 13% for its natural gas customers in the state. Gov. Maura Healey was critical of the price-hike request, suggesting that it would be difficult for residents to afford and indicating that she would call for scrutiny of the proposal by the DPU.
Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, announced that it sold off its full stake in Canada-based Orla Mining (ORLA) for $439 million. The move is part of Newmont's plan to reduce its debt, lower headcount, and divest non-core assets following its acquisition of Australia's Newcrest Mining in 2023. Newmont shares advanced 4.3% on Friday, while Orla's shares were down more than 7%.
Apple (AAPL) stock advanced 3.2% as the iPhone 17 went on sale around the world. Following signals of strong demand for the latest devices—especially the Pro models—analysts at JPMorgan boosted their price target on shares of the tech giant.
Shares of medical device maker DexCom (DXCM) dropped more than any other S&P 500 stock on Friday, falling 11%. The move lower followed a report from short seller Hunterbrook Capital alleging that there are problems with DexCom's G7 continuous glucose monitors for people managing diabetes. Hunterbrook also raised questions about DexCom's accounting and flagged the recently announced leave of absence taken by CEO Kevin Sayer.
Companies in the IT services business came under pressure after reports that President Trump intends to initiate a $100,000 application fee for H-1B worker visas. The president is also reportedly exploring changes to prevailing-wage rules as an additional way of discouraging the use of H-1B visas. Shares of global tech consulting firm Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) dropped 4.7%.
Lennar (LEN) shares lost 4.2% after the homebuilding giant reported lower-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal third quarter. The company cited softness in the housing market and noted that it increased incentives to entice homebuyers who remain hesitant due to elevated mortgage rates."

Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 3.3% in the afternoon session after the successful launch of its new iPhone 17 lineup prompted a significant price target increase from analysts at JPMorgan.
The latest generation of iPhones hit stores worldwide, reportedly drawing long lines and stronger-than-expected demand, particularly for the high-end Pro models. This strong consumer appetite caught Wall Street's attention. In response, JPMorgan boosted its price target on Apple to $280 from $255, keeping its ""Overweight"" rating on the stock. The investment bank pointed to the robust early sales as a key reason for its optimism. Analysts at the firm now projected iPhone sales to reach 236 million units in fiscal year 2026, which they believed would fuel solid revenue growth for the tech giant.
The shares closed the day at $245.28, up 3.1% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Apple’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago when the stock dropped 3.3% as its highly anticipated iPhone 17 launch event on September 9 left some investors and analysts underwhelmed.
The stock's decline, which began after the event and continued into the next day, was attributed to several factors. Investors were likely unenthusiastic about the new devices, viewing them as offering only modest enhancements and incremental upgrades rather than revolutionary breakthroughs. This sentiment was compounded by a ""sell-the-news"" reaction, as many of the new features had been leaked beforehand, removing any element of surprise.
Apple is up 0.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $245.38 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,229.

The company's share price was up 3.3% as of 3 p.m. ET. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.46%) was up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.80%) was up 0.4%.
In addition to positive momentum for the broader market today, especially tech stocks, Apple is getting a lift from a potentially bullish demand indicator for its iPhone lines. According to a recent report from The Information, the tech giant has instructed its manufacturing suppliers to increase production of its base-level iPhone 17 mode.
Apple stock rises on iPhone 17 news
According to the recent report, Apple has increased its orders for entry-level iPhone 17 models. The basic iPhone 17 models retails at a price of $799. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro model sells at $1,099. News that Apple is moving to increase production for one of the models in its iPhone 17 line is generally encouraging, but there could be some complicating factors.
What's next for Apple?
Increased production output for Apple's entry-level iPhone 17 model seems like a positive demand indicator, but it also comes with some margin concerns. While a rise in production output for the base-level iPhone 17 suggests that the model is doing better than expected, it also raises questions about whether other iPhone 17 products may be underperforming. If so, it could reflect general consumer hesitance when it comes to the latest iPhones that winds up actually being a net negative for Apple."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.4% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains, adding about 0.7%, as Apple (AAPL) stock rallied on optimism over its new iPhones hitting store shelves.
All three major indexes hit all-time highs for a second session in a row, ending the week on an upbeat note as the dust settled on the Federal Reserve's return to interest rate cuts. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq cinched their third straight weekly gains, adding 1.2% and 2.2%, respectively. The Dow climbed 1%, marking its second consecutive weekly gain.
Save for Nvidia (NVDA), the Mag 7 tech stocks all posted gains for the five trading sessions through Friday, led by Tesla (TSLA). Tesla ended the week up nearly 8%, while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) added around 6% and Apple jumped almost 5%.
Investors on Friday were focused on details from Trump's conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The US president said in a post on Truth Social following the talks, ""We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal.""
The details of the TikTok deal — which would allow the social media app owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance to continue US operations amid an impending ban — are not yet clear. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the agreement would involve a consortium of investors including Oracle (ORCL), Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz taking an 80% stake in the company.
Notably, a summary of Trump and Xi's talk in Chinese state media did not provide a detailed update on a TikTok deal beyond saying that Xi supported a commercial solution to the problem and that he wanted a set of rules that would allow Chinese companies to invest in the US.
The writeup from China also said that the US should avoid new restrictive trade measures to avoid ""undermining"" recent trade talks.

Elsewhere in markets, nuclear stocks including Oklo (OKLO) and NANO Nuclear (NNE) rallied amid optimism in the sector. Meanwhile, chipmaker Micron (MU) pulled back from a record high ahead of its quarterly report which lands Sept. 23. AI chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) ended the week down 4% after a big upswing last week.
LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 19 updatesMicron falls from record ahead of earnings
Memory chipmaker Micron (MU) saw its shares fall more than 3% Friday, sinking from a record close of $168.89 in the previous trading session as investors await the company's quarterly earnings report Sept. 23.
Despite the pullback Friday, Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock.
JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reiterated his Overweight rating on Micron shares Friday, noting ""AI demand growth"" and ""rising hyperscaler capex budgets.""
Micron's memory chips are used in Nvidia's (NVDA) GPUs (graphics processing units) for AI, and ""hyperscale"" AI data center operators such as Meta (META), Oracle (ORCL) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) have been continuously upping their capital expenditures to increase their computing capacity as they rush to meet AI demand.
TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar said his own note, ""We think MU stock will continue its outperformance in the short term as checks continue to support that momentum.""
Overall, analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect the chipmaker to report earnings per share of $2.83 and revenue of $11.1 billion for the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year.
Stocks open higher with Trump-Xi call underway
US stocks edged higher on Friday at the open, eyeing fresh records.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed 0.3%. The gains kept an advance on Thursday's all-time highs in play.
The moves come as a highly anticipated call between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping is underway, with the fate of TikTok and potentially the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies in the balance, Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports. The call began at 8 am E.T. on Friday."

The development suggests more consumers than Apple anticipated chose the cheaper $799 iPhone 17 over the premium Pro models, which start at $1,099 and typically offer superior materials, cameras, processors and displays.
Apple this week asked Luxshare Precision, one of its two main iPhone assemblers in China, alongside Foxconn, to boost daily output of the standard iPhone 17 by about 40%, the report said.
Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Apple is betting its latest iPhone lineup, including a thinner ""iPhone Air,"" will revive growth in the flagship product after years of lackluster sales, as consumers upgrade less frequently and new models offer only incremental improvements.
The entry-level iPhone 17, which went on sale Friday, now includes screen and camera upgrades once limited to the Pro models, narrowing the gap with Apple's higher-priced versions.
The shift underscores how even Apple, long known for pushing customers toward its highest-margin devices, is facing more price-sensitive demand, raising questions about its ability to sustain growth through premium upgrades.
Analysts have said sales of lower-priced models could weigh on Apple's profit margins, even as they help the company defend market share.

Apple (AAPL, Financials) is adding a new health feature to its Watch Series 11 alerts that can warn users when they may have high blood pressure. The tool, powered by artificial intelligence, was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and will be available in more than 150 countries.
The feature works by analyzing existing heart sensor data through AI models trained on research from more than 100,000 study participants. It doesn't measure blood pressure directly, but it nudges users to check with a traditional cuff and follow up with a doctor if needed. Apple says the alerts will also be available on Watch Series 9 and newer devices.
More than a billion individuals throughout the world have high blood pressure, and many of them don't know it. Experts in health suggest that the alarms on the Apple Watch could help more individuals find out about the ailment early. They also say that the tool shouldn't be used instead of a doctor's diagnosis, and people who don't get an alert shouldn't think they're safe.
The launch for Apple builds on years of work to make the Watch more than just a fitness tracker. It now has blood pressure warnings in addition to heart rhythm tracking and other functions. Both investors and users will be watching to see how many people use the new tool and whether it helps Apple get more people interested in health."

Apple alumni, Apple suppliers, Apple playbook — OpenAI’s first gadget may feel more familiar than disruptive

OpenAI’s ambitions to move from software into hardware are taking clearer shape — and, well, they look a lot like Apple’s.
Suggested Reading
Earlier on Friday, The Information reported that Sam Altman’s company has been busy scooping up Apple veterans — designers, hardware engineers, and even wearable specialists — and talking with the go-to manufacturers that make Apple’s crown jewels. Luxshare, the iPhone and AirPods parts supplier, has reportedly already jumped on board, while Goertek, which builds parts for AirPods, HomePods, and Apple Watches, has been approached to make components such as speaker modules.
Related Content
And that means: It’s not a stretch to say the same factories that churn out Apple gear could soon be minting OpenAI’s first AI-native devices.
Reports from The Information suggest that one device prototype resembles a screen-free smart speaker (Apple makes two). Other ideas thought to be on the table include glasses, a digital voice recorder, and a wearable “pin,” echoes of Apple’s experiments in the same and similar categories. The devices won’t arrive tomorrow (or the day after that); the target launch window is late 2026 or early 2027 — but the apparent trail for an Open AI-branded gadget is already telling.
Earlier this year, Altman pitched the idea of an “AI companion” — a device that’s context-aware, screen-light, and designed to live alongside you rather than in your pocket. The OpenAI CEO has floated an eye-popping target of 100 million units and a shipping date by the end of 2026.
As a whole, the Apple parallels are obvious. Earlier this year, OpenAI bought io, the hardware startup that Apple design legend Jony Ive co-founded, for about $6.5 billion. Ive’s design firm, LoveFrom, remains independent but has been deeply involved in shaping OpenAI’s hardware vision. Now, add in senior Apple alumni such as Tang Tan and Cyrus Irani, who also once helped define the look and feel of the iPhone and Apple Watch, and you get what sounds like an Apple sequel, just maybe with a rebooted cast of characters.
OpenAI leaning hard on Apple’s DNA is both a shortcut and a strategy. Hardware is brutally hard; it’s often better to borrow a blueprint that works. But for Apple, the optics are thornier. It isn’t just losing talent to a rival; it’s watching that rival repurpose its suppliers, its playbook, and maybe even its signature product categories. Apple’s challenge may be reputational as much as it is operational. That steady stream of high-profile staff to OpenAI suggests that Apple’s once-impenetrable design aura might be fading.
Apple has been slow to roll out any of its own generative AI products, especially compared with Mag 7 competitors Microsoft and Google, which are racing to bake AI into search, productivity, and the cloud. If OpenAI manages to land a consumer hit before Apple even finalizes its AI strategy, one of the world's most valuable companies could find itself not only out-hustled on AI but out-designed on the devices meant to showcase it.
So far, OpenAI hasn’t shown off a prototype, set a price, or committed to a single form factor. But if reporting holds, the company’s debut gadget will arrive with suspiciously Apple-like fingerprints all over it. Whether that becomes an advantage or a liability will depend on whether consumers are buying into AI hardware — or just another Apple echo. But if the past few months are any guide, OpenAI's first gadgets won’t just test its product chops — they'll be a referendum on whether fresher Silicon Valley ventures can beat Apple at its own game."

It’s the first time since 2020 that Apple has rolled out several new phone designs. Alongside the new handsets, it also released into stores the Apple Watch SE, Watch Series 11, Watch Ultra 3 and AirPods Pro 3.

The new phones, which bring a fresh look in addition to battery life and camera improvements, attracted long lines at Apple stores from Hong Kong to London to New York to Los Angeles. At the Fifth Avenue location in Manhattan, a line for walk-ins — people who hadn’t preordered a device to pick up — wrapped around the block, extending to Madison Avenue. Multiple shoppers interviewed by Bloomberg News indicated they were upgrading belatedly from Apple’s four-year-old iPhone 13 series.
In Frankfurt, Germany, about 100 people were gathered around midday, including some people who had traveled long distances.
Julia Sowden, an online creator, said she had trekked about 100 kilometers (62 miles) to Frankfurt to get the iPhone 17 Pro Max in orange. She was replacing her iPhone 13 Pro Max, whose battery had seen better days. “I’m actually an influencer, so it’s very important to have the best camera and the longest battery life,” she said, adding that the lengthy trip was worth securing the device the day it went on sale. “Then it wouldn’t have been until October 12. That would have taken too long for me.”
Indeed, the majority of customers interviewed by Bloomberg were planning to buy an iPhone 17 Pro or Pro Max, not necessarily the superthin iPhone Air. The Pro, and particularly the Pro Max, are aimed at power users including early adopters and tech enthusiasts — precisely the sort of people who might be motivated to line up in front of a store around dawn.
At New York’s Fifth Avenue Apple store, few shoppers mentioned the Air. The iPhone 17 Pro Max was mostly sold out at that location, with additional inventory for the iPhone 17 Pro and Air.
The enthusiasm for the iPhone 17 Pro line comes amid early feedback from customers that the phone, particularly in the deep blue color, is quick to show scratches on the back side. Bloomberg reporters also found the black iPhone Air shows scuffs, and that Apple’s magnetic MagSafe charger can leave a circular mark."

Meta says it has sold 2 million of the first-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and earlier this year, Meta unveiled its latest AI-powered smart glasses with Oakley, which were designed for athletes. Silicon Valley is leaning heavily into AI wearables, and Meta seems to be one of the companies leading the charge.
What happened at Meta Connect 2025
With Meta looking to regain its footing in the AI race and sell more hardware, the company had a lot at stake during Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Connect 2025 keynote. Overall, Meta showcased some pretty impressive technology — the Meta Neural Band, the wristband controller that comes with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, is a particular highlight.
And yet, in a twist that felt reminiscent of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Zuckerberg’s demo of the AI capabilities on the Ray-Ban Metas failed. Whoops!
While sharing a live video feed of the cooking content creator Jack Mancuso at Meta HQ, Zuckerberg asked the chef to demonstrate how his Ray-Ban Meta glasses could help him whip up a Korean-inspired steak sauce.
“I love the setup you have here, with soy sauce and other ingredients. How can I help?” asked the chipper Meta AI voice.
Mancuso asked for a recipe for a Korean-inspired steak sauce, and the AI voice began to list the ingredients that he would need — but Mancuso knows he needs to keep the demo succinct, so he interrupts and asks, “What do I do first?”
After a moment of silence that dragged a bit too long, Mancuso repeated, “What do I do first?”
“You’ve already combined the base ingredients, so now grate a pear to add to the sauce,” the AI said. But he had not yet combined the base ingredients, because he had not started making the recipe, hence the question of what to do first.
Mancuso asked the same question again, and the AI gave the same response. The audience laughed.
“I think the Wi-Fi might be messed up — back to you, Mark!” Mancuso said.
“You know what? It’s all good. The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making the technology, and then the Wi-Fi of the day kind of … catches you,” Zuckerberg said. “Anyway, we’ll go check out what he made later.”
The whole interaction was a bit awkward, especially since the issue did not seem to be with the Wi-Fi. But even when things are going according to plan, these presentations can feel a bit hokey … like the end of the keynote, when Zuckerberg and Diplo quite literally ran into the sunset together, wearing their Meta Oakley Vanguards. It had to be a busy day for Mark, so maybe he just needed an excuse to build some cardio into his schedule."

Let's turn now to our stock of the day. Apple's new iPhone 17 and iPhone Air are officially available for consumers starting today. And according to research from start.io, the single most widely owned model across the US is an iPhone 13. So will consumers choose to upgrade?
Year to date, Apple has lagged some of its magnificent seven peers, falling about 5%. Still with me at Jeff Crumpleman, Brooke De Palma and Inez Ferre. So Jeff, given Apple's underperformance this year, how important is the success of this latest upgrade cycle or do investors not really care at this point? They're more focused on AI.
Well, no, I think, you know, it it is very important. By the way, I I'd have to add, I have the iPhone 13.
So, you know, um, I I get the risk is you feel like a luddite if you're several Why haven't you upgraded?
What's the problem here, Jeff?
I know, exactly. I'm sure, you know, Tim Cook would wouldn't want me to to to hear me saying that. I don't know if that will reduce our access to, you know, management or not. But it has all the functionality that I want. I think that's part of the issue. You know, you're really seeing here not evolutionary, you know, AI type of, you know, major improvements here.
You know, you got some improvements in form fa form factor and camera and and those types of things. So that's great, but it it doesn't force me to upgrade and and and you'll see, you know, therefore low, mid single digit growth, you know, in units. And, you know, as a result, I think it's very important to maintain the um high single digit earnings growth as a result of what that helps drive.
You know, services is a big part of the the business, but you have to continue to see iPhone, you know, at at at decent levels. Um, I, you know, we we underown Apple relative to its weight in in the indices and um, I don't think you you don't want to own this company um because of its um ability to innovate and its services business.
But it's it's, you know, trading at 30 times earnings with 8% growth rate and it's hard to get super excited, you know, about major outperformance um when it's at this this stage.
Now, despite Jeff not upgrading his iPhone, I have seen many photos of people lining out the door around the globe including China. And Inez, I'm curious what strategists are saying about China demand, especially since Apple has really struggled against some of those more local competitors like Huawei.
Yeah, um well, jd.com had uh put out some information about pre-orders and it had seen that pre-orders had surpassed uh the days before compared to last year for the iPhone 16. So for the 17, especially 17 Pro, seemed to outperform. So that is something positive. You also had uh B of A that talked about ship dates and that those have been extended uh in China.
And so that's positive for the region as well. But certainly, it is very, very competitive. And as far as the ship dates overall, B of A had also noted that it had seen extended times across the board. So that speaks to strong demand for the iPhone 17, the 17 Pro uh with some of the features that were just mentioned, like uh yeah, like strong longer battery life, um the uh slimmer phone.
So these are the features that not not only are they just attractive for consumers, but also the fact that the price point for the 17 is not that much from the previ previous one, that not much higher. So that would make consumers sort of switch to the 17. Uh but certainly, it is competitive, but but Wall Street seems to at this point be bullish."

One rumour is that she could look to make further changes to inheritance tax (IHT), which has become known as Britain's ""most hated tax"" and is paid on someone's estate after they've died if it is valued at more than £325,000.
The Guardian reported last month that the Treasury was mulling ways to raise more money from changes to IHT. This includes potentially introducing a lifetime cap on the amount of money or assets that individuals can gift.
The Treasury has also reportedly looked at changes to the taper relief rate on IHT. Currently, no tax is due on any gifts if a person lives for seven years after giving them. If a person dies within those seven years and there's IHT due on the money or assets, then the amount of tax due depends on when this was gifted.
Money or assets gifted in the three years before death are taxed at 40% and are then taxed on a sliding scale up to seven years.

In last year's autumn budget, the Treasury announced that from April 2027, most unused pension funds and death benefits would be included in the value of a person's estate. This means that they could be subject to IHT.
The Treasury also announced that from April 2026, it would restrict the IHT relief available on agricultural and business property.
Data released by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on Friday showed that IHT receipts hit £3.7bn in the first five months of the 2025/26 tax year, which was £200m higher than last year.
Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, said: ""Inheritance tax continues to be a cash cow for HMRC. While wealth taxes, IHT's uglier sibling, will be in the spotlight in the run up to the autumn budget it wouldn't be entirely surprising to see further tinkering with IHT too.""
""As things stand inheritance tax may only affect around 1 in 20 estates, but that number is on the increase as an ever greater number of estates become liable for the most hated of taxes,"" he said.
""Years of freezes in thresholds, matched with increasing house prices and rising inflation have pushed more families, who might not consider themselves to be wealthy and would not historically have qualified for the tax, over the threshold.""
Earlier this week, we asked Yahoo Finance UK readers if they believed that the government should introduce tougher IHT rules. We received 3,881 votes, with 11% believing it should, while 83% disagreed and 6% were undecided on the matter."

Earlier this year, Apple introduced its Foundation Models framework during WWDC 2025, which allows developers to use the company’s local AI models to power features in their applications.
The company touted that with this framework, developers gain access to AI models without worrying about any inference cost. Plus, these local models have capabilities such as guided generation and tool calling built in.
As iOS 26 is rolling out to all users, developers have been updating their apps to include features powered by Apple’s local AI models. Apple’s models are small compared with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta. That is why local-only features largely improve quality of life with these apps rather than introducing major changes to the app’s workflow.
Below are some of the first apps to tap into Apple’s AI framework.
Lil Artist
The Lil Artist app offers various interactive experiences to help kids learn different skills like creativity, math, and music. Developer Arima Jain and Aman Jain shipped an AI story creator with the iOS 26 update. This allows users to select a character and a theme, with the app generating a story using AI. The developer said that the text generation in the story is powered by the local model.
Daylish
The developer of the Daylish app is working on a prototype for automatically suggesting emojis for timeline events based on the title for the daily planner app.
MoneyCoach
Finance tracking app MoneyCoach has two neat features powered by local models. First, the app shows insights about your spending, such as whether you spent more than average on groceries for that particular week. The other feature automatically suggests categories and subcategories for a spending item for quick entries.
LookUp
The word learning app LookUp has added two new modes using Apple’s AI models. There is a new learning mode, which leverages a local model to create examples corresponding to a word. Plus, the example asks users to explain the usage of the word in a sentence.
The developer is also using on-device models to generate a map view of a word’s origin.
Tasks
Just like a few other apps, the Tasks app implemented a feature to suggest tags for an entry using local models automatically. It’s also using these models to detect a recurring task and schedule it accordingly. And the app lets users speak a few things and use the local model to break them down into various tasks without using the internet.
Day One
Automattic-owned journaling app Day One is using Apple’s models to get highlights and suggest titles for your entry. The team has also implemented a feature to generate prompts that nudge you to dive deeper and write more based on what you have already written.
Crouton
Recipe app Crouton is using Apple Intelligence to suggest tags for a recipe and assign names to timers. It also uses AI to break down a block of text into easy-to-follow steps for cooking.
Loving Foundation Model access on iOS 26, so many possibilities. Here are a few simple features that we’ve added in Crouton so far
— Devin (@JustMeDevin) September 15, 2025
Signeasy
Digital signing app Signeasy is using Apple’s local models to extract key insights from a contract and give users a summary of the document they are signing.
Dark Noise
Background sound app Dark Noise has used Apple’s local models to let users describe a soundscape in a few words and generate one based on that. You can adjust the levels of different elements of the soundscape once it is created.
Lights Out
Lights Out is the new app to track the F1 season and grand prix from Shihab Mehboob, developer of Twitter client Avery and Mastodon client Mammoth. The app uses on-device AI models to summarize commentary during a race.
Capture
Note-taking app Capture is using local AI to show category suggestions to users as they type in their notes or tasks.
Lumy
Sun and weather-tracking app Lumy now shows neat weather-related suggestions on the app using AI.
CardPointers
CardPointers is an app that helps you track your credit card expenses and gives suggestions on the best way to earn points from the cards you have. The app’s new version is using AI to let users ask questions about their cards and offers.
Guitar Wiz
Guitar Wiz is a guitar learning app using the Apple Foundation Model framework in a few ways. Users will see an explanation of a chord while learning it. The app is showing advanced players’ insights based on time intervals. Plus, the AI model is helping the developer support over 15 languages.
SmartGym
SmartGym app uses local AI to convert the description of a workout to a step-wise set with rep counts, intervals, and equipment. It also gives users workout summaries with monthly progress, routine breakdowns, and individual exercise performance.
Stoic
Journaling app Stoic is using Apple’s models to give personalized prompts to users based on their mood logging. The models can also help users summarize posts, search past entries, and organize them.
SwingVision
This app helps players of racquet sports such as tennis and pickleball improve their form based on the video recordings. The app makers are now using Foundational models to give actionable and specific feedback.
Zoho
India-based productivity suite company Zoho is using local models to power summarization, translation, and transcription across its apps like Notebook for documents and Tables for spreadsheets.
TrainFitness
The workout app is using on-device models to suggest an alternative for an exercise when you don’t have particular equipment available to you.
Stuff
The to-do app has a listen mode that uses Apple’s AI models to listen to the user and convert the voice to individual tasks.
We will continue updating this list as we discover more apps using Apple’s local models."

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Jeff Kilburg from KKM Financial said in a program on CNBC late July that he was selling Nvidia shares and buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The analyst at the time said there was an opportunity for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to reach $230 if the company could show something “tangible” related to AI. While the iPhone maker is yet to make a dent with its AI plans, the stock was trading at around $238 as of September 18, having gained about 4% over the past 30 days. Here is what the analyst had said about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL):
“They have to say something. They have to capture AI somehow someway. They’re not a hyperscaler, so they don’t need to spend the money, but they need to deliver something to provide some optimism. We’re seeing Apple down about 17% from its all-time high. So, there’s an opportunity for Apple to run back up to 230, but it has to be tangible. We need something AI. It’s not cheap. Apple’s not cheap here. Correct. It’s not. But I think if you look at the MAG 7, look at the MAG 7, it’s a 62% market cap concentration of the NASDAQ 100. It’s about 35% as a collective MAG 7 in the S&P 500. So Apple being the laggard, we have to remember, Melissa, that Apple, I know, has had a rough year, but the last couple years it has been producing. It’s been the cash cow. And it would be interesting to see if they make some type of purchase potentially in AI. It’d be the biggest purchase since Beats was just three billion.”
brandon-romanchuk-NOFyRmSQfUQ-unsplash
Renaissance Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined in the quarter. Despite reporting solid operating results, the stock came under pressure over concerns about decelerating iPhone sales, China growth headwinds, and underwhelming details for Apple’s long-awaited AI strategy. Tariffs were also an unexpected negative surprise, with Apple quantifying a sizable $900M cost impact. Moreover, the latest development in the Apple vs. Epic Games lawsuit resulted in a ruling that Apple had violated an earlier injunction, questioning Apple’s absolute control over its App Store.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

In addition, Apple’s magnetic MagSafe charger can leave a visible circular mark on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models, Bloomberg found.
It’s the company’s first major physical redesign of its smartphones in years. With this generation, the handsets return to an aluminum shell and feature what Apple has touted as a more scratch-resistant finish on the back.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Consumers in China, one of the first markets where the new devices went on sale, took to social media earlier Friday with photos of scratches on the back of the newly released iPhone 17 lineup. As of Friday afternoon, the related hashtag was among the top trending topics on China’s Weibo, with more than 40 million views. Users on X similarly posted images and video of the scratched handsets.
Aluminum, the material Apple used for its iPhone 17 Pro and Max enclosures, is known to be scratch prone, and the blemishes are especially conspicuous on darker-colored devices. The iPhone 5, released in 2012, received similar complaints from users about scuffs on the black and slate models. The iPhone 17 Pro is offered in three shades, with the deep blue being the darkest. That handset is not offered in black, which is otherwise a mainstay in Apple’s usual iPhone color selection.
Apple has contended with launch-day hiccups in past years. Users also complained about how the iPhone 7’s glossy black finish could be easily scuffed. Earlier, the super thin iPhone 6 experienced a more serious issue, as users found it was susceptible to bending. The iPhone 4 also infamously had a problem with its wireless antenna failing when held in a certain way.
The fresh social media comments come during an otherwise strong debut for the iPhone 17 line, which Apple is counting on to maintain its momentum at a time that the company is struggling to roll out AI features."

The device is currently a prototype under development and is expected to be pocket-sized and aware of context, designed to work closely with the ChatGPT parent's artificial intelligence models.
Such a gadget could eat into the markets of Apple and other consumer electronics makers by offering an alternative to users for interacting with AI, challenging the dominance of smartphones and traditional hardware.
Luxshare and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
OpenAI bought hardware startup io Products, founded by former Apple designer Jony Ive, earlier this year in a $6.5 billion deal, underscoring its push to move beyond software into consumer hardware.
Luxshare, a major assembler of Apple's iPhones and AirPods, would bring large-scale manufacturing capabilities to OpenAI's effort.
OpenAI has also approached China-based Goertek (002241.SZ), a supplier that assembles AirPods, HomePods and Apple Watches, to provide components, including speaker modules, for its planned devices, the Information report said.
The project marks one of the boldest bets yet by an AI company to build a dedicated device rather than relying solely on smartphones and PCs. The goal is to create an ""AI-native"" product, hardware designed from the ground up to work with AI models, rather than bolted onto existing platforms.
This, according to analysts, could open new markets and give OpenAI a foothold in consumer electronics, an arena still dominated by Apple, Samsung and Alphabet's Google.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-19T14:30:00,Prediction: This AI Growth Stock Will Become Europe's First $1 Trillion Company by 2035,"Even near a 52-week high, ASML has plenty of room to run for patient investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2b7bde98783357de6cea9864dd5240c863df836525404dbfedb822bdd9b0168d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,fool.com,200,,"On Sept. 15, Alphabet joined Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple as the fourth U.S. company to surpass $3 trillion in market capitalization. But turn your attention across the pond, and there is not a single European company that is worth over $1 trillion, or even half that amount.
Here's why Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML 2.49%) is the best-positioned company to surpass $1 trillion in market cap within the next decade.
Why leading European companies are much smaller than top U.S. companies
The European stock market is highly fragmented. Instead of being viewed as European Union companies, Siemens is a German company, Novo Nordisk is a Danish company, and Shell is a British company. It would be like if U.S. investors viewed Oracle and Tesla as Texas companies versus Microsoft and Amazon as Washington companies.
There are also different regulations in Europe and more conservative pension and funding rules. Companies tend to be more specialized, although there are some conglomerates, like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, that united French luxury brands in the 1980s.
Most importantly, European stock markets simply haven't benefited from technology as much as the U.S. Many of Europe's largest companies aren't tech enterprises. In contrast, the U.S. stock market is dominated by tech-focused companies like the ""Ten Titans"" that continue to make up a larger share of the S&P 500. The U.S. is the tech capital of the world, and the tech sector makes up around a third of the S&P 500 -- illustrating its importance in the U.S. market.
ASML is an anchor in the AI industry
ASML popped 6.5% on Monday after a sell-side analyst who had been neutral on the stock upgraded it to a buy. The move pushed ASML's market cap to $341 billion -- making it the most valuable European company, even ahead of LVMH. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years, ASML would need a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% -- which seems reasonable for a cutting-edge technology company that heavily benefits from artificial intelligence (AI).
There's no contest that ASML is my top AI stock to buy now and hold for the long term. Holding a stock for years or even decades takes a lot of conviction. For ASML, the essential ingredient in the investment thesis recipe is its monopoly over the most complex part of the semiconductor manufacturing process. ASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems use lenses to print features on microchips.
There are plenty of companies that make DUV machines, including Nikon and Canon, which specialize in camera lenses. However, what sets ASML apart is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. These machines use mirrors to reflect light because EUV light has a wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers (almost X-ray range), which is too small to pass through glass. At a wavelength that small, a glass lens would absorb the light instead of bending/refracting it.
Achieving such a small wavelength unlocks untold efficiency improvements, allowing ASML's machines to pack more transitions per chip by printing more precise features (narrower lines, smaller spacing, etc.). It's an incredible engineering feat, and one that is driving advancements in AI.
EUV's smaller wavelength, fewer steps, and high efficiency make it a must-have for fabs like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung Electronics, and Intel to handle increasingly sophisticated designs from Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.
Steady growth at a great value
Despite the long-term potential, ASML warned investors during its last quarterly earnings release that it may not grow in 2026 -- which sparked a steep sell-off in the stock. However, ASML reaffirmed its 2030 targets. The high end of its guidance range calls for doubling revenue relative to 2024 levels. Additionally, ASML expects its gross margin to expand to the high 50% range, likely because high-margin EUVs are expected to make up an increasingly larger percentage of its sales mix compared to DUVs.
Even after its run-up, ASML sports a reasonable 31 forward price-to-earnings ratio, which is far cheaper than many other fast-growing AI stocks, especially considering ASML's strong moat in EUV technology. What's more, the company has a strong dividend. Currently yielding 0.8%, the quarterly payout is a nice cherry on top for investors seeking to add some passive income to their long-term holdings.
Round out your AI portfolio with ASML
ASML isn't a high-flying AI stock that is heavily disrupting cloud computing or making next-generation chips. Nor is it a tech conglomerate like Microsoft and Alphabet, which have a lot of moving parts in addition to their AI focus. However, ASML is well positioned to grow earnings by double digits over the long term, in lockstep with fabs expanding their manufacturing capacity to meet AI demand.
The stock is an especially attractive buy for investors who have valuation concerns about the current market, especially leading S&P 500 tech stocks. However, it's important to understand that ASML's results can swing based on its order volumes from key customers, as well as geopolitical tensions and trade policy.
Although ASML is a Dutch company, it is heavily influenced by U.S. trade actions. So, ASML's growth could stall in the near term due to factors outside of its control. Therefore, it's best to approach the stock with a long-term mindset, especially as a balanced play bridging the gap between growth and value.
In sum, ASML will benefit from higher chip demand, especially from AI. The stock may be a perfect buy for investors with exposure to other aspects of the value chain, such as the chip designers, fabs, or cloud computing plays. Adding an equipment supplier like ASML, rather than doubling down on just one part of AI, is a great way for investors to build a diversified portfolio."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-19T14:05:54,Analyst Explains Why He’s Selling Nvidia (NVDA) – ‘I Know It Sounds Crazy’,We recently published Top 10 Stocks to Watch After Federal Reserve’s Rate Cut.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Jeff Kilburg from KKM Financial said in a program on CNBC late July that he was planning to sell Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares despite the idea sounding “crazy.” Here is how the analyst explained his decision:
“I want to sell Nvidia. I know it sounds crazy, but Nvidia at a new all-time high of $175. I want to sell Nvidia, take profits and the reason is because of the overconcentration. If you see the NASDAQ, we’ve talked about the NASDAQ right now. It’s on its 65th day of being above its 20-day moving average. So, a little long in the tooth, but this is momentum. This is the V-shaped recovery. So, by selling Nvidia, I want to buy Apple nearly the lagger. Tesla is just below Apple in the MAG 7. So, I think there’s an opportunity. If you want to short Nvidia, this is not for you. You will have a very hard time shorting Nvidia. But there’s an opportunity to either sell or trim position. I blindly bought Nvidia back in April at $92. So I’m taking profits.”
NVDA was trading at around $176 as of July 28, while the stock price is $170 as of September 18.
Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Brown Advisory Large-Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
Information Technology was the largest detractor from relative performance during the quarter. The strategy’s underweight to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and not owning Broadcom (AVGO) were the two largest detractors during the period. NVIDIA (NVDA), a market leader in advanced graphics processing units, rebounded after a first quarter marked by a lower gross margin outlook, which was attributed to short-term complexities in ramping up Blackwell production, and a broad-based decline in AI infrastructure stocks. The company’s most recent quarterly earnings were modestly ahead of consensus expectations, and management expects gross margins to increase by year-end as yield and throughput on Blackwell racks continue to improve."

3 Reasons to Avoid Netflix Stock Despite Its +28% Surge in 6 Months
Netflix has emerged as a dominant force in the entertainment industry, raising its revenue forecast for 2025 to $44.8-$45.2 billion, up from $43.5-$44.5 billion, reflecting management's confidence in sustained growth momentum. The stock has returned 28.2% in the past 6-month period. Yet beneath these headline numbers lie structural concerns that warrant a more cautious investment approach, particularly for those seeking optimal entry points in the evolving streaming landscape.
Operating Margin Pressures Signal Near-Term Headwinds
While Netflix achieved an impressive operating margin of 34.1% in the second quarter of 2025, an improvement of nearly 7 percentage points from the year-earlier period, management has warned investors about forthcoming profitability challenges. The company cautioned that operating margin in the second half of 2025 will be lower than in the first half due to higher content amortization and sales and marketing costs associated with the larger second half slate. This guidance suggests that the company's margin expansion story may face temporary setbacks as content investment accelerates.
The deteriorating margin trajectory reflects Netflix's strategic imperative to maintain content leadership amid intensifying competition. With major releases scheduled for late 2025, including high-budget original productions and licensed content acquisitions, the company faces mounting pressure to balance growth investments with profitability targets.
These elevated content costs, combined with increased marketing expenditures to defend market share, create a challenging operating environment that could constrain earnings growth despite revenue expansion. Management's warning about second-half margin compression indicates that profitability improvements may stall, potentially disappointing investors expecting continued operational leverage.
Intensifying Competitive Landscape Threatens Market Dominance
The streaming wars have evolved from Netflix's monopolistic advantage to a fiercely contested battlefield where deep-pocketed rivals continue gaining ground. In the United States, Netflix leads the streaming market with 27% of the share, but Amazon owned Prime Video follows closely, holding 26%, demonstrating how quickly competitors have closed the gap. Disney -owned Disney+ and Apple -owned Apple TV+ continue expanding their content libraries and technological capabilities, while leveraging unique ecosystem advantages unavailable to Netflix."

Apple (AAPL, Financials) released the iPhone 17 worldwide on Friday, with lines extending from Beijing to London. The launch is crucial. Apple needs to maintain demand high in China, where Huawei and Xiaomi have gained market share, and show progress on artificial intelligence following last year's disappointing launch. This year's range includes the iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, smaller iPhone Air, and new Apple Watch and AirPods. The first customers were Chinese, some waiting overnight. JD.com said that iPhone 17 series preorders surpassed the iPhone 16 inside the first minute, while trade-ins increased dramatically. Upgrades were cited for better storage, battery life, and design. Young professionals lined for hours at Marina Bay mall in Singapore, while launch-day lineups in London were greater than for the iPhone 16, with purchasers favoring the Pro models. Analysts claim the base iPhone 17 exceeds expectations. Apple gave customers additional value without raising prices by adding RAM at the same price. New AirPods with live translation also made waves. After concerns that Apple may be losing position in AI and its biggest outside markets, the large turnout reassures investors. Attention will soon turn to whether sales momentum lasts beyond the first wave of devoted consumers."

Here's what investors need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Tick Higher as Major Indexes Look to Add to Records
Stock futures are slightly higher after markets hit record highs yesterday on a surge in tech stocks. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were each up about 0.1% recently. The Russell 2000 small-cap index recorded its first record close since November 2021 on Thursday amid optimism about the prospect for further interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, is at 4.14% this morning, up from yesterday's close. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is down slightly at around $116,500, while gold futures are holding steady at around $3,680 an ounce.
2. Trump, Xi Set to Discuss TikTok Ownership Deal
President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday to negotiate a deal to keep video app TikTok operating in the U.S., according to media reports. The call is expected to come at around 9 a.m. ET. A reported framework for a deal would have Oracle (ORCL) lead a consortium of companies that operate the social media app. Trump this week signed an executive order to push back a deadline for Chinese owner ByteDance to divest its ownership of the company, extending it to mid-December. Oracle shares were up about 1% in premarket trading.
3. Apple iPhone 17 Goes on Sale, Strong Demand Reported
Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 17 lineup went on sale Friday, reportedly drawing long lines of customers in Europe and Asia amid strong demand for the new products—especially for the Pro models. The iPhone 17 features four models, including the “Air,” its thinnest model to date. Other models feature longer battery life, more scratch-resistant materials, and better cameras than earlier models. Apple stock has lost 5% of its value since the start of the year, making it the only member of the Magnificent 7 group of mega-cap tech companies to lose ground. Investors have been concerned that Apple has been slow to bring artificial intelligence features into its products. Apple shares were up about 1% ahead of the bell on Friday.
4. FedEx Shares Gain After Company Reinstates Full-Year Outlook
FedEx (FDX) shares moved higher as the company reinstated its full-year outlook, after suspending it in June over tariff uncertainty. FedEx said it expects 4% to 6% revenue growth this fiscal year, above analysts' estimates as compiled by Visible Alpha. FedEx posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.83 on revenue that climbed close to 3% to $22.2 billion in the first quarter, topping analysts' estimates, as volumes in the U.S. rose. The shipper also said it's on track to reduce costs by $1 billion in fiscal 2026 and spin off its freight business by next June. FedEx shares, which had lost about a fifth of their value so far in 2025 coming into today's session, were up about 1% in recent premarket trading, well off their earlier gains.
5. Shares of Homebuilder Lennar Fall as Earnings Drop, Revenue Misses Expectations
Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) reported declining quarterly profits amid continued sluggishness in the U.S. housing market. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.29 for its fiscal third quarter, above analyst estimates tracked by Visible Alpha, but lower than the $4.26 it reported in the year-ago quarter. Lennar’s quarterly revenue of $8.8 billion was more than 6% lower than the year-ago quarter and below the Visible Alpha consensus. Lennar increased new orders by 12%, but it had to rely on incentives to achieve those results, sending the average sales price down to $383,000 and reducing its gross margin by 17.5%. Shares of Lennar were down nearly 3% in premarket trading."

- Apple's iPhone 17 lineup went on sale Friday, with early sales of the devices across the U.S, Europe and Asia reportedly drawing long lines amid strong demand—especially for the Pro models.
- The phones have met with a mixed reaction from analysts with some saying they are waiting for AI-powered upgrades to the models next year.
- Apple shares have struggled this year amid Wall Street consensus that its devices have been slow to catch up in the AI race.
Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 17 lineup went on sale Friday, with early sales of the devices in the U.S and the rest of the world reportedly drawing long lines amid strong demand—especially for the Pro models.
The queues began in Asia and Europe then continued in the U.S., where CEO Tim Cook greeted a long line of customers at the company’s flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York City.
The tech giant introduced the lineup earlier this month and opened them up for pre-orders, with the new phones including a thinner model, the iPhone Air, as well the more expensive iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and iPhone Air and also new Apple Watch and AirPods models. The iPhone 17 Pro is selling for $1,099, up $100 from the iPhone 16 Pro, with storage of 256 gigabytes, or double the previous model's and a longer battery life.
The phones had met with mixed reaction from analysts, with some, like Morgan Stanley, calling the iPhone Air “a small positive surprise” while others said they are waiting for AI-powered updates to the lineup that could give Apple’s stock, the sole underperformer among the Mag 7 tech giants, a bigger catalyst for gains.
Apple's Slow Rollout of AI Features Have Hit Its Stock
The shares have been under pressure on the back of Wall Street concerns that the tech firm has been slow out of the gate in the AI race, with even the new devices lagging at a time when analysts increasingly are touting wearables like smart glasses as a key device to access the technology. Apple has also been increasingly losing ground in China, the world’s largest smartphone market, to domestic rivals like Huawei and Oppo.
According to CNBC, demand is especially strong for the Pro and Pro Max models, with lines in London “notably longer” than they were for the iPhone 16 and consumers in Beijing queuing up the night before to get their hands on the models following strong pre-order sales in China.
Bloomberg said demand for the phones was also strong in Hong Kong, though noted some consumers in China were complaining on social media that they were easily scuffed.
Apple shares are rising 3% in intraday trading Friday and have lost 2% of their value so far this year.

“The promise of glasses is to preserve this sense of presence that you have with other people,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the Meta Connect 2025 keynote. “I think that we’ve lost it a little bit with phones, and we have the opportunity to get it back with glasses.”
In reality, Meta wants its own hardware to eat into the marketshare of Apple and Google so that it doesn’t have to keep siphoning profits to them via app stores. But nevertheless, this is the angle Meta is taking to sell its most sophisticated smart glasses yet, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which the company hopes could one day eclipse the market share of smartphones.
Meta’s Reality Labs division burns cash at an alarming rate, which has concerned investors over the years. But Wednesday’s event finally showed us a glimpse of what the division’s $70 billion in losses since 2020 have gone toward.
Meta has had its fair share of flops, like the entire promise of its social metaverse. (Remember when they announced that metaverse avatars would finally get legs?) But with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta has created a remarkable piece of technology, unlike any other consumer-facing product on the market — we have yet to test it ourselves, so we can’t quite say just how groundbreaking this really is, but it looks promising.
Like Meta’s existing smart glasses, which have sold millions of pairs, the new model has cameras, speakers, microphones, and an on-board AI assistant. The display on the glasses, which is offset so as not to obstruct one’s sightline, can display Meta apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, as well as directions and live translations.
What most sets the Meta Ray-Ban Display apart is the Meta Neural Band, a wristband that uses surface electromyography (sEMG) to pick up on signals sent between your brain and your hand when performing a gesture.
Meta’s keynote didn’t get into the specifics of how Zuckerberg was writing these texts, but according to Reality Labs’ research on sEMG, users can write out messages like this by holding their fingers together as if they were gripping a pen and “writing” out the text.
While some live AI demos at the keynote failed — Zuckerberg blamed the Wi-Fi — we at least got to see the wristband in action, which is more novel. Zuckerberg quickly wrote out text messages, then sent them on his Ray-Bans.
“I’m up to about 30 words a minute on this,” Zuckerberg said onstage at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters. “You can get pretty fast.”"

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is among the 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 5 Years. On September 11, investment firm D.A. Davidson downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy, saying it was ‘unimpressed’ by its latest products.
However, analyst Gil Luria maintained his earlier price target of $250, which represents a 7% upside potential from Friday’s close. The analyst expressed disappointment at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s product strategy and said that unless the company redefines its offerings or develops compelling new ones, growth is expected to stay stagnant.
“While we don’t question the utility of the products, Apple has brought lackluster innovation to their core lineup, starting with the iPhone. Even a foldable iPhone, which we expect to be announced next year, may not be a compelling enough of a reason for the average user to go out of their way to upgrade, thus we are left unimpressed until the company can either truly innovate on their core lineup or develop a new product category to accelerate growth.”
Luria also pointed out how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was losing footing to growing overseas competition, especially from China. Moreover, the analyst highlighted the company’s lack of role in the AI ecosystem as another disappointment.

In January 2021, Parler was wiped out overnight accused of “inciting violence” and tied to January 6th. The punishment was catastrophic: more than 20 million voices silenced, with Amazon Web Services pointing to a mere 98 flagged posts as justification.
Fast forward to 2025: Bluesky, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Meta, and Discord are flooded with thousands of posts celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk and inciting violence against conservatives. Yet none of these platforms face bans, removals, or even warnings. “This is the very definition of a diabolical double standard,” said Elise Pierotti, Co-Founder and Sr. VP of Business Development at Parler.
Even industry leaders are calling out hypocrisy. On September 14, 2025, Elon Musk endorsed an X post stating that Parler was removed from Apple’s App Store for “0.1% of the extremist vitriol now rampant on Bluesky and Reddit,” replying simply: “True.” U.S. Senator Mike Lee has also demanded answers: “What does Apple’s targeting of Parler—but not Bluesky or Reddit—reveal about its political bias and monopolistic control over app store markets?”
Parler asks the question Big Tech refuses to answer:
“Why was Parler obliterated without due process over 98 posts, while platforms hosting thousands of violent threats remain untouched?”
Our Stance on Speech
Parler has always stood unapologetically for free expression. We reject the censorship of so-called “hate speech,” a subjective label that is selectively enforced. At the same time, we recognize clear constitutional boundaries: direct calls for violence and unlawful threats are not protected speech—and Parler enforces against them. Our standard is simple: open discourse, yes. Incitement to violence, no.
The Hidden Hand of Government Influence
Recent reports revealed that USAID funded Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, which produced reports later weaponized to justify Parler’s deplatforming. This raises serious questions: Why are taxpayer dollars being used to silence lawful speech in America?
Parler Returns Stronger
Despite every effort to erase us, Parler has returned bigger, stronger, and untouchable. Today, Parler operates on decentralized hosting, a rewards system, and integrations with more than 20 platforms —ensuring no single gatekeeper will ever silence us again. “Against every attempt to destroy us, we are still here,” Pierotti said. “Our ecosystem is unshakable, and our voice is louder than ever.”"

Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financials) has started trial production of its long-rumored foldable iPhone, according to a report from Nikkei Asia. The company is working with suppliers in Taiwan and may begin mass production in India in 2026 if testing goes smoothly.
Foxconn, Apple's longtime manufacturing partner, is involved in the effort. Analysts expect the foldable device to use ultra-thin glass, which is harder and more expensive to produce than conventional smartphone glass. TF International's Ming-Chi Kuo said the glass costs could be two to four times higher, but Apple appears confident in demand.
Kuo noted that Apple has lifted its shipment forecast for 2026 to 810 million units, up from 68 million previously. Projections for 2027 have also been increased to as many as 25 million units. Some analysts believe this year's launch of the iPhone Air is meant to set the stage for the foldable model.
For investors, the report signals that Apple is preparing a major new hardware cycle in 2026, with the foldable iPhone positioned as a premium driver alongside the existing lineup."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft on Thursday said it plans to build a second massive artificial intelligence data center in Wisconsin, bringing its spending in the state to more than $7 billion.
The new $4 billion project will join a $3.3 billion data center in Mount Pleasant in the southeastern corner of the state, announced last year.
Microsoft said the initial data center remains on track to open next year and will employ about 500 people at its peak, expanding to about 800 once the second data center is complete.
It said with the addition of the second large-scale data center, the site would eventually house the world's most powerful AI supercomputer, connecting together hundreds of thousands of powerful chips from Nvidia.
The area in Racine County, which sits nestled between Milwaukee and Chicago, has drawn the attention of U.S. presidents of both political parties in recent years.
It was initially the site of a proposed $10 billion factory by electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which builds phones for Apple and others, during the first term of President Donald Trump, but those plans were drastically scaled back.
At Microsoft's unveiling of the first data center last year, U.S. President Joe Biden, then running against Trump for a second time, highlighted Foxconn's pullback at the site.
Microsoft said on Thursday that it plans to pre-pay for electrical infrastructure to avoid raising electricity rates in the region and that a state-of-the-art cooling system will tap into Wisconsin's cool climate and reduce the data center's yearly water use to that of an average restaurant.
The company plans to build solar power in a different part of Wisconsin to offset its energy use at the data centers, but Microsoft President Brad Smith said the project will entail new fossil fuel power generation near the facilities.
The driving factor was ""what can be built in a particular area,"" Smith said in an interview. ""This is (liquefied natural gas) territory.""
He said that the 800 permanent jobs the data centers create will be fewer than the thousands of jobs required to construct them but that there will still be jobs for skilled pipefitters and electricians.
""All the things that we build need to be operated,"" Smith told Reuters. ""It needs to be maintained. These are good jobs.""

We would talk briefly about meta, what it unveiled uh and as it pertains to Apple. I am I out of my mind to think that Apple could be challenged by what Meta put out or wants to put out in eyeglasses? And if I am out of my mind, you can certainly tell me. We'll still have you back.
Well, I'd have to ask you first if you have a set of the Meta Ray bands now and if you're using them and if that's the way you imagine consuming content and consuming artificial intelligence. I suspect that Apple still has the upper hand with over two billion uh installed units across the world and the the all of us will likely go to Apple first to consume our artificial intelligence.
The ability for them to give it to us has just got better when the the Google suit got thrown out. So I think they're going to partner with somebody pretty good and uh and I think Apple's probably going to be the preferred delivery device even though those Raybands are pretty cool.

NEW YORK CITY, NY / ACCESS Newswire / September 18, 2025 / With Apple's release of the iPhone 17, Start.io unveiled new research providing a detailed look at current iPhone ownership patterns across the United States. Drawing on data from millions of devices, the analysis highlights where Apple's latest models are gaining traction, which states are holding onto older generations, and how sharply the market is split between base and premium editions.
At the national level, the iPhone 14 remains the most widely owned generation at 18.91% penetration, followed closely by the iPhone 16 (18.33%), iPhone 15 (17.57%), and iPhone 13 (17.04%). When broken down by individual model, however, the standard iPhone 13 leads all devices with 9.24% share, underscoring its staying power as a baseline device across nearly every state.
Key findings from the research include:
-
The iPhone 13 dominates: The standard iPhone 13 ranks as the top model in 43 states, while the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 most often take second place.
-
Premium models are surging: The iPhone 16 Pro Max (5.97%) now outpaces the standard iPhone 16 (4.44%), the only instance where a Pro Max has surpassed a base model nationally.
-
Regional divides are stark: Colorado leads in iPhone 16 adoption at 21.3%, while Arkansas lags at 15.4%. Premium preference is highest in Alaska (54% of users) and lowest in Mississippi (33%).
""As Apple doubles down on premium models and introduces the slimmer iPhone Air, our data shows just how fragmented the U.S. market remains,"" said Omer Peled, Start.io's VP of Product. ""Consumers in some states are eager to adopt the latest devices, while others stick with legacy models. The iPhone 17 will be a litmus test of whether Apple can accelerate upgrades across the board or whether the divide between premium adopters and everyday users will continue to grow.""

This is a fair description. But it also obscures the fact DeFi actually unifies many elements of finance, says Arjun Sethi, the co-CEO of Kraken and the featured guest on the newest episode of Fortune’s Crypto Playbook vodcast (available on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube).
In a wide-ranging discussion on Kraken’s latest tokenization efforts, Sethi made the point that banks have historically sought to create walled gardens of financial services—storing assets, selling, lending and so on. They will typically work with favored partners to do this, but the customer has no say over who handles many of the behind-the-scenes transactions.
This changes with DeFi, said Sethi, who pointed out that the technology is a series of open protocols that lets customers control who does what with their assets. These protocols work together seamlessly so, while these tools are decentralized, they also unify the financial stack in an unprecedented way.
“What you are able to do is to defragment what you have across all these traditional financial markets,” said Sethi. “I think that’s the piece that people lose when we talk about decentralized finance.”
While DeFi tools offer enormous opportunities, they have largely remained beyond the realm of ordinary consumers due to the complexity of accessing them. This is beginning to change, however, as companies like Kraken are building interfaces that let consumers use DeFi in a manner that feels more like a traditional bank or brokerage.
Kraken’s recent offerings include xStocks, which are tokenized shares of popular companies like Apple or Tesla. Sethi says xStocks have already found huge appeal in markets like South Africa and Argentina because DeFi technology lets Kraken make them available without the fees tagged on by middlemen—fees that can make purchasing the stock cost 10% or 15% higher than the underlying price.
The DeFi element of xStocks also mean that the tokenized shares can be bought and sold not just on Kraken’s site, but on any platform that incorporates the appropriate protocols—a dramatic change from traditional brokerages.
xStocks is currently available in numerous overseas markets and in Europe, and will be offered in the U.S. by early next year. Right now, Kraken is offering the shares of around 50 companies, but Sethi says this will soon be expanded to 100 and then 1000 popular stocks."

But Oppenheimer analysts argue the product does not yet represent a meaningful challenge to Apple’s tightly integrated hardware ecosystem.
“The obvious questions for Apple investors are: 1) is Meta Ray-Ban Display a threat to Apple’s ecosystem around iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch? And 2) is Meta leapfrogging Apple in smart glasses design?” Oppenheimer wrote.
“Upon closer inspection of Ray-Ban Display’s specification and discussion with MR supply chain contacts, our answer to both questions is no.”
According to Oppenheimer, the device is not yet a full hardware “platform,” as Meta is not offering an SDK for third-party developers.
Instead, the glasses rely on pairing with a smartphone, primarily running Meta’s own applications and displaying notifications from third-party apps.
The firm added that supply chain checks also suggest Meta has leaned on off-the-shelf components, with Omnivision supplying the LCoS microdisplay and Lumus providing reflective waveguides. This contrasts with Meta’s Orion project, which involved more proprietary technologies.
Volume expectations remain modest. Oppenheimer estimates “near-term unit volume of the ‘tens of thousands’ upon release, and a unit sales forecast of 150–200K units over the next two years.”
Weight could also limit adoption, with the 67g form factor still above what most users find comfortable. “While Ray-Ban Display at $800 is an impressive step toward bringing smart glasses to the mainstream, its weight remains an uncomfortable burden for most,” the analysts said.
Oppenheimer concluded: “Meta Ray-Ban Display is an interesting product … however, it is still far from being able to challenge Apple’s wearable device ecosystem.”

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.
Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Apple (AAPL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AAPL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Apple's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Apple's main business drivers.
Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. The Services portfolio that includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services now contributes a significant part of revenues.
The non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPods continue to gain traction. In fact, Apple dominates the Wearables and Hearables markets due to the growing adoption of Watch and AirPods. Solid uptake of Apple Watch has helped Apple strengthen its presence in the personal health monitoring space.
Apple is expanding its non-iPhone portfolio with the launch of Apple Vision Pro a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world.
Headquartered in Cupertino, CA, Apple also designs, manufactures and sells iPad, MacBook and HomePod. These devices are powered by software applications including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems.
Apple’s other services include subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, the new Apple TV app, Apple TV channels and Apple TV+, a new subscription service.
In fiscal 2024, Apple generated $391.04 billion in total revenues. The company’s flagship device iPhone accounted for 51.4% of total revenues. The Services, Mac and iPad categories contributed 24.6%, 7.7% and 6.8%, respectively. The Wearables, Home and Accessories products category contributed 9.5%.
Apple primarily reports revenues on a geographic basis, namely the Americas (North & South America), Europe (European countries, India, Middle East and Africa), Greater China (China, Hong Kong & Taiwan), Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific (Australia & other Asian Countries).
In fiscal 2024, Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific accounted for 42.7%, 25.9%, 17.1%, 6.4% and 7.8% of total revenues, respectively.
Apple faces stiff competition from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Google, Huawei and Motorola in the smartphone market. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer and Asus are its primary competitors in the PC market. Other notable competitors are Google & Amazon (smart speakers) and Fitbit & Xiaomi (wearables)."

The adapters ensure that owners of the SeaTouch 4 Max Plus and SeaTouch 4 Max Platinum underwater housings can utilize the full potential of the new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max from day one.
On September 9th, Apple unveiled its highly anticipated iPhone 17 lineup at the ""Awe Dropping"" event. Powered by the new A19 series chips and featuring a groundbreaking camera system, the series is rightfully being called the most powerful iPhone ever created. DIVEVOLK’s rapid response reaffirms its commitment to keeping its users on the cutting edge of technology.
For existing owners of the SeaTouch 4 Max Plus and Platinum housings, this announcement highlights the value of DIVEVOLK’s modular design. Rather than needing to purchase an entirely new housing, users can simply acquire the new iPhone 17 series adapter module, making the upgrade path both cost-effective and sustainable.
“DIVEVOLK is committed to empowering divers to capture the underwater world with the very best technology,” said a DIVEVOLK engineer. “Our adapter modules ensure a seamless upgrade path, allowing our users to immediately harness the power of the iPhone 17 without needing to replace their trusted gear.”
With the SeaTouch housing providing full touchscreen control at depths up to 60 meters (200 ft), divers are perfectly equipped for any underwater environment. When paired with accessories like the DIVEVOLK +18 Macro Lens, the iPhone 17’s enhanced macro capabilities can produce results comparable to professional setups, capturing the intricate textures of an anemone or a tiny shrimp.
A Diver's Dream: A Deep Dive into the iPhone 17's New Features
The iPhone 17 series introduces a suite of upgrades that represent a quantum leap for underwater creators. Here are the key features and what they mean for your next dive:
-
Upgraded 48MP Main & Ultra-Wide Cameras on All Models: In a massive step up, all iPhone 17 models now feature 48-megapixel sensors for the Main and Ultra-Wide cameras. This delivers unprecedented detail and clarity whether you’re shooting a vast coral reef or a portrait of your dive buddy. The Pro models take it further with a dedicated 48MP Telephoto lens, achieving top-tier image quality across every focal length.
-
Fused Camera System & Pro-Level Optical-Quality Zoom: The new fused camera system says goodbye to lossy digital cropping. The iPhone 17 Pro series achieves a stunning 0.5x to 8x optical-quality zoom range, allowing divers to capture sharp, detailed images of shy marine life from a distance without sacrificing quality.
-
18MP Front Camera with Center Stage: The front camera gets a major upgrade to 18MP with a new square sensor. Combined with Center Stage, it allows you to switch from vertical to horizontal framing on the fly, making it perfect for capturing incredible group selfies with your dive buddies underwater.
-
Dual Capture Video: This revolutionary feature enables recording from a front and rear camera simultaneously. Imagine filming a majestic whale shark in front of you while also capturing your own priceless reaction in the same video file—it’s a whole new dimension of storytelling.
-
Brighter, Larger Super Retina XDR Displays: The entire iPhone 17 lineup features brighter, more vibrant Super Retina XDR displays with ProMotion. The increased brightness and new anti-glare coatings make it easier than ever to frame shots in challenging underwater lighting. The iPhone 17 Pro Max leads the pack with a massive 6.9-inch screen, providing an unparalleled canvas for viewing macro details."

The stock has delivered eye-catching results over the last few years, and if you are wondering what to do next, the decision has never been more intriguing. After a jaw-dropping five-year run that put Broadcom shares up almost 1,000%, plus a 49.2% gain year-to-date, it is no surprise that this company keeps popping up in conversations about tech growth leaders. But hold on, Broadcom’s recent swings have added some uncertainty to the mix. The shares dipped 6.3% over the last week, in part after news broke that Apple will roll out its own in-house chip, potentially reducing its reliance on Broadcom for key wireless components. At the same time, exciting headlines like OpenAI moving forward with Broadcom as a chip design partner mean opportunities are still very much alive, and competition for major contracts remains fierce.
It is only natural to look for clarity about whether Broadcom remains a compelling buy, especially with leadership selling shares and the market trying to price in everything from supply chain drama to explosive AI demand. For those interested in valuation, though, the numbers right now are pretty stark: Broadcom’s valuation score is 0 out of 6. That means the company is not considered undervalued by any of the six major checks we look at. Of course, these metrics only tell part of the story. Next, let us break down exactly how these valuation checks work and see where Broadcom lands, and why the best way to judge value might not be what you expect.
Broadcom scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: Broadcom Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company’s true value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to reflect today’s value. This approach helps investors understand whether a stock price is justified by expected future performance, rather than hype or short-term swings.
For Broadcom, the current Free Cash Flow (FCF) over the last twelve months is a strong $24.8 Billion. Analyst forecasts extend over the next five years, with the model extrapolating from there. By 2035, Free Cash Flow is expected to reach approximately $105.2 Billion. These substantial cash flows are calculated in US Dollars, offering a clear look at what Broadcom could be generating a decade from now.
Despite the impressive projected growth in FCF, the current DCF analysis places Broadcom’s estimated intrinsic value at $220.70 per share. With the latest market prices well above this level, the model implies the stock is currently 56.8% overvalued."

Investors closely parsed Fed chair Jerome Powell’s remarks, which hinted at the potential for more rapid monetary easing over the next year.
On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 11-1 to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, with Trump ally Stephen Miran dissenting in favor of a deeper half-point cut. The Fed’s latest projections point to two more cuts this year, which would bring the federal funds target range down to 3.50%–3.75% by December.
October is historically a strong month for bitcoin
Crypto investors highlighted the seasonal pattern that often favours bitcoin during this stretch of the annual calendar.
“Since 2020, every September FOMC (except during the 2022 bear) has set bitcoin (BTC-USD) up for a massive pump,” entrepreneur and bitcoin investor Lark Davis wrote on X. “It’s less about the decision itself, and more about seasonality. Bitcoin thrives in this stretch. Uptober is real.”

Ethereum (ETH-USD) gained 1% over the past 24 hours, but still remains trapped in a four-week band under the $4,900 mark.
Other major cryptocurrencies have advanced, with dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Binance’s BNB (BNB-EUR) token both up more than 4%, while XRP (XRP-USD) rose nearly 3% following a bullish breakout pattern.
Solana briefly topped $245, rising by almost 4% as optimism grew around CME Group’s plan to launch SOL and XRP options on October 13, a move seen as opening the door to greater institutional involvement.
Still, not all observers were convinced the Fed’s latest cut was a clear positive. “The weakening labor market ultimately convinced the FOMC to cut the rate, but this decision is not a clear positive with recent data showing inflation well above the Fed’s 2% target,” said Jai Kedia, research fellow at the Cato Institute. “Monetary policy rules would advocate keeping rates steady or even a minor increase.”

- U.S Steel (now owned by Nippon Steel) became the world's first $1 billion enterprise in 1901.
- General Motors rode the automotive boom to beat every other company to the $10 billion milestone in 1955.
- General Electric built a conglomerate that became the world's first $100 billion business in 1995.
- Apple crossed the most significant milestone of all in 2018, when successful products like the iPhone catapulted the company to a $1 trillion valuation.
There are now nine American companies with valuations of at least $1 trillion, and four of them have graduated into the ultra-exclusive $3 trillion club: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet (GOOG 1.73%) (GOOGL 1.66%).
Alphabet is the newest member, having officially joined on Monday, Sept. 15. It's the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and more, all of which are being supercharged by artificial intelligence (AI).
Its stock is in the neighborhood of a record high right now, but its attractive valuation suggests more upside could be on the way. Read on.
Google Search turned AI from a threat into a tailwind
Wall Street expects Alphabet to generate a record $394 billion in total revenue during 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. Google Search is likely to account for more than half of that figure on its own, so it's the company's most important segment by far.
When AI chatbots like ChatGPT went mainstream two years ago, investors feared they would drive internet traffic away from Google Search because they offered a faster, more convenient way to find information online. However, Alphabet mounted an aggressive response to protect its golden goose.
The company developed a family of large language models (LLMs) called Gemini -- and its own chatbot, which bears the same name -- to compete with start-ups like OpenAI. And those LLMs also power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews, which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to create more comprehensive answers to search queries.
Overviews appear above the traditional Google results, so users no longer have to spend time sifting through web pages to find the information they need. Over 2 billion people are using them every month, and Alphabet says they generate advertising revenue at roughly the same rate as regular Google Search outputs, so they aren't hurting the company's core business.
Google Search's revenue growth actually accelerated from 9.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to 11.7% during the second quarter, suggesting the business is building momentum, not slowing down. This offers some proof that AI Overviews are having the desired effect.
Google Cloud is Alphabet's growth engine
Google Search might be Alphabet's biggest business, but Google Cloud is the fastest growing. It generated a record $13.6 billion in revenue during the second quarter, which was up 32% year over year. That growth rate accelerated from 28% in the first quarter.
Google Cloud operates state-of-the-art data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers such as Nvidia, and it rents the computing capacity to developers, which use it to build AI software. The platform also offers access to hundreds of ready-made LLMs, including Gemini, which developers can use to accelerate their progress. Over 85,000 organizations are now using Gemini to create AI software.
This business still has plenty of room to grow because it had a $106 billion order backlog at the end of the second quarter, from customers waiting for more data center capacity to come online. That was up 38% year over year, so based on Google Cloud's revenue growth during the quarter, demand appears to be increasing even faster than supply.
The stock still looks cheap
The U.S. Department of Justice won a lawsuit against Alphabet last year, which determined that the company used monopolistic practices to safeguard its market share in the internet search industry. For example, Alphabet paid Apple enormous annual fees to make Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone, making it almost impossible for other search engines to compete.
Lawmakers sought to break up Alphabet by forcing it to sell certain assets, which could have significantly disrupted the company's ability to generate revenue. Its valuation has been suppressed for the last couple of years while this saga played out, as investors braced for the worst.
But earlier this month, the judge in the case handed down a rather lenient decision that will allow management to continue paying partners like Apple, as long as the deals aren't exclusive. He also declined to support the Justice Department's proposed breakup.
Alphabet stock has surged by almost 20% since the ruling, which catapulted the company into the $3 trillion club. But with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 26.8, it's still the cheapest stock in the ""Magnificent Seven"" (a group of peers operating at the forefront of the AI industry), as shown in the chart below.
For that reason, I think Alphabet stock still has plenty of room to run."

The stock had a five-day winning streak after slumping in the wake of last week’s product unveiling, which included a thinner iPhone that failed to generate much excitement. Behind the rebound is optimism that more expensive phones — like the top-of-the-line Pro model that retails for as much as $1,999 — could support Apple’s revenue growth even if customers don’t rush to upgrade.
Average selling prices for iPhones, which account for more than half of Apple’s revenue, are expected to rise about 4% in fiscal 2026 compared with an expansion of 1.5% in 2025, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. That comes after nearly a decade in which prices throughout the iPhone lineup were largely flat.
“Prices are being really increased for the first time in several years, so if we see a typical replacement cycle with higher prices, plus some progress on AI, that may not be an exciting setup for the stock, but it’s a decent one,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which has $33 billion in assets under management.
Apple shares slipped 0.3% on Thursday.
Apple shares have rallied in the past two months amid easing tariff risks, but the stock is still lagging behind Big Tech peers as the company struggles to deploy AI features. The stock is down almost 4% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the Nasdaq 100 Index.
Sluggish sales growth has long been a sticking point for Apple. While its most recent results featured the fastest expansion in quarterly revenue in more than three years, they’re still expected to rise just 6% in the current fiscal year and next. That’s less than half the revenue growth expected for the S&P 500 tech sector in 2025 and 2026, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
At the same time, Apple trades at 30 times estimated earnings, nearly 50% above its 10-year average. The multiple is in line with Nvidia Corp. and higher than Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc., all of which boast faster revenue growth.
The combination of a pricey valuation, tepid growth and lack of innovation has pushed analyst sentiment on the shares to a five-year low, with buy ratings barely outnumbering hold and sell ratings."

Is It Worth a Look?","He sold high-flying Apple stock instead, but why?",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1cf63ad5828fac84eb223b8310dfb61e95ae741b4c7d74ff3c99f869fccb28b9,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/warren-buffett-isnt-selling-coca-cola-stock-despit/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/warren-buffett-isnt-selling-coca-cola-stock-despit/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/warren-buffett-isnt-selling-coca-cola-stock-despit/,fool.com,200,,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett has made some surprising moves during his tenure at Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.15%) (BRK.B -0.37%).
One of these moves was buying Apple (AAPL 0.78%) stock in 2016, despite famously avoiding technology stocks because he considered them outside his area of expertise. Another was selling a big chunk of his Apple holdings this year, despite its market-crushing returns.
Even as he was selling a big chunk of his big winner Apple, Buffett hung on to his entire stake in Coca-Cola (KO -0.22%), which has been one of his worst performers lately. Does Buffett know something we don't? Should investors consider following the ""Oracle of Omaha"" into a position?
A massive stake
Buffett's stake in Coca-Cola is huge. Berkshire Hathaway owns 400 million shares of the beverage giant, with a current market value of $28.3 billion. That represents 11% of Berkshire's entire stock holdings.
Coca-Cola is roughly tied with Bank of America (BAC 4.88%) as the third-largest position in Berkshire's stock portfolio, behind its longtime $48.4 billion stake in American Express (AXP 0.29%) at No. 2. Buffett's aforementioned Apple position, currently worth $57.4 billion, is still his top holding, even after he sold 20 million shares in the second quarter.
Berkshire first bought Coca-Cola shares in 1988, and continued buying through 1994, at which point Buffett had invested $1.3 billion in the company. Just over 30 years later, not only are his shares worth more than 21 times what he paid for them, he'll rake in $816 million in dividend payments -- more than 60% of his initial investment -- this year alone. That's one amazing set of returns!
But what have you done for me lately?
Coca-Cola may be one of Buffett's biggest holdings, but recently it certainly hasn't been one of the best. If we look at the performance of Buffett's biggest holdings since the time he bought Apple in 2016, there's a clear winner and a clear loser.
| Stock/Index | Total Returns Since 3/31/2016 |
|---|---|
| Apple | 846.5% |
| American Express | 507.3% |
| Bank of America | 361.5% |
| S&P 500 Index | 276.7% |
| Berkshire Hathaway | 248% |
| Coca-Cola | 93.4% |
Yes, if Buffett had sold his Coca-Cola stock and put the money into any one of his other top holdings -- or even just used it to buy back Berkshire shares, or invest in an S&P 500 index fund -- he would have had astronomically better returns. Incidentally, it doesn't matter if you go back a few more years: Coca-Cola's returns -- on both a total return basis and a straight price basis -- have lagged the others all the way back to the Great Recession (at which point Coca-Cola finally starts outperforming Bank of America only).
So, why does Buffett keep hanging on to this longtime dud, and what does it mean for the rest of us?
Great for dividends, not for growth
Warren Buffett is a big fan of Coke as a beverage. In 2023, he claimed to drink five Cokes a day, and said he would rather give up a year of his life than stop doing so. However, he's also a big fan of Coca-Cola as a reliable, well-managed business.
In his 1988 letter to shareholders, Buffett extolled Coca-Cola's business model, saying of the company: ""[W]hen we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever."" In his 2022 letter, he focused on the dividend-paying power of Coca-Cola:
The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke's quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to [continue to] grow.
Buffett is right about that. As a Dividend King, Coca-Cola is likely to continue increasing its dividend payouts every year, even though its yield is already an above-average 3%. Investors looking for stability and a rock-solid dividend can't do much better than Coca-Cola.

Is It a Buy?,This company just received fantastic news.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c88f8570b3036be157a2332b950f5cc3e18536503265c0e64154b06be5b02dbf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/this-ai-stock-just-joined-3-trillion-club/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/this-ai-stock-just-joined-3-trillion-club/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/this-ai-stock-just-joined-3-trillion-club/,fool.com,200,,"A few years ago, Apple reigned as the world's biggest company, with Microsoft close behind. But the artificial intelligence (AI) boom upset those rankings, helping AI giant Nvidia to zoom ahead into the top spot, with a market value of more than $4 trillion. In recent days, another AI player has seen its market value increase, pushing it into the $3 trillion club with Apple and Microsoft.
Of course, this isn't actually a real club with membership rules and benefits, but rather a way of referring to the few companies that have reached such an enormous market capitalization. It's important to note that all these players are in the tech industry, and each is involved in AI to a certain degree. Let's take a look at this new addition to the exclusive group of $3 trillion stocks and find out whether it's one to buy.
Billion-dollar earnings
So, which company has passed the key level of $3 trillion, bringing it closer to market giants Apple and Microsoft? I'm talking about Alphabet (GOOG 1.73%) (GOOGL 1.66%), owner of something you probably use every day -- the world's No. 1 search engine, Google. On top of this, Alphabet is the parent of high-growth cloud business Google Cloud and generates revenue through the sale of hardware such as smartphones. All these businesses have helped Alphabet deliver billion-dollar revenue and profit quarter after quarter.
Alphabet has also become a key player in the field of AI, offering a vast number of services through Google Cloud, which has supercharged that unit's revenue in recent years. In the latest quarter, the company reported that cloud revenue soared 32% to more than $13 billion, boosted by AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions.
The company has been using AI itself to make gains across its Google Search business, too. For example, Alphabet's large language model (LLM) Gemini is improving advertisements across the platform to generate better results. Considering ads are Alphabet's biggest revenue driver, this is an important move that may prompt advertisers to spend more.
An antitrust lawsuit
This paints a very bright picture, but in recent times, one particular risk darkened the image: a U.S. antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet. A district court ruled last year that Alphabet's Google was an illegal monopoly, and the U.S. Justice Department recommended a breakup of Google. Though many investors (including myself) didn't expect this worst-case scenario to unfold, the possibility still represented a headwind for the stock.
Earlier this month, though, a district judge ruled that Alphabet wouldn't be ordered to sell Google's Chrome browser or the Android operating system. Instead, the decision ordered Alphabet to share search data with rivals. Removing the worst scenario from the landscape, the decision drove Alphabet shares higher and helped the company's market value advance past $3 trillion.
Now, let's return to our question: Following this much-awaited outcome, is now a good time to buy Alphabet stock? As mentioned, Alphabet's businesses are going strong -- and the latest court ruling suggests this trend will continue. The company's leadership in search, along with its use of AI, should keep ad revenue climbing, and overall demand for AI is set to power Alphabet's cloud revenue growth.
The cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" stock
Alphabet's recent gain in market value alone isn't a reason to buy the stock, but the other positive points I've mentioned all add to the buy case for this stock. ""But what about price?"" you might ask. Even though Alphabet's valuation had increased, it remains reasonable at 25 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock is still the cheapest among all the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- these are the tech players that have driven market gains over the past two years.
Alphabet's valuation today, despite the recent share price performance, also supports the idea of getting in on this tech player.
Of course, Alphabet faces competition in the cloud business, and the company must continue to invest heavily to meet the needs of AI customers. But this tech player has the strength to do so and is well positioned to be among the AI winners as this growth story continues. All this means that today, after the biggest headwind has subsided, is the perfect time to buy Alphabet shares."

Traders digested news from the Bank of England (BoE) on their latest policy decision, which kept rates unchanged at 4% as expected.
Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England said interest rates must be cut “gradually and carefully” after voting to hold borrowing costs. Members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) were split 7-2 on the decision, with Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor backing a quarter of a percentage point reduction.
Bailey said: “We held interest rates at 4% today. Although we expect inflation to return to our 2% target, we’re not out of the woods yet so any future cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.”

It comes as the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the rate to its lowest level for more than two years at its last meeting in August. However, analysts believe there will be no further cuts this year.
Money markets have increasingly priced out the possibility of another cut in 2025, assigning less than a 30% chance of a reduction before year-end. Most traders now anticipate the next move will come in April 2026 at the earliest.
Additionally, the MPC also decided to dial back the speed of its “quantitative tightening” (QT) programme, to £70bn over the next year. That’s down from £100bn over the last 12 months. City economists had expected the QT programme to be cut to around £70bn, so the decision fell in line with forecasts.

LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 22 updatesBank of England slows quantitative tightening in boost for Rachel Reeves
The Bank of England (BoE) has reduced its quantitative tightening (QT) envelope from £100bn to £70bn with a broad landing zone of £65-75bn.
The move comes as a potential boost for Rachel Reeves ahead of her November budget amid concerns the bank was pushing up borrowing costs by smothering the bond market with UK debt.
The bank's quantitative tightening programme influences how much money the chancellor will have to keep the public finances in balance, adding to the cost of servicing the national debt.
A slowdown in how fast the BoE reduces its balance sheet could help lower yields on bond markets, which is the return that issuers of debt, such as the Treasury, must pay to buyers.
Under the QT programme, Threadneedle Street has been selling some of the government bonds it bought during the financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.
It will lower its stock of UK government bond purchases by £70bn over the next year, taking its total to £488bn. Since 2022, the BoE has reduced its gilt holdings from £875bn to £558bn.
The monetary policy committee (MPC) was split over its decision to slow the pace of its bond-selling programme on Thursday.
Seven MPC members, Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor, voted in favour of cutting its UK government bond purchases by £70bn over the next year.
However, Catherine Mann wanted a larger slowdown in QT, cutting sales to £62bn over the next year.
Chief economist Huw Pill voted to cut stocks by £100bn, meaning the same pace of reduction as over the last 12 months.

WATERLOO, ONTARIO / ACCESS Newswire / September 18, 2025 / BlackBerry Limited today announced it is the first mobile device management (MDM) vendor to be certified by the German Federal Office for Information Security, BSI, certification program for the use of BlackBerry® Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) for MDM on Apple® Indigo (iOS® native devices in government operations) and Samsung Knox® devices. This enables government organizations to continue implementing projects to secure government data on employee iOS and Samsung Knox devices. The BSI issued a certification ID (BSI-DSZ-CC-1235-2025) for BlackBerry UEM against rigorous testing conditions conforming to Common Criteria's high assurance level for Trusted MDM and Trusted Communication Channel (TCC). This certification builds upon the BSI approval previously granted to BlackBerry® SecuSUITE® applications for Secure Mobile Communications, reaffirming their compliance with rigorous secure, encrypted communications standards.
BlackBerry is now the only vendor approved to operate secure mobile communications for device management, secure voice, and apps within the German government and its agencies. This ensures that these entities do not need to rely on ineffective point solutions which could inherently be insecure.
BlackBerry has a strong commitment to achieving and maintaining government and enterprise security accreditations including those that allow it to operate within classified and restricted environments.
BSI requires that Apple Indigo and Samsung Knox devices meet the strictest security standards to handle classified information. Achieving this requires an Endpoint Management solution that can guarantee the secure configuration of devices and secure transfer of highly confidential data (Verschlusssache, nur für den Dienstgebrauch, VS-NfD) to mobile devices. The German government and critical industry agencies have confidently adopted BlackBerry UEM as the trusted foundation for deploying iOS and Samsung Knox devices to employees, ensuring unparalleled security and compliance.
The key to this achievement is BlackBerry's proven track record with on-premise deployments, used by governments worldwide. BlackBerry's NOC/BBI-centric approach allows BlackBerry to meet and exceed the need for Brightsite deployments for Apple Indigo and Samsung Knox that offer the security and flexibility demanded by BSI.
""Having a secure and trusted mobile device strategy is essential for ensuring operational success in today's government and critical infrastructure environments,"" said Nathan Jenniges, Senior Vice President and General Manager, BlackBerry Secure Communications. ""With BlackBerry UEM becoming the first MDM solution to achieve the BSI certification, German government entities and Critical National Infrastructure organizations can confidently support mobile device choice for their users while maintaining full compliance and adhering to the highest standards of confidentiality."""

Data from consumer body Which? showed that Tui (TUI1.DE) was the worst for punctuality, with the lowest average percentage of on-time departures. In 2024-25, an average of 59.2% of Tui's departures were on time, a drop from the 67.2% average from back in 2019.
Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) came in second-worst, with only 66% of flights on time, and Ryanair (RYA.IR) third, with only 66.5% of flights departing on time.
Next comes easyJet (EZJ.L), with punctuality at the airline coming in at 67.8%. Jet2 (JET2.L) recorded 68% of flights leaving on time in 2024-25, and British Airways (IAG.L) was the most on-time company on the list, with 68.7% of flights leaving on time.
Naomi Leach, deputy editor of Which? Travel said: “Our analysis shows that many airlines are less punctual than before the pandemic, which will come as no surprise to those travellers who have experienced delays.
“Airlines need to improve how they communicate with and support passengers during delays ensuring they inform travellers about their right to claim compensation.

“Thousands of travellers could be entitled to compensation if they have faced delays, so it is always worth putting a claim in with your airline and escalating the complaint if it refuses to pay compensation.”
Which? reviewed departure data from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA defines a flight as on time if it departs within 15 minutes of its scheduled time.
Travellers are entitled to compensation if their flight arrives three or more hours late. However, they are unlikely to receive any remuneration if the delay is not due to the airline. For example, bad weather or security issues.
The amount of compensation customers receive changes depending on the length of delay and the journey distance.
-
For delays of three hours or more getting to your destination less than 1,500km away, it is £220.
-
For delays of three hours or more between 1,500km and 3,500km, it is £350.
-
For delays of four hours or more and over 3,500km, it is £520.
If the delay reaches five hours, you do not have to board the plane.
If you do not board, Citizens Advice say the airline has to provide: a full refund for the flight, and a full refund for other flights from the airline that you won't use in the same booking, eg. an onward or return flight.
If you are part-way through a journey, they should provide a flight back to the airport you originally departed from."

Speaking at the company’s annual Meta Connect event, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Meta’s future glasses will be a vehicle for “superintelligence,” a term he has adopted to describe advanced artificial intelligence development and the name of a team inside the company.
“AI should serve people, not just be something that sits in a data center, automating large parts of society,” he said Wednesday from the stage at Meta’s Menlo Park, California headquarters.
For smart glasses — or AI glasses, as Meta now calls them — a display is key. The addition, over time, could allow consumers to offload some functionality to their eyewear that they would normally expect their phones to handle.
In an interview ahead of their launch, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth called the new glasses “the first serious product” in the space. This launch is a key part of Meta’s effort to build its own consumer electronics ecosystem, positioning itself against rivals like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Since debuting its first virtual reality headset in 2016, Meta has aimed to attract users away from the dominant platforms.
“This feels like the kind of thing where you can start to keep your phone in your pocket more and more throughout the day,” Bosworth said. He added that the phone isn’t going away, but glasses offer a more convenient way to access its most popular features.
The glasses introduce a new control system. While users can still swipe along the frame as with previous models, the primary interface is now hand gestures, detected by a neural wristband strapped around the wearer’s dominant hand.
The user can select items by pinching their thumb and index finger, swipe through items by sliding a thumb across their gripped hand, double tap their thumb to invoke Meta’s AI voice assistant, or twist their hand mid-air to adjust music volume and other controls."

Claiming the top spot in notional short is mainly related to Nvidia’s surging market capitalization, the report highlights.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) maintains its position as the second-largest short position by notional dollar value at $32.7 billion, while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) (NASDAQ:MSFT) has moved into third place at $30.6 billion, the report indicates. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in fourth at $27.7 billion in notional short interest.
The rankings represent a significant shift in market capitalization from the beginning of 2025, when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the group at $3.9 trillion but has since experienced a 9% decline in valuation, dropping it to third place in market capitalization. Nvidia, which was previously tied with Microsoft for second place in market cap, has surged 30% in market cap to claim the top position at $4.3 trillion. Microsoft sits second at $3.8 trillion. Despite this increase, Nvidia’s short interest percentage of float has decreased by 11%, while Microsoft and Tesla have each seen increases of approximately 20% in this metric.
The research highlights notable changes in volatility across these major technology stocks. Tesla has become 22% less volatile, while Nvidia has experienced a 15% volatility decline, contributing to a 25% reduction in its daily risk exposure. Using recent volatility measurements, Nvidia’s volatility has decreased to levels comparable to non-technology stocks.
S3 Partners’ analysis reveals a strong inverse relationship between stock returns and short interest percentage of float across these four companies, which creates a degree of stability in notional calculations by making them less sensitive to volatility in either component.

“Today, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine to deter aggression,” the king said while offering a toast at the event, capping a day of pageantry designed to strengthen a US-UK alliance enduring economic and security headwinds.

“In striving for a better world, we also have a precious opportunity to safeguard and restore the wonders and beauty of nature for the generations who follow us,” Charles continued.
Trump nodded along as Charles spoke, but the comments — hitting on two areas where he has broken with other allies — were particularly notable given how the state dinner was designed to curry favor with the US president and the king’s traditional restraint from engaging in political issues.
The king emphasized the longstanding bonds between the nations and became the latest leader to flatter Trump’s love of golf. “I understand that British soil makes a rather splendid golf course,” he said, referencing Trump’s properties in the UK.
The trappings of the event — from a string orchestra that played Trump playlist favorites from Elton John and the Rolling Stones to a 1945 vintage port intended to honor the 45th American president — underscored the efforts at flattery.
But the guest list of the event nodded to the work that Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who are set to meet Thursday, face as they attempt to bring the special relationship back onto stronger footing. Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang, Blackstone Inc. CEO Steve Schwarzman, Arm Ltd CEO Rene Haas, and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch were among 160 guests listed to attend the banquet, and the nations are set to solidify joint tech, energy and digital asset agreements.
US and UK officials have said they expect to roll out economic deals worth billions of dollars to coincide with the visit, with artificial intelligence data centers and nuclear plants to help power them high on the agenda. The UK government is touting a £150 billion ($205 billion) investment package led by the promise of £90 billion from Blackstone Inc. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI and other American companies also announced plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on technology infrastructure in the UK."

Cramer has continued to dismiss negativity surrounding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and asserted that the firm is ushering in a new industrial revolution.

This time, he discussed the general sentiment surrounding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the firm’s relationship with EDA firm Synopsys:
“And of course, NVIDIA. . .but NVIDIA is one of those stocks that has gone so out of favor, that literally, there are people who are afraid to take it up.

Apple (AAPL, Financials) smartphone sales in China fell 6% in the weeks leading up to the iPhone 17 launch, according to Counterpoint Research. The decline was steeper than the usual slowdown that comes before a new model release.
The weakness was part of a broader market trend. China's overall smartphone sales slipped 2% year over year during the first eight weeks of the third quarter, despite government subsidies aimed at boosting consumption. Rival brands Xiaomi, Vivo and Honor also posted declines, while Huawei grew its share on the back of new product rollouts.
Analysts expect China's smartphone market to post slightly negative growth in the third quarter and remain flat for 2025 overall. For Apple, Greater China remains its second-largest national market and a key source of revenue, but competitive pressure has increased.
Some analysts say Apple's iPhone 17 failed to deliver major innovations, leaving few catalysts for mass upgrades. Within China's top five smartphone makers, Apple has been the second-biggest market share loser this year, according to Counterpoint."

But according to Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder and CEO of battery materials manufacturer Sila, the real breakthrough might lurk elsewhere inside the aluminum and glass enclosure.
“The battery in the new iPhone is pretty remarkable,” Berdichevsky told TechCrunch. “The completely arbitrary, two-dimensional shape — you look at the shape, and it’s pretty amazing.”
“I just got back from Asia and, and I got a chance to see some of these cells,” he added. “It’s a revolutionary piece of battery tech.”
Berdichevsky knows a thing or two about batteries. As Tesla’s seventh employee, he led engineering on the original Roadster’s battery, which became the template for subsequent Teslas. Today, he leads Sila, which is producing silicon anode materials for consumer electronics and, soon, electric vehicles.
The iPhone Air’s notched design is made possible by a technology Apple has patented called a metal can battery. The key detail is in the name: a metal casing that surrounds the entire cell, adding strength and physical durability. Most batteries used in consumer electronics are pouch cells, which have a soft plastic casing that’s cheap to manufacture and allows for some degree of swelling.
Apple has used L-shaped batteries in iPhones for years. All lithium ion batteries swell to some degree, and the interior corner of the L becomes a pinch points when that swelling occurs.
“Those are very finicky, and this basically makes it bulletproof. You can now build batteries in any two-dimensional shape you want,” Berdichevsky said.
Metal can batteries allow Apple to make the most of the small space within the iPhone Air. “They’re able get very close to the edges,” he said. It allows the battery to worm its way into whatever space is free after the various circuit boards have been positioned.
Ultimately, Berdichevsky thinks that most phones will adopt metal can batteries despite their added expense. The extra energy storage will be worth it.
It will also be “very key” for smaller devices like AR and VR glasses, he said, adding that he saw a few prototypes while he was in China. “It’s even more of an energy density improvement because it lets you fit into weird shapes,” Berdichevsky said.
The switch to such a complex battery is likely why Apple hasn’t swapped carbon anodes in its lithium ion batteries for silicon-heavy versions, also known as silicon-carbon.
“If you’re bringing [a new battery design] online, you kind of go, ‘You know what? Let’s use yesterday’s chemistry,’” Berdichevsky said."

Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, shared his thoughts on diversification, advising investors not to diversify if they are right.
Scaramucci: Don't Trade Apple Or Bitcoin For Mediocrity
Scaramucci, on his YouTube channel, used the example of Warren Buffett‘s investment in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to explain his point. Scaramucci pointed out that when Apple became 50% of Buffett’s portfolio, he didn’t rush to diversify. Instead, he held onto his position, refusing to trade it for several smaller investments in the name of diversification.
“You don’t trade Apple for four scrubs and call it diversification,” Scaramucci remarked.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
Scaramucci used a basketball analogy to further illustrate his point, quoting Buffet’s words from a ’90s annual report, “Well, in the name of diversification, I’m going to trade Michael Jordan for four mediocre basketball players. Is that what I’m doing?”
“There’s diversification and there’s diworsification,” explained Scaramucci.
He also gave the example of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), stating that if someone advises an investor to diversify their Bitcoin holdings, the investor should not feel pressured to do so. “The answer to that question is no, you don’t need to diversify.”

Scaramucci Echoes Charlie Munger But Dalio Differs
Scaramucci’s advice is in line with the investment strategies of other renowned figures. The late Charlie Munger, for instance, had a concentrated approach to investing, with his family’s entire portfolio consisting of just three major holdings. Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK), was vocal about his approach, calling diversification a strategy for people who know nothing.
On the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has emphasized the importance of diversification in achieving investment success. Dalio, the former CEO of Bridgewater Associates, has highlighted diversification as the most important thing to do in order to invest well. His macroeconomic viewpoint has led him to concentrate on broader asset classes such as sovereign bonds and commodities.
Buffett himself has made some of the largest acquisitions during his time leading Berkshire Hathaway, indicating a profound diversification strategy. His biggest acquisitions highlight a strong focus on sectors such as utilities, railroads, insurance, and energy."

The analyst noted that his bullish sentiment is based on the strong demand signals for the new iPhone 17 series. He highlighted that the initial delivery lead times for the new series are longer than the previous one, indicating higher consumer interest. Moreover, this improved consumer sentiment is seen across all key regions, including the US, Europe, and China.
In addition, the base model of the iPhone 17 is gaining traction faster than the company’s internal expectations, pointing towards a solid sales momentum during the launch cycle.
Moreover, on September 10, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan raised the price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $260 to $270, while reiterating a Buy rating. He also based his bullish sentiment on what Chatterjee pointed out. Wamsi Mohan notes that he tracked the company’s website and other various carrier sites and found that ship dates for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are longer than last year’s models at the same stage of pre-orders. He added that the current ship dates for the iPhone 17 are the longest since the iPhone 11 launch, suggesting strong demand for the new iPhones.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of Jim Cramer’s favorite stocks. He believes the firm is heralding a new industrial revolution and can play a key role in the robotics industry as well. Given its status as the most valuable company in the world, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is often the focus of a myriad of reports daily. Some of these are negative, and they have made Cramer repeatedly comment that the “long knives” are out for NVIDIA. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares were turbulent at trading start yesterday after China accused the firm of violating anti-monopoly laws:
“[On China ruling about NVIDIA’s monopolistic behavior] I know, five years I remember they left it open. Mellanox is a great company, let them expand the data centers, I totally get it. I think it’s interesting as Treasury Secretary Bessent says it, it’s poorly timed.

As is the case for Apple, Cramer also believes that one should not be influenced too much by the daily movement in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares either. For instance, he commented on September 8th:
“However, I got real bad news for those who are trading, not owning NVIDIA. The price performance of NVIDIA is so much better than any other company, including the one that’s our larger position, that we say we don’t care. I got another idea: why not own both? Today was the Citi analyst day to shine. Oh yeah, after four weeks down for NVIDIA, he really nailed it. Did I mention that he lowered his price target and then the stock actually finished up on the day but he did break ranks.”

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s been a regular feature of Cramer’s morning and evening shows last week and this week. It’s been a jam-packed time for the firm as it launched the iPhone 17 lineup. Cramer also visited Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Corning’s factory in Kentucky last week and was full of praise for the glass manufacturer’s ingenuity. He believes that Apple is a stock that has to be owned instead of being traded. This time, he discussed the FDA clearing Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Apple Watch for hypertension detection:
“[After Carl commented that the Apple Watch receiving FDA approval for hypertension shed light on earlier discussions of how much of a medical device it could be] I’m so glad that you mentioned that, because when it first came out, there was talk, there was a project at Stanford, there were a lot of doctors who were saying, if we could just get hypertension, then they kind of gave up.

San Francisco-based Airbuds offers a mobile, social app that lets people express themselves through their music. Users can share what they’re streaming with friends through a smartphone widget that works with a range of streaming services.
On Wednesday, Airbuds is announcing its raise of $5 million in funding from early-stage venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, founded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
The startup has seen over 15 million app downloads up to this point, and has 5 million monthly active users, 1.5 million of whom launch the app daily. According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Airbuds also has a 96% positive ratings sentiment over the last 30 days across 9,400-plus ratings.
For users, the app offers a way to socialize and connect with their friends, engage in self-expression, and discover new tunes, all in one place.
That’s a combination that top music providers like Apple and Spotify have yet to figure out. Apple has tried and failed multiple times to integrate a social experience inside its music apps. That effort began with its disastrous music social network Ping, which closed down in the early 2010s, and was followed by a revamped attempt known as Connect, aimed at connecting artists and fans. (Connect also didn’t last.)
Spotify, meanwhile, has been working to make its music streamer a more social app with additions like its TikTok-inspired feeds, comments, polls, and Q&As for podcasts, artist stories, collaborative playlists, a messaging feature, and more.
Yet neither company has found the sweet spot when it comes to offering a true social network, because building popular consumer social experiences can be difficult and unpredictable.
Fortunately for Airbuds co-founders Gilles Poupardin and Gawen Arab, they’ve had time to iterate on their ideas.
Poupardin has been building products for consumers since his college days, including a Pinterest-like music bookmarking tool, a voice-controlled smart speaker (arriving just ahead of Amazon’s Echo debut), and a social audio app called Cappuccino that let friends make mini-podcasts together. Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the smart speaker with Poupardin and then later did a stint at Zenly, the social app maker that sold to Snap for $350 million in 2017.
After the Cappuccio team sold the app and its related IP to a meditation studio called Sociaaal, the startup moved on to a widget-oriented app, resulting in Airbuds.
“Because I built all of these music products in the past, I knew that when you ask the users to create a playlist or to do something, it’s a lot of effort,” explained Poupardin, in an interview with TechCrunch. He saw that iOS widgets, which were still relatively new to the iPhone at the time, were popular with teens. That led him to think about building a widget that would show you what songs your friends were streaming."

- Alphabet this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted recently by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom
- Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have trended sharply higher this month.
- The measuring principle projects bullish price targets at $261 and $286.53. Investors should also watch key support levels on Alphabet's chart around $215 and $201.
Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom.
The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business.
Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year.
Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for.
September Rally in Focus
Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month.
While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking.
It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers.
Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring.
Bullish Price Targets to Monitor
Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements.
To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value.
When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201).
Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201).
Key Support Levels Worth Watching
The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap.
Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

He called TSLA a meme stock and highlighted its high valuation.
“This is the biggest meme stock we’ve ever seen. Even at its peak, Amazon was nowhere near this level. The PE on this, well above 200, is just crazy. When you’ve got stocks like Nvidia, the price-earnings ratio is around 25 or 30, and Apple is maybe 35 or 36, Microsoft around the same. I mean, this is way out of line to be at a 220 PE. It’s crazy, and they’ve, I think, put a little too much emphasis on the magic wand of Musk.”

Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Tesla’s global sales in the second quarter fell 14% year over year. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Say You Should Watch Closely. On September 11, Phillip Securities analyst Helena Wang downgraded the stock from Neutral to Reduce with a price target of $200.00.
The rating downgrade comes amid a stretched valuation and near-term headwinds which overshadow the impact of the company’s latest product launches. The firm said that it maintains a cautious outlook in the stock due to near-term tariff headwinds, elevated CAPEX, and lack of significant AI innovation.
“Our valuations remain unchanged. Our DCF target price remains unchanged at US$200, with a WACC of 6.5% and a terminal growth rate of 3%. We downgrade our recommendation from NEUTRAL to REDUCE due to the recent share price rally.

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) run-up to the iPhone 17 hasn't gone quite to plan. According to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales in China slipped 6% year-on-year in the first eight weeks of Q3 2025an unusually steep drop for the lead-up to a major product refresh. The broader market declined 2% over the same period despite Beijing's consumption subsidies. Apple wasn't alonedomestic brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, and Honor also posted sales declinesbut Apple's market share lagged at just 12%, ranking sixth behind local heavyweights like Vivo (19%), Huawei (16%), and Xiaomi (XIACF) (16%).
Apple's China story remains a tug-of-war. On one hand, CEO Tim Cook pointed to record iPhone usage across Greater China last quarter and strong uptake for new users of Macs, iPads, and Watches. On the other, Apple's relative underperformance this summer underscores just how competitive the mainland market has become. The iPhone 17, which launches globally Friday, could be Apple's most important hardware release in yearssporting a design overhaul and revamped camera system aimed at recapturing momentum. Xiaomi's decision to pull forward its own flagship launch this month signals how seriously rivals are treating this product cycle.
But the battlefield may not be decided by specs alone. While the iPhone 17 ships without Apple Intelligence in China, that's not yet proving to be a dealbreaker. Counterpoint analysts note that AI remains a background factorChinese consumers continue to prioritize battery life and value over generative features. Full-quarter smartphone sales are still expected to dip slightly. In that context, the iPhone 17 isn't just about featuresit's Apple's shot at reclaiming high ground in a market where hardware alone may no longer be enough."

An infostealer particularly focused on stealing cryptocurrency wallet data from macOS, Windows and Linux users has been discovered by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) device management and security firm Mosyle.
Mosyle told 9to5Mac that it had discovered an infostealer dubbed ModStealer, which had remained undetected by antivirus tools for about a month.
Mosyle said the malware used an obfuscated JavaScript file preloaded with code targeting 56 different browser wallet extensions, including Safari, to steal wallet private keys and other sensitive account data.

The malware can extract clipboard and screen data, and execute remote code, Mosyle told 9to5Mac. Mosyle said that attackers could almost completely control the victim’s device with the remote code execution capability.
The malware is able to remain undetected for long on macOS devices by abusing Apple's launchtl tool to run as a LaunchAgent, Mosyle said.
But perhaps what makes the ModStealer attack particularly sinister is that it targets job seekers. According to Mosyle, attackers are distributing the malware through job recruiter ads targeting developers.
Mosyle said that the data stolen by the attackers appeared to be sent to a remote server in Finland, but added that the server infrastructure is tied to Germany. This discrepancy is likely the result of the attackers trying to obscure their location, the firm said.

Mosyle said ModStealer was likely a Malware-as-a-service product. These are malware tools that attackers create and sell to less tech-savvy affiliates.
""For security professionals, developers, and end users alike, this serves as a stark reminder that signature-based protections alone are not enough,"" Mosyle told 9to5Mac. ""Continuous monitoring, behavior-based defenses, and awareness of emerging threats are essential to stay ahead of adversaries.""
The ModStealer warning comes as the cryptocurrency industry reels from a large supply chain attack that caused at least one expert to warn users against conducting on-chain transactions. Attackers had compromised several widely used JavaScript packages with malware that allowed them to hijack transactions."

Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading manufacturer of consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Shares declined amid mounting headwinds, including new U.S. tariffs on Apple’s China centric supply chain, which are pressuring gross margins, and increased regulatory scrutiny of the App Store model in both the U.S. and Europe. These developments have introduced greater uncertainty around the growth and profitability of Apple’s high margin services business. While we continue to admire Apple’s brand, ecosystem, and long-term innovation capabilities, the ongoing regulatory overhang and heightened risk to margins and growth prospects led us to exit the position and reallocate capital to holdings with more compelling risk/return profiles.”

Citizens JMP upgraded CoreWeave (CRWV) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $180 price target. The firm now believes CoreWeave’s graphics processing unit-as-a-service business is likely to grow to an estimated $300B from $3B-$4B currently.

Goldman Sachs upgraded Hershey (HSY) to Buy from Sell with a price target of $222, up from $170. The shares are trading at a “compelling risk/reward” following the company’s multiple guidance reductions over the past year, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
BofA upgraded Prologis (PLD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $130, up from $118, following the firm’s Global RE Conference. The key new takeaway from the event is that conversion of new lease proposals into signed leases during Q3 is occurring at a better rate than during Q2, says the firm, which sees demand versus supply dynamics improving throughout 2026 and notes its estimates are above the Street consensus.

TD Cowen downgraded Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $14. The shares have rallied well above the price target following last week’s report that Paramount Skydance (PSKY) may be considering a bid, the analyst tells investors in a research note. TD believes that while Paramount may come in with a bid of $20 per share or higher, it does not find Warner’s current risk/reward attractive given the potential for the stock to “quickly round-trip” to $11-$12 if the bid doesn’t materialize.
-
Rothschild & Co Redburn downgraded Live Nation (LYV) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $170, up from $144. The company’s margin expansion will slow from fiscal 2026, leaving less potential upside to earnings estimates, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
Stifel downgraded VF Corp. (VFC) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $16, up from $15. The risk-reward on the stock is now “in balance” after a 12.5% one-month return, and the $600M sale of Dickies is a “strong outcome”, representing 15-times enterprise value to expected forward EBITDA multiple, even though the company’s Vans business still continues to seek a new base and a normalized growth rate, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
JPMorgan downgraded Camp4 Therapeutics (CAMP) to Neutral from Overweight without a price target. The company’s private placement provides a cash runway into 2027, but this is balanced by its lead program CMP-SYNGAP-01 for Syngap-related disorders being in the very early stage, the firm tells investors in a research note.

Sep 17 - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is seeing pressure in China ahead of its iPhone 17 launch.
According to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales in China fell 6% year-over-year in the weeks leading up to the debut. The decline was sharper than usual for a product transition period and highlights a difficult environment for global smartphone makers.
Apple was not the only one facing weaker demand. Xiaomi, along with Vivo and Honor Device, also reported softer sales in the first eight weeks of the third quarter. Industry-wide, smartphone sell-through in China slipped 2% year-over-year despite government subsidies aimed at encouraging spending.
One exception has been Huawei, which continues to expand its portfolio and post growth, further challenging Apple's standing in the region. Analysts expect China's smartphone market to show slightly negative growth in the third quarter and remain flat for the full year.
Greater China remains Apple's second-largest national market and a key driver of revenue. Yet, with competition intensifying and consumer upgrades slowing, Apple risks losing share to rivals that continue to push aggressive product strategies."

“iPhone 17 lead times are tracking in-line to higher Y/Y, but early iPhone supply is better Y/Y, meaning early iPhone 17 demand is likely up Y/Y (vs. flat FY26 shipment ests),” Morgan Stanley wrote. The bank reiterated its Overweight rating on Apple shares.
According to the analysts, “our iPhone 17 lead time analysis suggests that early demand for the iPhone 17 models is stronger than at the onset of the iPhone 16 cycle last year, a positive early indication that iPhone replacement cycles could be stabilizing and upgrade rates could be improving Y/Y.”
As of Sept. 16, four days after pre-orders began, “the average iPhone 17 (incl Air) lead time in the US is ~15 days, up 7 days vs. last Friday when pre-orders started, and up 0.3 days (or 2%) vs. the same point in the iPhone 16 cycle last year,” Morgan Stanley said.
International markets are said to be showing an even stronger trend, with average lead times extending 3 days week-on-week and 3 days year-on-year in China, Japan, the U.K., France, and Germany.
The firm also highlighted better production this cycle. “Early iPhone 17 supply is more sufficient than last year, a testament to better Y/Y production yields and higher productivity in India, where Apple is building/shipping all new model iPhones at launch for the first time in history,” the analysts noted.
While cautioning that lead times historically lack predictive power for 12-month shipments, Morgan Stanley said the combination of stronger supply and longer lead times “is informative enough to be positively biased on the iPhone 17 and Apple shares.”

The newest features showcased for Apple iPhone 17, new devices
'Thin is in': iPhone Air could be glimpse into Apple's future
Apple 'way behind' on AI. But maybe that's not a bad thing right now.
The next generation of Apple iPhones are here. They include the iPhone Air as well as the standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pros.
It's been about eight years since Apple launched the iPhone 10 in 2017. and since then, the design of its big-time phones have kind of stagnated.
Sure they've updated the inside with new chips, made their cameras better, but really the look and feel of the phones has remained mostly the same. until now.
There's a ton of big deal changes to this, but there are also a few tradeoffs. So let's go through them.
This is the iPhone Air. It is the latest iPhone, new design, incredibly thin at 5.6 mm and incredibly lightweight.
Now, I know those numbers might not sound big, but when you hold them next to something like the iPhone Pro Max, it really does feel like a different kind of device.
Uh inside the phone has Apple's new A19 Pro processor. Basically, it's the latest version of the chip that runs in all iPhones.
The Air, unlike the Pro or the standard iPhone 17 has just one rear lens.
So, it's not as though that's bad, but if you're the type of person that really likes to get a macro shot or really zoom in, that could be a a deal breaker for you.
On the 17, we have a standard zoom as well as an ultrawide, and then on the 17 Pro Max, we have a new 8X telephoto zoom, which is the furthest that Apple's offered so far.
And then up front, they have what's called a new center stage camera.
Now the big deal here is that unlike prior versions of the the front-facing selfie camera on the iPhone where you had to kind of turn it sideways to get a vertical view uh or rather a horizontal view, this does it automatically.
So you can just press a button and it'll immediately turn to landscape.
It's got a good decent amount of battery life, but the problem is that the 17 and 17 Pro also get big updates for their battery life. They're going to last uh with the 17 Pro Max up to about 39 hours.
One of the other things that I think is worth pointing out is all of these phones now come with Apple's iOS 26 and their new liquid glass design.
Finally, pricing, let's talk about that. The standard 17, that starts at 7.99 still, no difference, but you do get 256 GB of memory up from 128.
The air, that starts at 9.99. So, not exactly going to break the bank for a new design, very cool uh to see that. It's slightly more expensive though than the Plus was, which the air replaces.
The pros though get a little bit more expensive at the start. Instead of 9.99, it's now 10.99 for the base Pro and 11.99 for the Pro Max.
So not as much change as far as the pricing goes overall, but it's definitely something to keep in mind.
For my experience, I really like the air. I think the photo quality is great. I thought the battery life was great, especially compared to last year. Uh basically about the same performance.
So overall, it's a big moment for Apple. They're finally changing the design of the iPhone and
if they follow the same pattern that Samsung did, they released a super thin phone and then released a super thin foldable.
There have been rumors for a long time that Apple's working on a foldable and it just released its first super thin phone. So now we just have to see if there's a foldable in Apple's future."

In 2017, Apple introduced an edge-to-edge screen on the iPhone X. And not much has truly changed since then. Sure, the company has continued to upgrade its all-important smartphone's chips and cameras, but authentically, things have sort of stagnated.
``That long drought has come to an end with Apple's all-new iPhone Air. Seemingly impossibly thin and light, the $999 Air makes its stablemates, the reworked $799 iPhone 17 and $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro, feel downright chunky by comparison.
``While they might not get the spicy new design of the Air, the 17 and 17 Pro bring along their own improvements, including upgraded cameras and performance, not to mention a slick Cosmic Orange color for the Pros.
``This is the most impressive iPhone lineup in years. Although it's not without its trade-offs.
`` ``The Air is easily the star of Apple's latest show. It's just 5.64 millimeters thick, versus the 7.95mm-thick iPhone 17 and 8.75mm-thick iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. And at just 5.82 ounces, the Air feels shockingly lightweight, especially since it packs a 6.5-inch display.
``The iPhone 17 weighs 6.24 ounces and has a 6.3-inch screen, while the 8.22-ounce Pro Max gets a 6.9-inch panel.
``I realize all of these numbers are already pretty small and that a few millimeters here or there might not sound all that impressive, but actually holding the Air and then the 17 and 17 Pro is a different story altogether.
``The Air does, however, come with some caveats. Apple, for instance, said its battery provides up to 27 hours of video playback. That's in line with last year's iPhone 16 Pro, but short of the new iPhone 17's 30 hours of playback and well below the 17 Pro Max's 39 hours.
`` ``That's not to say the Air's battery is bad. I used it throughout the day — streaming video content, playing games like ""Balotro,"" incessantly scrolling Reddit and Instagram, and checking my email — and had some 20% left to stream the Mets game at night. That's right in line with the performance I've gotten out of the 16 Pro for the past year.
``The Air also gets a single camera rather than the dual-camera setup on the iPhone 17 or triple-camera array on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. Apple, though, uses cropping and software tricks to give the Air a 2x optical-like zoom. Details in photos taken with Air were sharp, and colors were even and natural.
``But because there's no wide-angle lens, you won't be able to take the kind of macro photos you can on the iPhone 17 or 17 Pro and Pro Max."

The U.S. has shed 33,000 manufacturing jobs this year—but Tim Cook believes he has a solution.
The Apple CEO said his company’s recent $600 billion investment to build factories across the U.S. will create a “domino effect,” boosting manufacturing in the country.
“We can’t be everywhere. I wish we could, but we are putting $600 billion to work in the next four years,” Cook told CNBC’s Jim Cramer during a TV interview on Monday. “And so it is an extraordinary commitment.”
Cook suggested Apple’s “extraordinary commitment” over the next four years to build 79 factories in the states could bring more businesses to the communities they are built in.
“That’s the ripple effect,” Cook said. “There will be more companies coming. It’s a domino effect kind of thing.”
Apple has manufactured iPhones outside the U.S. since the product’s inception in 2007, with the vast majority of assembly taking place in China at massive Foxconn facilities. Foxconn, a Taiwanese multinational electronics contract manufacturer, has a Zhengzhou plant that alone employs roughly 350,000 workers, produces up to 500,000 iPhones a day, and helps drive large-scale economic growth in central China.
Apple produces about 80% of the iPhones purchased in the U.S. in China, but has reportedly been shifting supply chains to India to avoid tariffs to the tune of a $433 million chip deal. The Silicon Valley-based tech company shipped $2 billion worth of iPhones in March, a record for both IT company Tata and Foxconn, according to Reuters.
Apple had plans to shift assembly of most of the iPhones it sells to the U.S. by the end of 2026, Al Jazeera reported in April.
Now, Cook is betting big on U.S. manufacturing under the current administration, noting President Donald Trump’s objective to get “more and more manufacturing” domestically.
“I think most people look at [the investment] and say, ‘It’s great that you’re investing in America,’” Cook said of investor sentiment to the planned factory build out.
Apple’s Asia dependence
Despite Apple’s pledge to build out factories, Scott Bickley, an advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, told Fortune the tech giant’s manufacturing hub will remain in Asia, because of factors like the overseas supplier concentration, workforce scale, and how expensive U.S. workers are compared to offshore labor.
“[These factors] all favor Asia remaining the core of iPhone manufacturing for the foreseeable future,” Bickley said.
John Belton, portfolio manager at financial services firm Gabelli Funds, told Fortune most of Apple’s $600 billion investment was already reflected in the company’s long-range financial planning."

- Apple shares have declined 5% since the start of the year, making it the only Magnificent Seven stock in the red for the year.
- The iPhone maker has struggled to roll out artificial intelligence features, leading Wall Street to debate whether the company should make an uncharacteristically large acquisition to close the gap with big tech peers that have gone all in on AI.
- Low expectations heading into this year's iPhone upgrade cycle could boost the stock in the near term, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring.
The Magnificent Seven is living up to its name this year, with one glaring exception.
Apple (AAPL) shares have stalled out, with the iPhone maker’s stock down 5% in 2025 as of Tuesday's close. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN), the Mag 7's next-worst performers, are up single digits, and the remainder of the group—Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META)—has gained between 20% and 33%. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up 18% for the year, compared with the S&P 500's 12% gain.
Artificial intelligence, the technology that's sent so many stocks soaring, is the main reason Apple has struggled. The consensus on Wall Street is that Apple was slow out of the gate in the AI race, and has failed to deliver with the AI features released so far.
While other tech giants quickly pivoted to all things AI when ChatGPT took off in late 2022, it took Apple two years to launch its first major AI tool, Apple Intelligence. In the year since, Apple has delayed new features, raising concerns that the company lacks a clear strategy to deploy the increasingly ubiquitous technology.
The Trump administration’s efforts to revive U.S. manufacturing haven’t helped matters. Apple makes the vast majority of its products in China and neighboring countries that may face high tariff rates. While Apple products are currently exempt from tariffs, the White House has repeatedly caught industry off guard with sudden and dramatic changes to trade policy.
What Will It Take for Apple Stock To Catch Up?
“In our view, what needs to be settled before shares can regain more momentum is clarity on Apple’s AI strategy,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in an iPhone 17 release preview earlier this month.
For months, Wall Street has been debating how Apple can turbocharge its AI efforts, whether through acquisitions or partnerships. CEO Tim Cook said in July that Apple is “very open to M&A that accelerates our road map.”
Related Stories
Earlier this year, executives reportedly discussed acquiring AI search start-up Perplexity, which at the time was valued at $14 billion. But the company is notoriously averse to large deals. Despite booking nearly $100 billion in profit last year, Apple’s $3 billion acquisition of headphone maker Beats in 2014 remains its largest transaction to date.
For now, Apple appears to be prioritizing partnerships over acquisitions. In June, the company expanded its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its devices. And Apple is reportedly considering partnering with Alphabet to launch an AI-powered search tool as part of a Siri revamp planned for next year.
Low iPhone 17 Expectations Could Be a Blessing
Woodring sees the potential for iPhone 17 upgrades to give Apple stock a slight boost in the near term.
iPhone launches tend to be “buy the rumor, sell the news” events, with shares running up in anticipation of the event and selling off as products are unveiled. This year’s event was no exception. Apple last week introduced the iPhone Air, its first major iPhone design overhaul in nearly a decade. Shares fell the day of the launch and have been treading water in the week since.
But according to Woodring, low expectations could be to Apple’s advantage. Wall Street consistently underestimated iPhone sales growth between 2011 and 2020, but has repeatedly overestimated growth since then. Woodring predicts this dynamic has made analysts too pessimistic about the upcoming iPhone upgrade cycle.
“The iPhone 17 launch as a ‘sell the news’ negative catalyst could actually turn out to be a positive catalyst for the stock, and set up potential positive estimate revisions and stock outperformance into year-end,” said Woodring.
A report from Bank of America on Tuesday suggested demand for the new line of iPhones is stronger than in recent years. As of Monday, a pre-ordered iPhone 17 was expected to ship within 19 days, compared with the iPhone 16’s 10-day wait at this time last year.
“In fact, the ship dates for the iPhone 17 are the highest since the iPhone 11, which indicates healthy demand,” according to the report."

Nvidia, the world's largest company, dominates the AI chip market. Meanwhile, Microsoft's tremendous revenue backlog created by the booming demand for its AI cloud and productivity services is one of the reasons why it is the second-biggest company in the world. Apple, the other name on the $3 trillion-plus market cap list, is also looking to capitalize on the proliferation of AI to supercharge its growth. Alphabet, like Microsoft, is a cloud computing player and digital advertising leader.
However, there is another big tech company that's winning big from AI adoption within its industry and could witness outstanding growth. Let's take a closer look at that name and check why it has the potential to enter the $3 trillion market cap club ahead of peers, including Amazon.
Digital advertising dominance is set to give this tech giant a major boost
Meta Platforms (META 1.06%) is the sixth-largest company in the world with a market cap of $1.9 trillion. It is known for its family of social media applications, including Instagram, Facebook, Threads, and WhatsApp, which have billions of users. This puts Meta in a terrific position to capitalize on the massive digital advertising market.
Grand View Research estimates that the digital ad market could generate $1.1 trillion in revenue in 2030. That would be a huge improvement over last year's revenue of $488 billion. Meta is taking advantage of AI to ensure that it can corner a nice chunk of this massive addressable opportunity on offer. It is using AI to drive stronger engagement across its apps, apart from giving advertisers access to AI tools so that they can improve audience targeting and create ad campaigns easily.
For instance, smaller advertisers can use Meta's generative AI creative tools to create and optimize ad campaigns for Facebook and Instagram, eliminating the need to hire a separate agency. Meanwhile, the AI-recommended content that's driving an increase in time spent on both Facebook and Instagram is another positive for advertisers since they have a chance to capture more eyeballs.
Additionally, Meta's AI advertising tools use real-time data from campaigns so that they can be optimized for better performance, helping advertisers reach a wider audience at lower costs. As mentioned in a company blog post citing a recent study conducted by Meta management: ""This study also assessed the impact of our new AI-driven advertising tools and found that they drive a 22% improvement in return on ad spend for advertisers. This means that for every dollar U.S. advertisers spend with Meta, they see a $4.52 return when they use our new AI-driven advertising tools.""
As such, it is easy to see why Meta is growing at a much faster pace than the digital ad market. Its second-quarter revenue increased 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. For comparison, the digital ad market is predicted to grow by almost 8% in 2025. Meta, therefore, seems to be capturing a bigger chunk of the lucrative digital advertising market. Not surprisingly, Meta expects massive growth in generative AI-fueled revenue, which will be enough to help it join the $3 trillion club.
Meta Platforms projects a massive spike in its AI revenue
In June last year, Meta management estimated that its AI revenue in 2025 could hit at least $2 billion (according to unsealed court documents). By 2035, the company estimates this figure to land between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion. That forecast points toward massive growth considering that Meta is expected to end 2025 with $196 billion in revenue.
But even if Meta's AI revenue lands at the midpoint of its guidance range after a decade, the company would see a massive spike in its top line that could send its market cap way beyond the $3 trillion mark in the long run. Importantly, analysts also updated their growth expectations, and that's not surprising considering the points discussed above.
But then, there is a good chance that the company will be able to outpace these expectations as it has the potential to keep growing at a faster pace than the 15% annual growth that the digital ad market is expected to clock. Assuming it can hit 20% revenue growth in 2026 and 2027, Meta's top line could jump to $282 billion after two years (using 2025's projected revenue of $196.1 billion as the base). If it maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could go past $3 trillion.
However, Meta could get to that milestone at a quicker pace. The market may reward it with a higher premium on account of its growing dominance in digital advertising."

Meta Platforms is looking to AI-powered glasses to drive growth, which some Wall Street analysts said could help position the tech giant as an early leader in a new category of devices.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg is widely expected to showcase Meta's (META) latest AI glasses, called ""Hypernova,"" at its ""Connect"" developer conference Wednesday and Thursday. (The keynote address is set to start at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, Register for the livestream here.) Meta's existing glasses have shown some signs of success, with sales of its Ray-Ban AI glasses more than tripling in the first half of the year from a year ago.
The Hypernova glasses, developed with Ray-Ban and Oakley owner EssilorLuxottica, are viewed as a shift in Meta's AI product strategy away from virtual reality headsets. They come with more smart glasses expected from competitors: Apple (AAPL), South Korea’s Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions next year and beyond, HSBC analysts wrote Tuesday.
Will Smart Glasses Be a Pathway to 'Superintelligence'?
Zuckerberg during a conference call in July said he sees the AI glasses becoming a major opportunity for the company and the ""main way that we integrate superintelligence into our day-to-day lives,"" according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.
“Smart glasses are a nascent market with a potential to become, if not 'the,' then at least 'one' computing platform of reference for the coming decades,” bullish HSBC analysts led by Nicolas Cote-Colisson wrote.
More technological progress may be required before the glasses can compete with functionalities currently offered by smartphones, HSBC wrote. Bank of America analysts, meanwhile, have raised concerns that Hypernova's projected $800 price tag might be too high for mass adoption, though they said it could help bridge a gap ""between early adopters and mainstream consumers.""
Wall Street is broadly bullish on Meta's stock, with a majority of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha calling the stock a ""buy."" Their mean target, $874, would suggest 15% upside from Tuesday's close at $779. The stock has added a third of its value in 2025."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-17T09:30:00,1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia Microsoft and Apple in the $2 Trillion Club by 2028,This company is at the heart of the AI boom -- can the shares double in three years?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7a43c1f490bd5cc9d90267b003253221e8508508998ade852a858f6016361540,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-microso/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-microso/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-microso/,fool.com,200,,"Half a century ago, the idea of a $2 trillion company was unthinkable. Just consider this: In July 1975, the entire U.S. GDP barely cleared $1.7 trillion. Fast-forward to 2025, and the five largest companies in the world -- Nvidia (NVDA 0.38%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.16%), Apple (AAPL 0.78%), Amazon (AMZN -0.47%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1.62%) (GOOGL 1.66%) -- individually command valuations at or above that.
At the moment, two companies are within a few hundred billion of the $2 trillion mark. These are Meta (META 1.06%), $1.9 trillion, and Broadcom (AVGO 3.14%), $1.7 trillion.
But there's another company that looks strong enough to cross the $2 trillion mark by 2028, or even sooner than that. Indeed, it's a company without which several tech giants would lose their dominance: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.77%). Here's why I think its market cap of about $1 trillion will double in three years.
Why TSMC fits the $2 trillion thesis
TSMC is the world's first and largest pure-play semiconductor foundry. What that means is simply this: Instead of designing chips, TSMC manufactures them for hundreds of clients. These clients include other trillion-dollar companies, like Nvidia and Apple, as well as semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 8.29%).
Just how dominant TSMC is in the foundry industry can be summed up by two pieces of data: TSMC commands about 70% of the global foundry market (according to data by research firm TrendForce), and it held about 35% of the expanded foundry market for more advanced chips in the first quarter of 2025 (according to Counterpoint Research).
To put it another way, TSMC's second-quarter 2025 foundry revenue was more than $30 billion. The foundry revenue of its closest competitor, Samsung, was about $3.16 billion, according to TrendForce.
TSMC has been dominating the foundry scene since Dr. Morris Chang founded the company in 1987. Superior execution by Chang and his successors has dug TSMC a deep competitive moat in the advanced chip industry. The company is often the first (or sole) supplier for some of the most advanced chips on the market.
What needs to happen for TSMC to hit a $2 trillion valuation by 2028
By now, it's clear that TSMC is in firm control of the foundry market. But the question still remains: Can this company's market cap really double in three years?
One back-of-the-envelope way to answer this is by looking at the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). At today's price, TSMC is trading at about 22 times earnings. If we keep that multiple the same, the company needs to double its net income (projected to hit about $48 billion in 2025) to about $90 billion to $100 billion by 2028.
On paper, that doesn't sound all that outlandish. Indeed, Wall Street is already forecasting high-teens percentage revenue growth through 2027, and TSMC's margins are some of the best in the business. If TSMC can keep a stronghold on the chipmaking industry, its current trajectory could be enough to get it to the $2 trillion mark by late 2028 or early 2029.
TSM Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
But I don't want to make it sound as if this will be a walk in the park. TSMC doesn't operate in a vacuum, and several headwinds could knock the company off course. Geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan is an ongoing concern and was the reason Warren Buffett cited when he sold most of his TSMC stock a couple of years ago. Likewise, the current geopolitical rift between China and the U.S. could cause problems for TSMC down the road. It's notable, for instance, that the U.S. recently revoked fast-track export licenses for shipping U.S. chipmaking equipment to TSMC's main plant in China.
At the same time, TSMC stands at the center of one of the most exciting developments in technology: artificial intelligence. As AI models get larger and computing needs explode, demand for TSMC's most advanced chips only grows. This should be even more the case when it starts producing 2-nanometer chips, which, according to TSMC, will consume 25% to 30% less power than its 3nm chips, even when configured to run at the same speeds.
Whether that's enough to outweigh political risks and other headwinds is an open question. Still, if tailwinds hold and the company keep producing at today's rates, $2 trillion in three years isn't out of reach at all."

Fed officials voted in favor of a 25 basis point cut, a move widely expected by the market, following its two day policy meeting.
It came as the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) and European shares mostly pushed higher on Wednesday after Donald Trump arrived in the UK for his second state visit.
The US president and first lady, Melania Trump, touched down on board Air Force One ahead of a series of events over the next two days, including a carriage procession with King Charles, military parades and a possible flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets.
Coinciding with his visit, British pharmaceutical giant GSK (GSK.L) revealed plans to invest $30bn (£22bn) in research and supply chains in the US over the next five years. It includes $1.2bn of new money to build an AI-powered biologics factory in Pennsylvania that will develop treatments for the lung diseases COPD and asthma, as well as cancer.
It will also fund the roll-out of AI across GSK’s (GSK.L) existing five manufacturing sites in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Maryland and Montana.
Trump's arrival also heralded the first tech deal between the two countries, as major companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) committed to investing billions in Britain.
The transatlantic pact is focused on developing the fastest growing technologies such as AI, quantum, and nuclear, according to a government statement.

Bank of Canada cuts interest rates by quarter point
The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates by a quarter point to 2.5% as expected. The rate is now below the midpoint of the bank’s 2.25% to 3.25% neutral range estimate for the first time since the early stages of the COVID pandemic.
Governor Tiff Macklem highlighted three factors behind the decision to cut rates today:
-
The softness of the labour market,
-
Recent more encouraging core price data
-
The government’s decision to remove most of its retaliatory tariffs on US goods
However, he struck a cautious tone in relation to US trade policy, saying: ""the disruptive effects of shifts in trade will add costs even as they weigh on economic activity. It is difficult to predict the extent of cost increases, where they will show up, and how they could be passed through to consumer prices.""
The Bank dropped the line from its previous policy statement that said “if a weakening economy puts further downward pressure on inflation and the upward price pressures from the trade disruptions are contained, there may be a need for a reduction in the policy interest rate.”
It also reiterated that it will be assessing the extent to which weakness in exports “spills over into business investment, employment, and household spending”, how “trade disruptions are…passed on to consumer prices” and “how inflation expectations evolve”.

Lyft jumps on Waymo partnership
Lyft (LYFT) shares jumped 12% on Wednesday after the ride hail company and Uber (UBER) rival said it's partnering with Alphabet-owned (GOOG, GOOGL) robotaxi firm Waymo to offer self-driving cabs in Nashville in 2026.
“We’re delighted to partner with Lyft and launch in Nashville next year, as we continue to scale our Waymo ride-hailing service to more people in more places,” Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a statement Wednesday.
Waymo is in expansion mode: the company on Tuesday said it obtained a permit to test its driverless taxis at the San Francisco International Airport, and its cabs are already available in the city of San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin and Atlanta.
Uber shares fell 4% on news of the Waymo-Lyft partnership. Lyft shares pared initial gains, up 15% shortly before the market open.

Morrisons posts slowdown in sales growth
Morrisons reported a slowdown in sales growth in the 13 weeks to 27 July, flagging “challenging macroeconomic conditions”.
The UK’s fifth-largest supermarket chain, which was acquired by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice in 2021, said like-for-like sales rose 3% over the period, down from 3.9% growth in the previous quarter.
The company also complained of rising costs:

Failed house sales cost UK economy at least £1.5bn a year
House sales that fall through are costing the UK economy at least £1.5bn a year, research from Santander (BNC.L) has shown.
The bank found that there are more than half a million (530,000) house sales that fall through each year in England and Wales, which is costing UK consumers £560m directly, as well as resulting in a further £950m hit to the wider economy.
That's according to Santander's ""Fixing the broken chain"" report, published on Wednesday, with the findings based on independent economic analysis from WPI Economics and a survey of more than 2,000 consumers by research firm JL Partners.
The report highlighted that nearly a quarter (23%) of consumers will have experienced a property chain fail.
The economic analysis showed that the direct cost to consumers of this through expenditure on elements such as mortgage and solicitors’ fees that consumers cannot recoup, is £560m annually.
This is 40% higher than the £400m estimate used by the government earlier this year, when it set out plans to modernise and streamline the way people buy and sell property.

UK will be AI superpower, Nvidia boss tells BBC
Nvidia boss Jensen Huang has told BBCNews “this is the week that I declare that UK will be an AI superpower.”
He also has spoken on AI jobs, the UK company he is backing, China and quantum computing.
It comes as Huang said he was ""disappointed"" by restrictions of exporting its most advanced chips, which are in demand for developing artificial intelligence, to China.
Adding to the problems, the Financial Times reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources, that China's internet regulator is banning domestic tech companies from buying an Nvidia chip model tailored for the local market.
China is the world's second biggest AI computing market and Nvidia has contributed more than most companies, he said.
“I’m disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out, you know, between China and the United States, and I’m understanding of that, and we’re patient about it,"" he said.

What's the number one trending ticker today?
Shares in Nio were the number one trending ticker this morning on Yahoo Finance, as the Chinese EV maker got a fresh Wall Street upgrade.
UBS upgraded the stock to 'Buy' from 'Neutral' and raised its price target for the second time in two weeks after the EV maker said it planned to raise up to $1bn via a share offering.
UBS analyst Paul Gong said Nio’s “latest products could further attract consumers after the US$1bn equity offerings strengthened visibility on its healthy operations.”
Nio’s jump by over 8% on Tuesday propelled the stock to its highest level since last October. The company has also benefitted from optimism around its new model.
Nio will begin deliveries of the new ES8 SUV this weekend, priced to compete with Tesla's (TSLA) Model Y.

Bank of England set to hold interest rates
The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to maintain its key interest rate at 4% on Thursday, a decision that will affect millions of mortgage holders, many of whom are facing the challenge of refinancing at higher rates.
Conflicting economic data is driving the cautious stance. On the one hand, signs of a softening labour market are emerging. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed a 5.8% drop in job openings between May and July, with 718,000 positions available across most sectors. Average wage growth dropped slightly to 4.8%, while the unemployment rate held at 4.7%.
The UK economy stagnated in July, adding pressure to chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her autumn budget. The flat performance aligned with City expectations and followed a 0.4% expansion in June.
Also, inflationary pressures continue to trouble policymakers. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation remained at 3.8% in August, a 19-month high that sits well above the Bank’s 2% target. Air fares rose by less than they did a year ago, while prices increased at restaurants and hotels, and for petrol and diesel.
Despite the cooling labour market, high inflation remains a significant factor in the BoE's decision-making.
Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has warned that there is “considerably more doubt” about when the central bank will be able to cut interest rates again.

Manchester United posts sixth straight annual loss
Manchester United reported an annual net loss for the sixth consecutive year on Wednesday and forecast lower revenue for this fiscal year, highlighting the football club's ongoing financial struggles.
The Premier League side posted a £33 million ($45m) loss for the year ended June 30, an improvement on the previous year's £113.2m deficit.
The narrower full-year loss reflects significant cost-cutting measures aimed at shoring up finances after several years of underperformance both on and off the field.
The club said it expects revenue of between £640m and £660m for its fiscal 2026, compared with 666.5 million pounds reported for the year ended June 30.
Manchester United's New York-listed shares were down 3.8% at $15.79 in premarket trading.
The Premier League has in recent years tightened club spending regulations under its Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR), designed to level the playing field and curb excessive spending by wealthy owners.
Manchester United has racked up losses of about £175m since fiscal 2023.

Eurozone inflation comes in softer than expected at 2%
Annual inflation in the eurozone came in at 2.0% in August, in line with the target set by the European Central Bank (ECB). A year earlier, the rate was 2.2%.
The figure was stable month-on-month, as June and July also saw price pressures at 2%, Eurostat said on Wednesday, updating its earlier estimate of 2.1%.
Meanwhile, European Union annual inflation was 2.4% last month, remaining stable compared to July. A year earlier, the rate was 2.4%
Food, alcohol and tobacco had the highest annual rate during the month, recorded at 3.2%, compared with 3.3% in July.
This was followed by services (3.1%, compared with 3.2% in July), non-energy industrial goods (0.8%, stable compared with July) and energy (-2.0%, compared with -2.4% in July).
The lowest annual rates were registered in Cyprus (0.0%), France (0.8%) and Italy (1.6%). The highest annual rates were recorded in Romania (8.5%), Estonia (6.2%) and Croatia (4.6%). Compared with July 2025, annual inflation fell in nine Member States, remained stable in four and rose in fourteen.

Food and non-alcoholic drink inflation could reach 5.7% by December
The Food and Drink Federation has predicted that food and non-alcoholic drink inflation could reach 5.7% by December, from 5.1% in August.
Five categories saw inflation in double digits last month: beef and veal (24.9%), butter (18.9%), chocolate (15.4%), coffee (15.4%), and whole milk (12.6%).
Prices fell the fastest for: olive oil (-12.5%), flours (-5.9%), sugar (-3.8%), and pasta (-2.8%).
While the price of olive oil is falling year-on-year, it’s still over 120% higher than it was at the start of 2020.

UK house prices and rents slow in July
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed this morning that average house prices in the UK in July came in 2.8% higher than a year earlier, down from 3.6% price growth in June.
Growth has slowed sharply since hitting a two-year high in March, when buyers rushed to complete sales before a tax break on house purchases expired.
Across the UK, the average house price in July was £270,000. Average house prices increased by 2.7% to £292,000 in England, by 2% to £209,000 in Wales, and by 3.3% to £192,000 in Scotland.
The average house price for Northern Ireland was £185,000 in the second quarter of 2025, up by 5.5% annually.
Rents charged by private landlords rose by 5.7% year-on-year in August, down from an annual rate of 5.9% in July – the smallest annual increase since December 2022.

GSK pledges $30bn US investment
British pharmaceutical firm GSK has pledged to invest $30bn (£22bn) in research and manufacturing in the US over the next five years.
Coinciding with the start of US President Donald Trump's visit to the UK, the money will fund the development of next-generation factories, artificial intelligence (AI) and research labs in the US.
This includes $1.2bn of new money to build an AI-powered biologics factory in Pennsylvania that will develop treatments for the lung disease COPD and asthma, as well as cancer. It will also fund the roll-out of AI across GSK’s existing five manufacturing sites in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Maryland and Montana. This will create hundreds of highly skilled jobs, on top of construction jobs, expanding GSK’s 15,000-strong US workforce.

Fed expected to cut US interest rates
The US Federal Reserve is set to announce its latest decision on interest rates later today. It is widely expected to cut rates by a quarter point to 4.25% - the first rate cut since December.
Even if today’s decision ends up being a 25bp cut as expected, the meeting still has the potential for dissents in both directions.
All eyes will also be on the quarterly dot plot for where officials think rates will move next, as there is the potential for a big divergence between different officials.
On the theme of central banks, we’ll also get a decision from the Bank of Canada, who are widely expected to deliver a 25bp rate cut of their own.

Rachel Reeves on inflation data
In response to today's ONS inflation data, chancellor Rachel Reeves said:
Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said: “Inflation held steady in the 12 months to August, remaining at 3.8%, offering little relief for cash-strapped households still grappling with overstretched budgets. Persistent inflation is also unwelcome news for chancellor Rachel Reeves as she prepares for her autumn budget.
""Persistently high inflation mixed in with sluggish economic output and a cooling jobs market only adds to the pressure as she considers which taxes she may target to plug the black hole in the public finances.""
Reeves is due to present the autumn budget on 26 November, which is widely expected to include tax increases in an attempt to balance the nation’s books.

UK inflation holds steady at 3.8%
The rate of inflation was stuck at a 19-month high during August, official figures show, keeping pressure on households as the Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday showed the annual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer prices index remained at 3.8% last month, the same level as July and in line with expectations.
Air fares rose by less than a year ago while prices increases at restaurants and hotels, and for petrol and diesel, were higher.
The core rate of inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food costs, fell to 3.6% in August, also as forecast by economists.
The rate of food and drink inflation rose to 5.1% in August from 4.9% in July as shoppers continued to face higher prices for items at the till. This means that a supermarket shop that cost you £100 this time last year would be £105.10 now.
ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said:
Vegetables, milk, cheese and fish became more expensive, while bread and cereals and oil and fats became cheaper.

The US company wasn’t alone in experiencing a slow summer, as sales at fellow mobile makers Xiaomi Corp., Vivo and Honor Device Co. also declined in the first eight weeks of the year’s third quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. China’s overall market shrank 2% over that period covering July and August, despite generous government subsidies to encourage consumption.
China is the world’s biggest smartphone market and Apple’s most important after the domestic US arena. The company reversed a two-year decline in China sales over the June quarter, boosted in part by the subsidies, according to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. But he also said that the iPhone’s customer base in Greater China hit a record over that period and he sees it helping drive consumers to the rest of Apple’s portfolio. “If you look at the other products, Mac, iPad, and Watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China mainland were new to the product,” Cook said on Apple’s latest earnings call.
Apple still has ground to make up to regain its leading position in the market, however, as it had only the sixth-largest market share, with 12%, according to Counterpoint. Xiaomi, Oppo and Huawei Technologies Co. each had 16% of sales over the summer, with leader Vivo only slightly ahead with 19% in the highly competitive market.
The new iPhone 17 is seen as the most significant upgrade Apple has brought to its iPhone lineup in years, with a refreshed design and souped-up camera system. It goes on sale globally on Friday. In response, Xiaomi has moved up the launch of its next flagship phone to this month, with co-founder and CEO Lei Jun saying he wants his company’s products to be measured against Apple’s best.
None of the data so far suggests that artificial intelligence features or enhancements are proving key sales drivers for smartphone buyers. Counterpoint’s analysts expect sales to decline slightly in China in the full third quarter and the market to remain little changed across the full year. Apple isn’t yet paying a price for its inability to roll out its Apple Intelligence suite in China, as consumers appear to still be making their purchase decisions on practical factors like battery life and value for money."

The bank found that there are more than half a million (530,000) house sales that fall through each year in England and Wales, which is costing UK consumers £560m directly, as well as resulting in a further £950m hit to the wider economy.
That's according to Santander's ""Fixing the broken chain"" report, published on Wednesday, with the findings based on independent economic analysis from WPI Economics and a survey of more than 2,000 consumers by research firm JL Partners.
The report highlighted that nearly a quarter (23%) of consumers will have experienced a property chain fail.
The economic analysis showed that the direct cost to consumers of this through expenditure on elements such as mortgage and solicitors’ fees that consumers cannot recoup, is £560m annually.

This is 40% higher than the £400m estimate used by the government earlier this year, when it set out plans to modernise and streamline the way people buy and sell property.
The research revealed that approximately 85% of people who experienced a transaction failure reported some sort of financial loss. While the average cost stands at £1,240 per failed recent transaction, one in five people reported losses of more than £2,000.
Santander's report also highlighted the cost to the wider economy. This included £380m attributed to the loss of work output due to stress and the time taken to buy a property within work hours, a £400m cost to people’s reduced wellbeing and £170m lost to the economy due to leisure time wasted buying-related admin activities.
More than half (54%) of homebuyers said they were constantly or frequently stressed throughout the transaction. This was more acute among those who suffered a failed transaction, with 64% saying their stress levels were higher than normal, 57% reporting increased anxiety, 49% suffered from sleep disruption and 26% experiencing strain in their personal relationships.
Santander's research showed that while the early stages of the homebuying journey, such as making an offer or securing a mortgage, were generally manageable for most buyers, it is later in the process where difficulties arise and transactions increasingly fail. Less than a fifth (17%) of unsuccessful transactions collapsed after one month, while 43% of failed transactions happen at or beyond the three-month mark. Even in the final stages, more than a third (38%) of people found exchanging and moving properties difficult."

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook said the company's record $600 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years will benefit 79 factories nationwide and spark a ""domino effect"" of growth, as early data points to strong iPhone 17 demand.
Cook Says Factories Will Spark Growth
In an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer that was published on Monday, Cook focused on Apple's unprecedented domestic investment plan.
""We can't be everywhere. I wish we could, but we are putting $600 billion to work in the next four years,"" Cook said. ""And so it is an extraordinary commitment. And there's 79 factories across the U.S. that will benefit from this.""
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
Cook added that Apple's factory buildout could encourage other corporations to follow.
It might encourage others to build their own factories in these communities, creating a ""domino effect,"" he said, hinting there will be ""some surprises"" for towns not yet aware Apple is headed their way.
Corning Partnership And Training Programs
Cook highlighted Apple's $2.5 billion investment to expand its partnership with Corning and its Kentucky glass plant, which supplies glass for all iPhones and Apple Watches.
He called it a ""great start, and a very important one, because the glass is something you interface with all the time.""
The CEO also noted Apple's role in preparing workers for high-tech jobs, pointing to the company's new ""Manufacturing Academy"" in Detroit.
He said Apple is sharing training programs with community colleges to help small and medium-sized businesses.

Despite the enormous price tag, Cook said investors have voiced support. ""I think most of our shareholders believe that we're in the best position to make these type of decisions,"" he told Cramer. ""I haven't gotten a single complaint about the $600 billion.""
iPhone 17 Pre-Orders Track Ahead Of iPhone 16

""This historic second state visit is a moment to celebrate the unique bond between our two countries,"" said Starmer. ""But today, we’ve gone far beyond that, we’ve renewed the special relationship for a new era.""

US companies have pledged £150bn worth of investment in Britain during Trump's state visit, in a package of deals set to create more than 7,600 jobs across the UK.
A number of tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), had already announced billions of pounds of investment in the UK earlier this week.
New investment pledges announced on Wednesday included £100bn over the next decade from private equity giant Blackstone, £3.9bn from investment firm Prologis (PLD) and £1.5bn from data software platform company Palantir (PLTR).

The framework agreement, unveiled on Monday by senior US and Chinese officials after two days of talks in Madrid, would create a US-based version of the popular social media app. Oracle, venture capital firm Andreessen and Silver Lake will all hold stakes in the new venture, according to people familiar with the matter.
If finalized, a deal will resolve a sticking point in Beijing-Washington relations and help shape the fate of China’s most valuable private company — a $400 billion startup whose video product gained some 170 million mostly young American users before getting labeled a threat to national security.
Under an initial agreement, ByteDance Ltd.’s stake in TikTok would fall below 20% to satisfy a 2024 US law that required the Beijing-based company to divest or face a ban in the American market. Once finalized, the app’s users would migrate to a new platform, a person familiar with the contours of the deal said.
TikTok’s US engineers have been testing that app, which will replicate the recommendation algorithms that made the platform so popular in the first place, the person said. As part of the framework agreement, ByteDance will license the technology behind that, a Beijing official has said.
On the US end, the deal calls for Oracle to continue providing cloud services for TikTok, a business that’s become a steady source of revenue for the Austin-based company. Oracle already works with TikTok to host user data in the US and other countries as part of a multibillion-dollar partnership TikTok has dubbed Project Texas.
But many other unknowns persist — not least the price tag attached to one of ByteDance’s most lucrative businesses. The US operations have been valued at about $35 billion to $40 billion, though tech valuations have climbed rapidly with the advent of the AI boom.
It’s also unclear how much each prospective investor would acquire under the deal. Oracle, for instance, plans to take a small stake in the new venture, according to one of the people.
The US company’s shares rose as much as 5.9% in New York on Tuesday, before giving up most of those gains. The stock is up 84% so far this year thanks to its ascendant cloud infrastructure business.
A senior White House official said that any details of the framework agreement should be regarded as speculation unless announced by the administration. Representatives for TikTok, Oracle, Andreessen and Silver Lake didn’t respond to requests for comment.
More than a year in the making, a final deal will allow TikTok to remain operating for US users — though it deprives ByteDance of control of a key overseas asset, at a time it seeks users and traffic to drive broader endeavors in AI and commerce.
The law signed last year by then-President Joe Biden stipulates that ByteDance cannot have any operational role, including with the algorithm, once a sale is completed.
Under the agreement, new outside investors would own 50% of TikTok’s US business in a unit that would be spun off from ByteDance. Its existing US investors would own about 30% of the new business, cutting the Chinese firm’s stake to just below 20% and allowing it to meet the ownership requirements of the US security law.
The plan largely tracks with a proposal that had come close to an agreement with ByteDance earlier this year but was derailed when China withheld its approval following Trump’s decision in April to impose sweeping tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy.
TikTok’s future became entangled in the broader negotiations between Washington and Beijing over trade. Had there been no agreement on TikTok, any in-person meeting between Trump and Xi later this year would have been off the table, according to a US official.
On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he had “a deal on TikTok” with the Chinese as he departed the White House for a state visit to the UK, but declined to name the companies involved. “I’m going to speak to President Xi on Friday to confirm everything up,” he said. “We made a very good trade deal, and I hope good for both countries.”
Specific terms of the agreement, and whether it would satisfy the requirements of the national security law, remain unclear. But the will to challenge Trump legally or politically over his approach to TikTok has waned. The president has credited the app with boosting his popularity among younger voters and sealing his comeback election win in November.
To buy time for the transaction to be completed, Trump postponed the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US operations. Under the extension announced Tuesday — the fourth granted since January — the company has until Dec. 16 to forge a deal before a nationwide ban sets in.
Trump granted the reprieve even though the 2024 law allows for only one 90-day extension. That posture has defied bipartisan consensus behind the divest-or-ban provision — and has raised questions about whether the president’s repeated extensions have been legally sound.
Tuesday’s extension means TikTok can continue operating in the US while the administration takes more time to strike an accord with ByteDance on a “qualified divestiture” to a non-Chinese owner. Partners like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google can also continue hosting the popular video app in their online stores.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with CNBC that the deal was similar to the commercial terms that had been negotiated earlier in the year and indicated that he believed Trump and Xi would finalize the accord this week.
“This deal wouldn’t be done without proper safeguards for US national security,” Bessent said. “It seems as though we were also able to meet the Chinese interest.”

""Apple's not really innovating,"" was one analyst's reaction. ""We were like, 'meh,'"" said another. On Wednesday, shares of the tech giant fell more than 5% from Tuesday's pre-rollout high, and remain down more than 6% year to date.
Here's why this might be a great time to buy the stock.
Slow and steady
In the famous Aesop fable, the ""slow and steady"" tortoise beats the fast-moving hare in a race. But that's not the way things usually work in the tech world.
Investors are constantly clamoring for big new innovations and bold new designs. But for the past several years, Apple has only offered incremental upgrades to its iPhone and other products. Yes, each camera is slightly better, each processor is a bit faster -- but (aside from its niche $3,499 Vision Pro VR headset), the company's most recent product launches were the HomePod smart speaker in 2018 and AirPods in 2016.
Apple is also widely regarded as being behind its big tech peers in the AI race, and Tuesday's iPhone 17 rollout didn't showcase any new AI capabilities like the ones Alphabet (GOOG 1.62%) featured in its new Pixel phone rollout in August.
The conventional wisdom says that without a game-changing product or innovation (like, for example, the rumored foldable iPhone Air), Apple's inferior position in the AI race is going to weigh on its near-term earnings. But there's another factor that might tip the scales in Apple's favor.
Nothing lasts forever
There's always going to be a market for iPhones. Sooner or later, older models go obsolete (or get cracked screens, or fall into the toilet, or...). And that may be about to happen for a massive group of iPhone users.
Of the top 10 iPhone models in use today, by far the most popular is the iPhone 13 -- which came out in 2021 -- with a 16% user share. Meanwhile, 2020's iPhone 12 still has a 7.2% user share, and 2019's iPhone 11 has a surprisingly strong 9.2% share of users (including me). That means nearly one-third of current iPhone owners -- more than 400 million people -- are using a model that's at least four years old. These are models with 12-megapixel front cameras (vs. 48-megapixel on the new iPhone 17), lightning connectors as opposed to USB-Cs, and no ProMotion 120 frame-per-second refresh technology or Neural Engine AI compatibility.
It's no coincidence that Apple explicitly compares the iPhone 17's specs to the iPhone 13's on its website, boasting that the A19 chip's CPU is 1.5x faster and its GPU more than two times faster, with a battery that supports 11 more hours of video playback on a charge. The company is also offering store credit for trade-ins of ""iPhone 13 or higher."" Tim Cook and company clearly know that a lot of iPhone 13 users may be in the market for a new phone, and they're specifically encouraging them to upgrade now.
Brand loyalty
But will someone upgrading their iPhone 13 actually buy a new iPhone instead of a Pixel or another competitor? For the vast majority of iPhone users, the answer is yes. In May, research firm CIRP pegged Apple's iPhone customer retention rate at an industry-leading 89%, compared to just 76% for runner-up Samsung. That's especially impressive given how fierce the competition is.
Apple's major upgrade cycle may have already begun: the company reported double-digit iPhone revenue growth in its most recent quarter. In other words, this slow-and-steady tortoise could actually be winning the race without a flashy new product. The market seems oblivious, though: on a price to free cash flow basis, Apple's 37x valuation is much lower than Alphabet's 45x and Microsoft's (MSFT 0.24%) 53x.
Now looks like a good time to buy shares of Apple, before big iPhone sales numbers -- or an actual flashy new product -- surprise the market and send shares higher."

Following a 20-1 stock split in July of 2022, GOOGL is now up more than +120%. The recent surge has been attributed to momentum building off a favorable antitrust ruling that spared Alphabet from major regulatory penalties regarding monopoly probes into its dominant search and related advertising businesses.
However, with GOOGL previously trading over $2,000 before the split, investors may be on the fence about taking profits or whether they should still buy or hold Alphabet stock.

Alphabet’s Growth Catalysts
Serving as a further growth catalyst for Alphabet has been the tech giant’s momentum in AI development, especially with its foundational voice assistant and large language model (LLM) Gemini. Additionally, robust growth in Google Cloud and YouTube revenue has continued to fuel Alphabet’s expansion.
Zacks' projections currently call for Alphabet’s total sales to rise 13% in fiscal 2025, with its top line projected to expand another 12% in FY26 to $375.31 billion. On the bottom line, Alphabet’s annual earnings are expected to spike 24% this year to $9.99 per share compared to EPS of $8.04 in FY24. Plus, FY26 EPS is projected to increase another 6%.

$3 Trillion Market Cap Valuation Comparisons
Regarding the elite $3 trillion market cap club, which also includes Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Nvidia NVDA, Alphabet has the cheapest valuation of the group at 25.1X forward earnings, with the others above 30X. Alphabet also edges Apple for the most reasonable price to forward sales multiple, at just over 8X.

Average Zacks Price Target & Analyst Upgrades
Despite blowing past its Average Zacks Price Target of $235.45 a share, it’s noteworthy that some analysts have raised their price targets for Alphabet stock to $300. Notably, this includes analysts at Evercore ISI and Pivotal Research, who cited the company’s resounding court victory in the U.S. antitrust case as a stabilizing catalyst to its business outlook.

Bottom Line
While it’s certainly tempting to take profits in Alphabet stock if needed, holding on to GOOGL could still be advantageous, although there may be better buying opportunities ahead after such a sharp year-to-date rally. Soaring over +30% in 2025, Alphabet stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."

Apple closed Tuesday 0.6% in positive territory in a trading session that saw the S&P 500 index decline by 0.1%.
All about the AI
The analyst behind the move was Bernstein SocGen Group's Mark Newman, who launched his Apple tracking with a recommendation of outperform (buy, in other words). The pundit set his price target at $290, anticipating upside of 22% on the high-profile tech stock's most recent closing stock price.
According to reports, Newman was most encouraged by Apple being something of a quick pathway to artificial intelligence (AI) takeup for users. The company's latest iPhone models, for example, are packed with easy-to-use and device-native AI technology. The Bernstein analyst wrote that this provided quicker access to AI functionalities.
On the flip side, Newman cautioned that Apple could suffer if AI integration and implementation are not managed effectively. Customers could defect to other device makers.
The fruits of successful integration
That's a somewhat offbeat take on Apple. Of course, like any large tech company, it's trying hard to wed AI functionalities to its hardware and software, but for the most part it isn't renowned as an AI company. But this technology is pivotal for future success. As Newman wrote, Apple will need to integrate it well."

Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to again provide more time to finalize the sale for the popular video-sharing app, following recent talks between US and Chinese negotiators that led to a framework agreement.
The president earlier Tuesday told reporters he had “a deal on TikTok” with the Chinese as he departed the White House for a state visit to the UK, but declined to name the companies involved. Trump is expected to speak on Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about the plan.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with CNBC that the deal was similar to the commercial terms that had been negotiated earlier in the year and indicated that he believed Trump and Xi would finalize the deal this week.
“This deal wouldn’t be done without proper safeguards for US national security,” Bessent said. “It seems as though we were also able to meet the Chinese interest.”
TikTok’s US operations would be controlled by a group including Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the deal.
CNBC reported earlier Tuesday that Oracle would keep the TikTok cloud contract under the framework being discussed, which could close in 30 to 45 days. Multiple versions of a solution involving Oracle remaining a technical partner to TikTok have been floated over the years.
Oracle shares rose as much as 5.9% in New York on Tuesday. The company’s stock is up 85% so far this year thanks to its ascendant cloud infrastructure business.
Trump’s executive order is the fourth extension he’s issued since a national security law that requires ByteDance to sell off TikTok’s US business took effect in January. Since that time, Trump has instructed the Justice Department not to enforce the law, or penalize other companies supporting TikTok.
Trump granted yet another reprieve even though the 2024 national security law allows for only one 90-day extension of the deadline. That posture has defied bipartisan consensus behind the divest-or-ban provision — and has raised questions about whether the president’s repeated extensions have been legally sound.
The terms of a new potential deal, and whether they would satisfy the requirements of the national security law, remain unclear but the will to challenge Trump legally or politically over his approach to TikTok has waned."

What Is The Market Telling Us
Jamf’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 14 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago when the stock gained 3.8% on the news that it continued to rally as the company posted strong second-quarter financial results. The software provider, which helps organizations manage and secure Apple devices, reported revenues of $176.5 million, marking a 15.3% increase from the previous year and surpassing analyst expectations by 4.7%. The positive quarter was further supported by solid beats on both annual recurring revenue and billings estimates.
Jamf is down 18.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $11.51 per share, it is trading 38.5% below its 52-week high of $18.70 from September 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Jamf’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $356.19.

But resilient American shoppers are still looking for deals wherever they can find them, with a weakening labor market and tariff-related inflation fears still swirling.
Retail sales in August rose 0.6%, more than the 0.2% increase that was expected by Wall Street economists. In the key back-to-school shopping month, sales at electronics and appliance stores increased 0.3%.
Sales growth in clothing and clothing accessories, as well as sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument, and book stores was even better, rising 1% and 0.8%, respectively. At nonstore retailers, which includes e-commerce, sales rose 2%.
In an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Barry said that while its business continues to point to a ""steady"" consumer, shoppers remain on the lookout for deals.
""We see almost everyone looking for value now,"" Barry said. ""We actually are seeing a consumer ... bifurcated a bit, [that's] still willing to spend if they really feel like it's a great value.""
At Best Buy, same-store sales growth was up low single digits in late August. Barry said it is ""continuing to see that strength, especially through back-to-school.""
With more discretionary purchases, rather than household essentials, Barry said the company is seeing customers still willing to pay up for new products, like the Nintendo Switch 2 or Apple's updated lineup of iPhones, AirPods, and Apple Watches unveiled last week.
""We can summarize new technology better than anyone,"" Barry said. ""And so we're super excited about those things.""
And while Barry said Best Buy continues to see consumers remaining ""choiceful,"" the company doesn't see the kinds of broad shifts in consumer habits that have been called out by retailers that represent different parts of the household budget.
Other retailers, like Walmart (WMT) and some dollar stores, for instance, have said that high-income shoppers are driving share gains, with wealthier consumers ""trading down"" to lower-priced outlets to stretch their dollars further.
Dollar General (DG) CEO Todd Vasos told investors earlier this month that consumers are ""seeking value, we're seeing that in all cohorts of customers, meaning our core customer, mid- and high-end customers, [are] all seeking value at this point.""
And even with the Federal Reserve set to cut interest rates this week and ease the debt burden for consumers in the months ahead, experts expect more cost-conscious shopping habits to stick around."

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-16T17:28:00,Apple vs. HP: Which Stock Has an Edge as AI PC Sales Accelerate?,"AAPL or HPQ, which PC maker has an edge right now, given the growing demand for AI-powered devices amid a challenging macroeconomic environment?",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7310819eda53698b124cfe6ed13c09eef79e48311a484558b3a620d7dd5aefab,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-vs-hp-stock-edge-162800443.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-vs-hp-stock-edge-162800443.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-vs-hp-stock-edge-162800443.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Apple AAPL and HP HPQ are well-known personal computer (PC) makers in a market that is expected to see year-over-year shipment growth of more than 4.1% in 2025, per IDC. Meanwhile, U.S. shipment growth is expected to be 1.7% to hit 70.4 million in 2025, per Canalys, with commercial expected to increase 6.3%. The growing demand for AI-powered PCs and Microsoft Windows 10 end-of-service in October 2025 are key catalysts. Gartner expects AI PC global shipments to hit 77.8 million units in 2025 compared with 38.1 million shipped in 2024.
Both Apple and HP are well-poised to benefit from growing AI-powered PC demand. However, which has an edge under the current scenario?
The Case for Apple Stock
Apple’s Mac business is benefiting from strong demand for M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. In March, Apple expanded its Mac portfolio with the new MacBook Air powered by the M4 chip with up to 18 hours of battery life and a new 12MP Center Stage camera. Apple also announced the new Mac Studio featuring M4 Max and the new M3 Ultra chip. The new chip is the most powerful created by Apple and features double Neural Engine cores, Thunderbolt 5 with more than 2 times the bandwidth per port for faster connectivity and robust expansion.
The latest macOS Tahoe 26 introduces a stunning new design and powerful capabilities that enable users to get even more done with their Macs. Tahoe 26 offers personalized features, including an updated Control Center and new color options for folders, app icons, and widgets. The Phone app on Mac now allows users to access familiar features from iPhone — including Recents, Contacts and Voicemails — and new ones like Call Screening and Hold Assist.
Apple’s strong Mac portfolio helped it gain market share in the second quarter of calendar 2025. Per IDC, Apple had a market share of 9.1%, up 110 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. Shipment grew 21.4% year over year to hit 6.2 million. In third-quarter fiscal 2025, Mac sales increased 14.8% year over year to $8.05 billion and accounted for 8.6% of total sales.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal Mac sales is currently pegged at $8.43 billion, which indicates 9% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.
The Case for HP Stock
Growing interest in Generative AI-enabled PCs might give a fresh boost to HP’s PC sales. The company had earlier suggested that AI PCs could be a key growth driver beginning this year. It is forecasted that 40-60% of all PCs will be AI PCs in the next three years. To make the most of the growing opportunities in this category, HP has launched several AI PCs and plans to continue to expand its AI PC portfolio.
In third-quarter fiscal 2025, AI PC revenues grew double-digit on a sequential basis driven by strong adoption. AI PC shipment has surpassed 25% of HP’s mix, a quarter ahead of the company’s target. Launch of AI Companion, OMEN AI has been a noteworthy development. However, HP saw softer demand in Hybrid systems.
Although the company relies heavily on China for manufacturing and assembling many of its PCs, printers, and related components, nearly all products sold in North America were built outside of China, which helped in reducing trade-related costs.
Per IDC, HPQ had a market share of 20.7%, down 60 bps on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of calendar 2025. Shipment grew 3.2% year over year to hit 14.1 million."

Shares of semiconductor packaging and testing company Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) jumped 4.6% in the morning session after the company was highlighted as a key partner in Apple's U.S. manufacturing strategy.
The stock's rise was partly sparked by a video clip of Apple CEO Tim Cook on CNBC, where he reiterated Amkor's significance as a packaging partner. This public endorsement solidifies the semiconductor firm's crucial role in Apple's initiative to move parts of its supply chain to the United States, a process often called ""reshoring."" The announcement was well-received by investors, as the stock surged, signaling strong confidence in the collaboration.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $26.61, up 3.6% from previous close.
Is now the time to buy Amkor? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Amkor’s shares are quite volatile and have had 16 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 25 days ago when the stock gained 4.7% on the news that its stock was lifted by a broad market rally that overshadowed negative reports concerning a key customer.
The positive move came despite reports that Nvidia, a major client, instructed component suppliers including Amkor to halt production of its H20 AI chip. This chip was specifically designed for the Chinese market, but Beijing has reportedly raised security concerns and urged local companies to avoid using it. The production halt has led to semi-finished semiconductors 'piling up' at Amkor's packaging facilities, creating a potential inventory issue. However, the negative impact of this news was seemingly offset by strong positive sentiment across the wider market, as major indices surged following indications from the Federal Reserve that interest rate cuts could be on the horizon.
Amkor is up 2.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $26.61 per share, it is still trading 16.6% below its 52-week high of $31.91 from September 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Amkor’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,316.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Apple (AAPL, Financials) will invest $600 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a commitment CEO Tim Cook said will bring new factories, jobs and supply chain opportunities across the country.
In an interview on CNBC's Mad Money, Cook described the initiative as having a domino effect, suggesting Apple's presence could attract other corporations to build facilities in the same communities. He said 79 factories are set to benefit from Apple's commitments.
The company recently pledged $2.5 billion to expand its partnership with Corning and its glass facility in Kentucky, which supplies glass for iPhones and Apple Watches. Cook called the investment a great start, emphasizing the importance of Corning's technology to Apple's products.
Beyond glass, Apple has said it will expand ties with semiconductor manufacturers including Taiwan Semiconductor, Texas Instruments and Applied Materials to grow domestic chip production. Cook also highlighted the company's new Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, which aims to train workers and support small to mid-sized businesses while sharing resources with community colleges.
Cook noted that shareholders have not pushed back on the scale of the spending. I haven't gotten a single complaint about the $600 billion, he said, adding that most investors view the move as a positive step for Apple's long-term positioning.
The company's manufacturing expansion comes as technology firms face growing pressure to localize supply chains and increase domestic production."

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.
I'm Ali Canal, live at the Nasdaq. Let's turn now to some of today's top analyst calls on Wall Street.
First up, Warner Brother's Discovery. TD Cowan is taking a step back on the media giant, downgrading the stock to hold from buy.
The firm kept its $14 price target but says the recent rally fueled by speculation that Paramount Skydance may be eyeing a bid, has taken shares well above their failed value.
TD Cowan notes that while a takeover bid north of $20 a share is possible, it's far from guaranteed.
Without it, the firm said the stock could quickly slide back into the $11 to $12 range.
Bottom line here, investors are betting on a buyout, but analysts don't like the odds if no deal comes through.
And just a few days ago, a Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said any deal between the two companies must be blocked.
Next, a sweet call from Goldman Sachs. The firm double upgraded Hershey to buy from sell and hiked its price target to 222 bucks from the prior 170.
Goldman points to improving market share trends and says Hershey's strong pricing power on its iconic brands should drive growth into 2026.
While cocoa costs and tariff pressures remain headwinds, those risks are now priced in.
Goldman's price target implies about 20% upside from where the stock closed Monday, and the firm sees a setup as a quote compelling risk reward after a tough year of guidance cuts.
And finally turning to Apple. The stock has lagged as Mag 7 peers on AI hype, but Bernstein is calling the company a winner and what it dubs the intelligence revolution.
The firm initiated coverage on IT hardware more broadly, naming Apple, Dell, Seagate and SanDisk as top plays all with outperform ratings.
Bernstein argues that AI is reshaping demand for devices, storage, and servers, creating a massive and sustainable growth opportunity.
Importantly for Apple, early data from JP Morgan suggests the iPhone 17 upgrade cycle is off to a strong start, giving the company some much needed momentum that could help close that performance gap with peers."

The company unveiled its iPhone 17 lineup, following a favorable court ruling, and garnered Cramer’s attention.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recorded revenue of $94 billion, up 10% year-over-year, in the third quarter of 2025. The iPhone revenue went up by 13% year-over-year, owing to the popularity of the iPhone 16 family. Recently, on September 9, 2025, the company unveiled its new iPhone 17 lineup, including the ultra-thin iPhone Air, new smartwatches, and upgraded AirPods, kindling consumer interest.
However, the positive outlook for the company is heavily attributed to a court ruling on September 2, 2025. The ruling favored Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) significantly as it prevented a forced divestiture of core assets. Calling it his quarterback stock pick, Jim Cramer pointed to the company’s favorable relationship with the Trump administration, its lucrative deal with Google, and growing sales as positive signs.
The company, with 156 hedge funds holding ownership stakes, is strongly backed by institutional interest, which magnifies its positive outlook.
The multinational technology company, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was founded in 1976. Headquartered in California, the company is a global leader in consumer electronics and known for pioneering products like the iPhone, Mac, and iPad, as well as its software and services.

The firm said Apple, Dell, Seagate, and SanDisk are best positioned to benefit, all rated Outperform.
“The structural headwinds that IT Hardware has traditionally faced (Moore’s Law, Cloud, Commoditization) are now abating,” Bernstein wrote. “We see sustainable increase in spending as AI expands the addressable market for IT and creates a potentially massive opportunity for IT hardware to return to growth.”
Bernstein projects enterprise inference could reach $1.3 trillion by 2030 in its base case, representing a 67% CAGR between 2025 and 2030.
While acknowledging near-term fears of an AI bubble, the analysts said “risk/reward skews to the upside,” with early signs of demand looking healthy.
On devices, Bernstein highlighted both risks and opportunities: “On-device AI introduces opportunities and risks for OEMs to reinvent devices from PCs to handsets and wearables; with Apple, as the gateway to the Intelligence Revolution, best positioned to gain the most (but also most at risk if poorly executed).”
The firm also pointed to the “data explosion” being amplified by AI, forecasting storage demand in data centers to rise at a 23% CAGR through 2030.
“Seagate as the leader in HAMR tech [is] best positioned,” Bernstein said, while “SanDisk should reap significant growth with the return of the New Memory Paradigm.”
Bernstein sees Dell benefiting from AI servers, with “significant EPS and FCF growth,” while noting IBM’s quantum computing push could also “return the business to growth.”
Overall, Bernstein concluded: “Hardware stock dispersion is high and valuations are relatively attractive, creating long-term and short-term opportunities.”

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
-
Arete upgraded Baidu (BIDU) to Buy from Sell with a $143 price target. AI chips remain under-supplied within China and Baidu's Kunlun chip venture has the potential to more than offset the struggling online advertising business, the firm tells investors.
-
Citizens JMP upgraded CoreWeave (CRWV) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $180 price target. The firm now believes CoreWeave's graphics processing unit-as-a-service business is likely to grow to an estimated $300B from $3B-$4B currently.
-
Goldman Sachs upgraded Hershey (HSY) to Buy from Sell with a price target of $222, up from $170. The shares are trading at a ""compelling risk/reward"" following the company's multiple guidance reductions over the past year, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
BofA upgraded Prologis (PLD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $130, up from $118, following the firm's Global RE Conference. The key new takeaway from the event is that conversion of new lease proposals into signed leases during Q3 is occurring at a better rate than during Q2, says the firm, which sees demand versus supply dynamics improving throughout 2026 and notes its estimates are above the Street consensus.
-
Loop Capital upgraded Union Pacific (UNP) to Hold from Sell with a price target of $227, up from $214. With the shares down 5% year-to-date, Union Pacific's valuation multiples are now only modestly above the bottom of their five-year ranges, the firm tells investors in a research note.
Top 5 Downgrades:
-
TD Cowen downgraded Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $14. The shares have rallied well above the price target following last week's report that Paramount Skydance (PSKY) may be considering a bid, the analyst tells investors in a research note. TD believes that while Paramount may come in with a bid of $20 per share or higher, it does not find Warner's current risk/reward attractive given the potential for the stock to ""quickly round-trip"" to $11-$12 if the bid doesn't materialize.
-
Rothschild & Co Redburn downgraded Live Nation (LYV) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $170, up from $144. The company's margin expansion will slow from fiscal 2026, leaving less potential upside to earnings estimates, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
Stifel downgraded VF Corp. (VFC) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $16, up from $15. The risk-reward on the stock is now ""in balance"" after a 12.5% one-month return, and the $600M sale of Dickies is a ""strong outcome"", representing 15-times enterprise value to expected forward EBITDA multiple, even though the company's Vans business still continues to seek a new base and a normalized growth rate, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
JPMorgan downgraded Camp4 Therapeutics (CAMP) to Neutral from Overweight without a price target. The company's private placement provides a cash runway into 2027, but this is balanced by its lead program CMP-SYNGAP-01 for Syngap-related disorders being in the very early stage, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
JPMorgan downgraded Neumora Therapeutics (NMRA) to Underweight from Neutral without a price target. The company's Phase 3 KOASTAL-1 trial evaluating navacaprant as a monotherapy treatment in major depressive disorder failed to hit its primary endpoint or key secondary endpoint earlier this year, the firm tells investors in a research note."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-16T14:12:43,Experts Predict How Apple’s Stock Will Fare by the End of 2025,"What's the outlook for Apple stock for the rest of 2025?

When Trump first introduced tariffs, with China as the No. 1 target, Apple announced it would move production of its bestselling iPhones to India.
Trump recently imposed punitive tariffs of up to 50% on India, but Apple products, along with other electronics and pharmaceuticals, are exempt from the ban. “These exemptions blunt earnings damage near-term,” said Eric Schiffer, chairman of The Patriarch Organization investment firm.

Calling the India scale-up “monumental,” he said, “More U.S.-bound phones assembled there reduces supply-chain tail risk.” With this in mind, here’s what experts predict for Apple stock by the end of 2025.
Tariffs Unlikely To Hurt Sales, According to Experts
Experts added that, rather than hurting Apple’s stock prices, the continued threat of tariffs could spark growth. “Tariffs don’t destroy demand,” said Julia Khandoshko, CEO of international broker Mind Money. “I would argue that they more often boost it.”
She cited the June quarter’s 13% increase in iPhone sales ahead of tariffs as an example. “People just bought before prices increased. That ‘pull-forward’ effect should also be felt in the September cycle,” she said.

The Real Market Factor: AI
Khandoshko said she feels artificial intelligence (AI) could be at the heart of Apple’s power, and stock growth, in 2026.
“The market will have its ears on September’s keynote, where Apple is likely to lay out its AI strategy,” she said. “The company has uniquely wealthy and loyal users. Therefore, even a small hint of something ‘new’ in its AI strategy could counterbalance declining margin vs. tariffs.”
Apple’s Stock in 2026
Morningstar rated Apple as “Fairly Valued” following its July 31, 2025, earnings report, giving it a “Medium” rating for uncertainty. Meanwhile, Zacks gave Apple a “Hold” rating, with an F for value, but a B for growth and an A for momentum.
Taking market factors and the economic climate into consideration, Schiffer called Apple a solid hold for the rest of the year. “AI rollouts and Vision Pro 2 are lumpy — great optionality, but… volatility,” he said.
Indeed, while tariffs and international relations may play a role in Apple’s stock price moving into 2026, technology will remain the driving factor for the company’s success."

“Consistent with its previous communication, Affirm announced an extension of its partnership with Apple Pay allowing users to opt for BNPL checkout options in-store directly through their Apple Pay wallet,” Evercore ISI wrote.
Until now, Affirm’s BNPL services were limited to in-app purchases or the use of the Affirm card.
The analysts said this development “reinforces our growth thesis for AFRM as its best-in-class BNPL product can now more easily and conveniently access untapped in-store GMV through Apple Pay’s tap-to-pay platform.”
Evercore highlighted that Apple Pay’s network is estimated to be available at roughly 80% of global point-of-sale terminals, making the potential reach significant.
Industry data suggests the in-store commerce opportunity is more than five times larger than e-commerce.
With digital wallets already accounting for over one-third of checkout share, Evercore said the Apple Pay integration could be “accretive even with marginal share gains.”
The analysts tested the new feature with iOS 26 and described the onboarding process as “pretty smooth,” boosting confidence in adoption potential.
They expect more detail on usage during Affirm’s September earnings call and noted that the partnership could help sustain “mid-to-high 20%s GMV growth into FY28.”
Evercore acknowledged that Klarna also appears as an option within Apple Wallet’s “Pay Later” tab, reflecting the industry’s preference for non-exclusive strategies.
But it stressed Affirm’s positioning: “We view this advancement as a significant opportunity that reinforces BNPL’s secular growth tailwinds, and for AFRM to benefit more than other platforms given its top tier status.”

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., September 16, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Transact + CBORD today announced a major update to Transact IDX®, its cloud-based campus transaction and credential system. Students can now add their campus ID directly to Apple and Google Wallets—eliminating the need for a separate app to access dorms, dining halls, libraries, and other services. This update also includes a variety of new Transact IDX® features for schools and students.
For colleges and universities, this wallet integration delivers stronger security with the tools students already use, reduces IT support demands, and speeds student adoption—helping campuses achieve faster ROI and smoother rollouts.
Transact IDX® helps schools simplify operations and improve the student experience. The platform connects housing, dining, retail, and security services through a secure, mobile-first design trusted by schools in the U.S., Canada, and Australia.
""With 79% of Gen Z already using digital wallets, putting campus IDs where students naturally reach—their Apple or Google Wallet—just makes sense,"" said Rasheed Behrooznia, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Campus ID and Commerce Solutions at Transact. ""It's the difference between asking students to adapt to campus technology versus campus technology adapting to them.""
Additional Enhancements in This Update
Beyond the Apple and Google Wallet integration, this release adds improvements designed to reduce administrative overhead, improve campus services, and give students a better experience:
-
One Place for Students to Access Balances, Deposits, and Credentials: The Transact eAccounts mobile app now works with Transact IDX®, allowing students to check balances, make deposits, provision credentials, and report lost cards—all in one place.
-
More Partners, More Options: Transact IDX® now connects with more than 125 certified technology partners, with new certifications including Aramark Oracle Micros systems. A new Purchaser Info API helps partners display student photos and receipts at checkout, and robot-delivered food services are already live at universities like Oregon State—demonstrating how Transact IDX® powers real-world innovation on campus.
-
Less Manual Work for Staff: Schools can now automate ACH settlement for off-campus programs and vending, schedule broader transaction data exports, and use new tools like one-click photo syncs and improved transaction filters.
-
Easier Meal Plan Setup: Simplified setup and enhanced period management tools make it easier to configure and copy meal plan settings across days and terms."

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-16T13:00:31,"Apple's latest Watches are its most impressive yet, with advanced health tracking, satellite connectivity",Apple's latest Apple Watch lineup gets a number of big updates.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1c6f67226f32f3304a0bfb4064a0597677c4fa5618b6f02aefcbe5ffe4fcfcdb,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-latest-watches-are-its-most-impressive-yet-with-advanced-health-tracking-satellite-connectivity-120031268.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-latest-watches-are-its-most-impressive-yet-with-advanced-health-tracking-satellite-connectivity-120031268.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-latest-watches-are-its-most-impressive-yet-with-advanced-health-tracking-satellite-connectivity-120031268.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Apple's latest Watches are its most impressive yet, with advanced health tracking, satellite connectivity
Apple's (AAPL) latest Apple Watches hit the market Sept. 19 with a number of meaningful upgrades. The $259 Apple Watch SE 3, $399 Apple Watch Series 11, and $799 Apple Watch Ultra 3 each get more durable displays and 5G cellular connectivity.
But the marquee feature of this year's lineup is hypertension notifications, only available on the Series 11 and Ultra 3. Apple said the feature could potentially alert up to 1 million people who show signs of chronic high blood pressure within the first year of its availability.
I'm navigating the process of dialing in the right medication for my recently diagnosed hypertension, which makes the Series 11 and Ultra 3 especially intriguing. I've also got sleep apnea, which all of the watches can now detect. I'm a real peach to sleep next to at night.
Apple said hypertension notifications, which you have to opt into, work by using the Series 11 and Ultra 3's built-in optical heart rate sensor. It will also work with the Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 via software updates.
Hypertension alerts work by capturing a photoplethysmography, a waveform generated via the optical sensor that looks at the blood volume in your blood vessels from beat to beat. You won't notice the measurements because the watch takes them in the background. After a 30-day period, you’ll get an alert if the watch finds signs associated with hypertension.
Apple is careful to point out that the watches' results aren't a diagnosis and aren't meant for use by people who have already been diagnosed with hypertension, are under the age of 22, or are pregnant. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try out hypertension alerts because they weren't available when I was writing my review, and I'd need 30 days to get a reading.
Additionally, all three watches get Apple's new sleep score functionality, which uses a 100-point sleep system meant to help users better understand their sleep patterns.
Scoring is based on sleep duration, which accounts for 50 points; bedtime consistency, which is worth 30 points; and interruptions, which are worth 20 points. Consistency bases your bedtime on the past 13 days you've gone to bed. Interruptions are scored the lowest because users can't control when they wake up at night. My score was predictably rated as very low on my red-eye flight back to New York on Wednesday morning and low Wednesday night, but it jumped to high after a good night's sleep on Thursday.
The three watches also get Apple's new Workout Buddy feature, an AI assistant that provides personalized motivational chatter to get you pumped to exercise. It's a nice change of pace to have something like Workout Buddy to get you excited to move, providing you with things like your fastest run times. Hearing an energetic British voice tell me I ran my fastest 5K was genuinely helpful, since I don't keep track of my times on my own."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-16T11:38:06,British Airways passengers can trade air miles for iPhones,British Airways (BA) passengers will be able to use air miles to buy iPhones and other Apple products thanks to a ground-breaking pact with the technology giant.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1e2377cdbf381094fe34aba1fe314f891bff6557f7a696b791921b1f6ffd8e23,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/british-airways-passengers-trade-air-113806828.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/british-airways-passengers-trade-air-113806828.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/british-airways-passengers-trade-air-113806828.html,yahoo.com,200,,"British Airways (BA) passengers will be able to use air miles to buy iPhones and other Apple products thanks to a ground-breaking pact with the technology giant.
BA’s parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) said the 69 million members of its frequent flyer programme will now be able to buy Apple products, including the £1,199 iPhone 17 Pro Max, which is released on Friday, using Avios points.
Customers will initially be limited to covering 25pc of the purchase price of an item with their points, though that limit will be gradually raised.
The deal with Apple marks a departure from the usual airline loyalty model, under which points are typically used to purchase flights or other travel-related services.
British Airways plans to use the tie-up with Apple as a marketing tool in the run-up to Christmas as it battles rivals, including Virgin Atlantic, for dominance of the lucrative UK-US market.
The Apple deal will be promoted at Heathrow and on flights from next month.
Jack Smith, the chief retail officer at IAG Loyalty, said the collaboration was the first of a number of planned similar deals, with others to be announced in the coming months. The airline group plans to launch an online Avios Shop once a number of agreements are in place.
He said: “People are happy spending Avios on flights, but they also want other ways to use them, especially those who are sitting on large balances, so we’re now looking at more traditional retail in areas adjacent to travel.
“Apple fits the bill with products like mobile phones and AirTags, which help people track their bags, but we’re also looking to partner with some British heritage brands. It needs to be complimentary, so things like luggage. We won’t be selling sofas.”
Promotions for frequent fliers
The deal with Apple follows a successful trial that allowed Avios members to use their air miles to buy wine from online retailer The Wine Flyer.
Frequent flyer programmes play an increasingly important role in generating revenue for airlines. IAG Loyalty contributed 8pc of group revenue in the first six months of 2025, together with an operating profit of £191m. That’s equivalent to more than half the earnings reported at BA sister company Iberia, Spain’s largest airline.
Mr Smith said the deal with Apple would help minimise “breakage” – the industry term for air miles that expire without ever being used.
While once seen as positive since it meant fewer people were getting free flights, he said IAG now took the view that passengers were likely to remain more loyal if they were “continuously engaged” by accruing and spending points in equal measure."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-16T12:33:00,Pain or Gain Ahead of Apple? ETFs in Focus,"Apple's non-enthusiastic iPhone 17 launch, AI delays and mounting pressure from Xiaomi leave investors weighing ETFs like FTEC, IYW, VGT, XLK and TOPT for any potential rally.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2ed7140fde487a8e022ae311deeea633b8c17034395abf48c456310c35510094,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pain-gain-ahead-apple-etfs-113300236.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pain-gain-ahead-apple-etfs-113300236.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pain-gain-ahead-apple-etfs-113300236.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Apple AAPL shares have gained 1% over the past one month (as of Sept. 12, 2025), have jumped 9.4% over the past six months and have lost 4% so far this year. Its shares failed to infuse enthusiasm into investors’ minds after its much-hyped iPhone 17 launch in early September.
Despite updates to the Apple Watch and AirPods with real-time translation, investors did not find much in the event that could drive the stock. Market watchers probably viewed the iPhone 17 launch as only incorporating modest enhancements rather than radical features (as quoted on Economic Times), dampening hopes for a strong upgrade cycle.
Against this backdrop, below we discuss what awaits Apple shares ahead.
Competition From Xiaomi?
Chinese Xiaomi Corp. will launch its next flagship smartphone this month, jumping from the Xiaomi 15 line to the Xiaomi 17 series directly to challenge Apple in the premium market. Xiaomi is also launching its flagship phone sooner than its regular schedule, per a Bloomberg report, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.
The new 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max look to rival Apple’s iPhones. Apple’s iPhone 17 launches hit the globe recently. Apple currently holds 62% sales of the $600 and above smartphone market, per Counterpoint Research (as quoted on the above-mentioned Bloomberg article published on Yahoo Finance).
Although Xiaomi has a small share in the premium segment, its premium sales surged 55% in the first half of the year. This indicates that Xiaomi is eyeing to capture market share in the finest segment (at least in China), though on a gradual basis.
Note that, per IDC data for second-quarter 2025, Samsung topped the global smartphone market share leadership chart with 19.7%, while Apple was second with 15.7%. Xiaomi took the third position with a 14.4% market share.
Apple Still Remains a Strong Player in China: What Lies Ahead?
While AAPL is still a strong player in China, especially benefiting from the government subsidies, the road ahead can prove to be anything but easy. China's government provides subsidies to boost domestic consumption.
Shoppers in Beijing and Shanghai can now get discounts of up to 2,000 yuanon selectMac computer models, while select models of the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch that cost below 6,000 yuan are eligible for a subsidy of up to 500 yuan, per Apple, as quoted on South China Morning Post.
Note that iPhone shipments in China are forecast to drop 1.9% in 2025 (per IDC), owing to intense competition from Chinese smartphone makers like Huawei and the country’s economic slowdown, as well as the exclusion of most of its models from government subsidies capped at 6,000 yuan."

The DOJ had proposed stronger remedies, including that Alphabet-owned Google be forced to sell Chrome. Tech companies like Perplexity and Ecosia lined up with unsolicited bids. But that possibility has been nixed.
Beyond Google’s cash cow of search, its cloud computing business is also growing rapidly on the strength of its AI offerings. Alphabet now joins Nvidia ($4.3T), Microsoft ($3.8T) and Apple ($3.5T) in the three-t club with Amazon next up but a lap behind ($2.5T)."

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 17 is off to a hot start, with pre-orders climbing this week and analysts saying the buzz is real. Shares nudged 1% higher in premarket trading as Wall Street cheered signs of a healthy upgrade cycle.
Wedbush's Dan Ives thinks pre-orders could run 510% above last year. He points out that nearly 20% of Apple's 1.5 billion users haven't upgraded in more than 4 years, calling it a massive opportunity for Tim Cook and team to spark another wave of iPhone sales. Wedbush kept its Outperform rating and $270 target.
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also sees stronger demand than last year's iPhone 16 launch, saying it could give Apple's Q3 results a lift. The one wrinkle is the new iPhone Air, Apple's thinnest iPhone yet. Shipments to China are paused over regulator concerns with its eSIM card. Wedbush brushed that off as a near-term hiccup, expecting Apple to smooth things out quickly.
Kuo added the Air is a phone that has to be seen in person to appreciate the kind of device that might win you over once it's in your hand, even at $999."

MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jamf (NASDAQ: JAMF), the standard in managing and securing Apple at work, today announced same-day support for Apple’s macOS Tahoe 26, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and watchOS 26, which became generally available today. Jamf delivers consistent and reliable support to promote business continuity for organizations that opt to upgrade immediately. Through extensive testing in Apple’s beta releases, Jamf ensures compatibility for all of Apple’s fall releases across its security and management platform – and has done so for 14 consecutive years.
“Every Apple release is an opportunity for Jamf to innovate and help our customers get more value from their devices,” said Henry Patel, Chief Strategy Officer at Jamf. “As the market leader in Apple device management and security, Jamf sets the standard with the longest track record of same-day support for Apple OS releases. Our same-day readiness ensures IT and security teams can immediately deploy, secure and benefit from Apple’s latest features while providing their employees with secure, uninterrupted access to the tools they need.”
The following OS 26 features are just some of the enterprise features supported by Jamf on day-one:
Instant authentication with Simplified Setup for Platform SSO*
With Jamf’s same-day support for Simplified Setup for Platform SSO (Single Sign-On), customers can deliver a secure, seamless login experience to users the moment a device is unboxed. With macOS 26, organizations can now configure PSSO during Automated Device Enrollment or make it a required step in Setup Assistant, so users are authenticated with their organization’s identity provider before they ever reach the desktop. This OS-native approach, fully supported in Jamf on day one, streamlines onboarding, strengthens security and provides instant access to company resources the moment a device is first powered on. For employees, that means logging in and connecting to work resources right away; and for IT, it means identity, MDM enrollment and Managed Apple Account setup happen in a single seamless workflow.
Platform Single Sign-On with Authenticated Guest Mode*
Jamf is ready to support an additional enhancement to Platform SSO: Authenticated Guest Mode*. With macOS 26, a shared Mac deployment can now support multiple users by enabling sign-in with credentials from IdPs. For example, Authenticated Guest Mode allows for temporary users to be created after IdP authentication, enabling simplified SSO extension authentication when logged in and self-delete the account after logging out. This means organizations can help multiple users who work on the same Mac, like healthcare organizations helping nurses, technicians or other staff to more easily sign in to shared Mac in an exam room or common area."

The service won 22 Emmys at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, best-ever in Apple TV+’s history, driven by The Studio, Severance, and Slow Horses. Apple TV+ has achieved a record-breaking 81 Emmy nominations this year, spanning 14 original titles.
Seth Rogan starring The Studio became the most-winning freshman comedy in history with 13 wins overall. The second season of Severance won eight, including Outstanding Lead Actress (Britt Lower) and Outstanding Supporting Actor (Tramell Tillman). Slow Horses’ fourth season won for Outstanding Directing for a Drama.
Apple has a strong lineup of content, including a new season of Slow Horses and The Morning Show, respectively, along with new shows, including Pluribus. Movie slate includes The Lost Bus and F1 The Movie, per report from 9TO5Mac.
Apple recently raised the Apple TV+ monthly subscription to $12.99. Revenues from Apple TV+ are reported under Apple’s Services business, which accounted for 29.2% of third-quarter fiscal 2025 sales. Services revenues grew 13.3% year over year to $27.42 billion, with both paid accounts and paid subscriptions growing double digits year over year. Apple TV+ viewership soared double-digit year over year in the fiscal third quarter.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services sales is pegged at $28.04 billion, indicating 12.3% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.
Apple Faces Tough Competition in Streaming Market
AAPL is facing stiff competition from the likes of Disney DIS and Netflix NFLX in the streaming space. Disney’s streaming services — Disney+ and Hulu — now reach 183 million subscribers. Backed by marquee sports rights, including the NFL and WWE, initiatives like merging Hulu with Disney+ and launching a standalone ESPN streaming service in the fall of 2025 are designed to drive average revenue per user and long-term retention. Disney projects $1.3 billion in Direct-to-Consumer operating income for fiscal 2025, indicating a more than 800% year-over-year upsurge.
Netflix has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, supported by a diversified content strategy, including international programming, live events, and gaming initiatives. The 2025 content slate, with returning hit shows like Squid Game, Wednesday and Stranger Things, holds promise. Netflix is making significant investments in localized content and creative talent. It has committed $2.5 billion to expand Korean content by 2027 and allocated $18 billion in 2025 for India alone, supporting a slate of 28 originals."

Alphabet's shares have continued to climb, pushing the tech company's market capitalisation to a new level and the company value to more than $3 trillion (€2.55tr).
This means that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, entered a small but elite club of tech giants, worth more than $3tr. Other members include leader, Nvidia, which is valued at more than $4.2tr (€3.57tr), followed by Microsoft with an approximate $3.8tr (€3.23tr) market cap and Apple, worth $3.5tr (€3tr).
Alphabet shares received a boost in September after a long-awaited ruling in the US, concluding an antitrust case that had lasted nearly five years, in which the company avoided being forcibly broken up.
The US Department of Justice had previously demanded that Alphabet’s Google sell its Chrome browser business and potentially its Android operating system amid competition concerns. Google's search business accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.
However, a US federal judge has ruled that it doesn’t have to sell either, though the company must share data with competitors.
Alphabet's prospects appear to be promising, as the second-quarter earnings showed that demand for artificial intelligence products is lifting sales. Revenues were up 15%, better than expected.
Alphabet shares were up by more than 4% on Monday afternoon in Europe, after they had gained more than 30% since the beginning of the year."

The top spot has gone back and forth between Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia in recent months, behind a business boom driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4 trillion market value in July 2025, just over two years after it crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time. In September 2025, Google-parent Alphabet crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time.
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway joined the trillion-dollar ranks in August 2024 and is the only non-tech company on the list. Tesla rejoined the list in the second half of 2025 after a sell-off to start the year brought it below the $1 trillion mark.

Its shares rose more than 4% on Monday, closing at a record high near $252. The move pushed Alphabet’s (GOOGL) market capitalization above $3 trillion, making it the fourth company to do so.
The only others to have reached that level are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), the latter which earlier this year became the first company to top $4 trillion. (It remains the only member of that club.)
Alphabet’s stock has gotten a boost this month after a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case, a major legal win for the search giant that eased worries it might be forced to sell a key part of its business.
In a note to clients Monday, Citi analysts became the latest to boost their price targets for the stock to a Street high of $280 from $225, citing an “improving legal landscape” in the wake of the decision, as well as growing adoption of Google’s artificial intelligence tools across its ad and cloud businesses.
With Monday's gains, Alphabet's stock has added roughly a third of its value this year, making it the best-performing member of the Magnificent Seven for 2025 so far.

Alphabet finally crashed tech’s most exclusive party. On Monday, Google’s parent company became only the fourth U.S. firm ever to hit a $3 trillion market value when it touched that number in intraday trading, a milestone that caps months of investor hand-wringing over antitrust pressure and proves that Wall Street is ready to give the company more credit for its AI ambitions.
Suggested Reading
Shares jumped more than 4% to record highs, lifting both of Alphabet’s publicly traded classes into the three-comma club. That puts the company alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple — three rivals that have already made $3 trillion look routine — and reshuffles a leaderboard that, until recently, looked like a closed shop.

For Alphabet, the timing matters. The move comes just weeks after Judge Amit P. Mehta stopped short of the harshest remedies in a long-running antitrust case, declining to break up the company or strip away its Chrome and Android platforms. Instead, the court targeted certain exclusivity contracts and forced Google to share some of its search index, a ruling that imposed new obligations but left the crown jewels intact. For investors, that was the difference between existential risk and a manageable compliance bill — and Monday’s rally reflected the relief.
Google’s move to $3 trillion also comes as Google Cloud is finally throwing its weight around. In July, Alphabet reported that cloud revenue leapt nearly 32% year over year to $13.6 billion, with adoption of its in-house Tensor Processing Units and Gemini AI models driving growth, putting Google on pace to generate more than $50 billion annually if growth holds. The company also signaled it would spend more aggressively to meet data-center demand, boosting its 2025 capital expenditures plan by $10 billion to $85 billion. For a market skeptical about whether Google could turn AI into more than a defensive play, that was evidence that the company could potentially grow a second profit engine alongside its dominant search business.
The milestone underscores how AI has redrawn the stock market’s rules in real time. Nvidia rocketed past $4 trillion this summer on the back of GPU demand, while Apple and Microsoft have held their ground thanks to iPhone durability and cloud scale (Microsoft briefly joined the $4 trillion club this summer). Alphabet’s late arrival to the $3 trillion club suggests that investors now see AI as an accelerant, not just a cost sink — and that legal uncertainty, for the moment, has receded enough to let the market focus on growth.
Google’s next test is translating that momentum into durable margins without denting the cash-gushing search business — and keeping regulators at bay while Gemini seeps deeper into consumer and enterprise workflows. Today is a vote that the company can do both.
The $3 trillion club is still tiny, but the message is loud: scale, distribution, and power-hungry infrastructure are monetizing AI faster than skeptics expected. The bigger question for Google is whether this durability lasts. The remedies decision won’t be the last word from regulators, and the capex surge could squeeze margins if cloud adoption cools. But for now, Google has what every tech giant covets: clarity, momentum, and a market cap that has learned to count to three."

The bank maintained its $270 price target on the stock.
“Our tracking of iPhone ship dates on Apple’s own website, and various carrier websites, indicates that as of Sep 15th (three days after preorders started on Sep 12th), ship time (in days) for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models are extended compared to last year at this point in the pre-order cycle,” BofA analysts wrote.
BofA noted that globally, the iPhone 17 Pro’s average ship time stands at 18 days, compared with 14 days for the iPhone 16 Pro.
The iPhone 17 Pro Max currently has a 25-day wait, versus 23 days last year. The base iPhone 17 has an average ship time of 19 days, up from 10 days for the iPhone 16, marking “the highest since the iPhone 11, which indicates healthy demand,” according to BofA.
In China, delays are said to be more pronounced, with iPhone 17 Pro ship dates reaching 25 days, roughly a week longer than other regions. BofA said the postponed launch of the iPhone Air in China due to pending eSIM approval “could be causing some demand spillover to the other models.”
Despite extended waits for the flagship models, the iPhone Air shows the strongest availability, with global ship dates averaging just six days.
BofA reiterated its bullish stance, citing “strong capital returns, eventual winner on AI at the edge and optionality from new products/markets.”

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most important companies in the world due to its dominance in the semiconductor fabrication industry. Apart from Samsung, it is the only company in the world capable of manufacturing advanced chips based on the 2-nanometer technology consistently and with high yields for external customer use. As a result, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) enjoys the confidence of Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, and other technology giants. In this episode, Cramer remarked that he believed the shares should have jumped higher after Oracle’s latest quarterly earnings report:
“Taiwan Semi which is in the mix would be up more.
Cramer had previously discussed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) on September 2nd and commented on its financials:
“TSM’s balance sheet is better than the US government’s. What a balance sheet. They don’t need it. Look if the government’s gonna, if there’s a Chinese problem where they are about to like shell Taiwan, they’re gonna need government help. Taiwan Semi did not need the money.”

The stock move comes after the company avoided the worst of the potential consequences in its antitrust trial, with federal district court Judge Amit Mehta ruling earlier this month that Google won't have to sell its Chrome browser.
Google joins Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) in the $3 trillion space, though Nvidia has since climbed to $4 trillion on the strength of its AI chips.
Google is one of the key players in the AI race, thanks to its Gemini models and chatbot. The company, like Microsoft and Amazon, also bakes its AI into its cloud business, making it a powerful option for customers entering the space or upgrading their existing enterprise cloud subscriptions.
Citi analyst Ronald Josey wrote in an investor note Monday that Google's antitrust trial results and cloud offerings will only help it continue to grow.
Read more about Google's stock moves and today's market action.
""We believe the pace of Google’s product velocity is ramping aided in part by Judge Mehta's ruling as it provides more clear operational guidelines for Google,"" Josey wrote.
""More specifically, we believe Gemini's tools, capabilities, integration (across Google's products), and adoption continues to expand across Google's product halo and Google's size and scale give it an inherent advantage (15 products with 500 [million monthly active users]),"" Josey added.
Google, however, also faces increasing competition in the search space from AI upstarts, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity.
During Google's trial, Apple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue testified that Apple had seen searches in its Safari browser decline for the first time in April. Google, however, later pushed back on the statement, saying that the company is seeing growth in other areas.
Google isn't out of the regulatory woods yet, either. The company still has to contend with its ongoing online advertising antitrust lawsuit. And according to Bloomberg, the Federal Trade Commission is probing Google and Amazon's ad business practices.

Do you view Apple as a growth stock? Would you put it in that growth stock bucket?
You know, that's a funny question because 10 years ago I'd say yes, unequivocally. Uh, you know, right now, it's it's kind of sitting on the fence between growth and value, depending on how you value value at the moment.
You know, I would say this. So, Apple is obviously way behind way behind in AI. It's very exposed to the tariff story. You know, a new iPhone comes out every year and it seems like this version of the iPhone could pick up, I think you your word was a respectable amount of orders. That could very well be true, but you have to take a step back and understand what the growth story is right now.
Investors are looking toward AI as the next phase of growth for big tech companies. Uh, Apple's biggest segment of revenue by far is the iPhone. So this could provide a solid base for Apple, but it doesn't really wet the appetite of investors looking for growth.
I don't think so. I I also don't think that that's a horrible position to be in right now because at the moment with the economy weakening, uh, with rates coming down and probably a lot of speculation around the where the economy could be going. I think it's a point where you should be leaning on value and you should be taking profits from those, uh, more more, uh, you know, hot growth stocks that have done well as of late."

(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet hit a market capitalization of $3 trillion for the first time on Monday, riding on renewed optimism around artificial intelligence and a favorable antitrust ruling.
Class A shares of the company were up 3.8% at $250, while Class C shares climbed 3.7% to $250.4 - both trading at record highs.
Including Monday's gains, the company's shares have rallied more than 32% so far this year, the best performer among the so-called ""Magnificent 7"" stocks and outpacing the 12.5% gain for the S&P 500. Alphabet joined other tech giants Apple and Microsoft in hitting a $3 trillion valuation, while AI chipmaker Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, boasts a market cap of $4.25 trillion.
Technology and AI-linked stocks have powered Wall Street's main indexes to record highs lately amid growing hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this week.
Oracle's blowout forecast last week was the latest to fire up the AI trade.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said tech stocks have been the leaders of the recent rally and ""there has been no other (sector) in the past 18 months, maybe even two years that has had such excitement from investors.""
The communications services sub-sector - which houses Alphabet - has jumped more than 26% so far this year, making it the best performing sector among the 11 major sub-indexes with information technology in second place.

Investor sentiment received a boost after a U.S. court earlier this month allowed Alphabet to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system, marking a pivotal moment for the company whose dominance in search and mobile ecosystems has long drawn scrutiny.
While sharing data as part of the ruling will strengthen Google's advertising business rivals, not having to divest Chrome or Android removes a major concern for investors who view them as key pieces to Google's overall business.
In July, the company's cloud-computing unit delivered an almost 32% jump in second quarter revenue, surpassing expectations as investments in in-house chips and the Gemini AI model began to pay off.
""They still are very dependent on search, but with YouTube, Waymo, and other capabilities and products they're working on, investors are starting to see that possibility that this isn't just a search company anymore, this is a company that's moving into a lot of other things,"" said Dennis Dick, chief strategist at Stock Trader Network."

That's thanks to their ease of use — setting them up is as easy as opening the case and tapping ""connect"" on your iPhone — and solid performance.
The company's newest Pro model, the $249 AirPods Pro 3, ups the ante on both the audio and health fronts with improved sound and built-in heart rate tracking.
I've been using the AirPods Pro 3 for the past few days, including on a cross-country flight, throughout the workday, and during various workouts, and I'm already sold on them.
I've worn the AirPods Pro 2 for the better part of the last year, popping them in so often that walking to grab coffee or around the grocery store without them feels almost unnatural. And while I was satisfied with them, the Pro 3s are simply better in nearly every way.
First up, they now come with five different ear tip sizes, ranging from XX-small to large, and a redesigned shape to improve overall fit. I normally have to use different ear tips for my left and right ears, but the Pro 3s fit perfectly out of the box with the standard tips.
Fit is especially important for the Pro 3 because of the new built-in heart rate trackers. Each bud can track your heart rate while you're working out and provide a post-exercise summary of your heart rate performance and calories burned. The information is then fed into Apple's Fitness and Health apps, where you can review it later.
And if you're the type of person, like me, who is overly obsessed with closing your workout rings, you'll be happy to know workouts completed using the AirPods Pro 3 are counted toward your rings. Apple said it accomplished this by integrating its smallest-ever heart rate tracker into the buds and combining them with a new AI model based on 50 million hours of data from the company's Heart and Movement study.
The idea is to get people into Apple's health and fitness ecosystem, whether they have an Apple Watch or not. Speaking of which, if you have an Apple Watch and are tracking your workouts with it while wearing the Pro 3, all of the heart rate sensors will work in tandem to ensure the best reading possible.
So, if your watch is having trouble tracking your heart rate because of a tattoo or poor positioning on your wrist, the AirPods will take over and vice versa.
Apple said the AirPods will work with more than 50 exercise types that can be launched via the Fitness app, ranging from outdoor walks to kickboxing to traditional strength training."

Apple (AAPL) has once again drawn attention from investors, with its stock activity raising the familiar question: is it time to revisit your position? In the absence of a single headline-making event, this recent movement is likely prompting investors to scrutinize whether subtle shifts are simply noise or an early signal of something more meaningful on the horizon. For long-term Apple watchers, such periods often set the stage for deeper analysis rather than quick moves.
Taking a step back, Apple’s share price has posted an 8.7% gain over the past year, with a recent three-month jump of nearly 20% sparking some fresh optimism. Shorter-term swings have been minor, giving way to a longer-term story that still features strong five-year returns. In the background, Apple’s growth rates in annual revenue and net income continue to reassure those keeping a close eye on the fundamentals, even as the day-to-day headlines remain relatively muted.
After a year of steady but not extraordinary returns, investors are left with the classic dilemma: is Apple trading at a discount to its true value, or has the market already priced in the next chapter of growth?
Most Popular Narrative: 32% Overvalued
According to Investingwilly, the current market price of Apple stock is significantly higher than justified. The narrative paints Apple as an industry leader whose stock price may not align with its future growth potential.
The most troubling aspect of Apple’s valuation is the market's excessive optimism. While the company has been a consistent performer, its stock price now reflects growth expectations that may no longer be realistic. Apple’s core products are reaching maturity, and its future growth prospects are limited. With such high expectations built into its stock price, Apple may be due for a correction.
Curious what drives this bold claim about Apple being overvalued? The narrative takes aim at slowing revenue growth and pinpoints key factors that could tip the valuation scales. Want to know which assumptions could dramatically reshape how Wall Street sees Apple’s future performance? There is more to discover behind these numbers.
Result: Fair Value of $177.34 (OVERVALUE)
Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.
However, continued innovation or a major breakthrough in new product categories could quickly shift sentiment and challenge the current assumption that Apple’s growth has peaked."

you heard uh Inez talk a little bit how the Mag 7 reacted after uh prior rate cuts. Uh, what, you know, what is your thinking on this key space? You know, we get that one rate cut, get a couple more. Historically, these stocks have done pretty darn well uh after rate cuts.
Yeah, I I I think that they've not only done well over rate cuts, they also have done well over the last couple of years and they've really been the only source of positive earnings revisions, you know, ever since the Fed started to hike in 2022. But if you're looking at a change in potential leadership, I would look outside of the Mag 7 uh because, you know, the a lower interest rate environment should allow kind of more cyclical parts of the economy, things like housing that we talked about or manufacturing to start to grow again, to start to demonstrate some positive earnings revision. That's a catalyst in my mind that's been absent in markets last couple of years. And if you're looking just at at a valuation differential between those areas of the market and the Mag 7, that is is quite wide. Uh and so there's a potential there I think for a catch-up trade outside of just continued strength from the Mag 7 potentially, but also uh maybe uh maybe some other opportunities that investors really haven't favored the last couple of years.
You mentioned small cast. Small cast have been rallying. What's the what's the case for for that? You know, I would just counter, we've seen a weakening labor market, inflation is still high, a lot of these smaller businesses in the US, in some respects are really struggling.
They are and and it really has been a, um, a result of, you know, the Fed hiking rates in 2022 aggressively, but now we're on the other side of that. And what we've seen, especially if you, if you look at kind of prior periods of history when we start to see an easing in policy, um, you know, the smaller companies tend to borrow at at at a prime rate or a variable rate, and when the cost of financing comes down, they are in a unique position to benefit because they were the ones that have been hurt by it. Um, the Mac 7 hasn't been hurt by this. And so, you know, while they're not going to have any difference in terms of their operating environment, the small businesses are. Uh and so we would just look to that as more of a unique callyst for that specific part of the market even though it struggled the last couple of years."

NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK / ACCESS Newswire / September 15, 2025 / Disney ranks as the No. 1 most intimate brand according to MBLM's 2025 Brand Intimacy Study, a comprehensive ranking of brands based on emotions. Netflix and Apple rank second and third, respectively, in the overall study. Brand Intimacy is the emotional science behind the bonds that consumers form with the brands they use and love.
The largest analysis of brands based on emotion, the 2025 Brand Intimacy Study is an AI-powered evaluation of 475 brands across 22 industries and 25 brand families. Built on paradigms established by Nobel Prize-winning scientists, the study reflects more than 15 years of research combining qualitative multicountry studies and quantitative consumer studies. This comprehensive analysis examines more than 4.38 billion words across the social internet and platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Quora and X (formerly Twitter).
Over the past 15 years, top-ranking intimate brands have consistently demonstrated superior financial performance. Comparing the top 25 intimate brands with the Fortune 500 and Standard & Poor's indices over the past year reveals that intimate brands collectively achieved annual profit growth 18% higher than Fortune 500 brands and 13% higher than S&P brands. In dollar amounts, intimate brands generated $252 billion more in revenue than Fortune 500 brands and $222 billion more than S&P brands, underscoring that the stronger the emotional bonds between a brand and its consumers, the more its business outperforms.
""The world of information, and of marketing specifically, is being shaped by social consensus and algorithms in an environment of volatile politics and post-pandemic change,"" said Mario Natarelli, Managing Partner at MBLM. ""Today, the vast majority of consumers are guided and influenced by social conversations, even when not actively participating in them. Younger generations, in particular, increasingly base purchase decisions on what they see and sense online. For brands, this means love is harder than ever to earn and easier to lose, and collective intelligence now shapes brand reality. Brand Intimacy is a research-backed approach to understanding and leveraging emotion in the context of this evolving environment.""
Additional notable findings include:
Netflix continues its steady rise from 8th to 2nd in this year's ranking, signaling maturation and dominance of the brand and of major streamers in general."

Gold prices remained largely unchanged on Monday morning, hovering just below record highs, as investors awaited the anticipated rate cut from the US Federal Reserve this week. While the prospect of lower rates continued to support gold, profit-taking and a stronger dollar capped any further gains.
At the time of writing, gold futures (GC=F) retreated 0.4% to $3,672.20 per ounce, while the spot price of gold was muted at $3,641.55 a troy ounce, after hitting a record high of $3,673.95 last week.
The temptation by traders to lock in profit and some resilience from the dollar was putting pressure on gold (GC=F), KCM Trade chief market analyst Tim Waterer said.
""The bullish outlook remains in place; however, a period of consolidation or a minor pullback would arguably be a healthy outcome that supports gold's ambitions for hitting loftier price targets down the road,"" Waterer said.
The US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB), which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was up by 0.1% to 97.56, making dollar-priced gold (GC=F) more expensive for international buyers. The strength of the dollar acted as a counterweight to gold's gains.
US inflation data for August came in slightly above expectations on Thursday, but investors anticipate this will not deter the Fed from cutting rates by a quarter-percentage-point on Wednesday.
""The risk for gold (GC=F) this week is that the Fed may not be so clear-cut in signalling when further rate cuts could arrive,"" Waterer said.

Gold (GC=F), a non-yielding asset, is often viewed as a safe haven during periods of market volatility, and its appeal tends to increase in low-interest-rate environments.
The Fed’s meeting this week comes amid a backdrop of challenges, including a legal dispute over its leadership and political pressure from US president Donald Trump, who has sought to exert greater influence over the central bank’s monetary policy.
Goldman Sachs (GS), in a note released on Friday, expressed an optimistic long-term view on gold (GC=F) but warned of potential short-term risks.
For gold (GC=F), ""while we see the risks to our $4,000/toz mid-2026 forecast as skewed to the upside, rising speculative length raises the risk of tactical pullbacks, as positioning tends to mean-revert,"" the investment bank said.
Oil (BZ=F, CL=F)
Oil prices climbed in early European trading as investors assessed the potential impact of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries, which could disrupt crude and fuel exports. At the same time, market participants are closely monitoring signs of growth in US fuel demand."

So what steps can we take to make sure our estate is divided the way we want?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f3c32be603e23d7ffa8b43fe78b1cb92fdff563fa5d54cf2cd3f92294c26cb57,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/what-to-consider-when-making-a-will-retirement-savings-pensions-050043146.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/what-to-consider-when-making-a-will-retirement-savings-pensions-050043146.html,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/what-to-consider-when-making-a-will-retirement-savings-pensions-050043146.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Inheritance rows are on the rise. Part of the process of challenging a will involves making an application to stop the estate being paid out. New figures have shown the number of these applications has soared by 56% in the past five years. And while we can’t stop our families from falling out after we’ve gone, we can take steps to make sure our estate is divided the way we want.
The rise in disputes is partly because people have more to gain. The value of estates has risen with house prices and stock markets, so there are much bigger sums to argue over. At the same time, the generational gap means younger family members are often less well off, so they’re keen to get their fair share.
The biggest and most significant way to protect your loved ones is to draw up a will. The trouble is that around half of people have never got round to it. If you die without one – known as dying intestate – your estate is distributed according to specific rules.
If you’re married with children and have an estate worth more than £322,000, your partner doesn’t automatically get everything – they get half the estate, and a half share of the rest. The other half is shared among children. This can come as a horrible shock to a spouse – and can even trigger an inheritance tax bill. If you have an unmarried partner or stepchildren, they won’t receive anything at all.
Drawing up a will helps enormously, but not all wills are equal, so there are a few things to consider. If your circumstances are straightforward you may be able to do it yourself with a DIY kit for less than £50, but if they’re more complex, or you’re worried people will disagree, a solicitor can be a good investment. They can make sure your will is as watertight as possible.
When you’re writing the will, try to be as specific as possible. Don’t just say you’ll leave your ""favourite"" ring to your daughter – specify the exact ring and the specific daughter. One family ended up in court after a mother said she was leaving her ""principal"" car to a family member – without clarifying whether she meant the priceless classic car or the family run-around.
You may need to explain your decisions too. If you have written someone out of the will, talk to your family about this to avoid disagreements and blame after you pass away.
It’s also sensible to explain why you have done this in writing, so any court looking into it will know you made the decision deliberately and carefully. The best place for this is usually a letter of wishes kept alongside the will. This is better than the will itself because unlike the will, it isn’t made public."

Naturally, as Cramer discussed Corning in detail during this appearance, the firm’s partnership with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), CEO Tim Cook joining him in the factory, and Apple’s $2.5 billion investment in the firm meant that he discussed the iPhone-maker extensively. Cramer also ran a clip of Cook saying that every iPhone sold in the world would feature glass from Corning’s Harrodsburg factory. As for the CNBC TV host’s thoughts, here they are:

“So Carl, what we’re talking about here obviously, there’s great wonderment about this and it has to with the glass from Corning, it has to do with this, this is the side [of the iPhone] that really matters, it has to do with filming, it has to do with selfies.

April lows have disappeared into a thriving bull market, and the S&P 500 is up more than 11% year to date.
Things could change next week when the Federal Reserve meets and considers an interest rate cut. If it does end up reducing interest rates, which it has indicated that it will, the market is likely to greet the news positively. If for some reason it doesn't, or if it offers any kind of negative assessment of the economy, it could sink the markets again.
But that's life in the markets. There are always going to be periods of uncertainty and volatility as well as dips, corrections, and crashes. But the overall arc has always been upward, and investing today is a vote of confidence in the future.
If you're looking for excellent stocks that can withstand the oscillations of the market over time, I recommend MercadoLibre (MELI -0.59%), Dutch Bros (BROS 1.91%), and Apple (AAPL 0.78%).
1. MercadoLibre: E-commerce and fintech
MercadoLibre is a no-brainer for investors looking for long-term growth. It continues to demonstrate incredible performance, but there's so much further to go.
Although its main business is e-commerce, which is still a phenomenal growth driver, it has expanded to become a complete financial app. The dual focus gives it massive long-term opportunities.
Despite having been in business almost as long as Amazon, it still reports high growth in e-commerce. Its region is underpenetrated, and it's generating a shift from offline retail to online retail.
Total revenue increased 53% year over year (currency neutral) in the second quarter, and gross merchandise volume of goods sold through its e-commerce marketplace increased 37%. New active customers, the foundation of the consumer shift to e-commerce, increased 35% over last year. Management is upgrading the value proposition to make it worthwhile for new shoppers to try MercadoLibre, and the service recently lowered its threshold for free shipping in Brazil from 79 Brazilian reals to 19. It's also incorporating more artificial intelligence, and that's leading to higher engagement, as is infinite scroll, which displays more information on a screen.
MercadoLibre's fintech platform has even greater potential in underbanked communities. It offers a large assortment of financial services through its digital wallet, MercadoPago, and growth in monthly active users has been at 30% or higher for the past seven quarters.
Another feature I like a lot about this company is its varied markets. It operates in 18 Latin American markets, and they're not all the same. Last year, it was experiencing pressure in Argentina, historically its largest market, but that was offset by success in Brazil and Mexico, its other two largest markets. That kind of hedge gives MercadoLibre stability even as some of its markets look risky.
2. Dutch Bros: Growing its brand in coffee
Dutch Bros is almost as old as Starbucks, but it's been a small chain concentrated in Oregon. Although it's been expanding slowly for years, it made a clever move when the pandemic shifted coffee shop consumption behaviors to ride the tide and take its drive-thru coffee concept national.
The original pilot, bringing the chain south through California, was extremely successful. The company took it up a notch with some very smart decisions to bring in new management and try new store formats as it keeps moving east, and it's been a roaring success.
When you hear coffee, you might be envisioning steaming hot cups. But Dutch Bros' core beverages are cold drinks and energy drinks. It offers customized beverages featuring all kinds of flavors and shots, and it has carved out a significant and growing niche in this space. Customers love it, and the future looks wide open.
The results speak for themselves. Revenue increased 28% year over year in the second quarter, driven by a 6.1% increase in same-store sales. Contribution margin, which measures store profitability, improved from 30.8% to 31.1%, and adjusted net income rose from $31.2 million to $45.5 million.
The investing thesis is made even more compelling by the expansion opportunities. Management recently raised its long-term goal from 4,000 stores to 7,000, a sevenfold increase from today's store count.
3. Apple: Don't give up on it
Finally, Apple might seem like a contrarian call today, but its recently stagnating price means that there's time to buy before it starts to soar again.
The naysayers might point to slowing growth and too much dependence on the iPhone. But Apple doesn't need a lot of products to generate engagement and high sales. It has developed an incomparable ecosystem of products that work together, plus loyal fans who love its quality and stay in that ecosystem, buying new upgrades and complementary products.
One recent concern has been that it's not staying competitive in artificial intelligence (AI). It has released a slew of Apple Intelligence services, but it doesn't seem to have found a breakout AI model like many of its most direct competitors. But I think it's highly likely that it will come through.
Apple strives to be different, and better, and its AI will reflect that. One recent development just launched for its AirPods Pro earbuds is the ability to translate conversations on the spot. This is the kind of innovation that will make Apple Intelligence stand out.
Apple stock is down 6% this year, trailing the market, and now is a great time for the forward-thinking investor to take a position."

This is precisely what Tesla (TSLA 1.15%) has done. In an effort to drive the world toward sustainable energy, the business has developed a fleet of popular high-performance electric vehicles (EVs). Consequently, Tesla has disrupted the global auto market.
Shareholders have gained tremendously, despite a volatile ride. If you'd invested $500 in this EV stock five years ago, here's how much you'd have today.
Buying what Musk is selling
Tesla has registered monster growth throughout its history. This key factor is what has propelled the stock to new heights. Shares have accelerated 185% higher in the past five years (as of Sept. 10). This would've turned a $500 starting sum into $1,424 today. This is despite the fact that the stock currently trades 28% below its peak from December 2024.
Anyone who follows the business knows that the market buys what founder and CEO Elon Musk is selling. Yes, Tesla sells well-designed and tech-forward EVs. Based on the stock's incredible performance, however, investors are convinced that the company will one day find huge success with autonomous driving and robotics. This could boost Tesla's finances.
Tesla: Back to reality
Introducing a global robotaxi fleet or selling lots of humanoid robots to customers is far from a certainty, though. But Tesla shares, which trade at a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio of 201, reflect flawless execution in the years ahead. It's safe to say that the stock is overvalued.
And this is at a time when the company is struggling mightily. Revenue is down. In August, Tesla's market share of new EV sales in the U.S. was the lowest since 2017. And margins are taking a hit.
Investors can't complain about the trailing-five-year return. However, the next five years might not be so kind."

Over the last five years, Broadcom is up over 925% and Oracle is up over 475% -- outperforming every ""Magnificent Seven"" stock (Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla) except one -- Nvidia.
The ""Ten Titans"" provide an update to the Magnificent Seven by adding Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix to the list. Combined, these three companies have nearly the same market cap as Apple, and are gaining increasing influence in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.46%). In fact, the Ten Titans now make up 39.1% of the index compared to 33.7% for the Magnificent Seven.
Beyond the market cap influence of these names, Broadcom and Oracle embody groundbreaking advancements in cloud computing, infrastructure software, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Here's why Broadcom and Oracle have become such dominant companies, and whether either growth stock is a buy now.
Broadcom is a balanced way to invest in AI
Broadcom and Oracle's surging stock prices illustrate how AI is redefining previously stagnant investment theses. Just a few years ago, both companies were often viewed as dividend-paying stalwarts.
Broadcom was known for its established semiconductor business, providing the nuts and bolts behind networking, broadband, wireless, cybersecurity, and more. But the company is completely different today due to its acquisition of VMware in late 2023 and the development and adoption of its AI chips.
Cloud computing giants are lining up to buy Broadcom's AI chips, known as XPUs. XPUs are highly advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are tailored to a specialized function and are especially good at handling increasing AI workloads. Broadcom doesn't just design the chips, it also makes associated networking products, like Tomahawk switches that link chips within a server rack, and Jericho Ethernet fabric routers, which enable the connection of over 1 million XPU clusters across multiple data centers.
Broadcom is unique because it is far bigger than just an AI play. Rather, it is a highly diversified company that benefits from the buildout of AI infrastructure, AI software, and the growth of high-speed connectivity.
Oracle is heavily disrupting incumbent cloud giants
Oracle's latest quarter perfectly represents why Broadcom has become a behemoth that is closing in on $1 trillion in market cap. On Sept. 9, Oracle said that its cloud infrastructure segment is expected to grow 77% in fiscal 2026, 78% in fiscal 2027, 128% in fiscal 2028, and 97% in fiscal 2029 to become a $144 billion business. If Oracle comes remotely close to these estimates, its cloud business will become far larger than its legacy database services segment.
Like Broadcom, Oracle was once an entrenched business-to-business giant in tech, known for its stodgy growth and reliable dividend. But Oracle is now a completely different company. Its strength comes from its competitive pricing model, which makes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) a great add-on for customers that use its database services.
Oracle is an enterprise-facing company. Whereas investors in the ""big three"" cloud players, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are getting a lot of moving parts that have nothing to do with cloud computing. In this vein, Oracle has become one of the best ways to invest in high-octane cloud growth, somewhat similar to how investors are drawn to Nvidia. Nvidia has become a pure-play AI stock because its data center business is now magnitudes larger than its gaming and professional visualization markets.
Broadcom and Oracle's stock prices are running up far faster than they are growing earnings because investors are buying these stocks for where they could be years from now rather than where they are today. Forward earnings estimates will probably increase as analysts adjust their targets based on recent results and guidance. But for now, Broadcom's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a staggering 54.8 compared to 48.2 for Oracle. For context, Nvidia's forward P/E is 39.5 -- meaning investors are even more excited about Broadcom and Oracle's growth.
Broadcom and Oracle are moving markets
The breakneck growth rates and size of Broadcom and Oracle prove why it's time to forget the Magnificent Seven and use the Ten Titans as a better descriptor for market-moving growth stocks. Even folks who don't own the Ten Titans outright may be indirectly impacted through their holdings in index funds and exchange-traded funds.
In addition to their foundational role in the major indexes, the Ten Titans will likely make or break broader market sentiment. If the S&P 500 keeps making new highs, it's probably because of the Ten Titans. If it undergoes a major sell-off, it's probably because a few key Titans fell. You may have even seen headlines about how the S&P 500 is expensive relative to its historical valuation. That's because many of the Ten Titans are valued more for their future earnings than their current profits. So investors should only approach these stocks if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term time horizon, and believe these companies can deliver on highly optimistic expectations.
It's also worth noting the correlation that these companies can have. For example, Oracle's blowout quarter sent Broadcom and Nvidia soaring on Sept. 10 because Oracle is a major customer of these chip makers. Increased AI spending to build out OCI benefits Broadcom and Nvidia. Although Oracle may account for less than 2% of the S&P 500, its results had a significantly larger impact on the S&P 500 than the movement in its stock price alone."

According to the firm, Apple delivered an awe-inspiring keynote with a range of iPhones, watch, and AirPods. It noted how the iPhone 17 series were similar to market expectations considering the various specifications and innovation leaked beforehand.
Despite the leaks, the firm noted how Apple’s hardware updates have stood out.
“Apple’s “awe-inspiring” keynote on 9 September showcased new products to be made available from 19 September, including a range of iPhones, a Watch, and AirPods. The iPhone 17 series is not different from market expectations as most of the innovation and specs were leaked beforehand. Hardware innovation is at every corner, from better screens, cameras, or batteries, and it would be dishonest to not flag the slickness of all phones presented. This is particularly true for the slim iPhone Air (5.6mm vs 5.5mm expectation). Same for Apple Watch: improved hardware for the Series 11, SE3, and Ultra 3, but also in line with expectation. On AirPods (Pro 3), innovation leads to improved sound quality and noise cancellation capabilities (2x vs AirPods Pro 2).”
Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-13T18:07:00,"Apple's New Products May Help the Stock, but Services Matter Most Heading Into Fiscal 2026","Apple's fall product event grabs attention, but the services engine is what investors should watch as fiscal 2026 approaches.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=54affa4495ba5e56595593bc63a6873456e5beebc4840de2a9f56ca93d37dc54,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/apples-new-products-may-help-the-stock-but-service/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/apples-new-products-may-help-the-stock-but-service/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/apples-new-products-may-help-the-stock-but-service/,fool.com,200,,"Apple (AAPL 0.78%) shares have been choppy around this week's product event as investors parse what the iPhone 17 family, a new ultra-thin iPhone Air, and updated wearables mean for demand this holiday season. The Cupertino, California-based tech company refreshed its flagship devices with faster chips, display and camera upgrades, and new AirPods and Apple Watch devices.
While keeping its lineup fresh is vital, the more important driver for the company (and the stock) going into fiscal 2026 is Apple's services business, home to the company's App Store, subscriptions, payments, advertising, iCloud, and more. It is growing faster than hardware, carries far higher margins, and is steadily representing a bigger slice of Apple's profit. Yes, product cycles may sway the stock day to day, but the steady drumbeat of services growth is what can sustain earnings growth and support the stock's premium valuation over time.
Recent results highlight Apple's crown jewel
Apple closed fiscal Q3 (the quarter ended June 28) with $94.0 billion in revenue, up 10% year over year, and earnings per share of $1.57, up 12%. Management highlighted a record for total revenue in the quarter ending in June, as well as an all-time high for services revenue.
""Today Apple is proud to report a June quarter revenue record with double-digit growth in iPhone, Mac and Services,"" CEO Tim Cook said in the earnings release, adding that Apple Intelligence features continue to roll out across its platforms. The company also noted its installed base reached a new all-time high across every product category.
But services did the heavy lifting. The important segment's revenue rose to $27.42 billion, up about 13% year over year, and represented roughly 29% of total sales for the period. More importantly for investors, Apple's services carry structurally higher profitability. To this end, Apple's services gross margin was about 76% in the quarter, versus roughly 35% for products. That spread explains why steady services growth can move overall earnings even when device cycles ebb and flow.
Over the longer haul, services have clearly become a bigger piece of the pie. For the nine months ended June 28, 2025, services made up roughly a quarter of Apple's total revenue -- up significantly from fiscal 2019, when the segment accounted for less than 18% of sales.
This rising contribution highlights how much more important recurring, high-margin services have become to the overall business. This trend should persist over the long haul. Sure, the mix will not move up in a straight line (blockbuster product launches can periodically push product revenue growth ahead of services), but the overall trend of services gradually taking a larger share of the company's sales should persist.
Investors are also watching closely to see whether Apple's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) can become a catalyst for faster services growth. Features like Apple Intelligence and on-device AI enhancements, as well as tighter integration across iCloud, subscriptions, and the App Store, could deepen engagement and create new revenue streams.
Apple has already signaled this push. Management said in its July earnings call that the company is significantly growing its investments in artificial intelligence. In addition, management said it's making good progress on the development of a more personalized Siri, which is expected in 2026, underscoring how central AI is becoming to Apple's long-term strategy.
If successful, these initiatives may not only sustain services expansion but even accelerate its growth rate over time.
New products are helpful
This week's event was certainly important for the stock. Such a robust suite of new products should help drive upgrades. Apple introduced the iPhone 17 Pro, starting at $1,099 -- featuring the A19 Pro chip, design changes, and camera improvements -- alongside the iPhone 17 lineup and the thin iPhone 17 Air. Additionally, AirPods Pro gained live translation and health-sensing features, and Apple updated its Watch models ahead of the holidays. These are meaningful refinements that keep the ecosystem fresh and even have the potential to nudge average selling prices higher.
Ultimately, though, fiscal 2026's story is likely to be written in services. The recurring, subscription-heavy nature of this segment, combined with Apple's record installed base, creates a durable runway for growth. With services already accounting for close to a third of revenue and the majority of gross profit, incremental gains here can offset variability in hardware cycles and support continued earnings expansion.
That is especially relevant given where the stock trades today. At a price-to-earnings multiple in the 30s, investors are paying for steady, high-margin earnings compounding -- powered more by services than by any single iPhone feature.
A key risk for the stock, of course, is tariff uncertainty. Additionally, competition in streaming, cloud storage, and advertising is intense. And if hardware demand underwhelms for multiple cycles, the knock-on effects to services growth could slow. But Apple's financial position remains strong, with ample cash generation to invest in new services, support the ecosystem, and continue sizable buybacks and dividends. These dynamics -- rising services revenue and significantly higher services margins -- are the parts of the Apple story that matter most as investors look toward fiscal 2026."

“Okay so David I’m looking at WarnerMedia Holdings, I’m looking at all these different pieces of debt, they’re all horrendous. If I had Amazon, I would say, well you know what, we could really do a killing, or Apple. We’ve got the best balance sheet in the world, we just pay off that debt, we immediately become the number one entertainment company. We don’t know how to do entertainment, we’re using TimeWarner for a lot of the things anyway. David, can’t these companies pay much, much more and just decide you know what, we want this and we love Ellison, he’s a terrific guy, but he can’t be in our league.

Discovery's (WBD) stock has spiked close to 50% in just two trading days after a Wall Street Journal report said Paramount Skydance (PSKY) is preparing a majority-cash bid for the media conglomerate — a potential move that could set off a Hollywood bidding war and reshape the global streaming landscape.
The David Ellison-backed company, which just closed on its takeover of Paramount last month, is reportedly eyeing all of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets, which include recognizable and high-profile properties from HBO and CNN to the Warner Bros. studio lot.
Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance’s request for comment. Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.
While no formal offer has been submitted and talks could still collapse, analysts say the combination would instantly elevate Paramount Skydance’s scale in streaming and advertising, while forcing rivals from Disney (DIS) to Amazon (AMZN) to reassess their competitive playbooks.
“This makes tons of both strategic and economic sense,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst Geetha Ranganathan told Yahoo Finance on Friday. “Both Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery are relatively sub-scale players in streaming. Put them together and you’re talking about 200 million subscribers, a top five global player.”
Netflix (NFLX) has more than 300 million global subscribers, while Disney+ and Hulu together reported 183 million at the end of their latest quarter, which ended June 28, 2025. Paramount+ has roughly 75 million subscribers, and HBO Max has about 125 million. Put together, that gives Ellison’s venture around 200 million subscribers — enough to rank among the top global streaming players.
Beyond scale, the combined company would also generate roughly $20 billion in TV advertising revenue, with analysts estimating $3 billion to $5 billion in annual merger synergies.
But Paramount may not be the only bidder. Comcast (CMCSA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Netflix, and Sony (SONY) have all been floated as potential suitors, though analysts caution that most may be reluctant to absorb WBD’s shrinking cable portfolio. Still, the rare chance to secure Warner Bros. Discovery's crown-jewel franchises could prove too tempting to pass up.
“This absolutely raises the stakes for everybody,” Ranganathan said. “With Warner Bros., you get top-tier brands like DC Comics, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. On the TV side, they have one of the best production houses and some of the most premium properties on HBO Max.
""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Paramount or any other bidder,"" she added. ""It makes a very formidable competitor — and it weakens everyone else’s hand. That kind of leads us to think we could potentially have a bidding war on our hands."""

I did. I tried my best yesterday and I came up with Gamaton, which uh, you know, sort of sort of gets uh gets the Mag 7 plus. It actually was meant to include Broadcom, truthfully. I forgot the B and and actually Broadcom you could either do an A or a B. so I may have to make it gamma with an extra A, but um basically that would be my that would be my next thought here is uh because you know, I think
we're we're definitely broadening out our focus and I and I think from hearing the the uh the you know, the speakers you heard, they were all tech heavy people.

finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-13T13:43:00,Best Stock to Buy Now: Alphabet or Apple?,Alphabet and Apple are two of the most recognizable names in big tech.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5415f00423b4af942ced0f56f6d6082c086abaceecf57f6985c9fbf026818533,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/best-stock-to-buy-now-alphabet-or-apple/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/best-stock-to-buy-now-alphabet-or-apple/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/best-stock-to-buy-now-alphabet-or-apple/,fool.com,200,,"Two of the world's largest companies are Apple (AAPL 0.78%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.62%) (GOOGL 1.56%). These two companies are currently the third and fourth largest in the world by market cap, so neither is likely to provide market-crushing returns. As a result, investors need to determine if either of them can outperform the market over the long term; otherwise, they aren't worth owning.
I believe there is a clear better buy between the two right now, and this stock could easily outperform the market over the next five years, while the other may struggle to do so. Which one is it? The answer may surprise you.
Both businesses want to maintain the status quo
Both Apple and Alphabet have some of the most recognizable brands on the planet. Apple's ecosystem is centered around the iPhone, with accessories and laptops to create a leading consumer technology brand. Alphabet is the parent company of many businesses, but its most notable brand is Google. Google is how the vast majority of people access the right content on the internet, although that notion is under distress.
Many investors believe that generative AI could replace Google, although that remains to be seen. Google remains the top search engine used by many, and with its recent integration of AI search overviews, it has also evolved to adapt to this AI-centric view.
Additionally, Alphabet recently won a court case that allowed it to stay in its current state and continue paying Apple for the right to be the default search engine on its iPhones. This helps ensure Alphabet's status quo is maintained, and is an extremely positive sign for investors.
Apple is thriving on the status quo, as it hasn't really released a new feature or technology in recent years. That may change at its next release event, but investors will need to see what the market demand is for anything that Apple releases, as it could be a flop.
At their core, Alphabet and Apple are two businesses that want to maintain the status quo while expanding when possible. This doesn't really distinguish either of them from the other, so we'll need to examine their finances to determine the true best buy.
Winner: Tie
Alphabet is putting up better growth figures
Since 2023, Apple's growth has been practically nonexistent. That changed in Q3 FY2025 (ending June 28), when it delivered 10% revenue growth and 12% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth.
AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Still, that pales in comparison to Alphabet's growth, which has been far stronger for much longer. In Q2, Alphabet's revenue rose by 14% and diluted EPS increased by 22%. That continues a long-standing streak of Alphabet outperforming Apple from this standpoint, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that pattern continue.
Alphabet's faster growth stems from some of its other divisions, such as Google Cloud and Waymo. Both of these have massive upside and provide growth wings that Apple can't match.
As a result, I think it's fairly clear that Alphabet has far better growth than Apple.
Winner: Alphabet
Alphabet's stock is far cheaper
Valuation is another important consideration, as it's possible that the slower-growing company can be the better investment if it's priced cheap enough. However, that's not the case here. Apple's stock is significantly more expensive than Alphabet's, despite the latter's much slower growth.
Although they used to trade at a similar price-to-earnings (P/E) price tag, a significant gap has opened up since mid-2024. However, after reviewing the growth charts from above, it's clear that Alphabet has grown much faster than Apple during this time frame.
As a result, Apple's stock has become far more expensive than it normally is, while Alphabet is just returning to its usual valuation range. This makes Alphabet a far better buy considering its growth.
Winner: Alphabet"

Both are long-standing leaders in their respective industries, having produced market-beating returns over the past 10 years, but have lagged behind the market in 2025.
However, despite their poor performances this year, Apple and Eli Lilly still appear to be attractive stocks. In fact, they have qualities that make them likely to deliver excellent returns over the long run, making them great forever picks.
1. Apple
Apple has been dealing with the threat of tariffs for the entire year. And although that's a challenge worth monitoring, the company's underlying business remains attractive. For one thing, it consistently records strong financial results. In the third quarter of its fiscal year 2025, ended June 28, revenue increased by 10% year over year to $94 billion.
Apple's devices remain hugely popular. The company noted that its installed base, which it previously reported was above 2.35 billion active devices, has reached yet another all-time high. This happens often enough that it has almost become an expectation when Apple releases quarterly updates.
It's also the engine of Apple's future growth. The company boasts a deep ecosystem, and it's using that to boost its recurring services revenue. That number also reached a brand-new all-time high during Apple's Q3, coming in at $27.4 billion, 13.3% higher than the comparable period of the previous fiscal year.
The company's long-term plan is to increase this high-margin, fee-based source of recurring revenue, which will significantly improve the business's margins and bottom line. With more than 1 billion paid subscriptions to its name across several high-growth industries such as fintech, Apple is already well on its way. Services now account for almost 30% of the company's sales.
Furthermore, Apple generates significant cash flow to invest in research and development (R&D). Although its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts have failed to impress investors so far, it's not out of the question for the company to make a significant and lucrative move in this market eventually.
Finally, Apple is an excellent dividend stock. Despite an unimpressive current forward yield of 0.4%, the company has doubled its dividend in the past decade.
Apple has a lot to offer long-term investors. Despite the issues it has faced this year, its stock remains a worthwhile long-term investment.
2. Eli Lilly
Eli Lilly has faced several setbacks this year. Most recently, orforglipron, one of the company's investigational GLP-1 medicines, led to a 12.4% mean weight loss in patients who were overweight or obese but not diabetic. Wall Street expected more, leading to a sell-off.
However, that's little more than a wrinkle for investors focused on the long game. Lilly should continue dominating the fast-growing weight loss market at least through the end of the decade. Tirzepatide, which it sells under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, could reach sales of almost $62 billion by 2030, an impressive feat for any pharmaceutical product.
Eli Lilly's pipeline in this area is also one of the strongest in the industry. Orforglipron was a smashing success in helping diabetes patients control their A1C levels and lose weight, so the medicine should still help drive top-line growth. And the drugmaker has several other exciting pipeline candidates in this field.
Beyond its core area of expertise, Lilly has a diversified product portfolio and pipeline across areas such as immunology, oncology, and neurological diseases. The company's strong financial results in recent years enabled it to bolster its pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals. So not only is Lilly proving to be an innovative powerhouse, but it's also setting a strong foundation for the future.
Finally, Eli Lilly's dividend profile looks robust. Its forward yield is currently unimpressive at 0.8%, but its dividend has increased by 200% over the past 10 years. The stock's recent dip presents an excellent opportunity for investors to purchase shares and hold them for the long term."

One customer, who successfully secured a new handset for delivery on the September 19 launch date, said it took five minutes for the site to process payments. All time slots for picking up the iPhone 17 Pro Max in person at launch from Apple outlets in Shanghai were booked within 20 minutes.
As of Saturday morning, anyone in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, looking to buy any variant of the iPhone 17 series faced a waiting period extending to October 15, Apple's website showed.
The high demand underscores Apple's strong brand loyalty in China and the appeal of the latest generation of iPhones, despite growing competition in the premium smartphone segment from local competitors like Huawei Technologies, according to analysts.
""Apple has astutely segmented its product line-up, ensuring each model appeals to distinct user needs,"" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at market research firm IDC. ""Collectively, these devices will drive a robust wave of new purchases for the company.""
Earlier this month, consultancy TrendForce projected that global shipments of the iPhone 17 series would be 3.5 per cent higher than those of last year's iPhone 16 line-up, with the Pro series remaining the primary sales driver."

Some Wall Street analysts are already waiting for the next one.
Tech giant Apple's (AAPL) biggest update from this week's new iPhone 17 lineup was a thinner model, which some analysts said exceeded muted expectations—but still left many fans waiting for more.
""The iPhone Air is truly differentiated, sleeker, and thinner in-person than we expected,"" said Morgan Stanley analysts, who came away from the event calling it a ""small positive surprise."" Still, they and others suggested that more highly anticipated updates expected next year could provide a bigger catalyst for the company's stock.
The shares have slipped almost 2% in the days since Apple's iPhone 17 launch to finish Friday's session around $234. They've dropped more than 6% since the start of the year, making it the worst-performing member of the Magnificent 7 for 2025. Until this week, Tesla (TSLA) occupied that title, but a rally to end the week brought its stock closer to break-even for the year.
Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha are divided on whether Apple's stock still has room to rise, with as many neutral as ""buy"" ratings at four each. (Just one analyst tracked has advised selling the stock.) Their mean target around $240 would suggest less than a 3% gain from Friday's level.
Analysts Didn't See Many 'Awe-Inspiring' Moments
Apple Intelligence, HSBC analysts wrote, ""is still not delivering on all promises made in 2024."" They reiterated a neutral rating on the stock after the event.
“The only AI ‘awe-inspiring’ moment, in our view, was AirPods Pro 3's live translation capabilities,"" they said, though UBS and others suggested they don't view the translation features becoming a “meaningful driver” of sales in the next few quarters. UBS also maintained a neutral rating on the stock.
Bullish analysts at Citi this week said the Air may be “laying the groundwork for a foldable phone next year, which we expect could drive a stronger replacement cycle.” Morgan Stanley and others on Wall Street were looking ahead to possible artificial intelligence partnerships and new AI features, including a delayed Siri revamp now widely expected in 2026.
“The most significant Apple Intelligence update is still likely to come in March-June 2026, when we expect a revamped Apple Intelligence, likely powered by a combination of Apple technology, and partner (Google Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic) technology,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.
Still, the Morgan Stanley analysts said they remain optimistic on the stock, and would be buyers of any weakness in the wake of the event."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-13T09:51:00,Meet the $1 Trillion Stock Warren Buffett Has Plowed $77.8 Billion Into Since 2018,Warren Buffett's investments in stocks like Apple and Coca-Cola have propelled Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating returns for six decades.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3c8d8a6ad12cc659febca3b9d674184b792cbf9aadbd1c7d2a48ae57eaf720e5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/1-trillion-stock-warren-buffett-778-billion-2018/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/1-trillion-stock-warren-buffett-778-billion-2018/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/1-trillion-stock-warren-buffett-778-billion-2018/,fool.com,200,,"Warren Buffett has invested in hundreds of different stocks on behalf of his Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.15%) (BRK.B -0.27%) holding company since he became its chief executive officer in 1965. Apple (AAPL 0.78%) is one of his most famous bets; he put $38 billion into the iPhone maker between 2016 and 2023, and that position was valued at more than $170 billion by the start of 2024.
However, Buffett has plowed a whopping $77.8 billion into another stock since 2018 -- more than twice as much as he invested in Apple -- but you won't find it in Berkshire's portfolio.
Buffett's simple investing strategy yields incredible returns
Buffett is a long-term value investor who typically backs companies with steady growth, reliable profits, and strong management teams. He especially likes companies with shareholder-friendly initiatives like stock buyback programs and dividends, because they compound his returns much faster.
Berkshire owns a $302 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, and Apple is just one of many successful investments stemming from Buffett's approach. Coca-Cola (KO -0.31%) is another; he spent $1.3 billion to acquire 400 million shares in the beverage giant between 1988 and 1994, and he has never sold a single one. That position is worth an eye-popping $27.1 billion today, and it will pay Berkshire $816 million in dividends during 2025 alone.
Berkshire also has full ownership of subsidiaries like Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, Clayton Homes, and GEICO Insurance, in addition to numerous companies in the utilities, logistics, and energy industries. These businesses often provide the cash flow that Buffett and his team invests in publicly traded stocks.
Since Buffett took control of Berkshire in 1965, its stock has delivered a compound annual return of 19.9%, nearly double the average annual gain of 10.4% generated by the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.49%) index during the same period. The difference in dollar terms is mind-boggling: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965, it would have grown to a staggering $44.7 million by the end of 2024, whereas the same investment in the S&P would have be worth just $342,906.
Buffett has plowed $77.8 billion into Berkshire stock since 2018
Berkshire now has a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Buffett and his team are constantly scouring the world for new investment opportunities, but only a small number of them are large enough to make a meaningful contribution to Berkshire's growth. An even smaller number fit within Buffett's typical investment criteria.
As a result, Buffett occasionally returns some of Berkshire's spare cash to shareholders when he can't find a good home for it elsewhere. Buybacks are his preferred method rather than dividends, something Berkshire has never paid. Buybacks shrink the number of Berkshire shares in circulation, which organically increases the price per share and raises shareholders' equity stake in the company. Since investors can then sell their shares whenever they like, they can defer any tax liabilities to a time that suits them. Dividends, on the other hand, incur taxes as soon as they are paid.
Buffett has authorized a whopping $77.8 billion worth of buybacks since 2018, which is more than twice as much as he invested in Apple. This is rarely a bad decision given Berkshire's consistent market-beating returns, but it's worth noting that Buffett hasn't authorized any repurchases during the past four quarters.
Berkshire's valuation might be a reason. Its stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.84, which is a 31% premium to its 10-year average of 2.18. Therefore, Buffett might feel the stock is too expensive right now -- he is a value investor, after all.
Expect buybacks to make a comeback
Berkshire can resume buybacks at management's discretion, as long as the balance of its cash, cash equivalents, and holdings in government Treasury bonds is more than $30 billion. Since the conglomerate is sitting on a whopping $344 billion in cash and equivalents right now, that certainly isn't an issue. A large chunk of that cash was raised during the past year as Buffett trimmed some of Berkshire's largest stock holdings, including more than half of its Apple position.
Buffett will step down as CEO at the end of this year and hand the reins to his chosen successor, Greg Abel. That could be another reason for the pause in buybacks -- Buffett probably wants to give Abel an opportunity to decide what to do with Berkshire's enormous cash pile. Perhaps he has new acquisitions in mind and sees less value in returning money to shareholders.
Nevertheless, companies that return money to shareholders are very popular with investors, and they often earn a premium valuation as a result. Therefore, I don't think we've seen the last of Berkshire's buyback program."

Its chips are in high demand, and the company's monster success has pushed the stock up to astronomical heights in recent years.
Investors might be wondering if it's time to look elsewhere when allocating capital, especially since this top AI stock has soared so much. Perhaps it's time to consider a consumer electronics giant, one that investors are undoubtedly familiar with.
Is Apple (AAPL 0.78%) as good a stock as Nvidia? Here's what investors should be thinking about.
The strengths of Apple and Nvidia
These businesses each have many positive traits. There might be no brand on planet Earth that resonates as strongly with consumers as Apple. This comes from consistent innovation and marketing, with products and services that always seem to be in high demand. The company focuses relentlessly on providing a superior user experience.
Apple's ecosystem keeps its users locked in. It's the powerful combination of hardware and software that supports the competitive position, and this helps to drive recurring revenue.
There are few businesses as financially sound as Apple. As of June 28, the company had $31 billion in net cash on the balance sheet. So far in fiscal 2025, it has generated $85 billion in net income.
Nvidia is the dominant force powering the infrastructure buildout in the AI race, with unrivaled market share when it comes to data center graphics processing units (GPUs). Mixing the hardware component with its CUDA software platform has created an ecosystem similar to how Apple operates.
Nvidia's growth has been nothing short of spectacular. Revenue in second-quarter 2026 (ended July 27) of $46.7 billion was 597% higher than in the same period three years ago. With the largest cloud platforms investing hundreds of billions of dollars in combined capital expenditures in 2025 to build the technical infrastructure that supports their AI capabilities, Nvidia is poised to keep benefiting.
Investors in these companies don't have much to complain about. In the past decade, shares of Apple are up 735% (as of Sept. 9). Meanwhile, Nvidia is in a league of its own, with the stock skyrocketing 30,000%. The latter's incredible rise has cemented its position as the world's most valuable business, with a market cap exceeding $4 trillion.
Investing is a personal game
To say that a stock is as good as another one depends on an individual investor's perspective. For instance, those who want to own growth companies at the cutting edge of technology will find no faults with Nvidia, which is the poster child of the AI boom. On the other hand, if you want to add an established winner to the portfolio, then Apple might make more sense.
At the end of the day, what matters perhaps more than anything else is that investors adopt a long-term mindset. This means it's best not to buy a stock unless you are willing to hold it for at least five years, and maybe even much longer than that. Having this mentality reinforces the importance of identifying high-quality companies.
Both Apple and Nvidia are monster businesses worth trillions of dollars. However, it's clear that Apple, due to its more muted expansionary potential, won't necessarily be a top choice for those seeking huge growth. Nvidia is the winner in this department. For those who are more risk-averse, though, Apple is the better option.
This makes it impossible to give a fair comparison. These companies each clearly have their merits. As such, they will attract investors who prioritize certain characteristics over others. What matters most is that portfolio decisions are made as a result of independent thinking, not by copying what others are doing."

Now, in hindsight, I realise how lucky I was to encounter senior female leaders in that environment in my first major job. It built my sense of belonging. I never felt like I was the odd one out and it impacted my whole career in tech and my ability to see myself in it later on.
Every time Lorraine had to push forward a project or get approval, she would engage with every stakeholder, gather their input, address their concerns and only then show up at the big meeting.
Many people come thinking they are prepared because they’ve done the work, but they haven’t brought people along. Lorraine would come in almost knowing it would be approved. I learned that you shouldn’t do it all alone. Input from other people is strategic intelligence and increases your chances of success.
At Google (GOOG) there were a lot of decisions by consensus. That might feel counterintuitive in a business that moves fast and innovates, but they gathered the wisdom of the crowds and then took decisions. As the business grew, you needed alignment to get anything done.
Lorraine was the first person I saw doing that well and sometimes she asked me to prepare for that work too. She was nurturing and even when she had an office, she still mostly sat outside. I remember negotiating my first salary increase with her directly."

On Tuesday at the “Awe Dropping” event, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its iPhone 17 lineup.
Apple has reworked the iPhone 17 Pro lineup, moving away from titanium in favor of a precision-machined aluminum unibody. The new design incorporates a colorful oxide layer and features a full-width camera plateau that also houses antennas.
On Thursday, Phillip Securities analyst Helena Wang downgraded the rating for Apple from Neutral to Reduce and announced a $200 price target, while DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral and maintained the price target of $250.
Trending: Your Last Chance to Invest in Pacaso Before Their Global Expansion — Offer Ends Sept 18
With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.45%, which is a semi-annual dividend amount of 26 cents per share ($1.04 a year).
So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?
To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,327,043 or around 5,769 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $265,455 or around 1,154 shares.
To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.04 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.04 = 5,769 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.04 = 1,154 shares ($100 per month).
Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.
See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.
For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).
Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

(AP) — Apple is putting its trust in a Kentucky plant singled out to become the exclusive producer of the cover glass meant to safeguard every iPhone and Apple Watch sold worldwide by the tech giant.
Specialty glass maker Corning Inc. said Friday it plans to triple production capacity at its plant in Harrodsburg and increase the workforce there by 50%, deepening its relationship with Apple that began when the original iPhone launched in 2007. The Harrodsburg plant made the glass for those first iPhones.
Apple has put its vast financial muscle behind the project, announcing recently it was making a $2.5 billion commitment to enable Corning to produce all the cover glass for the iPhone and Apple Watch at Corning's plant in Harrodsburg, a central Kentucky town of more than 9,000 residents.
It is part of a massive commitment announced by the tech company last month to increase its investment in American manufacturing and which won bipartisan praise from Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.
Corning executives and selected employees spoke to reporters at the plant on Friday. Apple CEO Tim Cook visited the Harrodsburg factory earlier in the day but did not participate in the media event.
“We are transforming the plant once again, by combining Corning and Apple’s expertise to enable production of 100% of the cover glass for the iPhone and the Apple Watch,"" Corning Chief Operating Officer Hal Nelson said Friday. “Together, we are building a next-generation U.S. manufacturing platform to deliver ... high-performance materials for Apple’s iconic products.”
Cook said last month in a news release that the teamwork between Apple and Corning will result in “the largest and most advanced production line ever created for smartphone glass.”
“Thanks to the power of American manufacturing, any customer anywhere in the world who buys a new iPhone or Apple Watch will be holding precision glass made right here in Kentucky,"" he said.
By the end of 2026, all of the cover glass for the iPhone and the Apple Watch will be manufactured at the Harrodsburg plant, Nelson said Friday. Corning's Kentucky plant will be totally devoted to manufacturing for Apple, Corning said.
Regarding Apple's $2.5 billion commitment for the production, Corning said the details are “proprietary” to the two companies. The commitment will include revenue, technology and development teams and “new advanced manufacturing process development,” Corning said.
Corning, based in Corning, New York, says its markets include optical communications, mobile consumer electronics, display, automotive, solar, semiconductors and life sciences."

Shares of language-learning app Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) fell 2.8% in the afternoon session after reports revealed Apple's new AirPods will be able to translate conversations in real time, introducing a significant competitive threat.
The news created volatility for the language-learning app's stock, as a built-in translation feature from a tech giant like Apple could challenge Duolingo's market position. This latest drop adds to a difficult period for the company, which has seen its stock slide significantly over the past three months. Despite the market's negative reaction to the potential competition, some analysts remain positive. For instance, KeyBanc Capital Markets recently reiterated its Overweight rating on the stock ahead of the company's upcoming Duocon event, viewing it as a potential positive catalyst for investor sentiment.
The shares closed the day at $307.91, down 0.5% from previous close.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Duolingo? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Duolingo’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 37 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 8.6% after a positive analyst note highlighted a strategy that could significantly boost future profits.
Citizens JMP maintained its Market Outperform rating and $500 price target, pointing out that Duolingo's push to direct new subscribers to its web platform instead of app stores could increase its 2027 EBITDA by approximately 10%. By bypassing Apple's estimated 20% take rate for a much lower 3% processing fee from services like Stripe, the company stands to make significant savings. This optimistic analysis is supported by the company's strong financial health, including a 41.5% year-over-year revenue increase in its last reported quarter. Other analysts have also recently expressed confidence, with JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley maintaining Overweight ratings due to advancements in AI and monetization.
Duolingo is down 5.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $307.98 per share, it is trading 43% below its 52-week high of $540.68 from May 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Duolingo’s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $2,216.

Uncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward.
The recent 7% decline in ACV Auctions' share price could indicate investor concerns or uncertainties that may affect its long-term growth narrative. Over the past three years, the total shareholder return, which considers both share price and dividends, has been 12.28%. This performance suggests that despite current fluctuations, the company's long-term growth trajectory has been somewhat positive, though it may not be in line with analysts' more bullish expectations.
In the last year, ACV Auctions underperformed compared to the US market's 19.1% return and the US Commercial Services industry's 2.7% return. This underperformance might reflect market skepticism about ACV's ability to overcome challenges like dealer volume softness and fierce competition. The overall market optimism, driven by anticipated interest rate cuts and strong tech stock performance, contrasts ACV's situation, possibly influencing analysts to re-evaluate revenue and earnings forecasts.
ACV Auctions' shares are currently priced at US$10.33, which is significantly below the consensus analyst price target of US$19.73. This suggests a broader disconnect between investor sentiment and analyst expectations. If the current market environment results in revenue growth challenges or slower-than-expected earnings improvements, it may necessitate revised analyst forecasts. Keeping an eye on these developments will be crucial for stakeholders considering ACV's potential to realign with its estimated fair value and achieve its growth goals.

(Reuters) -Device management software provider Jamf is exploring a sale as weakness in its stock price makes it a prime takeover candidate for other companies, according to people familiar with the matter.
Jamf, which is backed by Vista Equity and has a market capitalization of roughly $1.4 billion, is working with investment bankers at Citigroup on the sale, said the people, who requested anonymity speaking about private deal deliberations. The company has been fielding offers from would-be suitors in recent months, they added.
Vista Equity, which owns 34% of the company’s stock, is expected to exit its position in the company as part of Jamf’s sale, the people said.
Vista and Citi declined to comment, while Jamf did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Minneapolis-based Jamf provides device management and security solutions for organizations enabling their IT teams to remotely connect and manage Apple devices such as MacBooks, iPads, and iPhones, at scale.
Though Jamf’s stock has been on an upswing since early August, it's still down more than 40% over the past year and about 59% through Thursday's close since its IPO debut at $26 per share in 2020 as the company struggled to find its path to profitability.
Jamf's loss in the second quarter widened to $20.9 million, from $19.3 million during the same period last year. Still, its second-quarter earnings beat analysts' expectations. The company's revenue rose to $175.5 million, up about 15% year-over-year, and it raised guidance for both the third quarter and the full year.
Vista Equity acquired a majority ownership of Jamf in 2017. In addition to exiting some of its position in Jamf in its IPO, Vista has completed three secondary stock sales and one private block sale, generating close to $1.3 billion in gross proceeds, according to public filings.

Beginning next week, users in more than 150 countries will gain access to this functionality across Apple Watch Series 9, 10, 11, and Ultra 2 and 3 models. Unlike traditional blood pressure cuffs, which provide only periodic readings, the Apple Watch uses its optical heart sensor to track vascular responses over a 30-day period. This longitudinal approach offers a more comprehensive view of blood pressure regulation and allows for earlier identification of risk patterns.
Hypertension is one of the most pervasive and costly chronic conditions, and affects almost half of the adult US population. It contributes to significant rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney failure if left untreated. Early detection and consistent monitoring are critical for prevention, but patients often struggle with adherence to conventional at-home monitoring protocols. The Apple Watch clearance represents a major step forward in addressing this challenge. By embedding FDA-validated monitoring into a widely used consumer device, the barriers to RPM adoption could be lowered. Users who already wear an Apple Watch daily now have access to clinically relevant information without changing their routines.
This clearance is also notable for what it signals about the FDA’s stance on digital health. Wearable devices have long offered features that are used for wellness and clinical utility, but the regulatory approval elevates Apple’s feature into the category of validated medical technology. Such recognition opens the door for broader use of consumer wearables in structured RPM programmes. It also underscores the increasing convergence of consumer electronics and regulated medical devices, a trend likely to accelerate in cardiovascular health and beyond.
The integration of hypertension monitoring into a mass-market wearable aligns with broader trends in healthcare delivery, including the shift towards value-based care and the decentralisation of monitoring from clinics to patients’ homes. The potential benefits include early intervention, improved patient adherence, and reduced costs. Healthcare systems may also find value in integrating Apple Watch data into electronic medical records and care management platforms to enable more seamless coordination across care teams.
Apple’s FDA clearance is more than a product announcement; it represents a broader shift in how chronic disease management is being reimagined. By embedding clinically validated monitoring into a device that millions of people already own, Apple can advance the adoption of RPM significantly. For healthcare providers and patients alike, this could mean more accessible data, earlier interventions, and a path towards more efficient and proactive models of care.

Apple (AAPL, Financials) rolled out the iPhone 17 lineup this week, but the spotlight quickly shifted to one model: the iPhone Air. Analysts say the slimmer, lighter phone may be Apple's bridge to its first foldable iPhone, expected as soon as next year.
Citi called the iPhone Air a groundwork device, pointing to its durability and design as signs Apple is gearing up for bigger changes. The firm kept a Buy rating and $245 target on the stock.
Goldman Sachs also stuck with its bullish stance, noting that Apple managed to squeeze in a 27-hour battery, dual 48-megapixel cameras, and a new A19 Pro chip despite the thinner build. The bank also highlighted Apple's first in-house Wi-Fi chip, which could help the company cut reliance on suppliers.
Wedbush analysts said the bigger story is the upgrade cycle. With 315 million iPhone users holding onto devices more than four years old, the firm sees Apple pushing toward what it calls a potential super cycle over the next 12 to 18 months. It maintained an Outperform rating and $270 price target.
Investors weren't immediately impressed. Apple shares fell about 3% after the event, a drop that has often followed new iPhone launches before rebounding as sales data rolls in.
The bigger question is whether the iPhone Air creates momentum ahead of the first foldable iPhone, which could mark Apple's next major shift in hardware design."

Sep 12 - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares gained 1.7% on Friday morning even as the company delayed the rollout of its new iPhone Air in mainland China.
The delay stems from pending regulatory approval. When pre-orders opened globally, customers in China were unable to place orders for the thinner device, with Apple's website stating that release information would be updated once approval was secured. The company had originally planned to align Chinese availability with the U.S. and other markets on Sept. 12 for pre-orders and Sept. 19 for general sales.
The iPhone Air faces added hurdles in China because it relies on eSIM technology, which is not widely used in the country where physical SIM cards remain standard. The device will initially be offered only through China Unicom and will require customers to activate service in-store.
China remains a critical market for Apple, generating about one-fifth of its global revenue. The company shipped 10.1 million smartphones in the country during the second quarter, up 4% from a year earlier, though rival Huawei regained the top spot with 12.2 million units, Canalys data showed."

Shares of the electric vehicle maker, up about 19% this month through Friday's close, are on a roll. Though it's been bumpy, Tesla (TSLA) stock has climbed off year-to-date lows around $222, seen in March, and is approaching break-even. (The stock, which finished last year near $404, ended the week just below $396, down roughly 2% year-to-date.)
The recovery is notable for a stock that, as of the end of the first half of the year, was the laggard of the Magnificent 7. It was (and still is) one of only two companies in the big-tech grouping in the red, Apple (AAPL) being the other, tailing all three major U.S. indexes. (The Roundhill ETF that tracks the Magnificent 7 group, known as ""MAGS,"" is up almost 16% this year.)
The stock has likely been boosted by factors that have lifted stocks broadly. Investors widely expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates next week, a move generally seen as beneficial to big tech companies. Strong second-quarter earnings growth has offered a measure of optimism to investors attempting to gauge the strength of the economy. (Though there's plenty of concern on that score, too.)
But Tesla-specific factors also seem to be lifting the shares. Despite wariness about the health of the company's EV business, some investors appear willing to pay up for the possibility of a big opportunity in robotics, as well as for signs of progress in autonomous driving at both Tesla and more widely. A costly public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, while not extending valuable EV credits, has apparently cooled.
And Tesla's board has offered CEO Elon Musk a pay package that could remove a ""Will he stick around?"" overhang from the company's outlook—albeit at a high price. (Further enthusiasm for the stock may be attributed to what some see as potential for a ""short squeeze"" in which investors who traded against the shares have to buy it as it rises to cover short bets.)
Wall Street analysts don't appear ready to climb aboard en masse. Visible Alpha tracks about as many combined bearish and neutral ratings as bull calls, while its mean price target around $327 is substantially below current levels. Investors are, nevertheless, driving ahead.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) recently announced that those who were owed money could expect to receive an average of £700 per agreement.
In addition, Lloyds banking group (LLOY.L) said it may need to set aside a “material” sum of extra money to cover the cost of the FCA's scheme. The bank already has a provision of £1.2bn reserved to compensate claimants. However, after considering the FCA's updated guidance, it doesn't believe the reserves will be sufficient.
The long-running saga has weighed heavily on the stocks of the most exposed players. Another impacted lender is Close Brothers (CBG.L), which had previously said it would set aside up to £165m for motor commission costs in the first half of its financial year.
The FCA is still consulting on the scheme, but it is due to open in early 2026.
The car financing scandal involved the mis-selling of financing agreements to customers. It is estimated that 44% of all agreements made since 2007 would be considered unfair, allowing those affected to claim compensation.
""Many firms were not complying with the law or our disclosure rules that were in force when they sold loans to consumers,"" the FCA said at the time.

Several weeks ago, the FCA launched a £1m campaign to raise awareness about compensation. It had previously said that collective payouts relating to the scandal could reach £18bn. However, an average payout of £700 means that the collective total may now be lower than previously thought.
The FCA's campaign aimed to make people aware that they didn't need to use a claims management company (CMC) or law firm to access the scheme.
As part of the campaign, which features radio and online advertising, the FCA said it was teaming up with influencers to get the message to consumers.
Research commissioned by the regulator found that 79% of motor finance customers are aware that they may be entitled to compensation, and 61% are aware of a potential compensation scheme. However, 41% of those aware they may be eligible for a payout didn’t know they wouldn't need to use a claims management company or law firm if a redress scheme is introduced.
The FCA said that using a CMC or law firm to make a motor finance claim could cost consumers around 30% of any compensation paid.

Apple’s iPhone 17 preorder morning split demand in predictable ways, with the Pro Max sliding off launch-day delivery while the Air stumbled in China
Wu Xiaoling/Xinhua via Getty Images
Apple’s preorder opening today laid bare the usual tensions: the models people want most, the ones Apple can ship, and the places where the rules can get in the way. By the time a customer's first cup of coffee had cooled, some Pro Max variants were already slipping into delayed delivery windows. While in China, the ultrathin “Air” got tripped up by regulation.
Suggested Reading
Preorders went live at 8 a.m. ET with first deliveries slated for Friday, Sept. 19. Early readouts showed the iPhone 17 Pro Max drifting beyond launch day — in many cases into early- to mid-October — while the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and the new iPhone Air largely still showed that September delivery date in the U.S.
Related Content
The synchronized rollout had a notable gap. In mainland China, the iPhone Air didn’t make the starting gun. The iPhone Air was pulled from preorder there while eSIM approvals make their way through regulators and carriers — a design choice that plays well globally but hits local policy friction in one of the company’s most important markets.
The rest of the lineup continues on the original timetable in that market, but the pause matters for mix, momentum, and the story Apple wanted to tell about a simultaneous debut. Apple now lists the Air’s release information in China as “to be updated later,” and local carrier support is contingent on regulatory sign-off. China’s three state operators are set to support eSIM, but approvals are still pending. And until the Air clears local hurdles, Apple’s China launch is incomplete.
Pricing landed where Apple set it earlier this week — $799 for the iPhone 17, $999 for the iPhone Air, $1,099 for the iPhone 17 Pro, and $1,199 for the iPhone 17 Pro Max — and the base storage across the lineup is 256 GB.
Color choices are already shaping purchase decisions: the Pro pair ships in cosmic orange, deep blue, and silver (and the absence of a classic black finish is already a subplot in buyer chatter); while the standard 17 comes in black, lavender, mist blue, sage, and white. Those options sound cosmetic, but finish choices can be the difference between a Sept. 19 doorstep and a later delivery, especially when layered with storage tiers.
Carrier economics are doing their annual lift and adding a dose of marketing gloss. Big trade-in deals running into four figures promise “free” upgrades on paper, but the small print is familiar: 24- to 36-month bill credits tied to premium plans. Apple and major retailers are happy to sell phones unlocked at full price, though the richest subsidies sit behind plan commitments. For many buyers, that math — short-term outlay versus long-term lock-in — is as important as launch-day bragging rights. Apple, for its part, is amplifying that message with its own “save up to $1,100 with carrier offers” language as preorders open.
The online chatter has been practical rather than breathless. Preorder threads filled with timestamp screenshots, early complaints about Pro Max ship-date creep, and the same playbook regulars recite every September: use the Apple Store app for speed, pivot to in-store pickup if delivery slips, and keep checking back because pickup slots and stock often pop as systems reconcile. It’s a refresh-the-screen morning, not a sidewalk-camping one.
Put together, today’s tape reads like a familiar launch-day triage. Demand is stacking where Apple’s margins are thickest, the China pause turns a sleek hardware story into a regulatory one, and carrier promotions will shape how many upgrades get pulled forward this weekend versus the next. For buyers who want a specific Pro Max on Sept. 19, the window narrowed early. For everyone else, launch-day delivery is still in reach — at least as of this morning."

Following the presentation, a special video was revealed, featuring the music video for singer Jackson Wang's latest single Let Loose.

The cage provides multiple mounting points for external accessories while ensuring dual-layer protection for the device.
Another key addition is the FilMov Magnetic Photography Phone Case for iPhone 17 Pro Series.

With support for attachable lenses, filters, handles, lights, microphones, and docks, it instantly converts the iPhone into a professional shooting rig.

Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) is a glass manufacturer that caters to the needs of the smartphone, telecommunications, and other industries. It has been in the news over the past couple of months primarily due to being Apple’s supplier for the iPhone. Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW)’s shares benefited from Apple’s $600 billion US investment in August, which included a $2.5 billion plan to produce all the cover glass for its iPhone and Apple Watch in the US. Cramer is Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW)’s fan and this time, he almost called the firm a national treasure:
“But Corning is, you know one of the best to make glass in the world. I think people feel we can’t do a lot of stuff. We’re the most efficient and we’re the best, this thing dates back from when the Air Force wanted glass. To be able to compete against the Soviets. And, it is, I’ll tell you, I get great joy about the fact that when we have a little pride. It’s not left or right. It’s just pride.”

Cramer’s optimism for Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW) has also led him to endorse the stock as he recently remarked:
“I’d rather buy a Corning which is up. Now I think Corning is a terrific situation. They’ve got all, they’ve got the glass, talk about the ability to have a supply chain.”

- A new malware named “ModStealer” targets crypto wallets across multiple operating systems.
- It spreads via fake recruiter ads and has remained undetected by major antivirus engines.
- The malware can steal private keys from 56 different browser wallet extensions.
A new cross-platform malware named “ModStealer” actively targets crypto wallets while remaining undetected by major antivirus software.
The malware is reportedly built to steal sensitive data from users on macOS, Windows, and Linux systems. It has been active for nearly a month before its discovery.
On Sept. 11, first detailed by 9to5Mac, an Apple product-focused publication, in a conversation with the Apple device management firm Mosyle, ModStealer spreads through fake job recruiter ads aimed at developers.
This method is a form of deception similar to sophisticated social engineering scams that have recently resulted in massive crypto user losses.
Beyond crypto wallets, the malware also targets credential files, configuration details, and certificates. It uses a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file written with NodeJS to avoid detection by traditional signature-based security tools.
How ModStealer Operates
The malware establishes persistence on macOS by abusing Apple’s launchctl tool, allowing it to run silently in the background as a LaunchAgent. Data is then sent to a remote server located in Finland but tied to infrastructure in Germany, a method likely used to hide the operator’s actual location.
Mosyle’s analysis found that it targets explicitly 56 different browser wallet extensions, including those on Safari, to extract private keys, highlighting the importance of using secure decentralized crypto wallets.
The malware can also capture clipboard data, take screenshots, and execute remote code, giving attackers near-total control over an infected device.
This discovery follows other recent security breaches in the crypto ecosystem. Earlier this week, a widespread NPM supply chain attack attempted to compromise developers using spoofed emails to steal credentials.
That attack aimed to hijack transactions across multiple chains, including Ethereum ETH $4 106 24h volatility: 3.4% Market cap: $495.80 B Vol. 24h: $55.68 B and Solana SOL $203.1 24h volatility: 3.7% Market cap: $111.03 B Vol. 24h: $11.01 B , by swapping crypto addresses.
However, it was largely contained, with attackers stealing only about $1,000, a minor sum compared to other major crypto heists where hackers have successfully laundered and reinvested millions in stolen assets.
Researchers at Mosyle believe ModStealer fits the profile of a “Malware-as-a-Service” (MaaS) operation. This model, increasingly popular with cybercriminals, involves selling ready-made malware to affiliates who may have minimal technical skills.
Mosyle stated the threat is a reminder that signature-based protections alone are not enough and that behaviour-based defences are necessary to stay ahead of new attack vectors.

Now time for some of today's training tickers. We are watching Warner Brothers, Google, Amazon and Apple.
First up, Warner Brothers, the stock extending gains on reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a bid for the media company.
The Wall Street Journal reporting the majority of the planned bid for Warner will be made up of cash.
Warner Brothers had a nearly $33 billion market cap prior to the Journal's report on the potential bid, more than double that of Paramount Skydance.
A bid has not yet been submitted. The plans could still fall apart. We'll have more on this in the next hour.
Next up, Google and Amazon. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether the tech giants misled advertisers that placed ads on their websites, according to Bloomberg.
The investigations focus on whether the companies properly disclosed the terms and pricing for ads, according to the sources cited.
The FTC probes mark a new front in regulatory scrutiny of Google and Amazon, even as top technology firms' executives try to win over President Trump.
And finally, Apple, delaying the launch of its new iPhone Air in mainland China, according to Bloomberg.
The reason behind the delay due to regulatory approval issues. When pre-orders for the new models began today, the company's China website would not let customers in the region order the new thinner device.
Instead, a message reads, Release information will be updated later. All models will be released after approval.

“AppLovin has repeatedly proven that its phenomenal growth will continue for the foreseeable future, and at a staggering profit margin,” Wedbush analysts wrote.
They expect momentum in gaming and “increased spending on user acquisition (UA), and layering in ecommerce” to boost results this year.
According to Wedbush, UA spending on mobile games totals more than $30 billion annually, with the portion spent on third-party games nearly tripling in recent years to about $15 billion.
The firm said it expects the UA market to keep growing, aided by the Apple vs. Epic case, which is “likely becoming a tailwind for AppLovin next year.”
The analysts flagged key near-term catalysts, including AppLovin’s international expansion in late Q3 and the launch of its self-serve tool on October 1.
They added that “AXON 2.0 should maintain its leadership, with 20 – 30% annual growth easily achievable through market growth.”
Wedbush said its new price target is based on an EV/EBITDA multiple of 37x on 2027 estimates and views current forecasts as conservative.
“A combination of ecommerce success and web store migration should drive significant growth for at least the next three years,” the note said.
The firm also emphasised AppLovin’s advantages in performance marketing, noting: “We believe AppLovin’s moat is securee; even as competitors will ultimately close the gap toward its proprietary technology. AppLovin’s training data will have learned exponentially more over that time, creating a vast delta in its performance capability vs. peers.”
Wedbush concluded that AppLovin is positioned to sustain “20 – 30% top-line growth” with margins of 80–85%, supported by both demand and supply expansion in mobile gaming.

Key Notes
- The ONDO price rally on September 12 comes with a sharp rise in trading and derivatives activity.
- The rally coincides with a boom in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), with Ondo’s TVL rising to $1.56B.
- Analysts eye a breakout past $1.08 that could open the door for a move toward $2.10.
ONDO ONDO $0.81 24h volatility: 5.7% Market cap: $2.54 B Vol. 24h: $225.73 M , the native cryptocurrency of Ondo Finance, has gained another 6% on Sept. 12, extending its weekly rally to more than 15%. The bullish sentiment comes amid rising tokenized RWA assets on the platform, along with strong on-chain metrics.
Ondo Finance Sees Uptick in RWA Tokenized Assets
Over the past week, RWA tokens have staged a strong rally, with market capitalization climbing from $67 billion to nearly $76 billion over the past week. According to data from RWZ.xyz, the total value of tokenized assets on-chain surpassed $29 billion for the first time.
Ondo Finance has been one of the key contributors to this sectoral momentum. Earlier this week, on Sept. 9, Ondo partnered with Trust Wallet to introduce tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds. This allows global users to trade equities such as Apple and Tesla directly on-chain through the decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch.
This year, in 2025, Ondo Finance has seen substantial growth with the total value locked on the protocol rising from $650 million in January to $1.56 billion as of Sept. 12, based on DefiLlama data.
ONDO Price Prepares for Another 100% Upside
Today’s ONDO price rally comes with a 100% surge in daily trading volume to $430 million. Derivatives activity around Ondo also surged. Data from CoinGlass shows open interest climbed 14% to $585.74 million, while ONDO futures trading volume spiked 67% to $1.38 billion. Amid the rising demand for the altcoin, 21Shares filed for spot ONDO ETF back in July.
The near-term outlook for ONDO price looks bullish at the moment. ONDO is holding above the $1.01 support level on the daily chart. Sustained demand at this floor could lift the token to a six-month high of $1.23. A breakout above that resistance may pave the way for further gains toward $1.40.
Market analysts also stage the possibility of a 100% upside here to $2.10. ONDO is approaching a potential breakout after 190 days of consolidation. Technical charts show a head-and-shoulders bottom forming on the higher time frame.
As shown in the image above, the token is testing neckline resistance as $1.08. Breaking past this could set the stage for another 100% upside to its December 2024 highs of $2.10.
Maxi Doge Raises Over $2 Million
Along with ONDO rally, memecoin presale project Maxi Doge has successfully raised more than $2 million in presale fundraise. Maxi Doge distinct from the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has quickly gained traction in the crypto presale market. The project promotes the idea that “there’s nothing a degenerate can’t do if they put their mind to it,” a message resonating with retail investors.
Current Presale Stats:
- Current price: $0.000257
- Amount raised so far: $2.070 million
- Ticker: MAXI
The presale price is set to be adjusted in less than two days. Purchases are available via debit or credit card, as well as cryptocurrency. Moreover, the project has already secured a spot among the best crypto presales of 2025, attracting attention from the meme coin community.

Newcastle Building Society said its First Step mortgage will let buyers borrow up to 98% of a home's value with a minimum deposit of just £5,000. The mortgage allows borrowing of £96,000 to £350,000 and has a five-year fixed mortgage rate.
However, the lender said that one condition of the mortgage was that the money for the deposit could not be gifted.
According to a report by The Times, Newcastle Building Society head of commercial and product development Ben Smith, said: “First-time buyers continue to face real challenges with rising house prices, higher rental costs and the cost of living. It’s especially difficult for those who don’t have access to the bank of mum and dad.""
""That’s why we’ve launched this mortgage to give more options to those who have worked hard to save and have built a deposit by themselves.""

As house prices continue to rise, more hopeful first-time buyers have been forced to rely on help from family to get on the property ladder. The average price of a UK home hit a record high of £299,331 in August, according to figures released by lender Halifax last week.
Some 173,500 (52%) of first-time buyers got help from the ""bank of mum and dad"" last year, receiving an average £55,572, according to research published by estate agents Savills in May.
At the same time, separate research released on Monday found that rising financial pressures are prompting a growing number of UK retirees to reduce the financial support they provide to younger generations.
The report by wealth manager and financial adviser Quilter found that 13% of retirees plan to cut back on gifting to children and grandchildren.
Quilter's report, which was based on a survey of 5,001 retirees, showed the average retiree currently spends over £2,500 annually supporting younger family members – £1,323 in gifts and £1,175 towards education.
Earlier this week, we asked Yahoo Finance UK readers if they believed that the bank of mum and dad was essential to getting on the property ladder. We received 1,108 votes, with 65% of respondents believing that it was necessary, while 25% disagreed and 10% were undecided on the matter.

Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading manufacturer of consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Shares declined amid mounting headwinds, including new U.S. tariffs on Apple’s China centric supply chain, which are pressuring gross margins, and increased regulatory scrutiny of the App Store model in both the U.S. and Europe. These developments have introduced greater uncertainty around the growth and profitability of Apple’s high margin services business. While we continue to admire Apple’s brand, ecosystem, and long-term innovation capabilities, the ongoing regulatory overhang and heightened risk to margins and growth prospects led us to exit the position and reallocate capital to holdings with more compelling risk/return profiles.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Sep 12 - Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) shares surged about 29% Thursday and 10% on early Friday trading after reports that Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ:PSKY) is preparing a majority-cash offer for the media company, according to a Thursday report.
The proposed bid would target WBD's entire business, the film studio, streaming services and cable networks, and would be backed by the Ellison family, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal.
Paramount Skydance, which recently completed its merger with Paramount, climbed in early trading. Netflix (NFLX) fell about 4% and other streaming peers eased as traders weighed the prospect of a bigger consolidation wave that could draw interest from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
No formal offer has been filed and plans could still falter, Reuters and other outlets added. Analysts warned the scale of a deal would create complex financing needs and invite antitrust scrutiny, while WBD's planned split of streaming and linear operations could shape any approach.
The moves pushed options volume sharply higher and marked one of WBD's strongest trading days in years. Deal details and timelines remain unclear."

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): AAPL underperformed in Q2 despite reporting solid results. The company posted revenue of $95.4 billion and EPS of $1.65, with growth in both iPhone and Services. However, investor response to Apple’s AI roadmap, unveiled at WWDC in June, was mixed. While Apple introduced several new on-device AI features under its “Apple Intelligence” initiative, the market viewed the rollout as more incremental compared to peers.

Here's why I'm not celebrating yet

“Success! Your registration form has been submitted successfully. If you are indeed a member of the class, you will receive formal notice later this year.”
That’s the message you get when you register to receive your personal piece of the $1.5 billion that Anthropic, maker of the popular AI chatbot Claude, has proposed to pay authors after the company was found to have illegally acquired pirated books from notorious online “shadow libraries.” The deal, announced last week, would cover roughly 500,000 pirated titles, with rights holders set to be compensated $3,000 per work — hence that eye-watering $1.5 billion overall price tag.
The terms, if finalized, would make for the largest publicly reported copyright payout in U.S. history and a benchmark for other AI cases pending against OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and others.
But for authors — at least for me — the news feels a bit like buying a scratch ticket, getting excited as the cherries seem to be lining up, and then finding out that you won $60. Maybe. A moment of glee followed by a long, sobering look at the fine print.
A lot of fine print
If you’ve only scanned the headlines, you might think the ground has been cleared. But in reality, where we’ve landed looks more like the beginning of an administrative nightmare.
At a hearing on Monday, Judge William Alsup called the deal proposal “nowhere close to complete,” postponing preliminary approval and insisting on basic mechanics before any checks go out to the likes of me: a definitive list of covered works, a feasible notice and claims process, plus clear allocation rules for when multiple parties share ownership.
In other words, the court wants a real, workable, detailed process for distributing the funds — and this within an industry, traditional publishing, in which it’s often the case that several parties have claims to rights. Authors retain copyrights to their books, but get publishing deals by licensing those works to companies like Macmillan, Penguin, and Hachette (my publisher). Beyond that, you may also have co-authors, work-for-hire agreements, estates, illustrators, and translators involved.
The bottom line here? The checks are very much not in the mail, and you shouldn’t hold your breath.
Then there are the complex details of the judge’s legal findings and the mixed feelings they’re inspiring across the industry. Alsup’s original ruling, which landed this summer, effectively split the legal baby. He held that training on lawfully obtained books is fair use — a major win for AI developers — while leaving authors’ claims regarding illegally acquired datasets (those from “shadow libraries,” etc.) very much alive. This paints the problem as dirty sourcing, not the unauthorized use of the underlying material.
The proposed settlement is meant to resolve the piracy angle: Anthropic would delete and pay damages for the unlawful copies, while the deal preserves future claims about model outputs if Claude reproduces protected text. But even if this settlement goes forward, other courts could still reach different conclusions about AI training itself, remaining open to the argument that transformative training on lawfully acquired materials is fair use.
So for authors who object to unauthorized use of their books for AI training, the issue is far from resolved, and if anything, looks set back, even as dozens of other cases wind their way through the legal system.
Nor is every author happy with the idea of receiving $3,000 per work as compensation. “Authors tend to say [the proposed settlement] is not punitive enough and no amount of money will ever be sufficient,” Jane Friedman, a widely respected publishing-industry analyst, wrote in her newsletter, The Bottom Line. “Others, especially those who argue AI training is fair use, say authors and publishers have hit the jackpot and that little or no market harm has been done.”
Who’s actually in the class? Am I?
One of the judge’s biggest questions is who exactly is in the class — an interest that I share.
For now, eligibility turns on whether Anthropic (allegedly!) downloaded a given book and whether that book was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office within certain relevant timeframes. From what I can tell, I’m eligible. My book was published and registered for copyright by my publisher in 2021, one of the years covered, and my book has also turned up in similar cases, such as the one against Facebook parent company Meta. But as yet, there seems to be no firm way of knowing. Many authors have no idea.
Worse, some authors are discovering an even more painful wrinkle. One thing the Anthropic case has made clear is that some publishers never registered for copyright of some of their titles — or if they did, did so too late. The plaintiffs have been ordered to deliver a final list of works and a fleshed-out plan in mid-September, with another hearing shortly after. If the judge is satisfied, preliminary approval could still happen this fall. If not, a trial is set for December. If you’re still following me here, and you don’t have a law degree, you’re probably feeling dizzy, the details whizzing, gnat-like, around your brain. Understandably, that’s how a lot of authors and observers feel, too.
About that $3,000
Who doesn’t want a random $3,000 check to materialize in their mailbox? I know I do. But here’s why that’s unlikely to happen. The figure is a before-everything number. “Before everything” means it doesn’t include class-action fees, expenses, author-publisher contract splits, potential taxes, and probably some other figures I’m not even aware of.
In other words, the $1.5 billion proposed settlement figure looks substantial. Heck, it may even be substantial. But to get a slice, a lot of pieces need to click together first, and the net number may be a lot closer to your winnings from PTA bingo night.
Believe me, I’m not complaining. As I’ve written before, realizing one’s lifelong author dreams tends to be a long, ongoing lesson in humility — less the stuff of A Star Is Born, more like a combo of Office Space and The Wrestler.
For the publishing industry, however, the overall figure is consequential. Until recently, it looked as if large-scale book piracy by AI companies would go unchecked. Now there looks to be some legal template for protecting rights holders. And that’s not nothing."

A newly discovered cross-platform malware dubbed ModStealer is slipping past antivirus systems and targeting crypto wallets on Windows, macOS, and Linux, according to researchers at Apple device security firm Mosyle.
Key Takeaways:
- ModStealer malware is evading antivirus detection and targeting crypto wallets across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- The malware spreads via fake job ads and extracts private keys, credentials, and wallet data.
- Researchers warn that ModStealer is part of a growing Malware-as-a-Service trend.
ModStealer has remained undetected by major antivirus engines since it was first uploaded to VirusTotal nearly a month ago, 9to5Mac reported on Thursday.
The malware is being distributed through fake job recruiter ads aimed at developers, a growing tactic among cybercriminals.
Victims Tricked into Running Malicious JavaScript File
Victims are tricked into running a malicious JavaScript file written in NodeJS, which avoids detection by traditional signature-based defenses.
Unlike more basic infostealers, ModStealer comes loaded with features designed for stealth and scale.
It targets 56 browser-based crypto wallet extensions, including those on Safari, and is capable of extracting private keys, credentials, configuration files, and certificates.
Clipboard and screen capture tools are also embedded, alongside remote code execution, which can give attackers near-total control of an infected device.
On macOS, the malware uses Apple’s launchctl tool to gain persistence by embedding itself as a LaunchAgent.
From there, it silently monitors activity and sends data to a remote server believed to be hosted in Finland but routed through German infrastructure.
Researchers believe ModStealer is part of a growing Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystem, where advanced malware packages are sold to affiliates who deploy them without needing technical expertise.
This mirrors a wider trend in the cybercrime space: infostealers now dominate Mac malware, with Jamf reporting a 28% surge in such threats in 2025 alone.
The implications for crypto users are especially severe, given the malware’s focus on wallet extensions and sensitive blockchain credentials.
“This isn’t just a Mac issue anymore,” said Mosyle in a statement. “The cross-platform nature of ModStealer, combined with its stealth and MaaS distribution model, represents an evolving threat to developers, traders, and enterprises alike.”
With its focus on evading antivirus systems, the campaign highlights the need for more advanced, behavior-based security solutions.
Investor Loses $3M in Crypto Phishing Scam
As reported, a cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to a phishing scam, losing $3.05 million in Tether (USDT) after unknowingly signing a malicious blockchain transaction.
The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders.
The attacker exploited a common habit among crypto users: validating only the first and last few characters of a wallet address while ignoring the middle.
Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report.
Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.

The board of Tesla (TSLA 1.15%) recently answered this question when it revealed its proposed compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which could be worth more than $1 trillion.
At first glance, that sounds crazy. However, if you look at the details, it may not be so crazy after all.
Tesla needs Elon...
Tesla currently trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 200 -- unlike more traditional car companies like Toyota (TM 1.01%) and General Motors (GM 1.29%), which both trade at P/E ratios of about 9. That's largely because of Musk's high-tech vision for the company, which includes developing fully self-driving robotaxis and autonomous humanoid robots. That's a powerful incentive for Tesla's board to keep Musk at the helm.
But is it really worth $1 trillion?
Well, although the ""trillion-dollar"" aspect of the pay package has been highlighted, it's not like Tesla's board is just planning to hand Musk $1 trillion in cash. Instead, the compensation -- which consists largely of additional Tesla stock awards -- is broken up into 12 ""tranches,"" with each tranche tied to a particular performance-based milestone. If Musk doesn't meet that milestone within 10 years, he doesn't get that tranche of shares.
One milestone requires Musk to revitalize Tesla's struggling auto sales, reaching 20 million total cumulative vehicle sales within 10 years (the company has currently sold about 8 million over its lifetime). Others require him to successfully develop new products, including full self-driving EVs, robotaxis, and autonomous humanoid robots.
The remaining metrics include adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) minimums, which are tied to the company's earnings and not its share price, and increasing Tesla's market capitalization to $8.6 trillion, roughly an eightfold increase from its current $1.1 trillion valuation. Those are tall orders.
...more than Elon needs Tesla
Lately, Musk seems to have lost interest in electric vehicles. That's hardly surprising: He's always been a futurist, and now that EVs are everywhere -- practically every major automaker currently produces at least one -- he's more excited by the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.
But he doesn't necessarily need to pursue those technologies through Tesla.
Musk already owns an AI company (xAI), where he could easily pursue future autonomous technologies. He could also develop them through a brand-new company: He could call it ""Musk's Marvelous Mannequins!"" Given his past successes, personal wealth, and current high profile, he'd likely have no trouble raising capital.
True, Tesla has already done a lot of work on autonomous self-driving and its Optimus line of humanoid robots, but Musk exercises significant control over Tesla's board, so it would probably be pretty easy for him to engineer a spinoff or sale of those business lines to a different company he controls.
What Tesla can offer
One thing Musk can't bestow on himself is the title ""World's First Trillionaire.""
Departing Tesla and trying to pursue automation, AI, and robotics through xAI or a new company would involve a lot of costs and complications. Meanwhile, Tesla's stock would almost certainly take a hit, and although Musk's 13% stake in Tesla only makes up about one-third of his current $435 billion net worth, nobody likes to lose tens of billions of dollars (though, to be fair, most of us will never have that opportunity).
While I can't speak for Musk, I know that if someone offered me a job that could result in my becoming the world's first trillionaire, I'd be unlikely to turn it down, even if I wasn't particularly excited about some of the job duties, and even if some of the milestones would be difficult to achieve. For Musk, it's probably a worthwhile trade-off.
From a Tesla investor's perspective, if Elon Musk can develop working self-driving cars, robotaxis, and autonomous humanoid robots within 10 years, plus grow Tesla's market cap eightfold, he probably deserves the payout he'd get. This makes this pay package -- eye-popping though it is -- a win-win for Tesla shareholders."

The sign was seemingly at odds to Dryrobe founder Gideon Bright's vision of a product protecting from the winter elements after emerging from the surf, as well as a convenient way of changing into warm clothes.
But, ever since public health advice to venture outdoors during COVID, Dryrobe has somehow found itself swimming against some divisive tides, as sightings of the oversized, innovative fleece-lined coats grew.

There are now Facebook and Reddit groups on ‘Dryrobe spotters’, while the brand has been hashtagged with #britishproblems and detractors have come up with phrases such as ‘Dryrobe W*****s’ and ‘grim reaper silhouettes’.
Last month, those groups were awash with images of Angela Rayner when the then-deputy prime minister was spotted wearing a camouflage and pink Dryrobe number and sipping a glass of rosé by the Sussex coast.
The previous week, Yahoo Finance UK had published a timely interview with the brand's founder where Bright admitted that he found the Dryrobe memes “weird”.
Why are Dryrobes so divisive to some?
The anti-sentiment seems to be placed on the garment being worn in drier places away from the coast — supermarkets, parks or a city centre. It has been reported that Dryrobe wearers simply take up too much space for some people.
“The drier the place is, the higher my chances of spotting one,” one tabloid journalist wrote.
“The exclusive price, celebrity endorsement and distinctive look have made Dryrobes a fashion statement,” chimed the Mail on Sunday. “They are now as likely to be seen in the organic aisle of Waitrose as in the rugged outdoors, much to the chagrin of hardy sportspeople. This makes them divisive.”
Bright, meanwhile, is undeterred and fully embraces those consumers who wear his product on the side of a sports pitch or walking the dog. It’s a disregard, he says, for a ""normal"" look.
“We created something that didn't exist before and there are very few brands I think that do that, and for it to be what it is is amazing,” Bright tells Yahoo Finance UK.
“It has always been about nature and, with my kids, dragging them out when they don't want to go down to the beach and you've got something to chuck on them or if we’re walking in the woods.”
He also told the Financial Times recently that “I wear it pretty much everywhere. It makes a lot of sense to me to wear it out when it’s freezing.”"

1. Farfield Hall, Addingham, West Yorkshire, £2.85m
This Grade I listed, 14,200 square foot Georgian mansion lies in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales.
Built in the 1720s from plans approved by Lord Burlington — known as the architect earl — it was occupied by a succession of families for over 200 years before being sold to the local council in 1947 and used as a home for the elderly. In 1990 it returned to private ownership and now requires full restoration.
Rooms are well proportioned with a wealth of period panelling and plasterwork, and it comes with a large coach house and gardens of around six and a half acres. Contact Carter Jonas.
2. Corsindae Estate, Sauchen, Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, offers over £4.4m
Rolling hills provide the backdrop to an estate so vast that it even boasts a loch and island of its own. The 1,080 acres include arable, pasture and grazing land and woodland, plus landscaped gardens.
The estate is centred around a turreted 15th century tower house where accommodation is spread over four floors and includes five reception rooms and six bedrooms.
Planning permission has been granted to convert the recently-restored laundry room into a two-bedroom annex, and three rental cottages and a holiday let generate extra income. Through Savills.

It features 11 bedrooms, a magnificent drawing room — once the ballroom — a dining room, library, numerous other reception rooms, an adjoining three-bedroom duplex and a private chapel with a bell tower and stained glass windows.
Five secondary houses are all currently tenanted, and there’s potential to establish an equestrian centre or glamping business. Get in touch with Fisher German.
4. Appleby Castle Estate, Boroughgate, Cumbria, £6.75m
It’s rare to find a Norman castle for sale, let alone one as intact as Appleby Castle. The Grade I listed sandstone fortress is set in 25 acres of parkland with a Norman keep, a 13th-century round tower, three cottages, a tennis court and fishing rights on the River Eden."

Analysts gave their thoughts — as well as ratings and estimates — on Apple’s future following the unveiling of its iPhone 17 lineup on Tuesday
Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
At Apple’s keynote event on Tuesday, it showcased the iPhone 17 lineup, including its new iPhone Air, alongside updated Watches and AirPods.
Suggested Reading
Investors weighed in on the tech giant’s latest rollout before, during, and after the event, sending the stock downwards by about 4.1% since last Friday. Now, analysts are chiming in with their views on the iPhone maker's future after its big fall unveiling.
Related Content
Some were impressed with what they saw.
“The iPhone Air is more ‘Awe Dropping’ than we expected,” Morgan Stanley analysts, including Erik Woodring, said in a Thursday report.
However, a thinner, sleeker iPhone isn’t all analysts noticed from Apple's Tuesday exhibit. Here’s what they had to say.
Analysts’ ratings and estimates
Most analysts that shared their reports with Quartz gave a less-than-eager rating for Apple, with two giving the green light to buy.
This falls in line with a recent Bloomberg report that found only 55% of analysts the outlet tracked recommend buying Apple’s stock, based on data it had compiled. The outlet added this is “extremely low” for megacaps.
“While we wait to adjust our estimates until we start tracking iPhone lead times (this Friday), we believe our next 12 month estimates are biased upwards, and therefore would be buyers of weakness after [Wednesday’s] stock underperformance,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.
It holds its overweight rating with a price target of $240 on a calendar-year 2026 earnings per share of $8.30.
Morgan Stanley’s rating is due to Apple’s “largest base of pent up iPhone demand ever (i.e. most elongated replacement cycles), new AI features rolling out (slowly) around the world, and a renewed focus on device form factor changes,” adding it believes “Apple can accelerate iPhone growth starting in FY26, before replacement cycles contract in the 2 years thereafter.”
“Longer-term, investments in AI, payments, cloud, health, and home, and long runway to grow spend per user from $1/day today are key arguments for sustained long-term growth and value creation,” it continued.
Wedbush analysts, including the firm’s global head of technology research Daniel Ives, gave Apple an outperforming rating and a $270 12-month price target on Tuesday.
Wedbush said some potential risks to attaining its price target and rating include increasing competition, pricing, technology shifts, and macroeconomic conditions, as well as Apple’s product strategy in China and Apple’s ability to ramp up its software and services business, among other factors.
Wamsi Mohan, a research analyst at BofA Securities, gave Apple a buy rating, according to a Wednesday note.
He said BofA upped its PO to $270 from $260 on 32x calendar-year 2026 EPS estimate due to Apple’s Pro model with 256GB starting at $1,099 compared to last year’s 128GB model that started at $999.
BofA Securities increased its revenue and EPS estimate for fiscal year 2026 from $446 billion with a $8.03 EPS to $448 billion with a $8.05 EPS, Mohan said, adding a calendar-year 2026 EPS estimate of $8.40, moving up from $8.37.
In a Thursday note, JPMorgan analysts gave Apple an overweight rating.
Jefferies analysts in a Tuesday note gave a hold rating with a $205.82 price target.
The iPhone 17
The iPhone 17 lineup includes an enhanced display, better durability, increased battery life, an improved camera, and a minimum of 256GB storage.
“From a GM perspective, the increase in base storage and camera upgrades across the lineup could be offset by the move to Apple's in-house modem (C1X) for the Air, the N1 in-house networking chip for all models (supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread), the move back to aluminum for Pro models, and slightly higher starting price for the Air/Pro models,” Mohan said.
Wedbush analysts said that because of “the complex tariff environment” Apple raised the cost of the iPhone 17 Pro by $100 to $1,099 as it continues to produce the majority of U.S. sold iPhones in India.
“Despite modestly higher iPhone prices — primarily a function of eliminating low-end storage SKUs — trade-in values and U.S. wireless carrier promotions are more favorable Y/Y, which actually makes the iPhone 17 family more affordable Y/Y, a potential tailwind to iPhone upgrade rates,” Morgan Stanley said.
It added that “Apple kept like-for-like iPhone 17 pricing largely unchanged with last year's iPhone 16 models, while reducing pricing for legacy models by $100 Y/Y, similar to last year.”
Morgan Stanley forecasts the iPhone 17 lineup will account for 66% of fiscal year 2026 shipments flat year-over-year.
Apple’s future opportunities
Wedbush estimates that about 325 million out of 1.5 billion iPhone users worldwide haven’t upgraded their phones in over four years, leading to an “upgrade opportunity” for Apple “with China front and center.”
Morgan Stanley analysts said they were “more impressed” with the look and capabilities of the iPhone Air than they previously expected — although they think it's unlikely to perform well in China.
“[We] could see this being a device that helps to improve iPhone upgrade rates over the next 12 months, though it remains a device unlikely to sell well in China given it features eSIM vs. China’s strict rules around physical SIM cards,” they said.
“The company’s focus on much-improved internal product efficiencies balanced with bold redesigns and practical new features interwoven with Apple Intelligence sets Apple up to launch towards an eventual super cycle over the next 12 to 18 months while the company looks to improve its AI strategy that's holding the stock back,” Wedbush said.
“Apple can position itself to lead in delivering AI at the edge, and increased use of its own silicon (A19/A19 Pro chips, C1X modem) and AI hardware enhancements (neural accelerators in each GPU core, thermal management) should help in that effort,” Mohan said.
But Morgan Stanley analysts don’t expect any major Apple Intelligence announcements until the end of the year, when they said it's “possible” Apple Intelligence gets approved in China.
“The most significant Apple Intelligence update is still likely to come in March-June 2026, when we expect a revamped Apple Intelligence, likely powered by a combination of Apple technology, and partner (Google Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic) technology,” they added.
Stock movement
Apple shares popped ahead of the keynote but slipped as the event wrapped, down about 1.7% an hour after the event ended. Its stock fell around 3% in the morning after the event.
“As in past years, shares were down after the event, but historically have recovered 30-60 days post event,” Mohan said.
Apple’s stock closed up 1.43% on Thursday.

Paramount Skydance, a media conglomerate itself only formed a month ago from a merger, is preparing an all cash bid for the rival media titan, which owns the famed Warner Bros movie studio as well as Eurosport.
Warner Bros Discovery’s New York listed shares surged as much as 37pc on Thursday while Paramount Skydance rose 14pc after the deal first emerged.
The takeover bid, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is set to be for the whole Warner Bros Discovery empire, including its US cable networks and its movie studio.
It comes after Warner has been struggling to convince investors that it can compete in the streaming market with key rivals such as Disney, Netflix and Apple.
In June, it said it would split the company into two, one based on television stations such as CNN, TNT Sports, and the other on movie production and streaming.
David Zaslav, Warner’s chief executive, said the break-up would allow “the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape”.
Earlier this week, Mr Zaslav told investors at a Goldman Sachs conference: “We expect sometime in April that the companies will be split. Everything’s on track.”
Paramount Skydance owns television channels such as Comedy Central and Channel 5 as well as the Paramount+ streaming service and movie production.
It was formed in August after Paramount, the TV and film studio formerly known as ViacomCBS, agreed to an $8bn (£6.3bn) merger deal with Skydance.
The group is led by David Ellison, the producer behind films such as Top Gun: Maverick and who founded Skydance in 2006.
He is the son of technology billionaire Larry Ellison, one of the world’s richest men, with a fortune valued at $383bn.
The father’s wealth surged earlier this week to over $400bn after the IT giant he founded, Oracle, revealed unexpectedly strong sales.
It is understood that Paramount’s bid for Warner is backed by the Ellison family, although it has not yet been submitted.
Any takeover involving two of the world’s biggest media conglomerates is likely to raise competition concerns on both sides of the Atlantic.
However, it may have an easier time in the US than Europe after Donald Trump’s moves to curb antitrust investigations.
Warner and Paramount were approached for comment."

Sep 11 - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was cut to Reduce from Neutral at Phillip Securities, with the brokerage citing stretched valuation and limited signs of a strong product upgrade cycle. The price target was maintained at $200 per share, according to a Thursday note.
The downgrade follows a nearly 14% gain in Apple's stock over the past three months, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite's 9% rise during the same period. Analyst Helena Wang pointed to near-term headwinds, including tariffs, higher capital expenditure, and slower momentum in China, as factors likely to pressure earnings.
At its Sept. 9 launch event, Apple introduced the iPhone 17 lineup, including the new 5.6-millimeter iPhone Air, Pro, and Pro Max models. The phones feature the A19 Pro chip, enhanced cameras, and upgraded Ceramic Shield. The company also unveiled AirPods with on-device artificial intelligence functions, and the Apple Watch Series 11 with health-tracking improvements.
Wang noted most of the new features were incremental, while Apple delayed its anticipated Siri overhaul to 2026. The analyst said pricing for the iPhone 17 range remains unchanged, with Apple absorbing tariffs and higher production costs, a move expected to squeeze margins further."

According to The Wall Street Journal, Paramount Skydance is working on an offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, with the majority of the planned bid expected to be in cash. The potential acquisition would be backed by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder of Oracle.
In June, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies to maximize value. The new S&S company will unite Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO, and HBO Max, along with their iconic film and TV libraries. Global Networks will bring together leading entertainment, sports, and news brands worldwide, including CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., Discovery, top free-to-air channels across Europe, and digital platforms such as the profitable Discovery+ service and Bleacher Report.
Earlier today, analysts at Wells Fargo speculated the company’s Streaming & Studios (S&S) unit could be sold to one of several interesting potential buyers, including Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Paramount Skydance, Netflix, or Sony. They added that Netflix stands out as the most compelling buyer.

(Reuters) -Wall Street's ""AI trade"" has propelled the market to record highs this year, and Oracle's stunning share-price gains are giving investors another reason to back the trade.
Oracle shares jumped 36% on Wednesday after the company pointed to a demand surge from AI firms for its cloud services. The surge lifted its market value to $922 billion, leapfrogging the values of Eli Lilly LLY.N, JPMorgan Chase JPM.N and Walmart WMT.N.
Gains this year for Oracle, Broadcom, Palantir and other tech companies illustrate how AI has dominated markets, despite occasional pullbacks related to concerns about the rally becoming overheated.
Meanwhile, the ""Magnificent Seven"" megacap trade that led stocks higher for much of this bull market has stumbled somewhat this year as shares of Apple and Tesla have skidded.
""When people were beginning to get a little bit concerned about the AI and its related infrastructure growth slowing down a bit, Oracle comes out with a number that just surprises everybody and fuels the fire of that whole subgroup,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""This is a sign of the overall AI trade once again getting in the driver's seat as far as equity markets are concerned.""
Oracle is now one of Wall Street's 10 most valuable companies. Nearly all of these are viewed as leaders in AI, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
AI chip heavyweight Nvidia this year became the world's most valuable company in history, displacing Microsoft and iPhone seller Apple, which many investors view as straggling in the race to dominate emerging AI technology.
Nvidia's stock price has dipped about 2% since it gave an uninspiring sales forecast on August 27, but its stock market value remained at $4.3 trillion as of Wednesday's close.
Meanwhile tech shares have steadied after wobbling last month when investors pointed to signs of emerging caution related to the AI trade. The technology sector is up more than 16% so far in 2025.
Oracle's $922 billion stock market value following Wednesday's surge was just behind Berkshire Hathaway's, $1.06 trillion, which trails Tesla's $1.12 trillion.
Oracle unveiled four multi-billion-dollar contracts on Tuesday, taking advantage of an industry-wide shift led by companies such as OpenAI and xAI, to aggressively spend to secure the massive computing capacity needed in the AI race.

But the Dow's impressive performance was built on a mixed bag of specific stock performances.
Microsoft (MSFT 0.24%) and Caterpillar (CAT 1.10%) lagged behind, with August drops of 4% or more. Meanwhile, health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH -0.11%) outweighed those underperformers with an index-leading 24.2% price gain.
Let's check out the rest of the top-performing Dow Jones stocks last month.
1. UnitedHealth Group (up 24.2%)
UnitedHealth took a tumble with a weak earnings report at the end of July, but bounced back in August. The stock soared on Aug. 15, as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a brand-new position of 5 million shares in the stock. The $3.3 billion merger with home health specialist Amedisys was completed on the same day, adding fuel to the fires. All told, UnitedHealth's stock moved 0.7% lower across the two-month span of July and August.
2. Apple (up 11.8%)
iPhone maker Apple (AAPL 0.78%) surged 12% in the first week of August. The company addressed tariff concerns by expanding its domestic manufacturing commitments. The four-year commitment of an additional $100 billion includes partnerships with Texas Instruments and Corning.
3. American Express (up 10.7%)
Credit services giant American Express (AXP 0.36%) sprinted higher by landing several valuable sporting sponsorships in the Miami area. The deals include the Formula 1 Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Dolphins football team.
4. Home Depot (up 10.7%)
Home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD 0.56%) reported modest Q2 results last month. The stock still rose; management said that consumers are just delaying their big-ticket home improvement projects. The financial results should improve over time.
5. Sherwin-Williams (up 10.6%)
Paint retailer Sherwin-Williams (SHW -0.61%) followed the same themes as Home Depot. Instead of an earnings report, the global company refinanced its credit facilities with better terms in Canada and Europe."

Apple (AAPL, Financials) launched the iPhone Air on Tuesday, its thinnest smartphone yet and the company's boldest design shift in nearly a decade. But despite fan excitement, analysts questioned whether Apple is still falling behind rivals in artificial intelligence.
CEO Tim Cook opened the Cupertino event with a quote from Steve Jobs, emphasizing design as function as well as form. The iPhone Air, measuring 5.6 millimeters thick, undercuts Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge and features Apple's new A19 Pro chip designed for AI tasks. It also includes custom communications chips and promises all-day battery life.
The iPhone Air headlines a lineup that includes the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the Air could drive higher upgrade rates over the next year, though they cautioned that its eSIM-only design may limit adoption in markets like China.
Apple shares dropped more than 3% Wednesday as investors worried about slimmer margins from tariffs and skepticism over Apple's AI strategy. Rivals such as Google have leaned on AI features in their smartphones, while Apple has yet to show similar advances.
The iPhone Air is priced between the standard and Pro models and comes in $100 below Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which shipped 1 million units last quarter. Analysts expect the Air to boost sales in the holiday season despite its single-camera setup compared with multi-camera rivals.
Apple's stock has fallen 6.4% this year, leaving its $3.5 trillion market cap trailing Microsoft and Nvidia. The iPhone Air will test whether design alone can reinvigorate Apple's smartphone momentum while it works to catch up in AI."

The iPhone maker has withheld its live translation feature, which allows people to automatically interpret conversations using their headphones, from customers within the EU.
A page on Apple’s website says: “Live Translation with AirPods is not available if you are in the EU and your Apple account country or region is also in the EU.”
It comes despite the fact that the new feature will offer translations from French, German, Portuguese and Spanish upon launching. It will be available in the UK and should still allow British users to access translations when visiting European countries.
On Tuesday, Apple unveiled a new version of its headphones, the AirPods Pro 3, which features technology that can translate conversations in real time by linking to its artificial intelligence (AI) software.
The company said this would “help people easily connect”. AirPods users will also be able to translate their own speech into another language, which will appear on their phone screen.
Apple launched a host of new AI-powered features for its iPhones last summer. However, it delayed bringing them to Europe until March this year amid criticism of the bloc’s Digital Markets Act, which came into force last year.
Apple has argued the EU competition laws require it to provide detailed access to its systems and data to rivals, warning that this risks exposing sensitive user information, such as location data.
Last year, Apple said the restrictions, which are intended to boost competition, could “force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security”.
Other tech giants have similarly criticised the byzantine technology regulations and withheld the launch of new AI tools in the EU. The rules come with the threat of billions of euros in fines for non-compliance.
Last month, Apple warned that a crackdown by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority on its business in the UK risked mirroring this “EU-style” crackdown.
Apple said at the time: “We’re concerned these EU-style rules the UK is advancing are bad for users and bad for developers. This approach undermines the privacy and security protections our users have come to expect, hampers our ability to innovate and forces us to give away our technology for free to foreign competitors.”"

Shares of language-learning app Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) jumped 8.6% in the morning session after a positive analyst note highlighted a strategy that could significantly boost future profits.
Citizens JMP maintained its Market Outperform rating and $500 price target, pointing out that Duolingo's push to direct new subscribers to its web platform instead of app stores could increase its 2027 EBITDA by approximately 10%. By bypassing Apple's estimated 20% take rate for a much lower 3% processing fee from services like Stripe, the company stands to make significant savings. This optimistic analysis is supported by the company's strong financial health, including a 41.5% year-over-year revenue increase in its last reported quarter. Other analysts have also recently expressed confidence, with JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley maintaining Overweight ratings due to advancements in AI and monetization.
Is now the time to buy Duolingo? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Duolingo’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 36 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 3.7% on the news that Baird initiated coverage on the stock with a 'Neutral' rating and a $280 price target.
The price target implies a potential upside of about 3.3% from the stock's current level. While analyst Vikram Kesavabhotla affirmed Duolingo's effective product development and strong position in the language learning market, the 'Neutral' rating reflects competitive risks that may make investors cautious. The positive stock movement also comes as the company prepares to unveil major product updates, including new non-language offerings like Chess, Math, and Music, at its Duocon conference on September 16th. This follows a period of strong growth, with the company recently reporting a 41% increase in revenue and a 40% increase in daily active users.
Duolingo is down 3.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $313.53 per share, it is trading 42% below its 52-week high of $540.68 from May 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Duolingo’s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $2,255.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

This underperformance questions the stock’s near-term prospects. Let’s explore the key factors driving and holding back ARM’s performance.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Mobile Market Leadership: Power-Efficient Chip Innovation
ARM’s strength lies in its power-efficient chip architectures, which remain essential to its leadership in mobile computing. Its designs power energy-saving devices from Apple AAPL, Qualcomm QCOM and Samsung, establishing ARM as the backbone of modern mobile technology. As demand for high performance with low power consumption rises, ARM’s chips continue to dominate smartphones and tablets. Apple builds its M-series chips around the company’s architecture, Qualcomm relies on it for Snapdragon processors, and Samsung integrates ARM designs across mobile and consumer electronics. ARM’s ability to combine efficiency and performance remains a core competitive advantage.
Positioned for Growth: The AI and IoT Frontier
ARM is fast becoming a key player in the AI and IoT space. As industry leaders like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung focus on AI-driven innovation, they increasingly depend on ARM’s flexible, energy-efficient architecture. From wearables to cloud data centers, ARM’s chips are designed to handle the rising need for embedded AI models. Apple is expanding AI features on ARM-based silicon, Qualcomm is enhancing AI capabilities in mobile and automotive applications, and Samsung is exploring advanced IoT solutions through ARM-powered Exynos chips. With machine learning and edge computing shaping the future, ARM’s architecture is emerging as vital infrastructure for technological progress.
China Exposure: RISC-V Gains Momentum
ARM faces significant risks from its large presence in China, its second-largest market. Growth in the region has slowed, driven in part by the growing adoption of RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture increasingly embraced by Chinese companies. The Chinese government is expected to release formal guidelines promoting RISC-V development, potentially accelerating this shift. As China seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign chip technologies, ARM’s dependence on this market becomes a long-term challenge. Continued RISC-V adoption could limit ARM’s growth in China, weakening its overall global momentum. This evolving competitive threat is a crucial factor for investors to closely monitor."

Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Micron, Delta, and Apple. First up, Micron. Shares of the chip company jumping in trading and up for a seventh straight day. Currently, they're on track to close at a record high. Joining us for more, our own Ally Canal. Micron is such an interesting one to me because it feels it's it's gains have felt more stealthier under the radar than some of the other big AI companies that we talk about.
Right. You constantly hear about Nvidia, AMD to your point Broadcom overshadowing some of these gains, but over the past month, Micron shares are up around 24%. Year to date, they have surged over 80%. And there's a lot of conviction out there on the street. We saw City raising their price target on shares to 175 bucks. That's up from the prior 150. City saying that they expect guidance above consensus on strong demand, especially from those AI data centers, which we've continuously been talking about.
And just based on the momentum here and across the board, not just for this company, but really the semiconductor index as a whole, you're just seeing a lot of those gains here. Of course, the risk is that maybe shares are a bit overbought right now. that has been flagged by some strategist on the street and there could be a short-term breather down the line, but for now, there just seems to be again, that word momentum, when you talk about all these AI names, these chip names that tends to be associated with it.
Yeah, and their earnings are coming out on September 23rd after the close of trading. So there's also the question of if it continues to rally strongly into that report, what will that mean for the reaction? Right, how much will we priced it in? Exactly. Just for folks who are not familiar, Micron is a little bit different than some of these other chip makers we talk about. It's a memory chip maker and it now makes something called high bandwidth memory chips which go into the AI stack in some cases. So that's why there's been an uptick in demand for that kind of of chip specifically and why they've been rallying so much.
Yeah, I know there's all the different facets of the chip game. There definitely are.
All right, let's talk about Delta now. It's raising the lower end of its revenue outlook as the airlines get more clarity on the state of consumer spending amid the trade war. I was also struck and I know you were digging into this today. Um, airline fares in CPI in the consumer prices, we saw what was it? 5% or something uptick in those airline fares.
Yeah, just around 5%, which I have been noticing unfortunately, when I'm going to book things.
I know.
I know. Again, it just is more pressure on the consumer and this is something that we saw in July as well. And there was this expectation heading into this August print that perhaps services inflation like airlines, for example, that would reverse some of the acceleration that we saw in July. That just did not happen. So the consumer in general is squeezed and it's interesting because in the Delta guidance raise. They they now see Q3 revenue up between two and 4%. The prior outlook was flat to 4%. So a slight uptick there. They did say that business and premium travel rebounded this summer. However, the CEO didn't note that lower income travelers haven't fully returned. So we're seeing that uneven demand recovery. You're just talking about CPI, that pressure on the consumer. and I think within airlines in particular, you are seeing that bifurcation play out in a more obvious manner than maybe some of the other sectors out there.
So if the premium economy and in terms of the consumer can continue to prop up some of these airlines, then their revenue is going to keep going up. But what does that mean longer term if that lower income consumer continues to be squeezed? Right.
Yeah. And the shares, by the way, are down today, even with raising the lower end of that forecast. So maybe investors were hoping for more, who knows. Um, let's talk about Apple too. Analyst sentiment on Wall Street is hitting a five-year low. What how are you measuring this? What is it, what are we talking about there?
Yeah, it it basically is comparing sentiment to what other tech companies are out there. So like your Nvidia, for example, sentiment is high like 90%. In terms of analyst ratings.
analyst ratings.
And then for Apple, it's just around 50%. So basically half of the amount of conviction out there on the street. And we saw double downgrade from DA Davidson, Philip Securities, DA Davidson going from a buy to neutral, Philip Securities going from neutral to reduce. And then overall consensus ratings fell to 3.9 out of five, the lowest since 2020. And again, only 55% of analysts now recommend buying Apple, whereas 90% for some of those mega cap tech companies.
Now, the biggest thing that analysts have cited were those AI concerns, a lack of a compelling AI strategy at a point when we're seeing a lot of competitors, uh and just really the tech industry in general, come out with clearer guidelines, clearer visions. And I think the Apple event we saw earlier this week, it disappointed investors because yes, we have the new fancy iPhone, but does the upgrade cycle matter as much anymore in this current environment? If you do not have a very specific AI plan, then where does this lead this company in this environment where clearly that is winning right now?
Yeah, yeah. Well, obviously, still a lot of questions about it. Allie, thank you. appreciate it.
Of course.

France’s national cybersecurity response unit said on Thursday that it was aware that Apple on September 3 sent a new notification to affected customers whose Apple devices may have been hacked.
The cybersecurity unit said receiving a threat notification means that at least one of the devices linked to a customer’s iCloud account “has been targeted and would be potentially compromised.”
It’s unclear how many individuals, including in France, received the September 3 threat notification, which spyware was used, or when the intrusions began.
An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s inquiries.
Apple periodically notifies victims that their devices were targeted and advises them to seek help from Access Now’s digital security lab. Most recently, Apple has notified victims in Iran, across Europe, India, and dozens of other countries of mercenary spyware attacks.
France’s president Emmanuel Macron reportedly switched phones in 2021 after his phone was targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware."

Let's turn now to some of today's top analyst calls on Wall Street. Chewy, Fanny May and Freddie Mac, and Apple. Shares of Chewy are moving higher this morning after Deutsche Bank raised its price target and its rating from hold to buy. The analyst there saying the retailer is coming out of the second quarter with multiple growth investments articulated in the second half. Now the firm added that if the investments reinforce market share, there are more levels for particu or rather accelerated growth in 2026. The company also got an upgrade over at Seaport Global Securities to buy. Another call from Deutsche Bank this morning is to buy Fanny May and Freddie Mac based upon that IPO Outlook. The firm said it sees shares gaining further on expectations that the mortgage giants will possibly be released from the federal government's control in the near future. Now President Trump's administration has been considering the sale and selling shares of both the companies, but key Senate Democrats are pressing the administration to hold off plans to study how exactly the move would impact mortgage rates. Now, both are up significantly year to date. And also we're keeping a close eye on Apple. That stock getting a downgrade this morning from D.A. Davidson to neutral from buy. The analysts there cited three key aspects saying the recent product announcements left them uninspired. They went on to say that growth will remain constrained as consumers will likely hold off for more compelling new items including a new iPhone.
And they also cited a lack of an AI strategy near-term, something that Apple has really been struggling with to stay stay in on this AI revolution. But keep it right here on Yahoo Finance. We'll be tracking all the latest market moves throughout today's trading session."

The tech giant's share price fell 3.2% in a daily session that saw the S&P 500 index rise 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite trade flat.
Apple unveiled its new iPhone hardware and other products at an event yesterday, and the market has had a moderately negative reaction to the unveilings. In addition to the lack of a new, clear-cut blockbuster in the pipeline, investors may also be concerned about the company's pricing strategy.
Apple stock falls after new product unveilings
At its product event yesterday, Apple unveiled its new iPhone 17 line and the iPhone Air -- an ultra-slim model. Early reaction to the new iPhones seems mixed. The company also unveiled new Apple Watches and AirPods. These products are slated to hit retail on Sept. 19.
While Apple did announce that the iPhone Pro 17 would launch at a $1,099 price point, $100 higher than its predecessor, it has kept comparable offerings for the other new iPhone 17s in line with what comparable iPhone 16s debuted at. Given the cost increases stemming from tariffs, some investors are likely concerned about the company's margins.
What's next for Apple?
Apple is a great company, but it's facing some significant challenges right now. For starters, the company appears to be lagging behind other tech giants in artificial intelligence (AI). The tech giant is facing saturation in the mobile market, and it's been a while since the mobile leader has delivered blockbuster new hardware. That doesn't mean it won't be able to deliver new breakout products down the line, but the company's recent product event suggests that there may be no dramatic new performance catalyst on the near horizon."

""I would intuitively say that we're at a point ... that I don't see super cycles as being kind of the dynamic around it,"" AT&T (T) CEO John Stankey told Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at Goldman Sachs' Communacopia + Technology Conference on Tuesday.
Stankey said that without major software advances — especially in artificial intelligence — Apple could struggle to reignite the blockbuster sales cycles that once defined its launches.
""These are now becoming more software-driven devices,"" Stankey explained. ""Software tends to be incremental. It's not necessarily built on a hardware platform that's put out. And as software continues to get better and better, that's what tends to drive engagement [and] usage.""
His comments strike at the heart of a growing investor concern: that Apple is lagging behind rivals in the AI race. Companies like Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Samsung (SSNLF) have spent the past year rolling out AI-powered features across search, devices, and productivity software. While Apple has released its own sweep of features, the company has taken on a more staggered approach.
Some key capabilities — including a more deeply integrated and conversational Siri and Visual Intelligence tools — have yet to be fully rolled out.
For consumers, the stakes are equally high. Without a visible leap forward, the new iPhone 17 risks being seen as a marginal upgrade rather than a must-have device, according to Stankey.
""I would expect that this might be the case and there'll be some consumers who find a compelling need to go and buy a new device,"" he said. ""But I don't think it's going to be something where people are going to be standing in a line beating down the doors at record levels for that day.""
That's a sharp contrast with the heyday of the iPhone, when ""super cycles"" — years with major design overhauls or groundbreaking new features — sent consumers flooding Apple stores and propelled shares to new highs.
Whether the tech giant can come up with applications that make the iPhone indispensable remains to be seen, Stankey added, noting Apple will need its AI to be ""unique to other AI tools or devices.""
Apple stock was slightly lower in Tuesday trading. The stock has dropped 4% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 11% gain.

With Apple's iPhone 17 series launching this September, mobile imaging is set for another leap. The question remains: how can users fully unleash this power in everyday life? TORRAS believes the answer lies in the most overlooked accessory—a phone case.
This year, TORRAS introduces the Ostand Q3 Silicone Case, redefining it as not just protection, but the lightest and most portable photography tool. TORRAS calls it the ""Smallest Imaging Revolution.""
From Protection to Creation
Phone cases were once just armor against drops and scratches. TORRAS reimagines them as creative companions. The Q3 Silicone turns spontaneous moments into stories, making photography effortless, natural, and always within reach. Instead of heavy gear, users gain a pocket-sized studio.
Always Ready, Always Creative
The case's signature OStand provides instant stability. With one press, the phone is perfectly positioned for photos, videos, or livestreams. Everyday scenarios—from travel and family time to workouts and concerts—become opportunities for storytelling, free of tripods or awkward balancing.
iPhone 17 × TORRAS: Perfect Pairing
Apple's iPhone 17 promises breakthroughs in low-light imaging, AI enhancement, and video stabilization. But powerful cameras demand equally flexible tools. The Q3 Silicone complements these advances, ensuring the device is always secure, stable, and ready—whether for cinematic video or late-night snapshots. Together, iPhone 17 and TORRAS unlock limitless creative freedom.
Quality in Every Detail
Revolutionary design demands flawless execution. Crafted from premium liquid silicone with a velvet-soft interior, the Q3 delivers comfort and protection. The O-Stand, made of aerospace-grade aluminum, is slim yet durable, disappearing seamlessly when not in use. The result is an elegant balance of style, strength, and utility.
Inspiring Everyday Creators
TORRAS wants to spread more than a product—it's a culture: ""Create Anytime, Capture Anywhere."" In an age where everyone is a storyteller, the Q3 empowers users to document life with ease. The smallest tool can inspire a movement, lowering barriers so creativity flows freely.
Conclusion
Smartphones transformed daily life by becoming indispensable. The TORRAS Q3 Silicone case is poised to be the next essential companion—not just a case, but a catalyst for creativity. As the iPhone 17 enters a bold new era, TORRAS invites users to join the ""Smallest Imaging Revolution."""

Apple unveiling its iPhone 17 lineup during an event at its headquarters, including its new iPhone Air. For more, we're bringing in Yahoo Finance tech editor, Dan Howley. You know, Dan, I'm of course going to wait for the full Howley review before I pull the trigger, but that iPhone Air, Dan, I'm I'm I'm curious.
Yeah, I mean, Josh, I got to say, you know, going into this, I I was kind of, you know, a little suspect of whether or not the Air would be an interesting product. Uh and then, you know, I got to uh go hands-on with it at Apple's headquarters. And I got to say, it really is striking how incredibly thin it is. I've actually seen some folks uh online in the the tech media press uh compare it to Samsung's own super thin Galaxy S25 Edge and the iPhone is actually thinner than that even. Uh and of course, Samsung ended up using that uh edge as a platform to roll out its foldable phone, which is just, you mean a great piece of technology. So the thinking is that Apple will do the same with its own uh new uh iPhone Air. And so, you know, I think one of the things to keep in mind is that the Air does have that one camera. It doesn't have two or three like uh the other phones do, so you don't get a wide angle like you would with the standard 17, and you don't get a true telephoto like you do with the pros. Uh that goes, those go up now to 8X telephoto. So I think uh there's there's going to be some trade-offs, but I do think that at 999, a lot of people are going to want to jump on it just because the design, it's so different than what you've seen in iPhones past and it truly is incredibly thin. I mean, you know, I was holding it, uh comparing it to the the pros while I was uh there and it it just knocked my socks off uh to to just see how thin it was. And then, you know, outside of that, obviously, uh some of the bigger uh announcements outside of the the Air of course, uh were the the new watches and their new hypertension uh detection capability. High high chronic high blood pressure. I myself recently was uh diagnosed with high blood pressure. I want to see uh if it's able to detect it. Hopefully not. Hopefully the meds are kicking in at some point. Uh and then obviously the the new uh AirPods Pro 3 with their heart rate tracking is really interesting and, you know, the between the the watch and the AirPods, uh both having heart rate trackers, if one doesn't work as well as the other or one's not getting as good of a reading, they'll just bounce off each other to keep going back to see which has the best reading. So you're able to constantly track. But even if you don't have a watch, you could still use the AirPods to track your exercises on the go and still get things like your heart rate, uh your uh, you know, heart rate zones. You can use it with the Apple Fitness Plus. Uh you would still get GPS tracking with your iPhone. So it really is an interesting lineup. Uh to to me, one of the the larger themes was Apple's further push into health with those the hypertension detection, the the heart rate tracking. and then they also improved uh the uh hearing aid capabilities of the AirPods Pro 3 uh with the new conversation boost. So if you're someone who's hard of hearing and you're in a loud area, it'll boost the conversation with the person that you're having versus the uh uh audio around you. That's also by the way coming to the AirPods Pro uh 2 as well as the AirPods 4 with active noise canceling. And then that hypertension detection, that's also coming to uh the Apple Watch Series 9 and and newer and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. So, they're rolling this out across uh a number of products and it just really does reinforce Apple's further push into that healthcare space.
Dan, what did you make of what they did with pricing? Uh because that was a big source of debate and discussion on the street heading into that event.
Yeah, I mean, there there really seemed to not be too much of a push higher as far as pricing. I think it was only the pro maybe that uh saw uh a new base price, but it's the same as the 256 would have cost you last year. Um they didn't do that with uh the standard iPhone. Um and the Air is the same as you would have paid for the Air the the plus, which the Air replaces. So it doesn't feel as though there's too much in terms of uh price swing, which is actually a welcome development. You know, going into it, we thought we could see as much as $100 price increase uh for the air versus the prior models. And so, you know, it doesn't seem as though Apple's gone in that direction despite, you know, concerns about tariffs, uh despite concerns generally that they haven't raised prices in quite a while. Uh I do think that that's something that's very welcome among consumers, especially as they're they're looking to get people to want to go out and upgrade as soon as possible with this new Air and you know, I I got to add, the the pros do get a new kind of styling on the back so you'd be able to tell them apart from, you know, between the 15 and 16, there really wasn't much to identify the the difference. You'd be hard pressed to be able to tell it. Uh with the the new pros, they have a new back uh where the cameras are and as I said, the cameras are are much improved. So, you know, they really did kind of uh massage everything across the board, getting that new design with the air. I do think that this is probably their strongest lineup in quite some time. But we'll just have to see if, you know, consumers are willing to go out. A lot of people still only upgrade when they need it.

Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 3.3% in the afternoon session after its highly anticipated iPhone 17 launch event on September 9 left some investors and analysts underwhelmed.
The stock's decline, which began after the event and continued into the next day, was attributed to several factors. Investors were likely unenthusiastic about the new devices, viewing them as offering only modest enhancements and incremental upgrades rather than revolutionary breakthroughs. This sentiment was compounded by a ""sell-the-news"" reaction, as many of the new features had been leaked beforehand, removing any element of surprise.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Apple’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 2.6% on the news that a court ruling ordered competitor Google to share some of its search data.
The ruling requires Google to provide rivals with access to certain search index and interaction data, a move that could significantly help Apple develop and enhance its own competitive AI chatbots and search tools. This legal development is seen as a major benefit for Apple's ambitions in the artificial intelligence space. Adding to the positive sentiment, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple has substantially increased its shipment forecast for the upcoming iPhone Fold, signaling strong confidence in the new foldable smartphone. Furthermore, reports indicate Apple is accelerating the use of automation and robotics throughout its supply chain to reduce labor dependency and ensure consistent product quality.
Apple is down 7.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $226.57 per share, it is trading 12.5% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,996.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financials) on Tuesday introduced the iPhone 17 family and the all-new iPhone Air in one of its broadest product updates in years, alongside refreshed Apple Watch and AirPods models.
The iPhone 17 features a 48MP Fusion Main camera, a new 48MP Ultra Wide lens, and an upgraded Center Stage front camera. It includes a 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion and Ceramic Shield 2, a tougher cover designed to triple scratch resistance. The device is powered by the A19 chip, which boosts efficiency and performance.
The Pro and Pro Max models use the A19 Pro chip with enhanced thermal management. They offer three 48MP cameras providing up to 8x optical-quality zoom, as well as advanced video tools like ProRes RAW and Apple Log 2. Ceramic Shield 2 now protects both sides of the devices.
The new iPhone Air emphasizes design, billed as Apple's thinnest phone to date. Built with titanium and a reworked internal architecture, it features a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and combines the A19 Pro, N1, and C1X chips for power efficiency. Its 48MP Fusion Main camera supports multiple focal lengths, while the front-facing 18MP camera targets improved selfies.
Apple also unveiled Watch Series 11 and SE 3 with longer battery life, new health functions, and 5G connectivity. AirPods Pro 3 gained stronger noise cancellation, live translation, and health-tracking features.
Analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management said the updates marked Apple's most significant form factor change since the iPhone 6, estimating that about 70% of iPhones sold will now carry a new design.
Despite the launches, Apple shares fell 1.5% in afternoon trading. Investors will look to holiday sales for the first read on demand for the new lineup."

While the Air and upgraded iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro line were the stars of the show, Apple also used the show to further one of its most ambitious initiatives with its new AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watches: its work in the health and fitness space.
Apple CEO Tim Cook famously told CNBC that the company's biggest contribution to humanity will be in health, and the iPhone maker has been moving in that direction for years, rolling out features including sleep apnea detection, elevated heart rate alerts, and the ability to identify signs of atrial fibrillation via its Apple Watch.
The company is pushing even further into the health space with its new AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3.
AirPods Pro 3 with heart rate tracking
In addition to improved acoustics, AirPods Pro 3 now come with built-in heart rate trackers in each earbud. It's the smallest heart rate monitor Apple has ever built and was trained on 50 million hours of fitness activity.
Apple combines the trackers with AirPods Pro 3's built-in accelerometer and iPhone sensors to help you track 50 different exercises, providing a range of information, including average heart rate and distance run, as well as your course map, if you were running or walking.
You won't, however, be able to see things like your cadence or vertical oscillation, which require an Apple Watch.
If you do have an Apple Watch, the AirPods Pro 3 and your watch will work in tandem to determine which heart rate tracker is capturing the most accurate reading and rely on that particular one. If that tracker struggles to follow your heart rate, the system will switch to the next best one.
""While heart rate sensing on headphones has been around for a while, most users were unaware of its existence or the benefits of tracking through the ear,"" International Data Corporation research manager Jitesh Ubrani said in a statement.
""The stationary position in [the] ear leads to better heart rate tracking, and with Apple's scale, it won't be long before consumers finally see the benefits and start demanding this from other brands too. All this provides a well-rounded package, making the AirPods Pro 3 a worthy upgrade,"" Ubrani added.
In addition to heart rate tracking, Apple has improved the AirPods Pro 3's hearing aid capabilities with a new feature called Conversation Boost. This feature raises the volume of whoever you're speaking to when you're in a crowded environment."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed nearly 0.5% to close above 45,725. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3% to also notch a fresh record close above 6,512. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4%, marking its second consecutive closing high this week.
Labor market data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday showed the US economy likely added 911,000 fewer jobs than previously thought in the 12-month period through March 2025 — a steeper revision than expected. Economists tracked by Bloomberg had expected the data to show around 680,000 fewer jobs added to the economy in that time frame.
The otherwise regular update took higher economic and political prominence than usual as debate reigns over how the Federal Reserve will react to the data after a slew of indications that the labor market is slowing down. So far, those signs have convinced traders that an interest-rate cut is coming when Fed policymakers meet next week. Now the question has shifted to how large the reduction might be, and whether that will be a boon for stocks.
Reports on inflation crucial to Fed thinking are due starting Wednesday with the latest reading of the producer price index (PPI). The consumer price index (CPI) follows on Thursday. The CPI and PPI readings will shine light on whether rising prices could become a significant stumbling block to deep or sustained rate cuts.
Also in focus was Apple's (AAPL) annual fall event, where the tech giant showcased devices including the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air, as well as new watches and heart rate-tracking AirPods. Apple stock fell around 1.5%.

Oil prices advanced nearly 1% on Tuesday as Middle East tensions escalated after Israel announced it had struck Qatar.
West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) trimmed earlier gains of as much as 2%, to hover near $62.80 per barrel. Brent (BZ=F) traded up nearly 1% to 66.30 per barrel.

Rate cut bets steady after steeper-than-expected jobs revision
Rate cut bets were in focus but remained steady after data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics posted a sharper-than-expected revision to jobs data for the 12 months through March 2025.
Traders continued to price in 90% chances of a 25 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its September meeting and 10% odds of a 50 basis point cut following the release of the BLS data on Tuesday, according to CME Group.
Recent federal economic data has shown deepening cracks in the US labor market, leading to investor certainty that the central bank will reduce interest rates this month but raising fears of a recession.
After last week's August jobs report was far weaker than projected, the rate cut debate has centered on how steep the cuts will be rather than whether they will happen at all.

The US economy added 911,000 fewer jobs than expected between March 2024 and March 2025
US nonfarm payrolls for the 12 months ended March 2025 were slashed by 911,000 jobs, according to preliminary revisions released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had predicted a downward shift of 682,000 jobs for the period, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg data.
The revisions follow an August payrolls increase of only 22,000 jobs, according to BLS data released Friday, coming in far below economists' consensus estimate of 75,000 jobs added.
That data also showed the economy lost jobs in June for the first time in four and a half years, losing 13,000 jobs compared to prior estimates of 14,000 jobs added.
Last year's release of this same preliminary annual revision fell during the heated final stretch of the presidential campaign — and became an immediate flash point when it showed the US economy created 818,000 fewer jobs than thought.
The August figures released Friday have been interpreted as largely locking in a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week, shifting the question away from one of whether the central bank will cut rates to just how big a nearly guaranteed cut will be.
Traders are pricing in a 100% chance of a cut, with 90% odds of a cut of 25 basis points versus 10% odds of a jumbo 50 basis point cut, according to CME data.

Women continue to vastly outnumber men when it comes to getting that all-important telegram from the King. In 2024, we saw 12,500 women reach that milestone compared to just 2,830 men.
The fact we are living longer is a real positive, but it also has major impacts for both pension policy and our longer-term financial planning.
Read more: How to contribute to a loved one's pension
For a start, increasing numbers of older people means the state pension bill continues to swell and this gives the government an ongoing financial headache.
With a review into state pension age ongoing, we will see further debate on whether the timetable for state pension age rises needs to accelerate and whether we will see rules put in place for a state pension age rising into the 70s.
The prospect of living into our 90s and beyond also has massive implications for our own pension saving. If you were hoping to retire at age 65, do you have the means to generate an income that could last 35 years or more?
Getting cracking early is key – the longer you save then the more time you have for your money to grow.
Here are some more tips to help you grow your pension so it can last for the long-term.
-
Small actions, such as boosting your contributions every time you get a pay rise or new job, can really boost how much goes into your pension long-term. If you do it straightaway before you get used to having the money to spend it will be easier.
-
You should also make sure you are getting the most from your employer’s contributions. If they are willing to offer an employer match, whereby they increase their contribution if you boost yours, then this can really power up your pension saving.
-
If you are worried about not having enough put away, then make use of online pension calculators. If you input how much you have already saved, they can tell you how much that is likely to give you in retirement. This gives you the opportunity to fill any gaps if needed.
-
Making sure that you’ve tracked down lost pensions from previous jobs is a good way of strengthening your position – you could find a pension worth several thousand pounds that you had forgotten about. You may decide that once you’ve got your pensions together, it’s worth consolidating them. It can cut down on time, admin and even save you money. Having one overarching view of what you have can also help you make better retirement income decisions. However, before you take the leap in consolidating, make sure you aren’t missing out on benefits, such as guaranteed annuity rates, or incurring expensive exit fees.
-
Finally, another challenge of these longer lives will be the impact of inflation. This can nibble away at your purchasing power and mean that what was once a decent retirement income becomes very stretched. Those in the market for a guaranteed income through an annuity will need to consider this when they are deciding whether to opt for an inflation linked versus level annuity, and those using income drawdown will need to ensure that they don’t take out too much income too early and leave themselves stretched later on."

(AP) — Apple on Tuesday rolled out its next generation iPhones, which include a new ultra-thin model and a slight price hike for one of its high-end models, while the company feels the squeeze of a global trade war.
The iPhone 17 line-up includes a new slimmed-down model that will adopt the “Air” name that Apple already uses for its sleekest iPads and Mac computers. In what has become an annual rite for Apple, all four new iPhone 17 models will feature better cameras and longer-lasting batteries than last year’s lineup. The iPhone 17 will all boast at least 256 gigabytes of storage, doubling the minimum amount from the last generation.
“We are raising the bar again,” Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted in front of a crowd gathered in an auditorium named after the company's late co-founder, Steve Jobs, located on its campus in Cupertino, California.
Grappling with tariffs
The new iPhones are the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the U.S. — a crusade that has thrust Cook into the hot seat.
All the iPhone 17 models are still expected to be made in Apple’s manufacturing hubs in China and India, exposing them to some of Trump's tariffs.
Analysts believe the additional fees on iPhones coming into the U.S. increase the pressure on Apple to raise prices to help protect its profit margins on its most marquee product.
Without giving a specific reason, Apple will charge $1,100 for the iPhone 17 Pro, an increase of $100, or 10%, from previous versions of that model. The iPhone Air will start at $1,000 — the price of last year's iPhone 16 Pro.
Apple is sticking with the same starting price for the basic iPhone 17 at $800 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max at $1,200.
All four models will be in stores Sept. 19.
Apple's shares closed down 1.5% Tuesday amid gains in the broader stock market, an indication that investors might be worried the company didn't do enough to prop up its profits amid the trade war.
A breath of fresh iPhone Air
The release of the iPhone 17 Air created the biggest buzz of the day as Apple found a way to pack in most of the punch of its Pro models while coming up with a fetching design that Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee will prod more trend-conscious consumers to splurge on the latest fashion in tech devices. The Air model is just 5.6 millimeters wide compared to 8 to 9 millimeters for the other iPhone 17 choices."
finnhub,AAPL,2025-09-09T02:10:00,Why Apple Is My Top Stock to Buy Right Now,"A record June quarter, swelling installed base, and fast-growing services business keep the iPhone maker's long-term story intact.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b9ff9e2069a10ac12fb4f7eff0b3900b93f3976e19951f05eb5f0ad92706e5fa,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/08/why-apple-is-my-top-stock-to-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/08/why-apple-is-my-top-stock-to-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/08/why-apple-is-my-top-stock-to-buy-right-now/,fool.com,200,,"Apple (AAPL 0.78%) heads into Tuesday's product launch event with fresh momentum in both the underlying business and the stock. Shares have climbed recently, prompting a fair question for investors: Did the investment window already close?
I don't think so. The Cupertino-based tech company that makes the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch -- and runs services like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, and Apple Pay -- just put up a strong summer update that bolsters the bull case.
In late July, Apple delivered a June-quarter revenue record and an all-time high in services revenue. And with an upcoming iPhone cycle and feature updates across software, now's a sensible time to revisit the stock.
The short version: The business is nudging back toward growth while leaning more on high-margin, recurring revenue -- and this tailwind of growing high-margin sales looks like one that could persist for a very long time, providing a powerful lift to the business.
Recent results show real momentum
In the third quarter of 2025, Apple's revenue rose 10% year over year to $94 billion, with diluted earnings per share up 12% to $1.57. Management called out June-quarter records for total company revenue, iPhone revenue, and earnings per share -- and said the installed base of active devices reached a new all-time high. That matters because Apple's growing device footprint is the flywheel behind services monetization.
Services continued to do the heavy lifting for the company in fiscal Q3 (Apple's quarter ending June 28). The segment generated $27.4 billion in revenue, up 13% year over year and an all-time high. Costs tied to services were just $6.7 billion, underscoring why this stream is so valuable: As services scale across a larger base of devices, Apple adds revenue that carries structurally higher margins than hardware. The net effect is a business mix increasingly tilted more toward recurring, cash-rich activity.
Also worth highlighting, Apple's growth is improving. In its fiscal second quarter of 2025, companywide revenue was up 5% year over year; the June quarter's 10% growth marks a significant step up.
Cash generation remains robust, too. Apple's fiscal third-quarter operating cash flow was $29 billion. Additionally, in May, the board authorized an additional $100 billion share repurchase program alongside a dividend that was lifted to $0.26 per share. That combination -- accelerating growth, expanding services, and big sums of cash being returned to shareholders -- is a winning recipe.
Catalysts, risks, and why I like the stock today
Looking ahead, Apple's record installed base is the engine. Each iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch creates multiple touchpoints for services like App Store purchases, subscriptions, and payments. As the company rolls out new software and features -- including Apple Intelligence integrations highlighted this summer -- it increases the reasons for users to stick with Apple and to spend more within its ecosystem. Tuesday's event should reinforce that narrative, as the company will likely bring to market the next iPhone family, updated Apple Watch models, and ecosystem enhancements that should fuel engagement.
The stock's valuation isn't a bargain, and that's the pushback you'll hear. However, the mix shift toward services, the durability of Apple's customer loyalty, and consistent capital returns arguably justify a significant premium. Growth stocks often merit higher price-to-earnings multiples when revenue visibility and cash generation are improving.
The business, of course, is not immune to risks. Macro pressure on device upgrades, regulatory scrutiny, and competitive dynamics in key geographies can all weigh on results.
Therefore, with revenue reaccelerating, services setting records, and a product event that can stoke demand and engagement across a massive installed base, Apple is my top stock to buy right now, bar none. If the market gives you volatility around the event or into the holiday quarter, I'd view that as an opportunity to add shares."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed nearly 0.5% to close above 45,725. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3% to also notch a fresh record close above 6,512. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4%, marking its second consecutive closing high this week.
Labor market data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday showed the US economy likely added 911,000 fewer jobs than previously thought in the 12-month period through March 2025 — a steeper revision than expected. Economists tracked by Bloomberg had expected the data to show around 680,000 fewer jobs added to the economy in that time frame.
The otherwise regular update took higher economic and political prominence than usual as debate reigns over how the Federal Reserve will react to the data after a slew of indications that the labor market is slowing down. So far, those signs have convinced traders that an interest-rate cut is coming when Fed policymakers meet next week. Now the question has shifted to how large the reduction might be, and whether that will be a boon for stocks.
Reports on inflation crucial to Fed thinking are due starting Wednesday with the latest reading of the producer price index (PPI). The consumer price index (CPI) follows on Thursday. The CPI and PPI readings will shine light on whether rising prices could become a significant stumbling block to deep or sustained rate cuts.
Also in focus was Apple's (AAPL) annual fall event, where the tech giant showcased devices including the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air, as well as new watches and heart rate-tracking AirPods. Apple stock fell around 1.5%.
Elsewhere on the corporate front, shares of Tourmaline Bio (TRML) and Nebius (NBIS) both jumped over 50% on deal news, with Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NVS, NOVN.SW) and Big Tech Microsoft (MSFT) respectively.

Oil prices advanced nearly 1% on Tuesday as Middle East tensions escalated after Israel announced it had struck Qatar.
West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) trimmed earlier gains of as much as 2%, to hover near $62.80 per barrel. Brent (BZ=F) traded up nearly 1% to 66.30 per barrel.

Rate cut bets steady after steeper-than-expected jobs revision
Rate cut bets were in focus but remained steady after data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics posted a sharper-than-expected revision to jobs data for the 12 months through March 2025.
Traders continued to price in 90% chances of a 25 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its September meeting and 10% odds of a 50 basis point cut following the release of the BLS data on Tuesday, according to CME Group.
Recent federal economic data has shown deepening cracks in the US labor market, leading to investor certainty that the central bank will reduce interest rates this month but raising fears of a recession.
After last week's August jobs report was far weaker than projected, the rate cut debate has centered on how steep the cuts will be rather than whether they will happen at all.

The US economy added 911,000 fewer jobs than expected between March 2024 and March 2025
US nonfarm payrolls for the 12 months ended March 2025 were slashed by 911,000 jobs, according to preliminary revisions released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists had predicted a downward shift of 682,000 jobs for the period, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg data.
The revisions follow an August payrolls increase of only 22,000 jobs, according to BLS data released Friday, coming in far below economists' consensus estimate of 75,000 jobs added.
That data also showed the economy lost jobs in June for the first time in four and a half years, losing 13,000 jobs compared to prior estimates of 14,000 jobs added.
Last year's release of this same preliminary annual revision fell during the heated final stretch of the presidential campaign — and became an immediate flash point when it showed the US economy created 818,000 fewer jobs than thought.
The August figures released Friday have been interpreted as largely locking in a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week, shifting the question away from one of whether the central bank will cut rates to just how big a nearly guaranteed cut will be.
Traders are pricing in a 100% chance of a cut, with 90% odds of a cut of 25 basis points versus 10% odds of a jumbo 50 basis point cut, according to CME data.

Following Alphabet’s Pixel 10 launch on August 20, Apple will be hosting its iPhone 17 lineup on September 9. The firm discussed what is anticipated at the big launch event such as four iPhone models, including an all-new slim version (“Air”) which will replace the “Plus” model in previous lineups.
Overall, the firm holds high expectations regarding Apple’s products pipeline in 2026-27.
“We expect a lower-priced 17e version coming in 2026. A US survey points towards high pent-up demand, with seven of 10 users expressing interest in upgrading to a 17 model (MacRumors, 1 September 2025). We also expect announcement of a new Apple Watch (11, Ultra 3), new AirPods, and Airtag (possibly an upgraded Vision Pro too).""
""While we do not see the iPhone 17 lineup as introducing a clear step change in Apple’s offering, we have higher expectations from its products pipeline in 2026-27 as reported in the press (Bloomberg 24 August 2025), including a foldable phone and smart glasses. Also in the works is a special 20th anniversary edition iPhone model with curved glass.”

Sep 8 - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may see more revenue upside from its upcoming iPhone 17 launch as Wells Fargo highlights higher pricing across the product line.
Analyst Aaron Rakers noted that the new iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are all expected to carry price increases ranging from $100 to $300 compared to last year's iPhone 16 models. The iPhone 17 Air, a thinner design, could start at $1,099 and run as high as $1,499, partly because Apple may remove the 128GB entry option and introduce a new 1TB version.
The iPhone 17 Pro is expected to be priced at $1,099, $1,299, and $1,599, each tier $100 higher than the 16 Pro line. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro Max could come in at $1,299, $1,499, and $1,699, also reflecting $100 increases.
Rakers, who holds an Overweight rating and a $245 price target on Apple, said his model projects iPhone revenue of $218.3 billion over the next 12 months, nearly in line with Wall Street's $218.2 billion estimate.

Apple is set to unveil the latest update to its iPhone lineup on Tuesday. We're now up to version 17. Uh and those are set to be a new iPhone Air, which is expected to come in about 30% thinner than current models. Wall Street also expecting Apple to raise prices on its latest iPhones. Uh, Ali Canal, I'll go to you.
you can decline to answer on whether you're getting a new device or not. But you said something earlier in the show that was very interesting, which is, you know, Apple, not really participating, not really a member of the AI trade. Really no AI thesis there. and I think it's it's interesting coming into what appears to be a pretty exciting product release. We all cared a lot about what the physical phone looked like many years ago. That's the story coming into tomorrow's event. Um and not really a part uh of the AI trade. I'll be curious to see if they sort of try to make that case at all.
Yeah, and personally, I don't think that we're going to see a big rally in the stock off of this announcement unless they do go in and make further inroads in AI. Now, what's interesting, Bloomberg is reporting that Apple is working on a rebuilt version of Siri, so an AI powered search feature that basically has Siri act like a chat GPT type of voice to answer a lot of your questions.
Will that be enough to satisfy investors? I'm not quite sure. We know Dan Ives, friend of the show, Wedbush analyst, he continuously has been preaching for Apple to go and buy perplexity, but Apple isn't really a company that goes out and does major acquisitions. And typically when it comes to innovation, they are not at the forefront there. They they come in later and then make a better product. So, we've just been slow on on the AI AI trade at large.
In terms of whether or not I'm going to be getting a new phone, I mean, I don't know if you can see, it's cracked everywhere. So the fact that it's thinner makes me a little nervous because I drop my phone constantly. So does that mean it's indestructible? I I really need a more durable iPhone. So that is something that I would be asking the company to do. But in terms of the trade at large, I'm not sure if just another iPhone announcement is going to move the needle here. We need to see some AI advancements.
I mean, maybe you just go get a company phone and then you don't have to worry so much about whether the uh case integrity. Um, uh, Larry, quickly, I want to get your thoughts on Apple just as a company within the context of this rally. Was the biggest company in the world for some time. It's now lost that crown. It's behind Nvidia and Microsoft. Stock's really done nothing this year, um, amid, you know, a tech trade that has dominated the market and all things considered as a collective, tech has acted very well.
So, I'm curious what you make of Apple being a relative laggard there.
I agree with Ali, what what's held Apple back is they really don't have an AI strategy. Siri is not ideal whatsoever. I've got an iPhone, I use Siri, it's very frustrating. Chat GPT and some of the other AI tools are much better. So I think if Apple could step outside the box and acquire a company that's better in AI or really, really upgrade Siri and the AI that the stock would make new highs, but if they don't do that, it could continue to just trade around and be a bit of a laggard versus the AI trade."

Apple’s “Awe Dropping” fall show is expected to replay the company’s careful hand: Polish the hardware, bundle the ecosystem, delay the hard questions
Cheng Xin/Getty Images
Wall Street already knows the cards on the table. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” show hits Tuesday afternoon — and the suspense isn’t whether CEO Tim Cook will pull a rabbit out of his sleeve; it’s whether Apple can turn an ultrathin iPhone silhouette, a cleaner camera story, a watch refresh, and a measured serving of “Apple Intelligence” into an upgrade wave that feels earned instead of engineered.
The real question isn’t whether those rumored and reported pieces show up; it’s whether Apple can turn a hardware glow-up into an upgrade catalyst — and keep the revenue engine purring — while the heavier Siri overhaul keeps simmering in the background. The bet is straightforward: design first, AI later, and pricing in the margins. The company doesn’t need a royal flush. It needs customers to ante up for a slimmer phone and, ideally, add a watch or new earbuds to the tab.
That's why the first card on the felt is the one you can see across the room.
Apple is famously stingy with dramatic redesigns, but the rumored iPhone 17 Air, at roughly 5.5 millimeters thick, could shake things up. This phone could be Apple’s loudest visual swing in years — thinner, cleaner, deliberately different. That’s not just a design school flex; it’s a sales thesis. A new silhouette is the one thing that makes a phone feel new from across the room, and Apple hasn’t had a truly fresh outline in a while. Analysts are already framing the Air as the first meaningful form-factor break in years, the kind of thing that can shunt fence-sitters off their iPhone 14/15/16 islands and back into the queue.
The bones of the pitch are familiar: a larger, bright, high-refresh display; a lighter build; and a chassis that telegraphs “new” without requiring a spec sheet. Reports say we'll see a 6.6-ish-inch panel and a notably slim frame that sits between the base iPhone 17 and the Pro in price — making the Air a mid-tier showpiece whose job is to look like a Pro at a slightly friendlier price. While none of this has been publicly confirmed by the company, the consensus coalesced weeks ago — and Apple preview playbooks rarely swerve at the last minute.
But “thin” is a compromise as much as it is a feature. Squeezing the body challenges battery capacity and thermal headroom, and shaving grams can force trade-offs in cameras and speakers; every millimeter saved has to be paid back somewhere else. The Air gets the lean frame and generous screen, but also serious edge-case headaches that the spec-maxed Pro models sidestep. People will buy the Air because they want the aesthetic, and they have to accept that it’s an aesthetic with fine print.
Shaving millimeters off the iPhone might make the Air feel fresh in ads and Apple Store displays, but it puts endurance under the microscope. It also raises the first question any buyer has after four hours of scrolling on TikTok: How’s the phone’s battery? Apple is expected to promise “all-day” use — its favorite mantra — but skeptics will want proof that the Air’s performance isn’t being sacrificed for looks.
If Apple really puts ProMotion on the base models — another rumor with momentum — the thin gamble gets an assist. Motion smoothness is one of those under-the-glass upgrades people feel before they understand it, and it helps the whole lineup read as “finally modern” after years of incrementalism. The Air’s camera setup will also be a litmus test. Insiders expect the phone to ship with a single 48-megapixel rear lens, and Apple will pitch that as elegant simplicity, leaning on computational tricks such as sensor crops and 2x “lossless” zoom to fill in the gaps. If Apple’s crop-and-compute math works, the Air feels like a bold statement: one lens, many tricks. If it doesn’t, the phone risks coming across as thin just for thinness’s sake — and the internet will pounce on that story within hours of the event. Apple’s task is to frame the Air as intentional minimalism — and to do it convincingly enough that “slim” doesn’t read as “fragile.”
The real question with the Air is whether novelty is enough. Apple has been dinged for looking sleepy next to rivals who fold, flip, or sprinkle AI on everything. This “Awe Dropping” event is largely the company couching a bet on design to restart upgrades while Apple plays catch-up on AI — a stark table stake in 2025. That tension is the heart of the event: a beautiful slab, yes; but can it carry the story while the smarter stuff arrives late?
The upsell chorus
Apple rarely relies on one device to do all the lifting. The rest of the iPhone lineup is expected to play a complementary role, there to nudge the average ticket higher and to make the ecosystem feel like a set — iPhone as the star, but watches and earbuds as the chorus that turns a purchase into a plan.
On phones, expect the usual tiered escalation: iPhone 17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max. The slightly larger standard iPhone 17 is expected to gain high-refresh displays at last. That one change alone — moving to 120 Hertz scrolling and gaming — would immediately modernize the base model. High-refresh screens are finally expected across the lineup, bringing smoother scrolling and gaming to buyers who have resisted the Pro tax. It’s the kind of improvement you notice five seconds after opening Messages. And a 24-megapixel selfie camera across all models nods to the FaceTime/TikTok reality of phone life in 2025. The Pro and Pro Max, meanwhile, are still the power flex. Both are slated to debut a horizontal “runway” camera bar and an upgraded telephoto lens that will keep reviewers pixel-peeping for weeks. None of that is mind-bending, but Apple knows that news doesn’t need to be mind-bending to move units.
Apple seems to be betting on its lineup finally telling a cleaner story: a style-forward Air, everyday base models that stop feeling artificially held back, and Pro models that carry the bragging rights. Of course, pricing is where the subtext lives. Rumor trackers have floated a matrix that positions the Air as the step-up model and keeps the Pro/Pro Max upmarket, with storage bands that encourage you to spend “just a little more.” If those price bands stick, Apple won’t crow about them — it will let the lineup do the nudging. Either way, the spreadsheet tells the story that Wall Street actually cares about.
Assuming Apple sticks to its usual cadence, preorders will open Friday, Sept. 12 (8 a.m. ET), with deliveries and in-store availability on Friday, Sept. 19. Apple watchers anticipate a new sky-blue option for the Air and a fresh orange for the Pro.
Beyond the hardware, iOS 26 brings the Liquid Glass look and Adaptive Power Mode, which quietly stretches battery life by dialing back performance on the fly.
The wearables side is more practical than flashy. Apple Watch Series 11 is rumored to pick up a new S-class chip, a brighter display, and a 5G RedCap modem purpose-built for wearables. There’s steady smoke around blood-pressure alerts — not medical-grade readings, but long-horizon hypertension detection — a feature that fits Apple’s cautious approach to health claims. It’s incremental, yes, but it could be distinctly useful, which is how Watches sell: They whisper usefulness instead of shouting novelty. Watch Ultra 3 is the halo — the big battery, the rugged casing, maybe satellite messaging improvements — while Watch SE 3 gives Apple a fresher on-ramp at the value end. None of it breaks the category. All of it supports the iPhone pitch with a “complete your look” logic that Apple perfected over the last decade.
Then there’s the potential sleeper hit: AirPods Pro 3. Rumors point to in-ear heart-rate sensing and at least temperature exploration, with more adventurous features (such as live translation) more likely to slip to a software update. If Apple lands even one new health metric cleanly — and keeps the case small and the ANC strong — you get a stealthy second reason to upgrade something, even if the phone alone didn’t tip you over. The event’s supporting cast is the margin plan. You came for “thin.” You leave with a bundle.
Intelligence deferred
And then there’s the part Apple would really, really prefer to be done with: the AI discourse. Here, Apple isn’t the industry headliner — and it’s still not particularly close. The company has previewed its Apple Intelligence umbrella and teased a more capable Siri, but the heavyweight Siri revamp has slipped, with expectations pointing to 2026 for the meatier upgrades. The near-term story is a slow, careful rollout — new UI polish (that “Liquid Glass” aesthetic), writing aids, some vision features — without the “Siri grew a brain overnight” moment the market keeps expecting.
Part of that pacing is deliberate. Rivals can wow with chatbots, while Apple hides behind aesthetics.
Expect Cook and company to play AI as pragmatic competence, not a moonshot. That may feel conservative, but it’s in character. Apple rarely wins by going first; it wins by making everyday tasks work without hiccups. Apple’s AI workaround has been finding a back-end partner for the web-answering part of Siri. The internal project label you’ll keep seeing is World Knowledge Answers, and the reported plan is to blend Apple’s on-device models for private data with a heavier-lift partner model — Google’s Gemini is the name most often attached — for broad, up-to-date answers. Whether that is finally announced on stage or punted to a developer post later is anyone’s guess, but the direction of travel is clear: Apple’s “privacy first” approach will lean on federation rather than one giant Apple-owned frontier model.
So yes, AI will be on stage tomorrow, just in small letters. The company may spotlight on-device “Apple Intelligence” — summaries, transcriptions, better autocorrect, context-aware Siri prompts — the sort of features that feel practical immediately and can be wrapped in Apple’s preferred framing of privacy, battery life, and latency. The grander ambitions are still on the calendar, although the clock is ticking in investors’ minds.
Apple can’t credibly sell a world-beating AI story tomorrow because too much is still cooking. What it can do is frame intelligence as a background advantage: features that quietly make the phone, watch, and earbuds feel more helpful without turning the keynote into a chatbot demo. That’s a very Apple move, and it might land — if the hardware feels fresh enough to carry the pause in the software saga. Design is the tip of Apple’s spear in part because its in-house AI isn’t honed yet.
There’s one more pressure point in the larger phone conversation: rivals. Samsung and Google have been shipping generative features, camera AI tricks, and, in Samsung’s case, a living room of foldables that make Apple look conservative by design. Apple’s answer has historically been execution: fewer features, but they work, and they work together. If tomorrow’s keynote feels like that — crisp, cohesive, and grounded — Apple can survive another news cycle of “late to AI” takes. If the event is thin phones and thin substance, the narrative calcifies fast.
Apple is playing a careful hand: a thinner flagship-adjacent iPhone to sell the sizzle; a chorus of practical wearable updates to sell the steak; and a frank acknowledgment — explicit or implicit — that the delayed AI payoff is worth the wait. But the risk is that the market has heard, “It’s coming, we promise,” for too many seasons in a row.
There will be, of course, wild cards to watch out for on Tuesday, including iPhone pricing ladders (does the Pro quietly start at 256GB?) and whether Apple even name-checks any AI partners on stage.
Regardless, if the Air looks as good in hand as it does on rumor sheets, and if base-model screens finally graduate to the modern world, Apple buys itself another cycle of “good enough.” If Watch 11 and AirPods Pro 3 land tangible health wins, the bundle math starts doing quiet work on the revenue line. And if the company can sketch a believable Siri arc — even in broad strokes — the AI deficit becomes a calendar problem, not a capability problem.
Apple doesn’t have to wow to win on Tuesday. It has to reassure — that thin can be durable, that the ecosystem still adds up to more than the parts, and that the intelligence behind the glass is coming on Apple’s timeline, not Redditors’. Do that, and tomorrow’s “Awe Dropping” show means the company has played its hand well. The suspense isn’t whether Apple has pocket kings or whether the right cards are on the table — it’s whether the table lets Apple keep playing into 2026."

As Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gears up for its highly anticipated iPhone 17 launch, industry analyst Daniel Newman has criticized the company for relying on predictable upgrades rather than delivering innovation.
Daniel Newman Says Apple Is ‘Better Than This'
On Sunday, Newman, CEO of Futurum Group, took to X, formerly Twitter, to vent his frustration with Apple ahead of the company's Sept. 9 event.
""The next ‘big $AAPL event' will be to launch a new iPhone 17 Air,"" he said, adding, ""I am no longer surprised by Apple's lack of innovation and ingenuity. But come on for crying out loud. You're better than this, Apple.""
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
His remarks come just days before Apple's ""Awe Dropping"" keynote at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California.
The event, which will be livestreamed on apple.com and through the Apple TV app, marks the company's first major showcase since June's Worldwide Developers Conference.
What To Expect From Apple's iPhone 17 Launch
Apple is expected to unveil multiple versions of the iPhone 17, including what could be its slimmest model yet—the iPhone 17 Air. Reports suggest the Air will replace the iPhone Plus model, following a broader industry trend toward thinner designs.
Other updates may include new colors such as purple and green, enhanced cameras and incremental design improvements. Pricing is expected to start at $800 for the base model, $1,050 for the Pro, and $1,250 for the Pro Max.
A foldable iPhone is rumored for 2026, but no announcement is expected this year. Apple is also set to reveal updates to the Apple Watch series and AirPods Pro 3.
While Apple's launch events typically drive consumer excitement, some Wall Street analysts caution that this year could turn into a ""sell-the-news"" moment if the upgrades are perceived as modest.
Previously, Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management argued that Apple's bar for AI innovation remains low but could rise sharply as Siri reportedly receives Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini integration in 2026.
Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has repeatedly labeled Apple's AI strategy a ""disaster,"" criticizing its reliance on partners rather than internal breakthroughs.
Balancing Legacy With Investor Expectations
With more than 2.4 billion iOS devices in circulation, Apple remains one of the most powerful players in consumer tech.
But Newman's criticism reflects growing impatience among analysts and investors who see rivals like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) racing ahead in artificial intelligence.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Jamf’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 13 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 3.7% on the news that Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on the stock to $10.00 from $14.00. Analyst Hamza Fodderwala maintained an ""Equal-Weight"" rating on the enterprise software company but the significant 28.57% reduction in the price target signaled caution. The negative sentiment surrounding Jamf was amplified by a broader market downturn that particularly affected technology stocks.
On the same day, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.2%, and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) fund plummeted 1.5%. This wider tech sell-off, driven by profit-taking and concerns over sticky inflation, contributed to the pressure on Jamf's shares.
Jamf is down 32.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $9.57 per share, it is trading 48.9% below its 52-week high of $18.70 from September 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Jamf’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $282.15.

Tim Cook is expected to unveil the company’s new iPhone 17 and a flurry of other gadgets at the company’s “Awe Dropping” event on Tuesday. A refreshed range of four phones will include the iPhone 17, a thinner and lighter iPhone 17 Air, the powerful iPhone 17 Pro and a big-screened iPhone 17 Pro Max.
The mobiles are expected to include new features including simultaneous front-and-back video recording – intended to appeal to live-streamers and selfie addicts – and automatic translation technology.
Apple will be streaming its launch event starting at 6pm, where it is also expected to reveal updates to its AirPods Pro headphones and its Apple Watch line.
Here is everything you need to know about the event, the iPhone 17 and how to watch along.
iPhone 17 release date: when will it go on sale?
Apple will host its “Awe Dropping” event on Tuesday with phone sales following a few days later.
The company’s flagship iPhone launches follow a fairly standard pattern. Its phones are made available for pre-order on the Friday after its launch event, in this case Friday Sept 12.
They then go on wider sale in retail stores a week after – this year on Friday Sept 19.
Not all phones follow this release schedule. Some phones have come out a little later in October due to production delays. The iPhone 16e, meanwhile, was released in February this year.
iPhone 17, Air, Pro and Pro Max rumoured features
Apple is intending to launch four new phones this September as it shakes up the line-up of its flagship product, according to Bloomberg and industry analysts.
Its main model, the iPhone 17, will be a modest upgrade on last year’s iPhone 16 with small tweaks to the design and features. These are expected to include a larger display at 6.3in, a more powerful processor and upgraded screen technology. All the new phones in the range will receive an upgrade to their selfie camera, boosting it from 12 to 24 megapixels.
The iPhone 17 Air will be the biggest detour from past releases. The phone will take on the same name as Apple’s popular MacBook Air and will feature a lightweight design titanium and aluminium frame.
It is expected to have a screen of around 6.6in and a body that is 5.5mm thick. That compares with the current iPhone 16 Pro Max, which is 8.25mm deep. Its thin size, however, means it will have a smaller battery capacity than its peers. On the back it is rumoured to have a single 48-megapixel camera.
Both the more expensive iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are expected to come with more advanced processor chips and significantly larger battery capacity than earlier models. The Pro Max will come with a larger 6.9in display. A switch to an aluminium frame, meanwhile, should make the phones lighter.
According to Bloomberg, both phones will also feature major camera upgrades. These will include an advanced telephoto lens with 48 megapixels, up from 12 megapixels, and up to 8x optical zoom on the Pro Max version.
The phones will also come with the option for simultaneous front-and-back filming for the first time, a feature popular with YouTube live-streamers.
It is expected to debut new colours for the phones, including a light blue hue for the Air model and an orange tint for its Pro phones.
All the phones will rely on Apple’s new iOS 26 software, which will come out around the time of their release and feature its Apple Intelligence AI technology.
Apple Watch and AirPods 3 Pro rumoured features
Apple’s AirPods 3 Pro headphones could see an update on Tuesday, although some analysts are not predicting a new set of AirPods until 2026.
The AirPods Pro line features active noise cancellation. Bloomberg has reported that the newly updated headphones will include improved heart rate and monitoring and temperature sensing for health checks.
Perhaps the most exciting feature will be AI-powered live translation, set to arrive as part of upgrades to Apple’s iOS 26 software. This would give users a Star Trek-like experience of universal translation. Rival Google has offered a similar technology in its headphones for several years.
Apple is also planning to reveal a new Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3, its rugged sports watch. According to multiple reports, the Ultra 3 will include the ability to connect via satellite and 5G. At the lower end of the price range, it will also update it Apple Watch SE.
Both the Series 11 and Ultra 3 are expected to include blood pressure sensing for detecting signs of hypertension, which can increase risks of serious heart disease.
How much will the iPhone 17 cost?
Analysts predict the iPhone 17 will be on a par with the current iPhone 16 in terms of launch price. In the US, it is likely to start at around $799 (£590), according to analysts at JP Morgan. In the UK, the iPhone currently costs £799.
However, the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro could be more expensive.
JP Morgan estimates the Air will set customers back $899 to $949. The iPhone 17 Pro will cost $1,099, $100 more than the previous model, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max is slated to cost $1,199.
Analysts at TrendForce, however, think the devices could cost even more. They anticipate the iPhone 17 Pro will start at $1,199 and the Pro Max at $1,299, climbing as high as $1,699 for models with more storage.
Apple has been battling Donald Trump’s shifting tariffs and the global trade war, which could push up prices.
When is the Apple launch event and how can I watch?
Apple will host its “Awe Dropping” event live stream at 6pm UK time, or 10am local time in the US, on Tuesday Sept 9."
