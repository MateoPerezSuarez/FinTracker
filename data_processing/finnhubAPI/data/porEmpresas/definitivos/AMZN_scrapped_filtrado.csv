Don't take my word for it: The world's five most valuable companies -- each with market caps of more than $2 trillion -- are leading innovators in the field of AI.
AI chipmaker Nvidia recently became the world's largest publicly traded company, valued at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the industry standard for AI workloads. Enterprise and cloud provider Microsoft provides a growing suite of AI tools, whikch has driven its value to $3.9 trillion. With more than 1 billion iPhones in the wild, Apple has a captive audience for its Apple Intelligence (AI) ambitions, pushing its market cap to $3.8 trillion. Cloud and AI leaders Alphabet and Amazon round out the top five, boasting values of $2.9 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.
With a market cap of roughly $1.5 trillion (as of this writing), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.88%), often referred to as TSMC, is on the fast track to join this elite fraternity. The adoption of AI continues at a hectic pace, fueling blistering demand for its most advanced chips. As the world's largest and most renowned semiconductor foundry, TSMC is on the fast track to meet the requirements for membership in this exclusive club -- and it might happen sooner than investors realize.
Want chips with that?
TMSC has worked behind the scenes for years, fabricating the most advanced processors, but recently found itself in the spotlight. Management bills the company as the ""world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry,"" making it a critical provider in the supply chain for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI.
And make no mistake, no foundry is as well-regarded as TSMC. Its customer list reads like the Who's-Who of tech glitterati, and includes Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others.
With the surge in demand for AI-centric processors, TSMC is no longer dependent merely on smartphone chips. In fact, the lion's share of the company's revenue now comes from the advanced processors needed for HPC and AI, recently responsible for 60% of sales.
TSMC's growth continues to accelerate. In the second quarter, revenue of $30 billion grew 44% in U.S. dollars, while earnings per ADR soared 67% to $2.47. Management expects this trend to continue. TSMC is calling for third-quarter revenue of $32.4 billion in USD at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 38%, and the company has been known to underpromise and overdeliver.
The path to $1 trillion
TSMC is in an enviable position as the world scrambles to adopt this groundbreaking technology. The company is well positioned to benefit from advances in generative AI, counting the biggest names in technology as its customers. Furthermore, TSMC's rapid revenue growth is the clearest sign yet that it is poised to profit from this opportunity. As such, TSMC should soon be joining the company of multi-trillionaires.
According to Wall Street, TSMC is on track to generate revenue of $123.3 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 12.8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSMC would have to generate revenue of roughly $156 billion annually to justify a $2 trillion market cap.
It's telling that Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 16% and 18% in 2026 and 2027, respectively. If the company achieves those relatively low hurdles, it will likely achieve a $2 trillion market cap sometime in 2027. That said, given the company's accelerating growth in recent years, it will likely make the grade even sooner.
Estimates regarding the market potential of AI continue to rachet higher. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the coming decade. That could be conservative, as new use cases for AI are continually being developed.
Finally, at roughly 30 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors a practical way to invest in a once-in-a-generation opportunity."

Solana is likely to be the winner in the stablecoin and tokenization wave, according to Bitwise investment chief Matt Hougan.
“I think Solana is the new Wall Street,” Hougan told Solana Foundation marketing chief Akshay BD in an interview clip shared last week, citing interest in stablecoins and tokenization.
“Really important people are saying that stablecoins will reinvent payments and tokenization will reinvent stock, bond, commodity and real estate markets,” he said.

Hougan said investors seeking to invest in the narrative were likely to turn to Solana because of its speed.
“The speed, the throughput, the finality of Solana makes it seem extraordinarily attractive,” he said. “Solana literally gets to finality in the blink of an eye.”
Hougan cited Solana’s plan to achieve near-instant finality with Alpenglow, a proposed upgrade to the network’s consensus mechanism. The upgrade is expected to reduce block finality from 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds.
Hougan said Solana’s competitive stablecoin and tokenization advantage was likely to drive “substantial flows” to spot SOL exchange-traded funds.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Hougan’s remarks come as Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that spot SOL ETF approvals were in the offing just before the recent federal government shutdown. At the time, Balchunas cited the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to eliminate 19b-4 filings for spot cryptocurrency ETF applications.
The 19b-4 is submitted by exchanges on behalf of issuers requesting a rule change to list a new ETF. The filing has historically been required for spot cryptocurrency ETF applications, but it came with a lengthy 240-day statutory approval window.
The SEC’s decision to do away with 19b-4 filings for spot cryptocurrency ETF applications followed the implementation of generic listing standards for spot cryptocurrency ETFs, leaving only the need for S-1 filings or registration statements from issuers. Balchunas said spot Solana ETF S-1 filings had already undergone four amendments, which has historically been a sign of SEC engagement and progress.

The institutional money floodgates have opened for Bitcoin, and one prominent crypto investor thinks the digital asset’s journey is just getting started—despite already trading north of $126,000.
Franklin Jiang, co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, told CNBC on Oct. 6 that Bitcoin’s current $2 trillion valuation could eventually swell to match gold’s $22 trillion market cap, representing potential upside of more than 10 times from current levels. His reasoning? Bitcoin is simply “a better version of gold.”
“It’s digital, it’s cheaper to transport and transact with, and it’s global and permissionless,” Jiang said. “You don’t have to carry around a heavy rock.”

The Institutional Adoption Wave Is Real
The numbers backing Jiang’s optimism are staggering. Total inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds since their launch have now exceeded the inflows into the Nasdaq-100 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), according to Jiang. That’s a remarkable milestone that underscores just how quickly institutional investors have embraced crypto exposure through traditional investment vehicles.
BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has emerged as the clear winner in this ETF race. The asset management giant’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) is approaching $100 billion in assets and has become BlackRock’s most profitable ETF product, Jiang told CNBC.
This surge in institutional participation marks a dramatic shift from just a year ago, when many financial professionals remained skeptical about crypto’s place in diversified portfolios. “Headwinds have become tailwinds for crypto,” Jiang said, particularly when it comes to equity investors embracing digital assets.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Most Investors Still Haven’t Touched Crypto
Despite Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, Jiang argues the market is far from saturated. A Bank of America survey conducted a few weeks ago revealed that more than 60% of investors still have zero exposure to digital assets, he said.
“The idea that digital assets are ‘too late in the game’ is not true,” Jiang told Reuters. “Most people still don’t own them.”"

- Markets roiled after Trump threatened an extra 100% tariff on Chinese goods, then said, ""Don't worry.""
- Elon Musk took a $16 billion blow, while Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg each took $10 billion hits.
The world's 10 richest people lost nearly $70 billion on Friday as fresh fears of a global trade war rattled markets.
The value of their stock holdings tumbled after President Donald Trump said the US would impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China from November 1, and restrict its access to ""any and all critical software,"" after China tightened export controls on rare earth elements and other key materials for advanced tech manufacturing.
Tesla stock slid 5% on Friday, shrinking CEO Elon Musk's wealth by about $16 billion, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw around $10 billion erased from their respective net worths as the e-commerce giant's stock fell 5% and the social media titan's shares dropped almost 4%.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took an $8 billion hit as the chipmaker's stock fell nearly 5%, while Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and Dell CEO Michael Dell both saw their fortunes shrink by more than $5 billion as shares of their companies retreated on worries of slower growth and more trade disruption. In all, the world's 10 wealthiest people saw a $69 billion wealth reduction.
Trump sought to reassure markets, posting to Truth Social on Sunday, ""Don't worry, It will all be fine."" Shares of Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Dell were trading around 2% higher as of 10:20 a.m ET on Monday, while Oracle shares were up 4.5%.
The 10 richest people's wealth loss sounds painful, but they were still collectively worth over $2.9 trillion at Friday's close, led by Musk's $437 billion, Ellison's $351 billion, Zuckerberg's $248 billion, and Bezos' $240 billion.
They were still $385 billion in the green for this year as of Friday, with a $159 billion year-to-date wealth gain for Ellison alone, fueled by Oracle's 75% stock surge in 2025.
All of them except LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault rank among the largest shareholders of US tech giants, meaning they've benefited significantly from the buzz around AI that has boosted tech stocks this year."

The DGX Spark, which Nvidia said offers data center-class performance, packs the company's GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, as well as its ConnectX-7 networking capabilities and software stack.
The idea is to provide smaller businesses and developers with access to an AI computing system without requiring them to spend thousands on renting AI data center services or buying their own AI servers.
The Spark is part of a new class of computer Nvidia is rolling out with third-party partners, including ASUS (2357.TW) and Dell (DELL), which will allow customers to develop and use AI models on their own local devices.
Nvidia said the Spark can be outfitted with up to 128GB of memory, which should help when running massive AI models.
“In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon [Musk] at a small startup called OpenAI — and from it came ChatGPT, kickstarting the AI revolution,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
“DGX-1 launched the era of AI supercomputers and unlocked the scaling laws that drive modern AI. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.”
Like the DGX-1, Huang also hand-delivered one of the first Spark systems to Musk.
The company also has a larger, more powerful DGX Station, which runs on Nvidia's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra desktop superchip.
But don't expect to grab a Spark or Station and start running your video games or other apps. The system runs on Nvidia's own Linux-based DGX OS and its AI software stack and is specifically designed for building and running AI models.
Nvidia also said users can connect two Spark systems to allow for even larger AI models with up to 405 billion parameters.
The Spark and Station are designed to complement Nvidia's existing AI offerings, enabling users to prototype AI models before deploying them more widely.
Nvidia holds the pole position in the AI chip race thanks to both its powerful processors and CUDA software service.
In addition to its desktop systems, the company continues to ink massive deals with AI companies, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) that will see the ChatGPT developer purchase 10 gigawatts of GPUs.
Last month, Nvidia signed a deal that will see CoreWeave (CRWV) purchase $6.3 billion worth of GPUs from the chip giant.
The company is also providing GPUs to Elon Musk's xAI (XAAI.PVT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and a slew of other tech behemoths — not to mention OpenAI and Oracle's (ORCL) joint Stargate Project venture."

The program is strategically timed to align with Amazon’s continued investment in logistics, infrastructure, and marketplace development across the continent, including new rollouts in Ireland and expanded same-day delivery coverage across major European cities.
The new initiative provides a structured pathway for US Amazon sellers seeking to diversify their sales beyond the saturated US market. Europe’s e-commerce sector offers multiple developed yet underpenetrated markets with strong consumer trust and consistent online shopping demand. By addressing critical challenges such as VAT compliance, marketplace localization, and logistics coordination, Lezzat enables sellers to scale internationally with clarity and minimize the risks typically associated with cross-border selling.
“Less than one percent of US Amazon sellers are currently active in Europe, despite the region including Germany – Amazon’s second-largest global marketplace that’s constantly expanding,” said Alexandros Karagiannis, Director at Lezzat. “Our program bridges that gap by removing the barriers that often make international expansion seem unattainable. For ambitious brands, this is an extraordinary opportunity to capture growth in markets where competition remains thin.”
A Timely Expansion Opportunity
Lezzat’s 2026 Amazon Europe Expansion service provides sellers with the expertise, infrastructure, and on-the-ground support needed to navigate the full-scope of cross-border e-commerce. It covers every aspect of international Amazon growth, offering end-to-end support that allows sellers to focus on scaling their brand while the agency manages compliance and operational demands.
Key features of the 2026 Expansion Service include:
-
VAT Registration and Compliance: Managed through trusted partner networks to ensure full regulatory alignment.
-
Marketplace Onboarding: Support for Germany, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, and additional European regions as Amazon’s network expands.
-
Listing Translation and Localization: Native-language adaptation to improve discoverability and engagement.
-
Advertising and Marketing Strategy: Full-service management of PPC, DSP, and advertising campaigns tailored to market behavior and seasonality.
-
Inventory Planning and Operations Management: Coordinated cross-border logistics, stock allocation, and cross-border fulfillment strategies to prevent delays and optimize cost efficiency.
-
Review and Reputation Management: Continuous monitoring and response strategies to help sellers build trust and long-term credibility with European customers."

The owners in question are Raymond Zage, a former hedge fund manager and U.S. expat now based in Singapore, and James Lu, a Chinese-American entrepreneur and former Amazon and Baidu exec. Together they led the 2020 acquisition of Grindr from Chinese ownership for over $600 million, then took the app public in 2022 through a blank-check merger.
Reportedly, Zage and Lu, who together control more than 60% of Grindr, pledged nearly all their shares as collateral for personal loans from a unit of Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek. After Grindr began a slide at the end of September, those loans became undercollateralized (worth less than the debt), so the Temasek unit seized and sold some of the shares last week.
Grindr’s stock slide appears disconnected from business fundamentals – profits were up 25% in the second quarter, Semafor notes, though it has seen some executive turnover; there has been some investor concern about narrowing margins, too.
Either way, the pair are now said to be in talks with Fortress Investment Group – itself now majority owned by Mubadala Investment Company, which is itself owned by the government of Abu Dhabi – to secure financing for a buyout at around $15 per share, which would value Grindr at around $3 billion. Shares jumped following the report."

Emily Flippen: The landscape of commerce is turning increasingly social. EV demand has been dampening, and are tariffs actually working? We'll discuss today on Motley Fool Money.
I'm Emily Flippen. Today, I'm joined by analysts Jason Hall and Dan Caplinger to discuss how the sale of TikTok in the United States could change the way we shop here at the start of Prime Day, as well as expectations for demand for electric vehicles now that domestic EV tax credits have expired. But first, I think it's worth taking a deeper look at whether or not we can call tariffs a success. I suspect all of our listeners are already familiar with the tariffs that the Trump administration has sought to implement over the course of the past year. Most empirical evidence says that, generally speaking, tariffs don't spur economic growth. In fact, most economists and investors speculated that they would actually cause profits to drop, stocks to fall, consumer spending to ease, and inflation to rise. But so far, it doesn't really seem like that's been the case. In fact, it's really been the opposite. Stocks are up. The economy has been really resilient, and inflation does seem to be moderating. Jason, when you look at this picture in terms of the economic policies we're seeing here, is it too early to call tariffs a relative success?
Jason Hall: I think if you're talking about the administration's goal of boosting US manufacturing, it's definitely way too early. So far, the only industries that have really been helped are the ones where there's already an entrenched base. You think about metals production, steel manufacturing. They've basically gotten a free license to increase their prices based on the tariffs that are in place on imports in those industries. You look at other manufacturing industries like the auto industry, whole building construction is a massive buyer of manufactured goods. They've actually been net hurt because they rely on a lot of imported goods, and the US just can't flip the switch quickly to produce those goods domestically. The agricultural sector has been impacted. We've seen countries like China has pulled back on buying US soybeans because of reciprocal tariffs, and tariffs on Chinese goods that are imported into the US. Semiconductor companies are feeling a huge pinch in China. Chinese companies are basically being told don't buy US chips unless you have no other choice. You look at the stock market, guys, this is an AI story. A JP Morgan analyst put out a research note, and he pointed out that since ChatGPT came out in November of 2022, three quarters of the S&P 500 returns have come from AI-related companies. Over that same period, 80% of the S&P 500's earnings growth has come from those companies. If you start peeling back the layers, it's obvious that we have a bifurcated market and economy. Plenty of companies are not doing well. In a lot of cases, because tariffs are either increasing their costs and/or putting pressure on already squeezed consumers who have been feeling the pinch from inflation for four years now.
Emily Flippen: I think it's a fair point that there's clearly this disconnect that's happening between what consumers are feeling and what the stock market is doing and what investors are experiencing. But if the stock market isn't actually the correct indicator of how well the economy is doing it, that's not the barometer we're looking at. If that's not the scoreboard, Dan, when you look at it, what is the right gauge for gauging or judging success?
Dan Caplinger: Well, I think there's a couple of directions that you can go with that, Emily. The first is to judge it from the goals that the administration had. I think that one of the primary goals that the Trump administration had was to make companies, both foreign and domestic, have the internal conversation. Are we interested in expanding US manufacturing capacity? Are we interested in sourcing more products that go to US consumers from US sources? That's the goal. I think those conversations are happening that they have taken place. As Jason said, the answer is not always going to be necessarily what the administration wanted, but they've definitely been able to define the conversation. They've been able to set the subject and put that in front of people, and let those folks come to whatever conclusions they have for their businesses. I think for big businesses, like Jason said, it's not always going to be a matter of flipping the switch, but it is a matter of if they make the decision to move more production and sourcing to US, that's going to be an option for them. It's the small businesses that I think have more trouble. Emily, I live in the middle of nowhere in Western Massachusetts. No big cities near me. There are plenty of small businesses that really did rely on cheaper goods from other countries in order to keep afloat. These tariffs, they are the marginal companies. They are the companies that are having to go out of business because of the extra costs due to the tariffs. They don't have the margins to be able to absorb those tariffs temporarily. That's the distinction that I see. The other thing that I think is a real issue is not so much the tariffs themselves, but the uncertainty surrounding how long are tariffs going to be in place? Are they going to be permanent? Is the rate going to change? Is it going to go up? Is it going to go down? It's impossible for businesses to have a good long-term sense of, OK, if an investment is going to take 5-10 years to pay off, is the policy just going to change back? Or is it going to get worse? Or am I making a smart decision? It's just really difficult to figure that out.
Jason Hall: That's exactly right, Dan. It takes years to transition manufacturing and supply chains. We're six months into this, guys. The bigger question that I think we don't know the answer to is will US buyers, whether it's consumers or businesses, are they going to be willing to soak up the higher cost to manufacture more things domestically? According to an American Enterprise Institute study, there's about $1.7 trillion in goods that the administration is targeting to try to bring to domestic manufacturing, and it would cost about 21% more to manufacture them at home. That's an extra $257 billion a year. Plus, there's another $348 billion in tariffs that the AEI estimates would have to remain in place to keep that US manufacturing competitive. That's $606 billion a year that American buyers would have to pay for the same goods we're buying today. I mentioned AI before. Maybe this is the problem that AI can help solve.
Dan Caplinger: Being a little glib.
Jason Hall: But maybe that actually is part of the answer.
Emily Flippen: Dare to dream here. I have to say, I think that part of the impact and part of the reason why there is that disconnect is just because we haven't felt the full force of the economic brunt of these tariffs. I saw some interesting data that was collected by Bloomberg over the course of the past month. They tracked more than two dozen of Temu. That is the shopping site owned by Pinduoduo, PDD Holdings, their most popular products. They found that their prices actually fell nearly 20% between April and September because they were attempting to make up for some of the costs that consumers were going to be paying for these tariffs. Further data collected by Goldman Sachs has shown that even American businesses have taken on the majority of the brunt of the cost of tariff impacts, that shoe will have to drop eventually, which is to say they can't continue to take on the impacts of tariffs to your point. Dan, we don't know exactly how long they're going to continue, what they could look like over the long term. Right now, consumers aren't bearing the full impact. I expect that, especially as we go into the holiday season, if we start to see some of those price increases come down the line, and businesses, whether they be domestic or foreign start to pass along those price increases, that's when we'll really start to see the economic impacts, and that's when we'll start to have it show up in our economic data as well. Up next, we'll be moving to the other side of the purchase equation to discuss TikTok, Prime Day, and how social commerce has redefined the shopping experience. Stick with us.
Today is the first day of Prime Day, and we're all underwhelmed. It seems like despite posting record dollars every year, a results that I have no doubt is driven by mainly inflation, enthusiasm from shoppers just always feel increasingly diffused year after year. Dan, when you look at Prime Day and social commerce in general, is this just a combination of weaker economic conditions or just shoppers changing the way that they're shopping or is it just something else entirely?
Dan Caplinger: I'm embarrassed to say that when we first talked about this topic, I was like, ""Whoa, it's going to be Prime Day again? Wasn't it just Prime Day like a few months ago?"" That's the thing is that we've been having Prime Day. Consumers like fresh concepts, fresh ideas. Prime Day is maybe hitting it past its prime, perhaps. It's been going on for 10 years now. It's a long time to keep it new, keep it interesting, keep it front and center. Amazon's done what they can to try to build and iterate and make it more interesting, but it's faced a bunch of problems. One is that the rest of retail said, ""Okay. Fine, Amazon, you want to create this new holiday for shopping in the middle of the year? Well, we'll be happy to sell to our customers at the same time on the same days as well."" It's not just Amazon having this random sale in the middle of the year. It's everybody else now jumping onto that and saying, ""Hey, people are in the mood to buy. Why don't you buy from us instead of them?"" Amazon hasn't really been able to maintain exclusive ownership of the event. The other thing I think is, keep in mind, Amazon, the original goal of Prime Day, probably first and foremost, was to try to get people to sign up for Amazon Prime, for the subscription service. Back in 2015, there were a lot of people who weren't Prime members. But 10 years later, there are a lot of Prime members. It's almost mission accomplished. There's just not that many people left to sign up. As a result, I think Amazon is facing this existential question with Prime Day. It's like, what do we want it this to be going forward? We've already done a great job of increasing our market share of the number of shoppers in the US and elsewhere who are Prime members. At the same time, plenty of other reasons to join Prime outside to shopping. It may be time for a reset, I think.
Jason Hall: Dan, I think it's more an indictment of you and me in our demographic, because you're not the only GenX dude on this podcast that did not realize that Prime Day was starting. Guys, I spend an embarrassingly large amount of money on Amazon every single week. That's the bottom line. But here's the thing. Literally, guys, as I'm typing out the outline, I get a text from my wife, and I'm going to read it to you guys now. I quote, ""I've got a slap full Amazon cart for Prime Day. I want to chat about it with you."" I don't really know if there's really anything else to say. We're not really the target anymore for that, but here's the other thing that I think maybe matters more. The noise around social shopping is pretty loud right now, but if there's anything we've learned from social media is that it's a great marketing channel, but literally nowhere across social media, his shopping is a habitual thing stuck. Facebook has tried it. Twitter has tried marketing. We've seen Pinterest make fits and starts attempts, and there's not a better social platform than Pinterest to be e-commerce. I think it may be a thing that maybe drives fashion trends and that thing, but it's more a top of the funnel. I think shopping is just a habitual thing. If you look at the numbers, again, we know that the lower and middle income consumers are the ones being squeezed. We can look at McDonald's and Amazon competitor Walmart as just some data points I think support it. McDonald's comps were 2.5% last quarter at the same source sales growth. That's lower than inflation. Walmart's revenue was up 5% in the second quarter. It's e-commerce sales are up 25%. That shows you there's still a lot of pressure. Then thinking about those inflation and tariff that we talked about before, GAAP operating income was actually down 8% and flat on an adjusted basis. I don't think we're going to see some massive disruption of retail from what's going on with TikTok potentially becoming US company or any of those sorts of things. It's just a tough time for consumers right now, and these big companies are feeling that pinch.
Emily Flippen: I actually disagree, Jason.
Jason Hall: I love the fact that you disagree.
Emily Flippen: I think you're right. Conceptually, big picture, you're right. But I do think when you look at social commerce in general, especially the way it operates in international geographies versus here in the United States, it just shows how people tend to engage with what they were raised on or habitualized. There's so many Prime shoppers, for instance, that were habitualized with buying on Amazon. To your point, Dan, it's no longer really about getting people to sign up for Prime. It's just a reminder you're mostly doing all your shopping on Amazon anyway, so it's just an excuse to maybe buy one or two extra things that went on sale today or maybe you delayed purchasing until they were on sale. When I look at the way that social commerce and e-commerce was built in places like China, back when mobile phones were accessible at the same exact time, credit cards were accessible. It just the way that people were going about purchasing and shopping was built on social before it was built on sites like Amazon. That has become habitual process of purchasing internationally. I don't necessarily think it has taken off in the United States exactly the same way it has internationally, but I think TikTok has been that turning point for buyers, and it's Prime Day every day on TikTok, so to speak. I worry a little bit big picture that the sale of TikTok could cause some people to either lose faith or engagement in the platform long-term, but I don't think that the idea of social commerce and purchasing based on trends or engagement with influencers, whatever it may be, I don't think that trend is going to go away, even if it shifts off of sites like TikTok. I am happy that Amazon has Amazon Web Services, which is generating something like 60% of its operating profit because Amazon, in my opinion, has been very slow to adjust to the social commerce trends. I worry a little bit that as we start to age out of the demographic here for commerce that they're not going to do a great job of convincing younger shoppers that they need to have an Amazon Prime membership.
Dan Caplinger: For me, the question as it goes with TikTok is going to be, what do content producing influencers decide to do? Are they going to take the shift in ownership and treat that as a catalyst to make them consider alternatives? If they do that, then that's going to be a shift, and the marketing will then follow the influencers. I don't think that it's going to be an external decision where external marketers tell influencers that they need to leave TikTok. I think that that's probably going to be an influencer judge decision, and I'll be curious to see how it works out, because if there is a big exodus among influencers from the platform, the question is going to be, what platform do they go to? Then that becomes the next TikTok, and then that becomes the next target of regulation. Where does that circle end?
Jason Hall: All roads lead to AI. AI is going to be doing our shopping for us in five years, guys.
Emily Flippen: I dare to dream there, Jason. If it could take care of my shopping for me, I would definitely take it up on it.

Emily Flippen: I hope everybody has already made their car purchases because September 30th was the last day for Americans to qualify for their federal EV tax credits. Automakers have been dreading this drop off for months now, and it could have come at a worse time. Tesla has really struggled to maintain deliveries. Ford's CEO expects EV sales could drop by half, and BYD just posted its first monthly year-over-year sales decline in more than a year-and-a-half. Jason, do electric vehicles need to shift in policies to drive adoption or is this just a temporary speed bump?
Jason Hall: I think we're about to find out, Emily. I know that's not a direct answer here, and I'm dancing around it a little bit, but I don't think we completely know a couple things. Our cars writ large have continued to become more expensive. Car prices on average are up about 16 new car prices on average are up about 16% since March 2021, according to Kelley Blue Book. That's helping create a little more parity to the cost of an EV versus an internal combustion engine powered car. There's still cost pressures, but the EV industry is starting to benefit from some other things to bring costs down. Higher scale manufacturing for batteries, and then advanced battery technology, they are bringing battery costs down. That's a big thing. I think those things might help over the longer term. We just don't really know how it's going to play out in the near term.
Dan Caplinger: I just don't think that tax credits are necessarily the linchpin of what determines the success in the EV industry at this point. To me, the key to adoption is reliable infrastructure. I'll just tell you, charging anywhere other than Tesla Supercharger Network, it's just a nightmare. I mean, I'm the target audience for this. I would love to drive an electric vehicle, and the electric vehicles that I've driven, I love how they perform. It's just really good acceleration. It's just the handling is great. But I'll tell you, I went to Florida, and the only rental car that they had left was an EV, a non-Tesla EV. It changed the complexion of the entire trip because suddenly, I had range anxiety. I couldn't just up and go to the next city down the coast to go check out the beach there and not think about, OK, am I going to have enough charge to get back in time for dinner? Where am I going to go? What are the charging options going to be? They really need to get the infrastructure up to speed before EV adoption is really going to hit the mainstream. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that's going to happen because at the policy level, we used to have tailwinds that were inspiring companies to spend on improving infrastructure for electric vehicles. That now in the current administration has turned into headwinds, not just on the tax credit side, but just on broader policy priorities and energy policy. With no real appetite for investment, I don't have nearly the expectation for improvement in EV infrastructure that I did a year ago.
Emily Flippen: The economic equation, especially as it applies to energy right now in a more expensive world for energy has gotten more expensive for electric vehicles. Without the incentives, at least as the environment exists right now, it's really hard to make the math work for new car purchases to move electric versus traditional.
Jason Hall: Well, just on the purchaser side, if you look on the manufacturing side, Tesla's bottom line may be hit more because of the loss of some tax credits that they were able to sell to other automakers to offset some tax liability. That's billions of dollars a year in high margin revenue that is going to completely go away. Part of the answer for that Tesla, after we record this today, is supposed to be announcing a lower cost model. Why? I think as much as anything, that's an immediate evidence that the automakers are having to react quickly with cost cuts to be competitive. Let me just say this last thing. Besides Tesla and BYD, find another mass market automaker. I'm throwing Ferrari out here. That's a brand that they're selling. Find an automaker, EV or otherwise, that has been a market beating investments over the past decade, and you will not find them besides again, Tesla and BYD. Most of the other EV stocks, they've wiped out tens of billions in investor value. This is just a tough, brutal industry. Even Tesla's future is less tied to cars and more to AI, autonomy services, robotics, and those sorts of things. They need to make profit from cars to pay for that stuff, but this is just a tough industry. If I were an investor, looking in this space, I would immediately go find somewhere else where the tailwinds are tied to profits. Hey, guys, maybe artificial intelligence. What do you say?
Dan Caplinger: I do have to say, though, Jason, I think that Tesla does have the opportunity to extract even more money for supercharger access to the other automakers for exactly the reasons that you just mentioned. Because of these policy headwinds, that could be a nice addition to Tesla's cash cow business there that could help fund AI, robotics, automation, all those other priorities.
Emily Flippen: Well, as always, I like to sign off here with the lightning rounds. Maybe you'll have some more hot takes for us, Jason. We discussed a lot of things today, electric vehicles, online shopping, tariff policies, so I really want to put you both and myself included on the spot to maybe give one of our favorite stocks that's likely to benefit from one of the broader trends we talked about. Dan, let me go to you first.
Dan Caplinger: I'm going to mention Symbotic. This is ticker SYM on the NASDAQ. It's a company. It's been heavily involved in improving warehouse storage technology, basically automating the warehouse with autonomous robots that help streamline movement of goods inside of those facilities, make the supply chain more efficient. I think that that company potentially benefits both from tariff-related pushes to get more manufacturing and warehousing back onshore, as well as just the overall positive trends in e-commerce over time.
Jason Hall: Well, I've mentioned AI a ton of time, so I might as well stick with that. Dan, you brought up robotics in warehouses, and this just lines up perfectly. Let's talk about Amazon again. It's winning from AI with its own AI-driven products. AWS, a lot of compute to build artificial intelligence is happening at AWS. We know that's the profit driver there, as you mentioned. Emily, it's starting to supercharge its Alexa products with AI. It's using AI to help shoppers. Also, hat tip to Dan on this one. Like I said, guys, it's one of the largest robotics companies on Earth, and people sometimes forget about that. I think it's later this year, if they haven't already passed it, Amazon will have actually deployed more robots in its warehouse than human workers. That's a big leg up in driving those costs down, Dan. Like you said, that helps offset the impact of tariffs and also labor inflation on its bottom line. One last thing, I'll do a little Steve Jobs here, too. Let's not forget about Zoox. That's the autonomous right hailing start-up that Amazon bought back in 2020. Largely, guess what? They got a lot of great AI and robotic stuff that's part of that. Three decades later, Amazon's still square in the middle of all of the innovations that are going to be changing the world for decades to come.
Emily Flippen: Well, now, I feel very insecure about the stock that I was going to go with because I feel sold. I'd never heard of Symbotic before, Dan, and you're staying. Of course, I know Amazon, and maybe my skepticism there on the commerce side is unwarranted, but I was actually going to go with BYD. The ticker is BYDDY.
Jason Hall: One of the only winners in the EV space. This is a great choice.
Emily Flippen: Well, I will say, I take to heart what you mentioned about the fact that cars have traditionally or automobile manufacturers have traditionally not been great investments. It's a pretty heavily commoditized space. They compete really heavily on price. But the reason why I like BYD, I mean, this is a battery company at its heart with a management team that has been incredibly focused on what I think is most important to win in this space, which is efficiency. BYD is really the only low-cost electric vehicle manufacturer that is managing to make vehicles worldwide at a rate that is, in my opinion, accessible to the average person. When we talk about the economic decision making for car purchases, being really against adoption of electric vehicles right now, that means the lowest cost model probably is the one that wins. I'm disappointed that we don't have more updates out from Tesla on the day that we're taping this. We're owed it today. Hasn't come out by the time that we're finishing taping. Maybe Tesla will eventually come out with their low-cost model, but BYD, in my opinion, is just leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to the accessibility of low-cost electric vehicles. That's going, in my opinion, really underappreciated by American investors. Well, fools, we hope that that was a hopefully somewhat interesting and useful podcast. We discussed lots of different topics. Ending here with some of our favorite investments that hopefully everybody could consider potentially adding to their portfolios. Jason and Dan, thank you both so much for joining today.
Dan Caplinger: Thanks, Emily.

The crypto market just sent a clear message to skeptics: digital assets aren’t going away. Exchange-traded funds tracking cryptocurrencies shattered records with $5.95 billion in inflows last week, propelling bitcoin to an all-time high of $126,223 on Oct. 6.
The record capital flooded into digital asset investment products during the week ended Oct. 4, according to data from Coinshares. Bitcoin surged past its August peak on Oct. 5, extending gains that pushed the world’s largest cryptocurrency above $126,000 for the first time.

Where the Money Is Coming From
The U.S. led with $5 billion in crypto ETF inflows, followed by Switzerland at $563 million and Germany at $312 million—both setting new records, Reuters reported, citing data from CoinShares. Bitcoin attracted $3.55 billion, while Ethereum drew $1.48 billion. Solana and XRP weren’t far behind, pulling in $706.5 million and $219.4 million respectively.
But what’s driving this momentum isn’t just retail FOMO. Bitcoin’s ascent comes alongside a record rally in traditional safe haven gold, as a weakening U.S. dollar amid trade uncertainty and economic concerns is pushing investors to diversify their portfolios, Reuters reported.
“This level of investment highlights the growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said in the firm's weekly report.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
The Institutional Shift That Changes Everything
Here’s what separates this rally from past crypto manias: institutional acceptance is accelerating faster than even bulls anticipated. Deutsche Bank expects bitcoin to feature on most central banks’ balance sheets, alongside gold, by 2030—a projection that would have seemed absurd just five years ago, according to Fortune.
The cryptocurrency rally this year has been driven by more supportive policies under U.S. President Donald Trump, demand from institutional investors, and bitcoin’s deepening integration with global financial markets, according to Reuters.
That integration is happening in real time. While retail investors chase price movements, institutions are quietly building infrastructure that treats bitcoin as a legitimate portfolio asset rather than a speculative gamble. The record ETF inflows reflect this shift—these aren’t day traders making impulsive bets, but wealth managers and pension funds methodically allocating capital."

Amazon (AMZN, Financials) stated that it would hire 250,000 staff for the holidays. This is the same amount of individuals it hired in the last two years.. The move shows that demand is expected to stay consistent, even though shoppers are being careful as the busy holiday season approaches.
The new jobs will include delivery and transportation networks all around the United States. Full-time and part-time workers will make an average of $23 an hour, while seasonal workers will get more than $19 an hour.
This news comes after Amazon spent $1 billion to improve compensation and cut healthcare expenses for its U.S. operations workers.
Retailers have different ideas about what will happen this season. Target and Best Buy maintained their full-year forecasts the same, but Walmart and Macy's boosted theirs. Analysts predict that this year, buyers will probably be more picky as they become used to the economy's uncertainty and the effects of President Donald Trump's new tariffs on Chinese goods.
Adobe Analytics thinks that online holiday sales will rise more slowly than last year, but they will still be better than in-store sales. Most stores already have their supplies full, so increases in tariffs won't have an immediate effect on prices."

Over the course of 323 pages, Davenport tells the tale of how competing missions between SpaceX (which wants to colonize Mars) and Blue Origin, which wants to ""build the road to space"" more locally (i.e., between Earth and its moon), are driving both privately owned companies to ever-higher heights -- both figuratively and literally.
How Blue Origin could get bigger than Amazon
Established in 2000, two years before Elon Musk set up SpaceX, Blue Origin started out small -- and slow. For the first 15 years of its existence, in fact, you probably didn't realize Blue Origin existed. It wasn't until 2015 that the company conducted its first spaceflight, a suborbital test of the tiny unmanned New Shepard rocket. But later that same year, New Shepard successfully launched and then landed back on Earth, one full month before SpaceX was able to accomplish the same feat with its Falcon 9 (orbital class) rocket.
Like Blue's gradatim ferociter motto (step by step, ferociously) suggests, Blue Origin is making steady progress -- in part by following in SpaceX's footsteps.
You may recall that 2015 was also the first year investors began thinking seriously about SpaceX as a potential investment. In 2015, Elon Musk announced plans to build a constellation of broadband internet satellites -- the concept that would eventually become Starlink. To get his idea off the ground, SpaceX invited a $1 billion investment by Alphabet and Fidelity, which valued the space company at $10 billion.
10 years later, SpaceX is worth $400 billion. That's a 40x gain in just 10 years.
Does Blue Origin deserve a SpaceX-size valuation?
Valuing Blue Origin is trickier. Whereas SpaceX has conducted multiple rounds of stock sales on the private market, details of which are regularly leaked, Blue Origin is funded almost entirely by its founder, Jeff Bezos, who is reported to be spending at least $2 billion annually to keep the company afloat. Still, various analysts who have tried to hang a valuation on Blue Origin estimate it might be worth $50 billion to $100 billion.
And what's 40 times $50 billion to $100 billion? That's right. $2 trillion minimum.
And potentially as much as $4 trillion.
How to go from $50 billion to $4 trillion (hint: you need a map)
If you ask management at Blue Origin, it'll deny it, but Blue wants to follow in SpaceX's footsteps in more ways than just valuation. ""SpaceX has shown how a commercial space company can be profitable, setting the standard for a resurgent Blue Origin,"" argues Davenport, and proving that ""the commercial space industry [is] for real.""
SpaceX owes much of its success to Elon Musk's decision to bid early on for government contracts to resupply the International Space Station (ISS) and, later, to help ""American astronauts [fly on] American rockets from American soil"" back to ISS, as former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine famously put it. These contracts functioned as government seed capital for SpaceX, giving it the resources it needed to develop ever-better versions of Falcon 9, and the supersized Falcon Heavy rocket, Starlink, and Starship as well.
In contrast, Blue Origin declined to bid on either of these two big contracts (known as Commercial Resupply and Commercial Crew, respectively), and it has increasingly lagged SpaceX as a result. The company only this year finally launched its first orbital-class rocket, New Glenn, and orbited its first few ""Kuipersat"" internet satellites as well. As a result, Blue Origin has fallen years behind SpaceX in launch cadence, in satellite volume, and in market capitalization.
As Bezos is quoted as telling his executives, ""Elon's real superpower is getting government money."" Going forward, Blue Origin intends to imitate that same strategy. ""From now on, we go after everything that SpaceX bids on.""
Will this strategy succeed in making Blue Origin ""bigger than Amazon""? Only time will tell. At the very least, though, Blue Origin has now identified a strategy for competing, and it's one that's proven successful for its archrival. As Blue Origin racks up contract wins in national security launch, in lunar landers, and even in space stations, SpaceX finally has some competition in America's race to space."

This is as investors piled into companies present in the hot area of artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon (AMZN -0.60%), a company operating in the consumer goods and tech sectors, has benefited from this momentum, climbing in the double digits over the past three years, but performance this year has been lackluster -- at the moment, the stock is down about 1% year to date.
The reason? Investors have worried about the impact of President Donald Trump's import tariffs on the company's e-commerce business -- and Amazon also has suffered at certain points this year amid general concern about the valuations of technology stocks. If the industry as a whole looks expensive, investors may avoid it. So, now it's reasonable to ask whether these headwinds will continue, or whether Amazon might soon explode higher. Where will Amazon stock be in a year? Let's find out.
Amazon's moat
First, let's take a step back to consider the Amazon story of the past few years. As you probably know, the company owns the global e-commerce giant Amazon.com, and this business generates billions of dollars in revenue year after year. Amazon has kept customers coming back thanks to its fantastic subscription service, Prime, which offers members everything from fast and free shipping to content like books and movies. This, along with Amazon's extensive fulfillment and delivery network, represent a solid moat -- a competitive advantage that should keep it ahead of rivals.
Though Amazon's e-commerce business suffered in the high interest rate environment a few years ago, the company at that point made a key move that should set it up for long-term success. It revamped its cost structure, and at the same time, the company leaned more heavily into using AI to help it improve efficiency. We've already seen the results of this, as Amazon has returned to growth -- after a loss in 2022 --and the efforts are lowering the company's cost to serve. As this continues, Amazon should progressively make gains in profitability.
Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing business and biggest profit engine, has established itself as a major player in the AI space. AWS offers customers everything they may need for their AI projects, from top Nvidia chips and budget-friendly chips designed by AWS itself to access to large language models (LLMs). As the world's biggest cloud services provider, it's well positioned to win customers for its AI offerings -- and we can see these results already, with AWS achieving a $123 billion annual revenue run rate in the recent quarter.
What's ahead for Amazon?
Still, these positive points haven't been enough to supercharge the stock this year. So, where do I think Amazon will be a year from now? As mentioned, investors have worried about the impact of U.S. import tariffs on earnings. Amazon has said that in the first half of the year it didn't see lower demand or significantly higher prices on items -- and the company said that, moving forward, its broad range of sellers means a customer probably will find the best prices on Amazon.
If Amazon's upcoming earnings reports show sustained growth in revenue, supporting this idea of limited tariff impact, investors may reconsider Amazon stock -- especially since, today, trading for 32x forward earnings estimates, down from 50x less than two years ago, it looks very reasonably priced.
At the same time, capacity for AI workloads is in high demand, and this should continue to fuel revenue growth at AWS. As mentioned above, Amazon's earnings also are likely to benefit from the cost structure improvements and use of AI to gain in efficiency.
Of course, it's impossible to predict share price performance over the coming year, but it's fair to say that Amazon has what it takes to advance and potentially outperform other technology companies that have seen their shares surge this year. Investors might be looking to lock in profits in some cases and rotate into a quality company that hasn't yet seen its shares skyrocket -- and that could make this consumer and tech player a winner a year from now."

For instance, Susquehanna raised their price target to $400 from $300 last week after TSM reported a 31.4% increase in September sales (vs. Sep'24). And the Jan-Sep run-rate compares at +36.4% yoy.
Taiwan Semiconductor, aka TSMC, is the premier chip fabrication company for the world's most advanced digital technologies, from Apple smartphones to NVIDIA GPUs.
In less than five years, TSMC's trailing 12-month revenue has more than doubled to hit nearly $105 billion as of the June quarter. Clearly, this is on the back of NVIDIA's (NVDA) explosive growth which saw sales grow by ten times in the same period to $165 billion as of the July quarter, on its way to cross $205 billion this fiscal year (ends January).
Of course, demand for NVIDIA GPU systems didn't turn into a hockey stick until its ""ChatGPT moment"" in the spring of 2023.
I mark that moment in late May at Computex in Taipei City, Taiwan when Jensen Huang unveiled the DGX Grace Hopper 200 system and said that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms (META) were already in line.
To me, this meant that the other 996 corporations in the Fortune 1,000 would want (or need) to build their own LLMs too. I then published this article and video to explain what was coming...
Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion
And that $2 trillion market cap came quickly. That's when the ""AI bubble"" talk started. You can imagine how astonished the bubble breathers are now that NVDA is approaching a $5 trillion market cap.
""Honey, I Shrunk the Chips!""
While Apple's business has been significant for TSMC (as much as 25% of revenues), the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in the low single digits.
What still makes Apple very important though is how they help drive innovation at TSMC by always demanding the latest and greatest architectures for their ecosystem of devices.
TSMC supplies chips for flagship smartphones and 5G infrastructure, where efficiency and miniaturization are crucial. The company’s 5nm and 3nm transistor nodes are widely adopted in high-end mobile devices and 5G equipment, supporting the global rollout of next-generation connectivity.
Transistor nodes refer to the specific manufacturing processes used to produce integrated circuits, where the ""nm"" (nanometer = 1 billionth of a meter) like 7nm or 5nm, historically represented a physical dimension of the transistor, specifically the gate length. For reference, the coronavirus is about 50nm.
Now it's more of a marketing term that signifies a new generation of chip technology with improved performance, power efficiency, and transistor density.
But generally, a smaller node number means...
Smaller transistors: More transistors can be packed into the same area on a chip.
Faster switching: Electrons have a shorter distance to travel, leading to higher clock speeds.
Lower power consumption: Less voltage is needed to operate the smaller transistors.
Why the AI Economy is Not a Bubble
Which brings us back to NVIDIA as they now pack 208 billion transistors into the Grace Blackwell ""superchip"" with further density on the horizon in the Rubin and Feynman series of GPUs expected in 2026 and 2027, following Jensen's nearly annual cadence of development.
I mentioned the early demand for NVIDIA systems in 2023 and have recently seen similar projections from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Marvell (MRVL) at their Custom AI Investor Event that total datacenter capex by the big ""hyperscalers"" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) plus Meta, Tesla (TSLA), OpenAI, Apple, and xAI, will grow from nearly $600 billion this year to over $1 trillion in 2028.
This demand is not slowing down because all these companies realize that the transition to an ""AI economy"" is built on the infrastructure of NVIDIA GPU systems. I am on record late last year saying that this megatrend would lead to over $500 billion in revenues for NVIDIA by 2030. That's only ~35% CAGR from when the TTM topline crossed $100 billion.
And Citi just updated their industry outlook in their ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Energy"" report. The bank forecasts global AI infra capex at $5.5 trillion cumulative through 2029 (56% CAGR), hitting $2.16T in 2029 alone. So that's a double from 2028's $1 trillion.
And that's the infrastructure to power not just generative and agentic AI systems (i.e., LLMs), but a whole new world of ""physical AI"" for autonomous machines, including self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and many other types of 3D automation requiring ""embodied"" or edge intelligence and vision/spatial perception.
And of course my favorite use cases for these technologies are science and medicine, where researchers can plumb the depths of our existence and come back with wondrous and life-changing knowledge.
The training alone for these worlds requires enormous datasets and compute, using simulation and synthetic models. In this way, Jensen is forging a new universe of possibilities that keep TSMC ""fabs"" humming.
TSMC is the Backbone of the AI Economy
TSMC holds about 67% of the global foundry market and nearly 90% of advanced chip production, making it the preferred manufacturer for high-performance, custom AI accelerators and GPUs.
While NVIDIA designs the magical GPUs and systems that power the innovations of the AI Economy, it all starts with Taiwan Semi's advanced silicon fabrication. This is the epitome of high-tech manufacturing using lithographic etching to create circuits smaller than the eye can see.
And what's better for crafting new chips than brand new ""fabs"" as TSMC just broke ground on their 3rd facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In late June, Softbank's Masayoshi Son announced new plans to invest in a $1 trillion industrial complex in Arizona that will build robots and AI technologies.
Son is seeking to create a version of China's vast manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, which concentrates high-tech companies for proximity of resources, logistics, R&D, collaboration, and talent. TSMC was named as a key partner in Son's plans.
Currently for TSMC, the 5nm and 3nm nodes are the backbone for state-of-the-art AI accelerators, powering chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple that are used in generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.
In Q1 2025, 58% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from 3nm and 5nm nodes, with 73% from 7nm and below, underscoring the centrality of these advanced processes in TSMC's business and the broader tech ecosystem.
But TSMC wouldn't be itself if it wasn't planning to go deeper. The company plans to begin production of its 2nm node by late 2025, promising significant gains in power efficiency and performance. Looking further ahead, mass production of the 1.4nm (14 angstroms) process is slated for 2028, offering 10–15% higher speeds or 25–30% lower energy use compared to 2nm."

Shares of beauty products company Estée Lauder (NYSE:EL) jumped 6.4% in the afternoon session after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to 'Buy' from 'Neutral' and raised its price target.
The investment bank increased its price target on the stock to $115 from a previous $76. Analysts at the firm noted that the cosmetics giant was at a ""fundamental inflection point,"" with the business potentially returning to sales growth. The optimism was fueled by signs of a stabilizing market in China and a recovery in global travel retail, both of which had been areas of struggle for the company. Estée Lauder itself had anticipated a return to top-line growth and expected to achieve double-digit profit margins by its 2027 fiscal year. The upgrade reflected confidence in the company's strategic initiatives, including new brand launches on platforms like Amazon and TikTok.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Estée Lauder’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 28 days ago when the stock gained 3.5% on the news that an analyst at Evercore ISI Group reiterated a positive outlook on the company, raising the firm's price target. Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein maintained an ""Outperform"" rating on the beauty products giant while increasing the price target to $115 from $100. This 15% upward adjustment in the target price signals a more bullish view from the analyst firm. The new target suggests a potential upside of nearly 33% for the stock over the next twelve months, offering a positive signal to investors after the stock had recently experienced a downward trend.
Estée Lauder is up 25.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $92.95 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $95.76 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Estée Lauder’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $416.78.

Nvidia (NVDA) in late September said it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) as part of a partnership for the ChatGPT maker to use Nvidia’s chips to train and run its next generation of models.
This is just one of a flurry of deals among a tight web of Big Tech players that have been made public in the last few months. There's also Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). And on Monday, the ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.
Wall Street analysts say the agreements highlight a growing trend: AI infrastructure providers, led by Nvidia, are investing in their customers, who then turn around and buy more of the infrastructure providers’ products. In other cases, customers of infrastructure like OpenAI are investing in their suppliers.
Analysts interviewed by Yahoo Finance said there are two major concerns with the circular dynamic seen in the recent spree of AI investments. For one, the nature of the transactions could make it seem like there’s greater demand for AI than there really is. It also drives a closer link among the valuations of Big Tech companies — especially given that their respective stocks have soared on news of such deals — and intertwine their fates so that a hit to any one company would be bad news for the entire ecosystem, the experts said.
“The latest developments are very troubling,” said tech analyst and Bokeh Capital Partners chief investment officer Kim Forrest. “Vendors [of AI infrastructure] have gotten a lot of money, so they're just shoving money back into their customers that may be poorly spent.”
Cornell professor Karan Girotra said instances of vendors and customers financially supporting one another reduce the “resilience” of the overall system: “If something goes wrong, then the effect flows through the system rather than [being] isolated.”
Legendary short seller Jim Chanos, famous for predicting the fall of Enron during the dot-com bust, also weighed in, writing in a post on X last week, “[Don’t] you think it’s a bit odd that when the narrative is ‘demand for compute is infinite’, the sellers keep subsidizing the buyers?”"

Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried says his “single biggest mistake” was handing the company over to restructuring officers as part of bankruptcy proceedings.
“The single biggest mistake I made by far was handing the company over,” Bankman-Fried told the magazine Mother Jones in an interview published last week.
Bankman-Fried is appealing his 25-year prison sentence for defrauding FTX investors and customers. The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed in November 2022 after a rush of withdrawals revealed an $8 billion hole in its balance sheet.

A significant portion of the deficit was the result of a concealed credit line to sister trading company Alameda Research, court proceedings later revealed. The so-called “backdoor” provided Alameda with unfettered access to FTX customer funds for speculative bets, without the knowledge or consent of investors and users.
Unable to secure a deal to plug the hole and meet withdrawal demands, Bankman-Fried yielded to pressure from his law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, to hand over the company to bankruptcy expert John J. Ray III on Nov. 11, 2022.
Bankman-Fried told Mother Jones that minutes after signing FTX over, he received a call that sparked hope of a potential investment that could save the company and he tried to revoke his signature. However, it was too late, and Ray immediately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, hiring Sullivan & Cromwell to oversee the process.

Bankman-Fried said that he could have salvaged the situation given the opportunity to be involved in the bankruptcy process. However, Ray refused to engage with Bankman-Fried after taking over, according to a January 2023 court filing.
Bankman-Fried, who maintains that he did not defraud anyone, told Mother Jones that FTX was solvent when he handed it over to Ray, referring to illiquid investments Alameda made with FTX customer funds. The funds were “always sitting there, in the company,” he said.
“We always had more value in assets than we had in liabilities,” he said. “But when you’re talking the billions, you can’t just go sell off everything in a matter of 20 minutes.”
Ray said in a March 2024 letter that Bankman-Fried’s claims that FTX was solvent were “categorically, callously and demonstrably false.”"

Management raised its full-year 2025 operating margin guidance to 30%, up from 29%, citing robust pricing, ad growth and favorable FX trends. This follows a strong second quarter, where the operating margin expanded 700 basis points year over year, driven by disciplined cost management and a rising mix of premium and ad-tier subscribers.
Netflix’s pricing strategy remains a key profit driver, supported by recent subscription hikes in key markets like the United States and Canada, where plans range from $7.99 to $24.99 per month. Its ad-supported tier has also become a strong growth engine, now reaching 94 million monthly active users. Management expects ad revenues to double in 2025, driven by the rollout of the Netflix Ads Suite and integration with Yahoo DSP.
Netflix is expanding globally by adjusting prices for markets like India and using generative AI to create more personalized ads. It’s also adding new ad formats like interactive mid-rolls, pause ads and live events such as WWE Raw and NFL Christmas Day games to attract premium advertisers. New interactive ad options launching in late 2025 will further boost engagement and diversify revenues. Meanwhile, blockbuster titles like The Beast in Me (Nov. 13), Stranger Things (Nov. 26) and Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery (Dec. 12) are set to keep engagement high, reinforcing the strength behind its pricing and ad strategy.
Reflecting this momentum, Netflix raised its 2025 revenue forecast to $44.8-$45.2 billion, up 15-16% year over year, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate projects 16% growth in 2025 and 13% in 2026.
Netflix’s Ad & Pricing Battle: Key U.S. Players
Amazon AMZN is rapidly expanding its advertising dominance by integrating Prime Video, Twitch and its vast retail data into a unified ad ecosystem. With retail media revenues projected to surpass $60 billion in 2025, Amazon leverages e-commerce insights and Prime’s reach to offer powerful targeting and competitive pricing. Amazon's growing ad presence in streaming strengthens its edge over rivals, though balancing ad load and user experience remains crucial.
Warner Bros. Discovery WBD is strengthening its streaming edge through a dual monetization model, expanding its ad-supported Max tier while raising ad-free prices to boost profitability. WBD’s 125.7 million subscribers and $1.3 billion streaming profit goal for 2025 highlight strong momentum. Leveraging its vast IP library, WBD’s tiered pricing and Disney bundle strategy position it competitively against Netflix in ad growth and subscriber expansion."

The announcement comes just a week after OpenAI announced a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that will see the chipmaker provide OpenAI with up to 6 gigawatts of AI processors.
Broadcom stock jumped nearly 10% on the news.
OpenAI is the world's most valuable startup, surpassing Elon Musk's SpaceX at some $500 billion.
Under the terms of the Broadcom deal, OpenAI said it will design the accelerators and systems, and then develop and deploy them with Broadcom.
""Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential and deliver real benefits for people and businesses,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
""Developing our own accelerators adds to the broader ecosystem of partners all building the capacity required to push the frontier of AI to provide benefits to all humanity,"" he added.
The announcement is another sign that companies are increasingly seeking to develop their own custom silicon to reduce their reliance on both Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD's chips. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) already have their own custom AI chips, as does Microsoft (MSFT).
But that doesn't mean they'll abandon Nvidia or AMD anytime soon.
OpenAI recently signed a $100 billion deal with Nvidia that will see the ChatGPT developer deploy up to 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems.
OpenAI has been on a dealmaking spree, agreeing to terms with the likes of CoreWeave (CRWV) and launching its Project Stargate initiative with Oracle (ORCL).
But the deals have raised questions about how long OpenAI can continue to spend billions while failing to turn a profit.
The moves have also increased concerns about a continued circular AI trade and the potential for an AI bubble.
During a discussion at Italian Tech Week earlier this month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that we’re likely witnessing an AI bubble, but he added that some of those investments will eventually pay off.
""When people get very excited, as they are today, about artificial intelligence, for example ... every experiment gets funded, every company gets funded,"" Bezos said.

He's led Berkshire Hathaway as CEO for 60 years, to the ripe old age of 95, and turned the company into a $1 trillion conglomerate that has its fingers in everything from energy to insurance and finance.
His investing style is to find great companies and hold -- he once famously said ""our favorite holding period is forever."" Buffett believes in finding companies that have leading positions in their industries, with great management, revenue, and reliable income. When Berkshire Hathaway invests in a company, people take notice. And when it finally sells, it's a big deal on Wall Street.
Buffett has announced he's stepping down from Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, but his investing philosophy continues. In fact, you can duplicate his masterful style by choosing three outstanding stocks -- all from different sectors -- that are currently mainstays in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.
1. Tech stock: Amazon
Berkshire Hathaway doesn't invest in many tech stocks, but Buffett and Co. made an exception for Amazon (AMZN -0.54%). Buffett actually had a chance to invest in Amazon in its infancy, back when the company was an online bookstore, and turned it down.
But rarely is it too late to invest, and Berkshire Hathaway finally began buying Amazon stock in 2019. The conglomerate holds 10 million shares for a position valued at $2.22 billion.
Amazon, of course, has evolved to be much more than a bookstore. The company has a dominant e-commerce site, holding about 37% of the U.S. market. Amazon.com generated nearly $137 billion in revenue for the company in the second quarter, including its international sales.
But it's the Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment that's giving Amazon a lot of its juice lately. Companies are turning to cloud computing providers to provide the computing power they need to run their operations without building hugely expensive data centers -- and the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) makes services like AWS even more popular.
AWS has the leading market share in the cloud computing space, with a 30% market share, and the segment's net sales increased 17% on a year-over-year basis.
2. Bank stock: Bank of America
North Carolina-based Bank of America (BAC 4.66%) is Buffett's favorite bank stock. Berkshire Hathaway holds 605 million shares of BofA stock, which is a total position of $30.3 billion.
Buffett appreciates companies that have a wide competitive moat, and Bank of America fills that bill. The company ranked No. 1 in the use for the number of consumer deposits in the first quarter, and boasts 69 million consumer and small business clients. Bank of America reported $1.2 trillion in combined consumer and wealth management deposits, and is the second-largest bank in the U.S.
Revenue in the second quarter was $26.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Net income was $7.1 billion and $0.89 per share versus $6.9 billion and $0.83 per share a year ago.
I think Bank of America is a freight train waiting to roll. With interest rates beginning to fall, BofA should benefit from an increase in mortgage activity as the housing market begins to rebound. Bank of America stock is up 13% on a year-to-date basis, but I expect it and other bank stocks to show strength in the coming quarters.
3. Healthcare stock: UnitedHealth Group
UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.43%) is a new position for Berkshire Hathaway -- the company purchased its 5.04 million shares in the second quarter, taking a stake currently valued at $1.88 billion.
This is a classic Buffett play. UnitedHealth had an awful first half of the year as it misjudged medical costs and ended up saddled with Medicare Advantage plans that weren't nearly as profitable as expected. The company missed analysts' expectations in the first quarter, which is the first time that's happened since the 2008 financial crisis.
UnitedHealth's shares dropped 38% in the first half of the year. By buying the dip, Berkshire Hathaway is in a prime position to profit as UnitedHealth Group adjusts its pricing and returns to its winning ways. This healthcare stock has already started to rebound, but there's plenty of room to jump on the bandwagon.
The bottom line
Berkshire Hathaway invests in dozens of companies -- because, of course, Buffett understands the benefits of a well-balanced and deep portfolio. Bank of America, Amazon, and UnitedHealth are classic Buffett stocks that reflect his investing style. They are leaders in their industries, have dependable revenues, and long-term relevance.
These stocks offer a durable foundation for buy-and-hold investors who want to copy Buffett's style."

“We recap recent developments in the Brazilian e-commerce competitive environment, which reinforce our view that growth should come at a higher cost to MELI in the coming years,” JPMorgan analysts wrote.
Amid the competitive pressure, JPMorgan expects the company to deliver $7.44 in Q3 revenue, which would be 3% above consensus estimates. Nevertheless, it forecasts EBIT of $750 million, which would be below $811 consensus estimates. Earnings are also expected to average $477 million, compared to the previously expected $551 million.
MercadoLibre Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) is a Latin American technology company that provides e-commerce, fintech, and logistics solutions to individuals and businesses. It operates a large online marketplace for buying and selling goods. Its payment platform, Mercado Pago, enables various online and offline transactions and offers financial services.
While we acknowledge the potential of MELI as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Shares of Broadcom rose more than 12% in premarket trading.
The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts' worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam.
The agreement is the latest in a string of massive AI chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry's surging appetite for computing power as it races to build systems that meet or surpass human intelligence.
OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity.
""Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal.
CUSTOM CHIP BOOM
The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on Nvidia's costly processors that are limited in supply.
The approach is not a sure bet. Similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have run into delays or failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports, and analysts believe custom chips do not pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the short term.
The rise of custom chips has, however, turned Broadcom - long known for its networking hardware - into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022.
The company unveiled a blockbuster $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer that some analysts and market watchers speculated was OpenAI.
Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements."

You are definitely not alone. The stock has been on quite a ride, and if you are wondering whether now is the moment to buy more, hold tight, or even pare back your position, you are in good company. Over the past year, Amazon’s share price has jumped an impressive 15.4%, and that long-term momentum is even more eye-catching, up 90.1% over three years. But recently, the tides have shifted a bit, with the stock sliding -2.1% in the last week and -5.2% over the last month. It seems the market is recalibrating its view on Amazon’s risks and growth prospects.
Recent headlines offer a mixed flavor of optimism and caution. Amazon’s ambitious EUR 1B investment in Belgium hints at further international expansion and new partnerships, while turbulence in its drone delivery operations and some high-profile management changes inject a little uncertainty into the narrative. Yet through all of this, Amazon’s valuation fundamentals are hard to ignore. The company racks up a value score of 5 out of 6 based on key checks for undervaluation, a strong indicator that it may still be underappreciated by the market.
So how does Amazon stack up when you run the numbers? Up next, I will break down the six main valuation measures that analysts use, and later on, I will share an even more insightful way to look at what Amazon is really worth.
A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates a company’s value by projecting its future free cash flows and then discounting those amounts back to today, reflecting the time value of money. This method attempts to capture what Amazon.com is really worth based on its expected ability to generate cash in the years ahead.
For Amazon, the most recent twelve months saw free cash flow reach $37.6 Billion. Analysts forecast this figure to rise sharply, projecting free cash flow to climb as high as $134.6 Billion by 2029, with growth estimates showing significant jumps especially between 2026 and 2029. Beyond the next five years, projections rely on model extrapolation, but the broad trend remains upward. Amazon is expected to keep generating more cash at an impressive pace.
Based on these projections, the DCF model estimates Amazon’s intrinsic value at $271.62 per share. This figure is roughly 20.3% higher than the current trading price, indicating the stock appears undervalued from a cash flow perspective.
Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Amazon.com is undervalued by 20.3%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover more undervalued stocks.
Approach 2: Amazon.com Price vs Earnings
For profitable companies like Amazon.com, the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is a widely-used and practical valuation metric. The PE ratio tells you how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of the company’s earnings, helping you gauge both value and the market’s growth expectations. A higher growth outlook or lower risk profile can justify a richer, or higher, PE ratio, while slower growth or higher risks often mean investors are willing to pay less for each dollar of profit.
Amazon currently trades at a PE ratio of 32.7x. For context, the average PE among its peers is 43.1x and the broader Multiline Retail industry sports an average of 21.6x. This positions Amazon’s valuation above the industry average but below that of many of its direct competitors. The big question is whether this gap makes sense, given Amazon’s size, profitability, and growth trajectory.
This is where Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” comes in. It is a custom PE ratio that reflects what’s reasonable for Amazon right now, taking into account the company’s earnings growth, profit margins, industry trends, market capitalization, and risks. This makes it a more nuanced benchmark than simply comparing PE ratios across peers or the entire industry. For Amazon, the Fair Ratio is calculated at 38.8x, moderately higher than the current market PE.
Since Amazon’s actual PE ratio is 32.7x, and the Fair Ratio is 38.8x, the stock appears slightly undervalued based on this approach. The current market is not fully factoring in Amazon’s future growth and strengths, at least according to these comprehensive benchmarks.
Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Amazon.com Narrative
Earlier we mentioned there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. Narratives are a groundbreaking feature on Simply Wall St that empower you to articulate your story behind a stock, connecting your expectations for Amazon's future revenue, earnings, and margins directly to a fair value estimate, all grounded in numbers rather than gut feelings alone.
A Narrative is much more than just your opinion; it's a structured, customizable forecast that links the story you believe about Amazon to financial projections, and ultimately to a calculated fair value per share. This approach makes it simple for any investor to see how their unique outlook stacks up and is available directly in the Community page on Simply Wall St, where millions of investors share and compare their perspectives.
Narratives help you make informed buy or sell decisions by instantly highlighting when your established Fair Value differs from the current market Price, so you can act with conviction. As new headlines, earnings results, or market events emerge, your Narrative updates dynamically, giving you constant clarity on whether your story about Amazon still matches reality.
For example, some investors believe Amazon’s high-margin tech segments will propel rapid profit expansion, leading them to a Fair Value above $430. Others, more cautious about global headwinds and competition, set their Fair Value closer to $150. This illustrates how Narratives help bring your view and the market’s assumptions together in one place.
For Amazon.com, however, we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Amazon.com Narratives:
🐂 Amazon.com Bull Case
Fair Value: $222.55
Undervalued by: 2.8%
Forecast Revenue Growth Rate: 15.19%
Believes Amazon’s future growth is powered by AWS, Advertising, and its Third-Party Seller ecosystem, resulting in significant cash flow expansion.
Anticipates near-term cash flow will remain suppressed due to reinvestment, but long-term operating margins and profits are expected to rise with scale and optimization.
Highlights international expansion, operating leverage, and business optimization as primary drivers, with key risks including regulation and recession.
🐻 Amazon.com Bear Case
Fair Value: $151.21
Overvalued by: 43.1%
Forecast Revenue Growth Rate: 7.2%
Sees Amazon’s retail core as mature, with limited room for expansion and rising competitive pressures, particularly as traditional retailers adapt to online.
Notes that advertising and AWS will be Amazon’s key drivers, but advises caution due to slowing segment growth, high capital intensity, and margin pressures.
Points to key risks such as trade headwinds, share dilution, and the challenge of gaining traction with original content and international growth.

Bitcoin's run back toward record highs is forcing a question that would've sounded absurd a few years ago. Should cryptocurrency sit next to stocks and bonds in a retirement portfolio?
With Bitcoin now trading around $122,000, nearly double where it stood a year ago, the answer for many younger Americans is already yes. A NerdWallet survey issued in August found that one in ten U.S. adults with retirement accounts holds crypto.
And among Millennials, the figure jumps to 18%, making digital assets one of the fastest-growing categories inside tax-advantaged accounts.

The shift comes as traditional firms and policymakers open the door wider. Places like IRA Financial now let investors buy crypto directly through IRA accounts, and a recent executive order from President Donald Trump cleared the way for alternative assets like Bitcoin inside workplace retirement plans.
The enthusiasm isn't universal, though. Advisors are split between those who view crypto as speculative and those who see it as a legitimate hedge or growth driver. But the tone is changing.
""You have a lot of tremendously smart investors saying that Bitcoin is the best risk-reward investment right now,"" Joshua Brooks, CFP and founder of Exponential Advisors, told CNBC.
The generational divide helps explain why. Investors in their 20s and 30s, still decades from retirement, are more comfortable allocating a small slice of savings to high-volatility assets that could multiply over time. For them, crypto isn't replacing the 401(k); it's modernizing it.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-13T10:15:00,Prediction: Buying Upstart Stock Today Could Set You Up for Life,The stock's performance doesn't reflect the company's recent results and progress.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=fe2076ad353416469c1d80e21288d1421ec26d23d14fdf3f4dcec506334d3ca3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-buying-upstart-stock-today-could-set-yo/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-buying-upstart-stock-today-could-set-yo/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-buying-upstart-stock-today-could-set-yo/,fool.com,200,,"Anybody who buys a particular stock obviously does so with the expectation that it will gain in value. No level-headed investor genuinely expects a normal-sized trade to become life-changing, though.
Yet, there's no denying it happens. Amazon and Nvidia are a couple of names that come to mind.
Could an up-and-comer like Upstart (UPST 0.36%) be the next millionaire-making stock most don't see coming? Although most investors aren't convinced, a small handful are. Here's what they're seeing, along with what the rest of the crowd is missing.
What's Upstart?
Upstart is a new kind of credit-reporting bureau akin to Equifax (EFX 0.67%), TransUnion (TRU 0.27%), and Experian (EXPG.Y 0.05%), although it also plays a credit-scoring role like Fair Isaac's (FICO -0.17%) FICO model.
Even with all the ways it's like the industry's legacy services, however, it's also distinctly different from these established names...and it's better. Its technology is easier for would-be lenders to use than traditional ways of retrieving a credit score. It also provides lenders with a more accurate assessment of someone's creditworthiness.
The key is the underlying platform itself.
One of Upstart's co-founders -- computer science and economics student Paul Gu -- did something that no one else had even attempted it before, or tried to imitate in the meantime. He developed an artificial intelligence algorithm that incorporates all the relevant information regarding a would-be borrower to paint a better picture of an individual's creditworthiness.
Upstart's platform looks at more than 2,500 unique variables as part of its credit-scoring process. Some of them are obvious ones, like income, employment, and someone's repayment history. Many of its other data points aren't ones on Fair Isaac's radar, even though they arguably should be.
More important to lenders, borrowers, and even interested investors, the approach is proving to be a better one for every party involved. Its solution allows for 43% more approvals without any additional defaults compared to the more traditional approach of determining an individual's credit score. More than nine out of 10 of its loan approvals are automated, and therefore completed in a matter of seconds. Lenders just need access to the company's application programming interface, or API, which links their systems to Upstart's.
At the tipping point
The technology works. But that doesn't mean Upstart's growth has been easy or consistent since its debut in 2012.
Like any start-up launching into a long-established industry dominated by a handful of powerful incumbents, this start-up has struggled at times. The mainstreaming (and then explosion) of artificial intelligence since ChatGPT's launch in late 2022, however, appears to have been the proverbial tipping point for this outfit. There are now more than 100 banks using Upstart's technology, up from fewer than 60 as of early 2022 and fewer than 20 at the beginning of 2021.
That's the chief reason its revenue has not only grown every quarter since the third quarter of last year, but is now accelerating. So too is the company's bottom line. Upstart swung to a profit in this year's Q2 and analysts expect earnings to continue rising. This year's full-year per-share estimated profit of $1.65 per share is projected to rise to $2.49 next year.
But that's still only a drop in the bucket. The 697,092 loans that Upstart's platform originated last year -- worth a total of $5.9 billion -- are a mere fraction of the total U.S. loan market. Numbers from the Federal Reserve indicate that U.S. consumers took out $131 billion in new mortgage loans just in Q2 of this year alone. They also collectively borrowed $13 billion to purchase vehicles, and took out $9 billion in home equity loans.
Although only the latter two loan types are currently facilitated by Upstart, that's still an enormous opportunity. Indeed, Mordor Intelligence believes the U.S. digital lending business is set to grow at an annualized pace of more than 13% through 2030, now that using artificial intelligence to quickly facilitate loans is an option. Furthermore, this growth could persist well beyond that point in time.
Upstart is well-positioned to capture at least its fair share of this growth, and realistically speaking, capture more than its fair share of it.
Only if you can make a long-term commitment
So, yes, buying Upstart stock today could help set you up for life, particularly given its lethargic performance since late last year, which doesn't reflect its long-term growth potential. Most investors seem concerned about the prospect of economic weakness, and fear the effect it could have on the company's lending and credit-scoring business.
Upstart's business continues to climb that wall of worry. This year's swing to profitability is being fueled by top-line growth that is forecast to roll in at 66% more than last year's, to be followed by next year's 27% growth. Lenders and borrowers continue to fall in love with just how well Upstart's solution works.
This might help seal the deal: Although most investors aren't very bullish right now, the analyst community covering the company mostly is. Their one-year average price target of $77.57 is almost 60% higher than the stock's recent price of $48.58. That's not a bad way to start out a new trade, even if you should only consider a stake in this company if you're truly committed to making it a long-term holding. There's likely to be a lot of volatility along the way."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-13T08:44:00,Billionaire Bill Ackman Has $1.3 Billion Invested in This AI Stock -- and Wall Street Says Buy It Hand Over Fist,Ackman loves Amazon. So do Wall Street analysts.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eed847c015055a74c7f2dd8aa3bcf33c60917bf9759624490dcf54ed0a855970,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/billionaire-bill-ackman-has-13-billion-invested-in/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/billionaire-bill-ackman-has-13-billion-invested-in/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/billionaire-bill-ackman-has-13-billion-invested-in/,fool.com,200,,"Bill Ackman's net worth totals roughly $9.3 billion. Unlike some billionaires, he didn't inherit his fortune. Instead, Ackman made his money by being one of the most successful investors around. His Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund has over $19 billion in assets under management.
As of June 30, 2025, Pershing Square's portfolio owned only 11 stocks. Ackman had $1.3 billion invested in one artificial intelligence (AI) stock that Wall Street thinks investors should buy hand over fist.
Ackman's AI addition
Pershing Square already owned three AI stocks before the second quarter of 2025. Uber Technologies (UBER -0.16%) remains the biggest holding, making up a little over 20% of the portfolio. The hedge fund also owns both share classes of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 2.06%) (GOOGL 2.09%).
Ackman added another AI stock to the list in Q2. He initiated a new stake in Amazon (AMZN -0.54%), buying around 5.82 million shares. This position was valued at roughly $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter.
Why did Ackman load up on Amazon? It's a company his team has ""long studied and admired,"" according to Pershing Square's latest interim report. Amazon's AI opportunities played a significant role in the billionaire's decision to buy the stock after a lengthy period of watching from the sidelines.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is well-positioned to benefit from the shift in IT spending to the cloud. AI is a major driver of this trend. Pershing Square's interim report stated, ""Over time, we expect AI to spur greater cloud adoption."" Ackman and his team believe that AI could ""potentially even accelerate"" revenue growth for AWS.
A Wall Street favorite
Wall Street really likes Amazon, too. S&P Global (SPGI -0.47%) surveyed 68 analysts in October who covered the stock. Fourteen of those analysts (20.5%) rated Amazon as a ""strong buy."" A whopping 51 analysts (75%) rated it as a ""buy."" That leaves only three outliers, all of whom recommended holding the stock.
This overwhelming analyst support for Amazon shows up in another way. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of 17%. The most bullish analyst thinks that Amazon's shares could soar roughly 35% over the next year.
Analysts see the same things that Ackman does. They recognize the huge AI tailwind that exists for hyperscalers. They know that AWS holds the largest market share in cloud services.
But AWS isn't the only way that Amazon is benefiting from AI. For example, the company recently deployed its one millionth robot. It also launched a new generative AI foundation model called DeepFleet that coordinates robots across its fulfillment network. This new AI platform should improve the travel time of Amazon's robots by 10% and help the company deliver packages to customers more quickly and cost-effectively.
Are Ackman and analysts right about Amazon?
Ackman loves Amazon. Analysts love Amazon. Are they right about the stock? I think so.
AWS does have a tremendous growth opportunity, thanks in large part to surging AI adoption. I believe we have yet to see the most impressive advances in AI. The use of AI agents remains in its early innings but could take off in a major way over the next couple of years. Breakthroughs in artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be a real possibility this decade.
Amazon's e-commerce business should also continue to deliver exceptional growth. As Pershing Square's interim report noted, e-commerce sales penetration in the U.S. has roughly doubled over the last 10 years. However, it still makes up less than 20% of total retail sales. Amazon's brand, fast delivery, low prices, and operational scale should enable the company to be the biggest beneficiary as e-commerce wins a larger percentage of the total retail market.
When a super-successful billionaire hedge fund manager and over 95% of Wall Street analysts are bullish about a stock, one would think that stock would be a good pick. In Amazon's case, I'd agree."

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-13T07:12:00,Prediction: Here's What's Next for High-Flying Oklo Stock in 2026,Nuclear energy has become an adjacent opportunity alongside the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=96aae1e95a98d83511119db92b7f4bc928646ad254a8eb91076e3fbc7027fce3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-heres-whats-next-for-high-flying-oklo-s/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-heres-whats-next-for-high-flying-oklo-s/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-heres-whats-next-for-high-flying-oklo-s/,fool.com,200,,"When it comes to clear beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, investors don't need to look much further than megacap technology giants.
Chip leaders like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are building the hardware backbones powering generative AI, while cloud titans such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon race to expand data centers and roll out new services at unprecedented speed.
One of the more surprising winners throughout the AI boom has been a nuclear energy company called Oklo (OKLO -0.38%). As of this writing (Oct. 6), shares have surged an astonishing 1,130% over the past year. My prediction for 2026? Oklo stock could climb even higher.
The question is -- does that make it a smart buy right now?
Oklo's momentum looks strong, but there's a catch
Oklo's mission is straightforward: to design and build small modular reactors (SMRs) capable of powering data centers and remote industrial sites. This concept has captured the imaginations of investors as AI's rapid expansion collides with soaring electricity demand -- a market that Wall Street estimates could be worth as much as $10 trillion.
Yet for all the excitement surrounding Oklo, the company still lacks two critical ingredients: revenue and profits.
Heading into 2026, my prediction is that Oklo's story will revolve more around partnerships than profits. The company will likely announce new collaborations with government agencies and private enterprises -- perhaps with data center operators or hyperscalers seeking to diversify their power sources.
These announcements will make headlines and stoke media enthusiasm, but investors should remain cautious. Oklo remains years away from true commercialization, and until the company deploys and operates a working reactor at scale, such deals are more symbolic than financially meaningful. In other words, they offer optionality but not cash flow.
Dilution risk looms as Oklo's valuation defies gravity
Oklo's meteoric rise has been fueled more by narrative momentum than by underlying business fundamentals. The company went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2024, and since then, its valuation has swelled to levels that would make even the most optimistic investors raise an eyebrow. At its current market capitalization of $20 billion, Oklo is priced like a mature energy company despite not generating a single dollar of revenue.
This disconnect could soon force management to raise more capital through a secondary stock offering. Building nuclear reactors is extraordinarily capital-intensive, and regulatory approvals can take years to secure. While Oklo has garnered early support from the Department of Energy, it will almost certainly need additional funding to sustain operations through the rest of the decade.
Issuing new shares while the stock remains inflated would be a logical move -- but it comes with an obvious trade-off: dilution. This is a familiar outcome for early-stage companies and one that bullish investors should be prepared to accept.
Oklo looks more like a meme stock than a long-term investment
Online forums have latched onto Oklo as the next frontier of nuclear innovation -- a bet that, in theory, could revolutionize the energy landscape. In practice, however, Oklo has yet to deliver a prototype that produces compelling unit economics.
Against this backdrop, the company is behaving less like a traditional investment and more like a meme stock. Much like the dot-com era -- when valuations were driven by engagement metrics such as clicks and page views -- Oklo's market value appears tethered to speculative optimism rather than measurable results.
For investors, that distinction is critical. Owning Oklo today isn't an investment in a proven enterprise; it's a wager on a narrative. This kind of profile rarely offers the durable financial foundation that institutional investors seek. Instead, Oklo has become a day-trader's playground -- propelled by retail hype rather than fundamentals.
Savvy investors should resist the fear of missing out (FOMO) and remember that hype cycles eventually correct. When the dust settles, Oklo could indeed become a key player in the future of nuclear energy -- but only after its technology and financials mature. Until then, the company remains one of the market's flashiest yet most fragile stories. If shares continue rising throughout 2026, I'd view it as an opportunity to sell on momentum."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-13T07:11:00,Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock That One Wall Street Analyst Thinks Is Poised to Hit $20 Trillion by 2030,"Despite the stock's rapid rise, one Wall Street analyst sees significant upside ahead for Nvidia investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=07b9dd81c680e4217c0100151397b5512fb0f8e6858e08f8758e5697464c3e16,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/meet-the-supercharged-growth-stock-one-wall-street/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/meet-the-supercharged-growth-stock-one-wall-street/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/meet-the-supercharged-growth-stock-one-wall-street/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia's (NVDA 0.06%) transformation over the past few years ranks among the most extraordinary business stories in modern capitalism. What began as a niche designer of graphics chips for gamers has evolved into the central nervous system of the artificial intelligence (AI) economy.
Today, hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, and Meta Platforms rely on Nvidia's hardware and software stack to train and deploy their AI models. Unprecedented demand has fueled staggering financial growth, propelling Nvidia's market value nearly 16x during the AI revolution. At a market cap of roughly $4.5 trillion, Nvidia now wears the crown of the world's most valuable company.
This raises the question: Is there any upside left, or have investors who don't already own shares missed the boat?
The answer according to Wall Street analyst Phil Panaro at The Boston Consulting Group may surprise you. Panaro projects that Nvidia could reach a $20 trillion valuation within the next five years -- representing a gain of more than 340% from current levels. While this target may sound ambitious, his thesis is built on three converging forces shaping the next decade of AI.
Let's unpack the key drivers behind Panaro's bold prediction and explore why Nvidia's long-term story remains one of the most compelling in the entire market.
The AI boom has only just begun
The first pillar of Panaro's thesis is that the current AI boom is still in the early innings of a decades-long transformation. He estimates that global AI adoption remains below 1% today, meaning that most industries have only begun to explore the potential of intelligent automation. As AI becomes embedded across healthcare, financial services, logistics, retail, and manufacturing, the demand for accelerated computing should expand exponentially.
Nvidia is uniquely positioned to capture these tailwinds. On the hardware front, its chips remain the gold standard for training and inferencing large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems. Equally important, Nvidia's CUDA software platform forms the base layer of its ecosystem, enabling developers to build AI applications at scale.
This deep integration has created enormous switching costs, meaning that once a company's AI infrastructure is built on Nvidia's backbone, migrating to another platform becomes complex and financially prohibitive.
This combination of superior product performance and ecosystem lock-in gives Nvidia exceptional pricing power. In effect, the company is no longer just a chip designer. It has assumed the role of a toll collector in the AI era, charging admission to every breakthrough that relies on its compute stack.
Web3 and the next frontier of compute demand
The second pillar of Panaro's argument centers on the rise of Web3 and decentralized applications. Blockchain validation, metaverse rendering, and on-chain governance are all emerging systems that require computationally intensive processing power -- precisely the kind of workload Nvidia's GPUs are designed to handle.
Nvidia's opportunity in this realm is twofold.
First, the company's hardware will likely remain a core foundation for next-generation decentralized networks -- providing the horsepower to process blockchain transactions and train autonomous systems at global scale.
Second, Nvidia's software capabilities -- particularly in simulation and digital twin technologies -- could prove to be essential tools for building virtual worlds, industrial replicas, and real-time digital economies that mirror the physical world.
As Web3 evolves, Nvidia remains positioned to supply both the silicon and the advanced software required to power the next frontier of the internet.
Governments will be the next wave of AI customers
The third pillar of Panaro's forecast highlights an often-overlooked source of demand: the public sector. While private businesses have raced to procure GPUs and expand their data center footprints, government agencies around the world are only beginning to invest in digital transformation.
Federal and state governments could use AI to optimize logistics, detect fraud, forecast infrastructure needs, and manage power grids with greater efficiency. Meanwhile, defense agencies could leverage AI for training simulations, satellite imagery analysis, and developing advanced cybersecurity protocols.
The underlying investment theme here is quite powerful: Government contracts tend to be long-term and capital-intensive. Initiatives like Project Stargate underscore this trend -- large-scale, multiyear buildouts designed to make AI infrastructure a national security asset.
Ambition vs. reality
Whether Nvidia will reach a $20 trillion valuation by 2030 remains open to debate. In my view, Panaro's target should be interpreted less as a precise forecast and more as a statement of potential.
Nvidia has built one of the most durable and profitable business models of the modern era, one that bridges hardware, software, and connected ecosystems.
And regardless of whether Nvidia reaches the $20 trillion milestone, I agree that its story appears to be in its early chapters. For this reason, I see Nvidia as a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon."

Blow-out quarterly earnings estimates from American software and cloud services specialist Oracle, a $100bn (£75bn) investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI by silicon chip designer Nvidia and, in reverse, the purchase of a 10pc stake by OpenAI in another semiconductor maker, AMD, are all keeping the artificial intelligence (AI) pot boiling, so far as stock markets are concerned.
The magnificent seven of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla now have an aggregate stock market capitalisation of $21tn – or 36pc of the S&P 500 index’s total value. Their spending on AI and their share prices are firing US economic growth, which continues to shrug off tariff turmoil, corporate earnings – and thus, the US stock market.
In theory, where the US goes, the rest are sure to follow. America is the world’s largest economy and home to its biggest stock market, biggest bond market and its reserve currency the dollar, all of which count for rather a lot. Many headline stock indices are cruising to new highs, including our very own FTSE 100.
Yet someone is worried. The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), released last Wednesday, offer warnings of increased risks of a sharp pullback in global share prices. The question now, as one email sent to this column immediately reflected, is whether this is a timely alert or a repeat of Alan Greenspan’s “irrational exuberance” speech of 1996. The then-Federal Reserve chair cautioned about the dangers of a galloping stock market, only for share prices to continue rising, not peaking until 39 months later.
Uncanny echoes
The FPC’s frets about the sky-high valuations of anything AI carry uncomfortable echoes of the technology, media and telecoms (TMT) – or dotcom – bubble that inflated over the 1990s, popped in 2000 and bottomed in 2002. It then took America’s technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index, the poster child for the bubble, until April 2015 to return to its March 2000 high, teaching investors a painful lesson of the perils of choosing narrative over valuation.
Greenspan had, in the eyes of some, tried to calm animal spirits before the bubble even got going – and with good reason. Just eight months after the Fed chair spoke, trouble blew in from an unexpected quarter when Thailand devalued the baht. Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia quickly followed with the rupiah, won and ringgit, and the Asian debt crisis began to roil markets."

The legendary investor was a rock star at Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford for more than 40 years. He was in charge of the premier Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust for over two decades, generating returns of more than 1,700% during his term.
Anderson secured his legacy early on, recognizing the dramatic growth potential of then early stage companies, including Netflix, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia (NVDA 0.06%), delivering considerable profits for investors along the way. Given his track record, when Anderson talks, investors should listen.
Most experts agree that the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is still in its early stages, and if the trend continues, Nvidia's market cap could surge to as much as $50 trillion by 2035, according to Anderson. While that might seem improbable on its face, Anderson's reasoning is worth a look.
Dominating the space
The dawn of generative AI in early 2023 created a windfall for Nvidia. The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that quickly became the gold standard for AI. Nvidia rode the unprecedented demand for its chips to become the world's largest publicly traded company, valued at $4.58 trillion (as of this writing).
After two successive years of triple-digit year-over-year sales growth, Nvidia's results have begun to moderate but are still enviable by any standard. In its fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 27), Nvidia generated revenue that grew 56% year over year to a record $46.7 billion, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08 jumped 61%.
Yet this could be just the beginning. The AI market is projected to be worth as much as $15.7 trillion by 2030, according to data compiled by ""Big Four"" accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The report suggests ""AI is still at a very early stage."" If Nvidia earns just a small slice of that total opportunity, sales and profits could continue to surge, resulting in a windfall for the chipmaker and its shareholders.
Anderson estimates the data center market, where most AI processing is conducted, is poised to grow 60% annually. If Nvidia's profit margin holds steady and the adoption of AI continues at its current pace over the next 10 years, Anderson estimates that Nvidia would deliver EPS of $1,350 and free cash flow of $1,000 per share. That would drive the stock price to about $20,000, pushing its market cap to roughly $49 trillion.
Despite increasing competition, Nvidia currently dominates the data center GPU space, commanding 92% of the market, according to IoT Analytics. Anderson points out that the company's ""persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.""
The fine print
Make no mistake, plenty of things will have to go right for Nvidia to reach this astonishing benchmark, and there will be a lot of obstacles along the way. Demand for AI could falter, a rival chipmaker could ""invent a better mousetrap,"" so to speak, or the economy could go south -- and these are just a few examples of the challenges that could arise.
Even Anderson admits that this ""isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact."" When asked about the potential for the stock to reach these meteoric heights, Anderson puts the odds at between 10% and 15%.
However, investors shouldn't miss the forest for the trees. ""It is the long duration of the development of [GPU] usage in AI -- and not just AI -- from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,"" Anderson said.
There's also the matter of Nvidia's valuation. The stock has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 54, compared to a multiple of 31 for the S&P 500. However, at less than 30 times next year's expected earnings, I'd submit it's an attractive price to pay, particularly given the magnitude of the opportunity.
Even if Nvidia doesn't hit a $50 trillion market cap over the next 10 years, all the available evidence suggests Anderson's thesis is directionally accurate. Furthermore, CEO Jensen Huang has proven particularly adept at identifying opportunities before they materialize and positioning Nvidia for future success. Given his track record, I wouldn't bet against him.
That's why I believe Nvidia stock is still a buy."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-12T17:20:00,3 Reasons Investors Are Excited About Coupang Stock,Coupang is expanding from fast-growing e-commerce upstart to one of Asia's most important internet companies.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=fc329e4813ce847420a88551f0ab9e6b226f9d75f550f01f86bec636c0a3eb91,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/3-reasons-investors-are-excited-about-coupang-stoc/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/3-reasons-investors-are-excited-about-coupang-stoc/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/3-reasons-investors-are-excited-about-coupang-stoc/,fool.com,200,,"When investors think of Asian e-commerce, Coupang (CPNG -0.22%) often draws the ""Amazon of South Korea"" comparison. This label captures part of the story but not the whole picture.
Coupang is headquartered in Seattle and describes itself as a technology company. While it's best known for its retail dominance and hallmark Rocket Delivery service, it has also expanded into fintech, food delivery, streaming, and advertising. Still, e-commerce remains the foundation of its business -- and that's where most of its growth and profits are generated today.
The company has given shareholders plenty of reasons to be optimistic -- here are three of the biggest reasons investors are bullish on Coupang stock.
1.Coupang dominates South Korea's retail market
South Korea is one of the most attractive e-commerce markets in the world, thanks to its internet penetration rate of over 97% and a highly concentrated population around the capital city of Seoul. Against this backdrop, Coupang has emerged as the undisputed leader in this market with approximately 24 million active customers -- roughly 46% of South Korea's entire population.
The company's edge lies in logistics. Coupang has spent years building a dense fulfillment and delivery network, strategically placing warehouses so that 70% of South Koreans live within a seven-mile radius of a logistics center. This extensive logistics footprint allows its Rocket Delivery service to consistently meet its promise of ""dawn delivery"" and same-day fulfillment. Note that Coupang reported the 70% figure in its 2021 IPO filing, so the actual number today is likely to be even higher than that.
This network doesn't just offer customers unmatched convenience and service -- it's a moat for the business. Once customers grow accustomed to reliable, rapid delivery, switching to rivals like Naver becomes far less appealing. That customer loyalty bears out in Coupang's revenue per active customer, which increased from $1,196 in 2023 to $1,207 in 2024, reflecting a steady upward trend that suggests customers are spending more with the company over time.
2.Profitability is improving -- and fast
For years, Coupang was criticized for operating losses as it invested heavily in the business. But that narrative is shifting. In Q2 2025, Coupang reported $8.5 billion in revenue, a 16% year-over-year increase, with gross profit rising even faster at 20%. Net income hit $31 million, reversing a loss from the year-ago period. It has also been profitable for the last four consecutive quarters, suggesting this trend is sustainable.
That kind of momentum matters. It shows that Coupang is beginning to flex its scale -- higher volumes are driving operating leverage, while investments in automation and AI also contributed to better efficiency. Unlike growth companies that fail to exit the cash-burning phase, Coupang now has the flexibility to self-fund its international expansion and new initiatives.
The trajectory looks similar to Amazon's early era -- years of losses followed by margin expansion. Investors who once worried about red ink now see a business with strengthening financial discipline.
3. New markets and verticals expand Coupang's runway
While South Korea remains its foundation, Coupang isn't standing still. After entering the Taiwanese market just a few years ago, the company has already built an impressive growth machine.
In Q2 2025, revenue growth in Taiwan was in the triple-digits, and Coupang expects that rate to improve further in the third quarter. It is using the same playbook it refined at home: aggressive investment in logistics and customer experience to win loyalty.
While international expansion is costly, it's also necessary if Coupang wants to break the mold of a ""single-market story."" Success in Taiwan could serve as proof of concept for the company's broader expansion across Asia.
Beyond geography, Coupang is also expanding into new verticals like Coupang Eats (food delivery), fintech, and video streaming. These efforts remain small compared to its core commerce business, but they represent important optionality. If even one of these bets scales meaningfully, it could add another growth engine.
What it means for investors
Coupang is no longer just a fast-growing but unprofitable e-commerce upstart. It has matured into a diversified technology company with a dominant retail business in its home market, improving profitability, and bold ambitions in both international and adjacent markets.
For long-term investors, the central question is whether Coupang can replicate its success outside of South Korea and turn new verticals into meaningful opportunities. If it can do so, Coupang will cement itself as one of Asia's most important internet companies.
All said, investors should keep Coupang on their radar."

James, a business owner with an annual income of about $120,000, told host Dave Ramsey how he lost between $45,000 and $55,000 in just six weeks to a sudden gambling habit after moving to Atlantic City.
He explained that the addiction started small, with $25 bets while socializing with new friends. As his friends increased their bets, it pushed James to higher-stakes gambling.

James' habit quickly escalated as he started going alone, with his nightly losses ballooning from $100 to between $2,000 and $5,000.
""I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't do anything at all. I live a fully sober life,"" James told Ramsey.
The sudden, intense addiction left James feeling out of control. He described a ""blackout"" phenomenon when inside the casinos, where he feels like he's not himself until he leaves and the reality of his actions sets in.
Ramsey, who said he has worked with countless addicts facing financial ruin, offered James a three-pronged action plan:
-
Seek immediate help by contacting Gamblers Anonymous to begin a 12-step program.
-
Find a one-on-one therapist or counselor to process the crisis and understand the cognitive basis of his addiction.
-
Connect with a local church to build a healthy support network and spritual foundation, intentionally making new friends who do not frequent casinos.
""100% of addicts eventually have financial troubles,"" Ramsey told James.

Ramsey's co-host, financial expert George Kamel, said James should implement financial guardrails such as limits on his bank accounts or enlisting a friend to hold him financially accountable and add more friction to the destructive impulse.
Ramsey said that if these steps fail, James should consider moving away from Atlantic City to a location without easy access to casinos, noting that removing the temptation may be necessary for healing.

This includes Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, which are together known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" There are others now part of the trillion-dollar club, but these are among the more notable names.
The list may get even bigger in the years ahead, as many businesses are growing and benefiting from feverish spending on artificial intelligence (AI). There's one unstoppable company that's doing well due to that trend, and which looks set to join the club in the near future: Oracle (ORCL 1.66%). Here's why it may not be too late to invest in this promising tech stock.
Oracle has become a key player in the AI boom
For years, Oracle has been known as a big name in databases and providing companies with the critical backend services and infrastructure they need to manage all their data. It still serves that purpose today, plus it also offers key products and services, which help its customers manage AI workloads.
Its new Oracle AI World, for instance, will allow its customers to use large language models to analyze existing databases. The big advantage with Oracle is that unlike many big tech companies, it's agnostic to the whole chatbot market; it isn't developing one of its own, and it's there to simply provide customers with the AI-powered products and services they need. It also has AI agents that can help to automate tasks and add efficiency.
And its efforts have been paying off. Last month, the company reported its latest quarterly results (for the period ending Aug. 31) and demand remains robust, with CEO Safra Catz noting that it ""signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1."" It expects even more large contracts to be signed in the future. And its contract backlog has skyrocketed by 359% year over year, totaling $455 billion.
Oracle's quarterly revenue totaled $14.9 billion and rose 12% year over year. Its cloud segment led the way, as sales in that business unit came in at $7.2 billion and were up by 28%.
The company also generates terrific profit margins, as its net income during the period was $2.9 billion, which is comparable to what it generated in the prior-year period. The bottom line would have been larger, however, if not for an increase in restructuring expenses, as the company has been reducing its workforce in an effort to improve efficiency.
Why a $1 trillion valuation may be just an inevitability at this point
Oracle's market cap as of the end of Monday was around $820 billion. For it to hit a $1 trillion valuation, it would need to rise by another 22% from that. In just the past year, its shares have soared more than 70%. And with tech companies continuing to invest heavily into AI, Oracle looks poised to benefit from those growth opportunities.
It may not happen soon, and it could take a couple of years, as the stock has already risen so fast. It's currently trading around its all-time highs, and its price-to-earnings multiple of 66 doesn't look cheap at all. As a result, growth investors may be thinking twice about the stock, and that could lead to limited gains, at least in the short term.
But with so much growth still out there, it may truly be an inevitability before Oracle reaches $1 trillion. According to analysts from the MarketsandMarkets, the global cloud AI market is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.4% until 2029. It's a staggering level of growth, with Oracle right in the middle of it all.
Oracle's still a good buy today
Although you may be tempted to pass on Oracle's stock because its valuation is a bit rich, over the long term, there's still much more runway for it to become more valuable. The important role it plays in tech makes it a solid investment, particularly due to its close relationship with other tech giants.
Oracle's solid fundamentals and AI-powered growth makes it a great investment to add to your portfolio today, especially if you're looking for an AI stock that still has a lot of upside left."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-12T10:00:00,3 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,Computing capacity will be a huge growth driver over the next decade.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dc45c50a5913d27f95c4fe9e016b8999341e9ce2280866df14aca43f823d776a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/tech-stocks-buy-and-hold-next-decade-nvda-tsm/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/tech-stocks-buy-and-hold-next-decade-nvda-tsm/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/tech-stocks-buy-and-hold-next-decade-nvda-tsm/,fool.com,200,,"Finding stocks that you can buy and hold over the next decade isn't easy. If you rewind to 2015, some events like the COVID-19 pandemic or the exponential rise of artificial intelligence would have seemed very unlikely, but thinking about such potentials is what it takes to invest a decade in advance.
Right now, for instance, I think there are at least three companies that have obvious tailwinds blowing in their favor that should make them excellent long-term investments. Even better, now looks like a great time to buy shares in these three companies.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.00%) tops this list as the best company to buy and hold over the next decade. The thesis here is simple: The world is going to need more-advanced chips in greater quantities. While AI is the largest demand driver for chip capacity right now, there are other technologies, like self-driving vehicles, that will require a vast amount of chips as well.
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) is by far the world's largest chip foundry and will be instrumental in all of the various technologies that emerge over the next decade. The company itself is also pursuing new advanced chip technology, mainly focusing on making more energy-efficient chips to ease the power demand on the grid.
One thing to note with TSMC is that the chip industry is cyclical. Over the next decade, there will likely be at least one downturn that causes the stock to sink. However, the overall trend is to use more-advanced chips in greater quantities, and this stock will be one of the best to own as a result.
Amazon
Amazon (AMZN -0.60%) is another stock that I'm excited about when looking out over the next decade. The e-commerce build-out in North America is nearing completion, but there are other parts of the world for Amazon to conquer. Furthermore, it's building a digital advertising empire within its platform that is boosting margins significantly.
Another area where it is seeing strong growth with healthy margins is cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the biggest cloud provider, and this industry is seeing tailwinds from the general move to the cloud as well as AI workloads. Once the company is done building computing capacity for AI workloads, this business will transform back into a cash cow, driving the stock price higher.
Advertising and cloud computing have much higher margins than an e-commerce business, which is why Amazon's operating margins have jumped over the past few years. Investors may see a slight pause in operating margin expansion during the AI computing build-out, but they will also see a resulting rapid spike when it's complete.
This trend will help boost Amazon's profits over the long term, making it an excellent stock to buy and hold over the next decade.
Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA 0.12%) may be a surprise addition to this list, but I think it's worth owning over the next 10 years. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are by far the most popular chips to power AI workloads.
The demand for advanced chips is rapidly rising, and management expects data center capital expenditures (capex) to increase from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's huge growth, but what happens when it's over?
GPUs don't last forever. Estimates vary widely, with normal usage lasting for three to eight years. But the high processing demand that comes with AI points toward these GPUs burning out within one to three years. So all of this huge AI demand that Nvidia is enjoying right now will be sustained in the future, as companies building these giant AI data centers will need to replace GPUs as they wear out.
This will allow Nvidia to sustain its sales for years to come. If the general direction in AI capex is correct, the company's run could just be getting started, making it a no-brainer stock to buy now and hold over the next decade."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-12T09:15:00,What Amazon Could Look Like in 5 Years' Time,"Amazon's retail story may be maturing, but its AI and advertising engines are just getting started -- and they could redefine what powers this trillion-dollar giant over the next five years.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7919903140851d33220626bd23011299232552128da61bdf15028abade430386,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/what-amazon-could-look-like-in-5-years-time/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/what-amazon-could-look-like-in-5-years-time/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/what-amazon-could-look-like-in-5-years-time/,fool.com,200,,"Amazon (AMZN -0.54%) has come a long way from being ""the everything store."" Today, it's a sprawling ecosystem of commerce, cloud computing, entertainment, and -- increasingly -- artificial intelligence (AI). But Amazon five years from now could look very different from the company we know today.
While retail still defines Amazon's public image, its future is likely to be powered by three engines: cloud, advertising, and AI. Together, they're quietly reshaping the company's economic model -- and its competitive edge.
AWS is evolving into an AI powerhouse
For nearly two decades, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been the company's profit engine. But in the next five years, its role could become even more strategic.
AWS isn't just selling cloud storage anymore. It's becoming an AI infrastructure layer for enterprises -- offering chips like Trainium and Inferentia, as well as services like Bedrock that enable developers to build generative AI applications using Amazon's in-house models or others, such as Anthropic's Claude.
This shift is crucial. While Microsoft and Google grabbed headlines with their AI tools (thanks to their consumer-facing services), AWS has taken a quieter but equally valuable path -- embedding AI into how companies run their data, software, and operations.
This approach is a smart move, as the company is already a cloud storage supplier to many leading companies. Extending the AI tools to them is a natural step that helps grow revenue and improve customer stickiness. Moreover, many of its customers are working diligently to develop next-generation AI applications for consumers, so these future winners will naturally rely on AWS to power their computing and storage needs.
In other words, Amazon doesn't need to win the consumer AI race -- it just needs to power it.
Advertising is going to be a gigantic business
Five years ago, few would have predicted that Amazon Ads would surpass $50 billion in annual revenue. But that's precisely what happened -- and it still grew more than 20% year over year in the latest quarter.
The reason is simple: Amazon owns intent. When customers search on Amazon, they're ready to make a purchase, providing advertisers with direct access to high-conversion audiences. Now, Amazon is taking the next step by bundling its ad technology across Prime Video, Fire TV, and commerce -- giving marketers reach across e-commerce, streaming, and connected TV.
In this new model, Prime Video is no longer just a subscriber perk. It's an engine for ad growth and engagement -- a way for Amazon to turn entertainment into a monetization opportunity. As connected TV ad spending accelerates, Amazon's first-party data could make it one of the most powerful players in the streaming ad market.
And that's just Amazon's own ecosystem. The tech giant is now scaling its demand-side platform offerings through partnerships with companies like Netflix and Roku, giving it additional leverage to capture an even larger share of the global digital advertising market.
If AWS is the obvious growth engine thanks to AI, then Amazon Ads will be the rising star propelling the giant's next phase of growth.
Retail will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate
Amazon's core e-commerce business in the U.S. isn't growing as fast as it used to, thanks to its already massive size, as well as competition from the likes of Walmart and newcomers like Temu and Shein. International markets, such as India, will continue to grow; however, margins are likely to remain thin in these markets as Amazon expands its market share.
But even if the growth rate is slowing, the e-commerce business still has massive moats. For instance, Amazon's gigantic logistics network will continue to improve in effectiveness and efficiency, which could contribute to improved margins. Prime membership will also remain a significant differentiator in maintaining strong customer relationships.
And if Amazon can blend AI-driven personalization and ad placements into its e-commerce experience, it could unlock a new layer of monetization that complements product sales.
AI as the common thread
Across all of Amazon's businesses, AI is becoming the connective tissue. It powers product recommendations, ad targeting, inventory forecasting, and even robot coordination in fulfillment centers.
However, Amazon's real advantage may lie in how AI ties the ecosystem together, allowing each segment (retail, cloud, and media) to strengthen the others. For example, more ad data improves seller tools on AWS, which in turn helps brands sell more on Amazon's marketplace. It's a flywheel built not just on scale, but on intelligence.
What does it mean for investors?
Over the next five years, Amazon is well positioned to grow its cloud computing, advertising, and core e-commerce businesses. The former will likely play a bigger role in the future as the giant rides the tailwinds in these areas.
For investors, it means that the behemoth can still succeed, so it is worth keeping a close eye on the company -- and if valuation permits, acquiring and holding a position in it."

Now, It's Poised to Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla in the $1 Trillion Club by 2026.",This historically low-tech business is getting a digital upgrade.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=76357a8e5e89635b420ba7446e2eb158958b1ef3d1c7479f6a5d54dec2680474,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meet-the-stock-split-stock-that-soared-by-470-over/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meet-the-stock-split-stock-that-soared-by-470-over/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meet-the-stock-split-stock-that-soared-by-470-over/,fool.com,200,,"In 2018, tech giant Apple became the first U.S. company to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Since then, it's been joined by other companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Of course, the list also includes the current market-cap leader, Nvidia.
It's becoming increasingly normal for a new company to join the $1 trillion club. But it remains an impressive feat nevertheless. At this pace, these tech titans could be joined by brick-and-mortar giant Walmart (WMT 1.54%) in 2026.
Over the past 15 years, Walmart stock has risen by 470%. The company has also been a steady dividend payer over this time. For investors who bought, held, and reinvested the dividends along the way, returns were even better with a 680% gain.
Stocks that post strong long-term gains, as Walmart stock has, often decide to undergo stock splits, bringing the price per share down due to a higher number of shares overall. Walmart has done this many times in its history, including a 3-for-1 stock split in 2024.
As of this writing, Walmart has a market cap of $820 billion. Therefore, to reach $1 trillion in 2026, it would need to appreciate by about 22% in less than 15 months. Is this really possible? It's not a sure thing, but it may be easier than some investors think.
How Walmart can reach $1 trillion
At a high level, stocks tend to go up when profit potential goes up. Perhaps profit potential goes up because a business is about to reach a new scale thanks to new locations or an acquisition. Or perhaps profit potential goes up because management is about to unlock some operating leverage. But either way, for Walmart stock to go up another 22%, one would expect improvement to its operating income over the next year or so.
Walmart is known for selling millions of products. But retail sales aren't driving growth for the company's operating income. In the earnings call to discuss financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2026, CFO John Rainey said: ""Contributions to operating income are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of interrelated drivers, including improved e-commerce, economics, and business mix, most notably from higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees.""
Rainey attributes much of Walmart's operating income growth to e-commerce, an area of the business that's absolutely booming. In Q2, e-commerce revenue was up a strong 25% year over year globally, far outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of about 5%. If e-commerce continues to boom in 2026, it could drive operating income, and the stock price, higher.
Walmart's e-commerce growth provides it with another opportunity: Digital advertising. The company has troves of consumer shopping data and strong relationships with top consumer brands. With more customers transacting digitally, it gives the retailer an opportunity to generate high-margin digital advertising revenue.
Additionally, Walmart recently completed its acquisition of connected-TV company Vizio. This is another channel with which the company can leverage its data and scale to advertise to consumers, which again drives operating income growth.
For what it's worth, Walmart's Q2 advertising revenue was up 46%. Granted, some of the growth was inorganic from the recent addition of Vizio. But the company is growing this revenue stream nonetheless.
In other words, Walmart's fastest-growing revenue streams also happen to be the ones that are driving growth in operating profit. Assuming these trends continue, which I do, Walmart's profits should continue to climb in 2026, providing a boost for the stock price.
To be clear, Walmart might not grow enough over the next 15 months to warrant a $1 trillion valuation before the end of 2026. But directionally, the business appears to be headed for the trillion-dollar club. It doesn't seem to be a matter of if, but rather of when."

And I could see why some investors would gravitate toward Berkshire Hathaway, which is like an ETF bundled within a single stock.
But I have my sights set on a stock that has quietly delivered a 58,000% return since it began trading in 1991. The business isn't flashy, but it's indispensable. It's a cash cow in good times and bad. And the company's share-buyback program can only be described as relentless.
I'm talking about AutoZone (AZO -0.48%).
You know the jingle
AutoZone is an auto parts retailer that likely needs no introduction, because that ubiquitous jingle -- ""Get in the zone, AutoZone!"" -- is probably living rent-free in your head. But if you've never peeked under the hood of AutoZone's business, you might be surprised by how strong the engine is.
Founded in 1979, AutoZone has grown from a single store in Forrest City, Arkansas, to more than 6,600 stores in the United States. AutoZone also is expanding internationally, with 883 stores in Mexico and nearly 150 in Brazil.
For the company's fiscal year 2025, which ended Aug. 30, AutoZone reported net sales of $18.9 billion, a 4.5% increase over the previous year on a 52-week basis. U.S. same-store sales -- also known as comparable-store sales -- were up 3.2%, while international same-store sales were up 9.3%, adjusting for the negative effects of currency exchange rates.
Tariff-driven cost inflation, a stronger U.S. dollar, and AutoZone's aggressive expansion efforts have put pressure on earnings. Net income dipped 6.2% to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2025, and diluted earnings per share fell 3.1% to $144.87.
In fact, AutoZone's fiscal 2025 Q4 results marked the fifth consecutive quarter that the company has fallen short of analysts' earnings estimates. Yet the stock is up 24% this year, as of Oct. 9, which tells me that investors are focusing on the big picture. Here's why you might consider doing the same.
A huge total addressable market
One way to assess a company's growth prospects is to look at its total addressable market. AutoZone is one of the leading retailers in the automotive aftermarket. Industry associations expect the total value of the U.S. automotive aftermarket to reach $576 billion in 2025, and globally, it's valued at $2.3 trillion. . With the number of vehicles on the road and the average age of vehicles at an all-time high, demand for replacement parts should continue to be strong.
AutoZone has been investing heavily in its sales and distribution footprint to capture more market share. In fiscal 2025, AutoZone's capital expenditures rose 27% to nearly $1.4 billion. The company opened 304 new stores -- the most since 1996 -- and two new distribution centers. Management expects fiscal 2026 capex spending to be in the same ballpark, with most of it focused on ""accelerated store growth.""
Some of those new stores are larger stores that function like mini distribution centers. ""Megahubs,"" for example, are supersized AutoZone stores carrying more than 100,000 SKUs (individual products). Megahubs have been outperforming traditional stores, and they're helping smaller stores in their area fulfill orders faster. AutoZone's ultimate goal is to have 300 megahubs.
In fiscal 2025, AutoZone generated nearly $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, so it's in a strong position to keep investing in the business. Given the sheer size of the automotive aftermarket, the payoff could be massive. But there's another reason I'm such a huge fan of this stock.
AutoZone knows how to treat shareholders
Since fiscal 1998, AutoZone has scooped up $38.5 billion worth of its own shares. Over the past 10 years, AutoZone reduced its outstanding share count by 45% -- and it's still buying more shares.
Share buybacks are a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders, and they signal management's confidence in the business. By reducing the supply of shares available in the market, share buybacks can enhance earnings per share and increase demand for the remaining shares -- both of which can drive the stock price higher.
You can see the inverse relationship in this chart:
Inelastic demand
There's something else that makes AutoZone a strong candidate for this ""what-if"" hypothetical.
The automotive aftermarket benefits from a concept known as inelastic demand -- meaning consumers will make essential repairs to their vehicles regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. In fact, auto parts retailers often shine in tough times, because consumers tend to pull back on buying new vehicles. As a leader in this space, AutoZone might be the ultimate recession-resistant stock, well-positioned for growth in boom times and busts."

Six years ago, with one of her clients struggling to find older talent, she successfully asked 400 people whether they might ‘un-retire’ and return to the workplace.
It sparked the idea for her company, 55/Redefined, which has seen some of the world’s largest organisations attract workers and consumers aged over 50.
Simpson’s aim was to inspire this generation and end ageism in the workplace. Further, she persuaded corporations that focusing on over-50s talent would not only future-proof their businesses but create a competitive edge by valuing experience.

It currently delivers age strategy services in 44 countries for more than 95 of the world's largest companies, including Amazon, Barclays and Warner Bros. Next year will mark the London startup’s fifth anniversary.
“We are a global organisation that helps everyone, everywhere to feel inspired and not retired, solving challenges around our ageing population,” says Simpson.
The idea was formed when Simpson was CEO and co-founder of an HR and recruitment outsource business. The firm had received a call from Natwest bank which needed to bring in over-50s talent for a regulated project of work harking back to the 1990s.
Her clients had to unpick the advice the bank was then giving to businesses, but found that all the people in their required demographic were in their 60s and retired.
As a former banker at Barclays, she started networking and phoned up ex colleagues with the same number she's had since the 1990s to see if they would return as contractors.
It didn't take long for Simpson to pick up on a recurring theme; dejected by a lack of purpose, retiring was the worst decision they had made. In eight weeks, she had 400 people placed back into the banking sector. Six years on, 250 are still working full-time.
So, why did they want to return? “It wasn’t about the money,” says Simpson. “They could all afford to be retired, they were career bankers on final salary pension schemes. They were targeting retiring in their late 50s or early 60s and being competitive about it.

“Most people who go into retirement underestimate their own life expectancy by about 15 to 20 years. What nobody spends any time doing is what they will do 24 hours a day for decades if they take work out of the equation.""
Since leaving Barclays in 2007, where her roles included head of corporate development, Simpson has been an entrepreneur in the consultancy and restaurant sectors."

The post ended with a question that kicked off a chorus of commiseration in the comments section. “Has anyone else had that moment where your big financial ‘win ' just vanished under rising costs? How do you keep motivation when progress feels impossible?” they wrote.
A Shared Misery and Economic Anxiety
The top comment offered a bleak silver lining. “On the bright side, at least you're not negative $400/month.”
The comment section by and large though embodied the ""misery loves company"" adage. Although some replies admitted “lifestyle creep” played a role as their income grew gradually, commenters flooded the replies sharing their all-too-familiar woes of inflation near-instantly erasing their hard earned promotions and raises.
One commenter wrote that after six years, a promotion took their salary from $80,000 to $120,000, but they were left with the same buying power as when they started, attributing it to high inflation. Another commenter wrote that “over 10 years my salary doubled and rent quadrupled. For a while, I was poorer on $50k than I was on $25k.”

Its stock has gained just 34% over the past five years, significantly trailing the S&P 500 index's 90% returns.
But despite its mediocre returns, there's still a lot to like about what Amazon's doing right now and where the company is headed. Here are a few reasons why the company could still be a good long-term investment and whether Amazon stock could set you up for life.
1. It's making big investments in AI
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading public cloud computing company with 30% market share, compared to Microsoft's 20% and Google's 13%. Microsoft has made some gains on Amazon over the past few years, but Amazon is making some very large investments in artificial intelligence to stay on top.
Recently, the company spent $34 billion in the second quarter on capital expenditures, mostly for expanding its cloud business, and analysts estimate it could spend up to $100 billion this year. The key to staying ahead in the AI race right now is investing a lot of money to build the most advanced data center infrastructure, and this spending could help Amazon outpace the competition.
And it will likely be money well spent, considering that AWS has an operating margin of 33% and generated $10.2 billion operating income in Q2. Not only that, but global AI cloud computing revenue is estimated to reach $2 trillion by 2030, giving Amazon a lot of potential to expand further into this space.
2. It's still the e-commerce king
Amazon has more e-commerce competition than ever, yet the company has maintained its dominant position. Amazon enjoys U.S. e-commerce market share of 40%, while rival Walmart takes just 13% and Target barely registers with 2%.
A big part of the company's success comes from its Prime membership subscription, which gives members access to fast and free deliveries, video and music streaming, photo storage, and more. The latest estimates put global Prime membership at 240 million.
Prime members are important to the company because they spend an average of $1,170 annually on Amazon -- more than twice what nonmembers spend, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.
3. Its advertising business continues to impress
Advertising is perhaps one of the most overlooked aspects of Amazon's business, but it's becoming increasingly important, with Amazon's ad sales increasing by 23% in Q2 to $15.7 billion.
To put this in perspective, Amazon is the third-largest advertising company in the U.S. behind Alphabet and Meta Platforms. The company will have an estimated 17% of the digital market next year, up from less than 11% in 2021. Considering that digital ad sales in the U.S. will reach $429 billion by 2029, Amazon's ability to successfully tap into this market could become increasingly important over the next few years.
Will buying Amazon set you up for life?
Amazon's stock has been a huge success for long-term investors, with gains of 2,800% over the past 15 years. But expecting similar results over the next decade or so probably isn't realistic.
Still, that doesn't mean you should avoid adding Amazon to your portfolio. With Amazon still the leading cloud computing player, its investments in AI just beginning, and the company already carving out a niche in advertising, Amazon still has a lot of potential to boost your portfolio in the coming years, even if it doesn't set you up for life."

Inversion envisions space as a global logistics network, creating orbital infrastructure that could one day move goods, resources, and information across the planet with unprecedented speed.
The Arc spacecraft operates from low-Earth orbit, where vehicles form constellations tailored to customer needs. When called down, Inversion says Arc descends from orbit, navigates hypersonic reentry at velocities surpassing Mach 20, and completes autonomous landings using parachutes.

Is Space Becoming A Global Logistics Network?
Arc includes a modular payload bay built to transport mission-critical cargo and sensitive materials across a range of environments, from isolated regions to areas without reliable infrastructure. Inversion says this design opens a new chapter in logistics by using orbital access as an extension of Earth's delivery network.
""With massive cross-range to cover great distances during reentry, and high maneuverability throughout every phase of flight, Arc delivers a transportation capability that has never existed before,"" Inversion co-founder and CEO Justin Fiaschetti said in the company's statement.
Fiaschetti added that the long-term vision involves deploying thousands of Arc vehicles working together as a connected fleet, forming an orbital logistics layer that enhances reach, reliability, and resilience for the U.S. and allied partners.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Hypersonic Testing Capabilities Drive Defense Innovation
Beyond its delivery mission, Arc also functions as a high-performance hypersonic testing platform, capable of maneuvering at high speeds, sustaining prolonged time under extreme conditions, and maintaining continuous high g-loading, according to the company statement.
Inversion said these characteristics support the U.S.' growing emphasis on hypersonic research and make it possible to simulate next-generation flight trajectories with greater precision than traditional ground-based tests."

Amazon.com Investment Narrative Recap
To be an Amazon.com shareholder, I believe you need conviction in the company's ability to lead in cloud, AI, and e-commerce while scaling new ventures, despite escalating investment needs and fierce competition in tech infrastructure. The latest wave of analyst optimism points to AWS and AI as the key near-term catalyst, but the short-term impact from news like Amazon’s recent Semicon West presentation or fresh product launches appears minimal. The most important risk remains margin pressure and execution challenges in AWS, with heavy AI spend raising questions about profitability if efficiency gains do not materialize.
The launch of Amazon Grocery, bringing over 1,000 private label food items under one unified brand, stands out among recent announcements. While it highlights ongoing innovation in retail and value propositions for customers, it is AWS and Amazon’s AI-driven momentum that are most likely to influence near-term excitement and longer-term earnings power.

You are definitely not alone. With the semiconductor sector capturing headlines and Arm’s architecture showing up in billions of devices, figuring out whether to buy, hold, or trim your position is more relevant than ever. It is no surprise that Arm’s share price has been on the move recently, closing at $154.87 after climbing 1.5% over the past week and just half a percent for the month. Step back, though, and Arm stands out more over a longer time frame, having clocked a 20.8% return so far this year, even if the one-year rise sits at a modest 2.2%.
Behind the scenes, a few key events are shaping investor sentiment. On the upside, Qualcomm’s adoption of the latest Arm technology and the company’s recent hire from Amazon’s AI chip team shine a light on Arm’s design strengths and growth potential in AI and custom chip markets. At the same time, SoftBank’s big-ticket financing move using Arm shares as collateral is a reminder of the sizable bets being placed, and the risk perceptions in play.
With all that noise, how do you figure out what Arm is truly worth? On a straight-up valuation score, where a company gets credit for each sign it is undervalued, Arm only checks one box out of six, for a total value score of 1. In other words, the case for undervaluation is not obvious. But valuation is a nuanced subject, and to make informed decisions, it pays to go deeper. Let us take a closer look at the different approaches analysts use, and then, stick around, because there is an even better way to assess a stock’s real value in today’s market.
Arm Holdings scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: Arm Holdings Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company’s value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to the present, capturing both expected growth and the time value of money. For Arm Holdings, this model uses Free Cash Flow (FCF) estimates as its base: over the last twelve months, Arm generated $774 million in FCF. Analyst projections see this figure rising substantially, hitting nearly $5 billion by March 2030. Only the first five years of forecasts come from analysts, with further projections extrapolated using prevailing growth rates.
All cash flows are denominated in US dollars, as reported. The DCF model used here, the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, takes these projections and discounts them using an appropriate rate to arrive at an estimated intrinsic value.

The moment some people make more money, they spend more money and don’t advance closer to long-term financial goals.
Bezos’ secret? He constantly reinvested in himself and the company. Bezos could have generated profits with Amazon much earlier, but he set his sights on long-term dominance over short-term profits.

The tech giant continued to invest in its infrastructure, technology and distribution networks in its early days instead of rewarding investors with high earnings per share. Not everyone was happy with that at the time, but Bezos’ reinvestments allowed Amazon to dominate multiple sectors and produce life-changing returns for early investors.
Here’s how you can apply Bezos’ smartest financial decision to your life.
Don’t Rush To Spend Money
Bezos could have generated profits much sooner, but he reinvested his money instead. While you may not have an Amazon-level corporation, you can still reinvest your profits back into assets that can produce solid returns.
For instance, if you receive a 10% raise, don’t upgrade your lifestyle. You can reinvest the extra money into the stock market or start a small business. Then, you will have a larger nest egg by the time you retire.
Letting money compound over the long run makes it easier to grow your portfolio than if you hold off on reinvestments and start late. It’s better to start now than it is to not start at all, but if you can invest in your 20s and 30s, that’s even better.
For You: The No. 1 Way Americans Become Millionaires Is Pretty Boring — and Easy To Do
Reinvest Your Money Into the Right Opportunities
Bezos didn’t reinvest his money just for the sake of it. He carefully researched opportunities to determine which ones aligned with Amazon’s objectives. Then, he deployed capital in ways that boosted Amazon’s revenue.
An index fund is one of the easiest ways to get started. Benchmarks like the S&P 500 contain some of the largest publicly traded corporations, and they are diversified across several sectors. However, some investors like to dig deeper and analyze individual stocks that have a chance of outperforming major benchmarks.
Investors should consider where a company is heading instead of what it’s doing right now. Some firms have positioned themselves to capitalize on major industries and tailwinds, like artificial intelligence. Other investments look good now but face headwinds and high valuations that can derail their gains."

According to Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives, the market reaction stems from China’s announcement about tightening restrictions on rare earth materials effective December 1.
""After a relatively calm few months and improving relations between the US and China this step up in tensions has created a white knuckle moment for the markets with tech stocks under major pressure today,"" Ives noted.
The analyst characterized the situation as ""a game of high stakes poker"" between the US and China amid the ongoing AI revolution, with Beijing also increasing scrutiny of NVIDIA’s advanced chips.
Ives maintained his bullish stance on tech stocks despite the sell-off, suggesting that ""the bark will likely be worse than bite this time around as cooler heads prevail."" He views such market reactions as buying opportunities for semiconductor, software, and Big Tech companies.
The analyst highlighted several companies leading what he called the ""4th Industrial Revolution,"" including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Palantir (which he dubbed ""the Messi of AI""), Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.
Ives predicted tech stocks could rise another 7% or more by year-end, describing the current market as a ""1996 Moment...and NOT a 1999 Moment."" He also pointed to OpenAI’s recent investments in NVIDIA and AMD as evidence of ongoing capacity expansion and enterprise demand.
""Sell-offs like today we encourage investors to buy the tech winners and not head for elevators despite this war of words between Trump and Xi,"" Ives concluded.

A look at Wall Street amid Trump tariff talks on China
The stock market plunged Oct. 10 after President Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on China in response to new restrictions on natural resources.
The Nasdaq Composite was down as much as 2.6% early in the afternoon, according to CNBC, while the S&P 500 fell 1.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3%. Those numbers had rebounded slightly but returned to approximately the same levels as of 2 p.m.
Among other popular stocks Vanguard was down 1.73%, Nividia 2.43%, Amazon 3.64%, Tesla 3.85%, Apple 2.6% and Invesco QQQ 2.28%.
The shift was apparently the result of a Truth Social post by Trump in which he alleged that China was ""becoming very hostile"" in restricting rare earth metals, which are key components in producing a variety of technological items.
""Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,"" Trump wrote. ""I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right! There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive,' but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time.""
Trump noted that he was scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks, but now ""there seems to be no reason to do so."" The administration is considering a ""massive increase"" on tariffs among other countermeasures, he said.
""I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,"" Trump wrote. ""Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.""
The stocks had been considerably higher before Trump's post. According to CNBC, the Nasdaq reached a new all-time high within the day prior to the president's comments."

Third quarter earning season is underway with the biggest tech names slated to report later in the month. It'll of course give us the latest read on just how much companies are spending and making on artificial intelligence, which has driven markets to repeated record highs. Here with more on what to watch is Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and Global Head of Technology Research. Dan, it's great to see you, as always. Um, so we're going into earning season for this company for these companies at a time where there is this debate of valuations. There is this debate about the so-called circular economy, how much they're all sort of spending on each other. Um, what are you going to zero in on in the in these earnings reports?
Yeah, I look, Julia, I'd say, I mean, the street's still massively underestimating what this tech cycle is going to look like. I think it's an AI super cycle. And I think this 3Q earnings is going to be much more of a validation moment in terms of not just for chips but for software. And I think the broader build out. Look, it continue the bears in hibernation mode. They've missed the last two and a half years. and they'll continue to miss this bull market that I think has another two years ahead of it.
You know, it's interesting because I haven't talked to that many bears, right? The bears, the straight up bears are hard to find on this stuff. It's more the message that maybe you should start to diversify a little bit. It's not that you should sell necessarily, maybe take a little bit of profits and put it in some of the smaller companies in the space, put them outside of AI entirely because maybe we're in a little bit of a a breathing period here. What do you think of that argument, Dan?
Look, I get it. I mean, but my view is we're in the second inning of a nine- inning cycle. So, I mean, to to peel away from an AI perspective, talk about people have peeled away from AMD over the last, you know, a month ago, or Oracle six months ago, or Nvidia a year ago. See my whole point is like, the street's under estimating what this cycle is going to look like. And I think ultimately in the next one, two years, numbers are maybe 20, 30% underestimated. And I think that's why three Q earnings is just going to be more validation showing the use cases are exploded."

A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after President Trump threatened to impose ""massive"" new tariffs on Chinese imports, reigniting trade war fears.
The unexpected announcement shattered a monthslong calm on Wall Street, sending major indices tumbling. The S&P 500 dropped around 1.3%, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7%. Investors reacted by selling off stocks, particularly in the technology and retail sectors, amid concerns that escalating trade tensions could disrupt global supply chains and increase costs for companies. The sell-off marked a significant reversal from the morning's slight gains, highlighting the market's sensitivity to geopolitical trade developments.

Zooming In On Skillz (SKLZ)
Skillz’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 45 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock dropped 4.2% on the news that a steeper-than-anticipated drop in U.S. consumer confidence raised alarms about future consumer spending.
The Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in September, its lowest reading since April. The decline was attributed to growing pessimism among Americans regarding inflation and a weakening job market. This data is particularly concerning for companies reliant on discretionary spending, such as those in online retail, travel, and the gig economy, as reports suggest a bleak consumer outlook could curb spending on non-essential items and services. The survey's Expectations Index, a measure of short-term outlook, has remained below a key threshold that often signals a future recession, adding to investor concerns about the economic landscape."

The company attributes its rapid growth in part to this decision, as well as the development of its ad placement algorithm.
Vibe said it focuses on ""performance marketers,"" think gaming apps or direct-to-consumer beauty brands, who tend to buy ads on platforms like Instagram instead of TV. For these companies, TV advertising can feel overwhelming– a barrier to entry that larger adtech companies aren't poised to help them overcome.
Querou, who is Vibe's co-CEO, told Business Insider that the company's team has invested heavily in its generative AI studio, which has been an essential tool for companies that are new to the TV ad game.
Vibe's AI studio allows advertisers to enter their company's name or URL, and the platform will create a custom ad from there. More than 10% of the ads run by Vibe.co are currently AI-generated, Querou says. He predicts this number will rise to 35% by the end of the year and 95% by 2028.

Querou also told BI that Vibe's ad targeting product has been a key component in the company's growth.
""We built our own data assets that allow us to be much more granular” in matching a specific product to the right viewer, he said. ""We’ve transformed the whole buying stack into a recommendation engine.”
Looking ahead, Querou says Vibe plans to combine this homegrown AI approach to help scale the company. While they are planning to hire for some key management roles, he says other positions, like account managers, will be filled by internally developed AI agents."

Shares of satellite communications provider fell 5% in the morning session after investors reacted to signs of growing competition in the satellite communications market after Amazon's Project Kuiper outlined plans to expand its services.
The news followed a meeting where a delegation from Amazon detailed plans to launch its Project Kuiper satellite broadband service in Pakistan. This expansion by a major technology company highlighted the increasingly crowded field for satellite communications. For existing players like Iridium, the entry and growth of well-funded competitors such as Amazon's Kuiper and others like Starlink signaled a more challenging market ahead, potentially putting pressure on future growth and market share.
Adding to the weakness, markets pulled back as worries over worsening trade relations with China were triggered by critical comments from President Donald Trump. Trump targeted China's tightening controls on rare earth metals, which are vital components in many technology products from electric vehicles to defense systems. The president's tone and the suggestion of canceling a meeting with President Xi caused a rapid sell-off in the market.

Iridium’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock dropped 2.8% on the news that broader macroeconomic concerns, including an ongoing government shutdown and anticipation of commentary from Federal Reserve officials, began to weigh on investor sentiment. After reaching new record highs, major U.S. indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced a slight retreat. This pause came as investors grappled with the potential economic impact of a partial government shutdown, which had dampened consumer confidence and delayed the release of key economic data, such as September's nonfarm payrolls. The market appeared to be in a holding pattern as traders anticipated signals from Federal Reserve officials, looking for clues on future monetary policy. The caution in the broader market suggests that wider economic anxieties are currently overriding recent sector-specific optimism."

Chicago, IL – October 10, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Carnival Corp. & plc CCL as the Bull of the Day and Constellation Brands, Inc. STZ as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Carnival Corp. & plc recently posted another record quarter. People are still cruising. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow earnings by 47.9% this year.
Carnival is the largest global cruise company. It's brands include Carnival Cruise Line, AIDA Cruises, Costa Cruises, Cunard, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn.
Carnival Beat For the 12th Consecutive Quarter
On Sep 29, 2025, Carnival reported it's third quarter 2025 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus. It was the 12th consecutive earnings surprise.
Earnings were $1.43, beating the Zacks Consensus of $1.32 by $0.11.
Revenue was a record of $8.2 billion, up over $250 million from the year ago quarter on lower capacity. This was the 10th consecutive quarter that Carnival has posted record revenue.
Gross margin yields were 6.4% higher than last year.
All-time high net yields were 4.6% higher than 2024 and outperformed the company's June guidance by 1.1 points driven by strong demand and onboard spending.
Carnival's exclusive Celebration Key beach destination in the Bahamas also opened in the quarter and should be a growth catalyst for 2026.
Carnival Booking Trends Remain Strong
Everyone has been watching the leisure and hospitality companies for clues about the strength of the consumer. But Carnival isn't seeing any slowdown.
Since May, Carnival's booking trends have continued to strengthen. It has higher booking volumes than last year and is far outpacing capacity growth.
It has already booked nearly half of 2026, which is in line with last year's record levels at the same time, but Carnival has been able to get historical high prices for North America and Europe segments.
Bookings have started for 2027 cruises. Carnival said it was already off to a great start, achieving record booking volumes in the third quarter.
Carnival Raises Full Year 2025 Margin Guidance
Carnival is bullish after another strong quarter. It raised its net yields guidance to up 5.3% compared to 2024. That is up 0.3 percentage points over the June guidance.
The analysts are bullish as well. 6 estimates were raised for both 2025 and 2026 in the last month.
The 2025 Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to $2.10 from $2.00 during that time. That is earnings growth of 47.9% as the company made just $1.42 in 2024."

Dublin, Oct. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""2025 Connected TV Platform Expansion in the U.S.: Gaming, Fitness, Smart Home"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
This study draws from the analyst's Q1 2025 survey of 8,000 US internet households. The survey is demographically representative of US internet households, with quotas for age, income, gender, and educational attainment.
TV operating system (TV OS) platform vendors and TV OEMs are looking for new use cases and applications to drive TV sales, advertising revenue, and uptake of related services. With widespread adoption of large-screen TVs, 4K and HDR, relatively little interest in 8K and a business model transitioning away from a high volume, low margin hardware model to a high margin advertising model, CTV platform vendors and TV OEMs benefit from expanding beyond the traditional feature set. With smart TVs now reaching 68% of US internet households, this creates new possibilities for commerce, gaming, fitness, and smart home applications, among others.
This study investigates new differentiators and points of interest for US CTV buyers. It examines demand for smart home hub capabilities, health and fitness services and integrations, advanced gaming functions and features, artistic display capabilities, telehealth, content creation, interactive shopping, and more. It identifies consumer openness towards technologies such as optical content recognition, embedded cameras and microphones, AI and AI assistants, among others.

When asked why he believed the company would be a top performer, here is what the analyst said at the time:
“ I think if you look at Amazon, Meta, or Microsoft, it’s very strategic for them to have a second source. They need to keep Nvidia’s pricing in check. Nvidia, to their credit, while prices and margins have gone up, have not taken advantage of their customers. They’ve profited from them greatly, but they’ve not exploited their market position. The buyers we’re talking about—hundreds of billions of dollars going into AI infrastructure—they need to make sure there’s a competitor. We’ve already seen the AI category for AMD growing to a $5 billion market for them over the next year.”
Over the past year, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) shares have gained 36%. The stock is up 95% so far this year, thanks to the recent surge following its latest deal with OpenAI. AMD agreed to supply 6 gigawatts of compute capacity to OpenAI.
Macquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and manufactures semiconductors, including central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and other high-performance computing solutions for various markets like gaming, data centers, and AI. The company currently maintains a small market share for GPUs used for AI applications though by 2027, we believe the company will have product on par with the market leader, NVIDIA. Hyperscale customers with deep programming expertise may increasingly decide to dual-source high-end chips leading to much larger revenue and profit gains in coming years for AMD than investors currently expect.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Which? - who we've teamed up with to tell you some do's and don'ts later in this post - asked 2,495 people to share their experiences of buying preloved smartphones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches from 18 shops.
Here are the scores based on customer service, product range and availability, product quality, accuracy of descriptions, communicating, delivery, amount of original packaging, ease of website and value for money...
""We were pleasantly surprised by the results - 10 retailers received a customer score of 80% or more,"" said Which.
For an idea of how much you could save, Which? offered these examples...
-
Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (2023): £679.99 (Amazon Renewed, ""Excellent"" grade), compared to £1,129 new - a £449 saving.
-
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: £139 (eBay Certified Refurbished, ""Excellent"" grade), £239 new - a £100 saving.
-
iPhone 16 (128GB): £649.99 or £609.99 (iOutlet, Grade A+ or A), £699 new - a £49-£89 saving.
Which? tech expert Andrew Laughlin told the Money blog: ""Not only is buying second-hand tech better for the planet, it can also be substantially better for your wallet with hundreds of pounds to be saved compared to buying new.
""It's important to go into it with eyes wide open. Buying from a reputable source, checking how long software updates will last and choosing a refurbished device with at least 80% battery health will ensure you're not left disappointed.""
We've teamed up with Which? to bring you these essential do's and don'ts...
Do - Check software update support periods
One of the most important things to consider when buying a second-hand or refurbished phone is how long the device will be supported with security updates. Apple iPhones tend to receive security updates from the manufacturer for at least five or six years from the phone's launch. For Android phones, this can vary from two to eight years.
Once a phone stops receiving crucial security updates, it'll be more vulnerable to attacks from data-grabbing hackers.
Do - Wait until after new product launches
There's usually an influx of last-generation products to second-hand retailers shortly after a new launch, as people sell old devices to raise money for the new model.
Do - Buy from Reputable Sellers
Stick to trusted sources and avoid random sellers or unverified marketplaces.
Do - Check the returns policy
You have 14 days to notify the store that you want to return an item, and a further 14 days to actually return it. But for peace of mind, it's worth checking if there is an extended returns period, and what the shop's faulty goods policy is."

Digital Marketing Market
Dublin, Oct. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Digital Marketing Market - Global Forecast 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The digital marketing market grew from USD 9.97 billion in 2024 to USD 11.07 billion in 2025. It is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 10.91%, reaching USD 18.57 billion by 2030. This growth reflects strong adoption of innovative technologies, evolving customer engagement strategies, and an expanding regulatory landscape, positioning digital marketing as a core function in driving enterprise value.
Senior decision-makers routinely confront rapid evolution in digital marketing, driven by advancing technologies, regulatory shifts, and shifting consumer behaviors. This research provides a strategic overview of the digital marketing market, offering relevant segmentation, actionable insights, and a clear pathway for business growth in today's competitive landscape.
Tariff Impact: U.S. Trade Measures and Supply Chain Adaptation
Recent U.S. tariffs introduced in 2025 have altered technology procurement and digital marketing infrastructure. Digital advertising vendors faced increased operational costs from elevated import duties on hardware, resulting in agile strategies such as vendor consolidation, renegotiation of service agreements, and a rise in cloud-based solutions to shift processing workloads to more favorable regions. This shift encourages organizations to cultivate robust, resilient supply chains and diversify their technology providers.
Conclusion
The digital marketing market presents both complexity and significant opportunity. Forward-looking organizations that prioritize adaptive technology, ethical data practices, and regional localization will secure competitive advantages and position themselves for sustained, resilient growth.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-10T09:25:00,Better Buy: Amazon vs. Target,Amazon and Target are badly underperforming the S&P 500 in 2025.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b174badf9fc6aa165456f46453dc10b9622920ef41ae0ad0d0f523bf4169e588,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/better-buy-amazon-vs-target/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/better-buy-amazon-vs-target/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/better-buy-amazon-vs-target/,fool.com,200,,"It has been a rough year for consumer discretionary and retail stocks.
Amazon (AMZN -0.54%) is up just 1.1% year to date (YTD), underperforming the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.75%) by a wide margin. Meanwhile, Target (TGT 2.11%) has lost a third of its value YTD.
With the major indexes at all-time highs, some investors may be looking at Amazon and Target as compelling values in today's premium-priced market.
Here's what two Fool.com contributors have to say about what makes each stock stand out as a top buy now.
It really is still ""Day One"" for Amazon
Keith Speights: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos instilled a corporate culture centered on the idea that the company was still in ""Day One."" By that, he meant that Amazon retained a start-up mentality, with a focus on customers and innovation despite its huge size.
I think it really is still ""Day One"" for Amazon. Look at e-commerce. Even though Amazon is the 800-pound gorilla in the market, it's still growing by leaps and bounds.
In the second quarter of 2025, the company's North America and international segments (both of which focus largely on e-commerce) delivered double-digit percentage sales growth. Operating income growth for these two segments was even more impressive.
Importantly, Amazon's management focuses more on the opportunity ahead than on what they've already achieved. Case in point: CEO Andy Jassy told analysts in the company's 2024 third-quarter earnings call last year that Amazon only has around 1% of the global retail market. He pointed out that between 80% and 85% of retail sales still occur in brick-and-mortar stores, with a much smaller portion online.
Jassy is convinced this ""equation is going to flip in the next 10 to 20 years."" If he's right, that presents a huge opportunity for Amazon.
Sure, AWS is growing more slowly than some of its rivals. But the cloud unit still managed to increase sales by 17.5% year over year in Q2. That's not too shabby. Meanwhile, Amazon is investing heavily in agentic artificial intelligence (AI) and infrastructure expansion to stay No. 1.
Want more evidence of Amazon's ""Day One"" mindset? The company will soon launch its Project Kuiper satellite internet service that will compete against Elon Musk's Starlink. Amazon subsidiary Zoox already offers robotaxi services in Las Vegas, with San Francisco its next target market. I think both initiatives will pay off handsomely over time.
Admittedly, Target's valuation seems much more attractive than Amazon's. However, Target is cheap for a reason: slowing growth that's due in large part to management decisions.
I own both of these stocks. But if I had to pick one, I'd go with the faster-growing one that trades at a well-deserved premium.
The worst is over for Target
Daniel Foelber: Amazon remains the leader in cloud computing, but competition is heating up.
Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud are growing faster than Amazon Web Services (AWS). And Oracle is landing massive cloud computing deals with Meta Platforms and OpenAI.
AWS management believes that its slowing growth is temporary and that, despite AWS's size, the segment is still in the early innings and has plenty of room to expand in lockstep with the growth driven by artificial intelligence. Overall, Amazon seems like a decent buy, but it isn't particularly compelling, given AWS's slowdown and challenges with its e-commerce business.
Target offers investors an alternative to high-flying growth stocks.
Fundamentals drive stock price performance over the long term. But in the short term, market sentiment can carry even more weight. Combine investor enthusiasm with high-octane growth potential, and you get explosive results.
However, negative sentiment and weak fundamentals can erode a stock's value, which is precisely what is happening with Target. Target's operating margins have taken a hit as the retailer has struggled with inventory management, estimating customer buyer behavior, and getting customers into stores. Buyers are increasingly focused on value rather than the shopping experience, which is why Walmart and Costco Wholesale are performing so well.
Target's solution is to lean into what differentiates it from these value-focused options, which is an engaging in-store experience. This includes what stores look like and what products Target carries. Target has a more discretionary product mix than Walmart and Costco, but it can offer nonessentials like household goods at attractive prices relative to premium alternatives.
Given Target's languishing stock price, it's clear investors are not convinced. For Target to complete its turnaround, the company must demonstrate that its strategies are paying off. Investors will look for better alignment between inventories and customer interests, which would indicate that Target is more effectively capturing buyer behavior trends. If that happens, Target's margins and same-store sales should improve.
In the meantime, Target stock is dirt cheap, and its dividend is compelling. Target has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.4 and a forward P/E of 12.2 compared to a 10-year median P/E of 15.4. And unlike many turnaround companies, Target is still generating a ton of free cash flow. In fact, Target's trailing-12-month (TTM) free cash flow is $6.43 per share, and TTM earnings per share are $8.58 compared to its annualized dividend of $4.56 per share.
Add it all up, and Target is the perfect dividend stock for investors to buy because it will pay you to wait for its turnaround to pay off."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-10T08:25:00,"The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $5,000 Right Now",These holdings in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio could earn market-beating returns over time.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=181a6069af90caf4e2d6659a79394ff29684691c20f0cb9ba180fe5e26bd61ce,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/the-best-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-with-5000-ri/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/the-best-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-with-5000-ri/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/the-best-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-with-5000-ri/,fool.com,200,,"Warren Buffett's portfolio holds numerous stocks that have generated considerable returns, either in the past or present. Unfortunately, many investors might wrongly assume a Warren Buffett investment is a buy simply because it remains in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.
This calls for investors to do some due diligence of their own. However, such analyses might persuade investors to put approximately $5,000 in these stocks. Here's why.
Amazon
Admittedly, the approximate $2.35 trillion market cap for Amazon (AMZN -0.54%) might make this company a more surprising choice. To double one's investment from that level, it would take the market cap to $4.7 trillion, slightly higher than the current market cap leader, Nvidia.
Still, the state of Amazon's business means such a market cap is realistic over time. While the online sales business is no longer a high-growth enterprise, it makes the company's faster-growing subscription, third-party seller, and advertising businesses possible, which may drive a positive operating income for its two e-commerce-related segments.
Investors should also note the majority of its operating income continues to come from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment, which pioneered the lucrative cloud computing industry. AWS has also driven its expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), which boosts the entire enterprise.
Moreover, Amazon stock sells at a P/E ratio of 34, a far cry from past years, when it was routinely above 100 times earnings. At just over $220 per share, an $1,640 investment could buy an investor 7.4 shares. While that sounds modest, it could still start investors off to market-beating gains.
Domino's Pizza
Domino's Pizza (DPZ -1.65%) is a stock Buffett's team has accumulated recently. As the world's largest pizza chain, it continues to drive growth both domestically and internationally, claiming more than 21,500 locations in more than 90 countries as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended June 15).
Despite intense competition, it has offered a digital-first approach, menu innovations such as parmesan-stuffed-crust pizza, and an asset-light business model, helping it stand out in a crowded market.
Additionally, it operates a vertically integrated supply chain with distribution centers. These make the company's pizza dough and distribute ingredients to many of its locations.
Furthermore, the company has raised its dividend annually since reintroducing it in 2013. At $6.96 per share annually, it has a dividend yield of 1.6%, well above the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.53%) average of 1.2%. With those returns in mind, investors should note that during the first half of the year, dividend costs of $60 million were well below the $332 million the company generated in free cash flow it generated over the same time frame, ensuring the safety of the payout.
Finally, its 24 P/E ratio means it sells at a discount to the S&P 500 earnings multiple of 31. Thus, if one makes a $1,660 investment, they will have four shares of Domino's, giving an investor a foothold on which one can build later.
Constellation Brands
Constellation Brands (STZ -2.40%) might be the most controversial of these picks. Americans have shown a lower propensity to consume alcohol, leading to revenue declines. Also, nearly 92% of the company's net sales in the first half of this year came from beers imported from Mexico. Thus, rising tariffs could threaten Modelo's No. 1 position in the U.S. market, as well as its beer sales in general.
However, since the fourth quarter of 2024, Berkshire has continued to accumulate shares of Constellation, despite being a net seller of stocks. For investors with a risk-tolerant mindset, this could indicate that Constellation is an excellent contrarian play.
Also, Buffett has long invested in stocks with a rising dividend income, and Constellation fits that bill. Its payout has risen every year since the company began it in 2015. Today, the $4.08-per-share annual payout yields 2.9%.
During the first half of the year, the nearly $1.1 billion Constellation generated in free cash flow easily covered the $361 million in dividend costs, making its payout sustainable. That also left it with cash to buy shares, reducing the shares outstanding by 2.5% to just over 176 million.
Finally, the stock trades at a P/E ratio of 13, and with that, investors can buy 12 shares for about $1,700. Given the low likelihood that alcohol consumption will end, this low valuation, high-paying dividend, and falling share count should make Constellation stock an excellent buy."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-10T08:10:00,3 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Coca-Cola, Visa, and Amazon are all reliable long-term investments in this frothy market.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=67674809ce7016e09a1dd683559dd3e7f66647c567bfde6383118ad78c649626,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/no-brainer-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-now-ko-amzn/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/no-brainer-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-now-ko-amzn/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/no-brainer-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-now-ko-amzn/,fool.com,200,,"Many investors closely track Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A -0.39%) (BRK.B -0.26%) massive equities portfolio, which is currently worth $304 billion, for investment ideas. Those stocks were picked by Warren Buffett, one of the world's most celebrated investors.
But over the past two years, Buffett sold a lot of Berkshire's top stocks, boosted its cash and Treasury holdings to record levels, and stopped buying back shares of the company. Those red flags suggest the market is getting overheated. After all, the S&P 500 is now hovering near record highs and trades at a historically high 31 times earnings.
Still, many of Berkshire's top stocks are solid investments that should continue rising over the long term. So if you can ride out the near-term volatility, I believe these three evergreen Buffett stocks are still worth buying: Coca-Cola (KO -0.71%), Visa (V -0.48%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.54%).
Coca-Cola
Berkshire initially invested in Coca-Cola, the world's largest beverage company, in 1988. Today, that $26.4 billion stake is its fourth-largest holding and accounts for 8.7% of Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett even claims to drink five cans of Coca-Cola every day.
Buffett might love Coca-Cola, but its stock might seem like a risky investment because soda consumption rates are declining across the world. But over the past few decades, it expanded its portfolio with more brands of bottled water, sports drinks, energy drinks, juices, coffee, and even alcoholic beverages to curb its dependence on its sugary carbonated drinks. It also refreshed its classic sodas with new flavors, healthier versions, and smaller serving sizes to attract new customers.
Coca-Cola only sells syrups and concentrates for its drinks, and it relies on its independent bottling partners to produce and distribute the finished beverages. That capital-light model keeps its margins high and generates plenty of cash for its dividends. That's why Coca-Cola is a Dividend King that has raised its payout annually for 63 consecutive years.
From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Coca-Cola's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of nearly 11%. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 21 times next year's earnings, and it should remain a stable evergreen investment regardless of the macroeconomic challenges.
Visa
Berkshire started to invest in Visa in 2011, three years after its public debut. That stake is now worth $2.9 billion and accounts for 1% of its portfolio. Visa owns the world's largest card processing network, but it doesn't actually issue any cards or handle the associated accounts.
Instead, Visa partners with banks and financial institutions to issue co-branded cards. Those partners handle the accounts and shoulder the debt, while Visa generates most of its revenue by charging ""swipe fees"" (2%-3% of a transaction's value, which it shares with the partner bank) as well as other small processing fees every time a card accesses its payment network.
That capital-light ""toll road"" model insulates Visa from credit crunches, but it still fares better in a healthy economy where consumers swipe their cards more frequently. Therefore, economic headwinds can throttle its growth by curbing consumer spending. It's also faced constant pressure from trade groups and regulators to reduce its swipe fees.
But from 2024 to 2027, analysts still expect Visa's EPS to grow at a CAGR of nearly 14%. Its stock isn't too pricey at 28 times next year's earnings, and it should head higher as the macro environment stabilizes and it overcomes its regulatory challenges.
Amazon
Berkshire acquired its first shares of Amazon in 2019, and its $2.2 billion stake now accounts for 0.7% of its portfolio. Amazon is the world's top e-commerce and cloud infrastructure company, and it's also becoming a major advertising company through the digital ads it integrates into its online marketplace and streaming media services.
Amazon generates most of its revenue from its retail business, which has already locked in more than 240 million Prime subscribers worldwide, but it generates most of its profits through its cloud business. That unique business model enables it to subsidize the growth of its lower-margin retail business with its higher-margin cloud revenues.
That's why Amazon can afford to offer steep discounts, free delivery options, cheap hardware devices, streaming media services, and other loss-leading perks to gain more Prime subscribers. Meanwhile, the secular expansion of the AI market is driving more companies to ramp up their spending on its profit-boosting cloud storage and computing services.
From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Amazon's EPS to grow at a CAGR of 19%. Its stock isn't expensive at 29 times next year's earnings, and it should remain one of the simplest ways to profit from the growth of the e-commerce, cloud, and AI markets."

Many of Microsoft’s US data center regions are experiencing shortages of physical space or servers, according to people familiar with the company’s internal forecasts. New subscriptions for Azure cloud services are restricted in some crucial server-farm hubs, including Northern Virginia and Texas, through the first half of next year, said the people who requested anonymity to discuss internal forecasts.
That’s a longer time frame than the company has previously outlined. In July, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said current constraints would continue through the end of 2025. The lack of capacity affects machines running graphics processing units typically used for artificial intelligence as well as data centers dominated by central processing units that have long been the workhorse chips for traditional cloud services, the people said.
Azure is Microsoft’s most important growth engine — the cloud unit generated more than $75 billion during the 2025 fiscal year. Its expansion has outpaced its biggest rivals, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
A lack of servers to rent out to customers has been a recurring concern for cloud providers in recent years. During the last six quarterly earnings calls, Microsoft has said it was unable to meet all of its customers’ cloud demand. Amazon and Google have described similar constraints.
A Microsoft spokesperson said that a majority of Azure services and regions in the US “have available capacity so that existing customers with deployed workloads can continue to grow.” In some cases of unplanned demand spikes, the company will introduce “capacity preservation methods” to balance customer demand across its data center fleet, the spokesperson said.
Azure customers select data-center regions based on physical proximity and what software is available. When a preferred facility lacks space, Microsoft salespeople point customers toward others with capacity, according to internal guidance. But these workarounds can increase complexity and the amount of time it takes data to travel between a server farm and the customer, said people familiar with the work.
In some cases, customers experiencing Azure capacity issues take their business elsewhere, according to Apurva Kadakia, who helps companies set up cloud workloads as global head of cloud and partnerships at Hexaware Technologies. Some tap multiple Azure regions or send only critical workloads to the cloud until more capacity is available, he said.
“Our teams periodically work with large customers to plan around demand spikes, like holiday periods, to guide them to the most appropriate regions” and products, the Microsoft spokesperson said. “In unusual cases where customers face increased cost or latency, Microsoft will compensate them for additional expense.”
Microsoft has been on a historic building spree to get data centers online — adding more than two gigawatts of capacity over the last year, roughly equivalent to the power output of the Hoover Dam.
“It’s been almost impossible to build capacity fast enough since ChatGPT and GPT-4 launched,” Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott said in early October, referring to OpenAI’s popular chatbot and the AI model that runs it. “Even our most ambitious forecasts are just turning out to be insufficient on a regular basis.”
AI’s intense computing demands have fueled much of the need for new data centers. But Microsoft also faces a crunch in demand for its traditional cloud infrastructure, which underpins applications and websites across the internet.
For these CPU-based workloads, OpenAI is Microsoft’s largest customer, according to people familiar with the company’s operations.
Microsoft also uses significant computing resources to host its own workloads and applications such as the Office suite. Some Microsoft employees have been told to close internal projects in impacted regions to save capacity, according to people familiar with the matter.
It can take years to bring a data center online from initial planning to turning the servers on. Several crucial components for data centers, ranging from the semiconductors themselves to electricity infrastructure like transformers, are subject to long delivery times, according to people familiar with the process.
Exceptions can be made for key customers who want additional capacity in Azure regions with supply crunches, the people familiar said. Availability is much better outside the US. For example, many of Microsoft’s European regions can handle new customer subscriptions without restriction.

With major employers such as Amkor, Nestlé, Amazon, and others expanding operations in metro Phoenix, and with population growth soaring, the demand for skilled careers is only expected to rise, particularly in the semiconductor and advanced manufacturing industries.
However, the region faces several challenges in building the talent pipeline needed to meet this demand. The high number of entry-level openings, coupled with an aging workforce approaching retirement, has created a widening skills gap. Compounding the issue is a general lack of awareness about careers in advanced manufacturing, specifically what these jobs entail, the benefits they offer, and the paths to enter them.
Arizona must act now to meet the growing demand for skilled workers. One organization helping to address this challenge is Western Maricopa Education Center, or West-MEC.
West-MEC is a public career and technical education (CTE) district serving more than 45,000 students from 49 high schools across 3,800 square miles in the northern and western Phoenix metro area. Each year, more than 3,000 students receive hands-on, industry-aligned training at West-MEC's four central campuses.
CTE programs are developed in close collaboration with local employers and advisory councils made up of industry professionals. This ongoing feedback loop ensures West-MEC's offerings are responsive to workforce needs, whether by updating curriculum or launching new programs like the Advanced Manufacturing program, which will begin in Fall 2025.
West-MEC equips high school students with a powerful jump-start toward in-demand careers, yet misconceptions persist. A common myth is that CTE students forgo college or are not suited for higher education. In reality, about 70% of West-MEC graduates go on to further their education, while 28% enter the workforce directly out of high school.
For example, students who complete relevant programs at West-MEC could pursue careers with companies like Amkor Technology Arizona in roles such as:
-
Manufacturing operations
-
Facility technicians (HVAC, electrical, mechanical, water, controls)
-
Logistics and warehouse technicians
Every student's path is different; some go to college, others enter the workforce, and many do both. CTE does not limit a student's future; it expands it.
West-MEC has over 30 career training programs in areas such as Auto Tech, Coding, Welding, Nursing, and more. Each program is aligned with local industries to ensure students are learning what an entry-level employee would need to know to excel in their role. Not only are students taught the technical skills required to obtain these roles, but just as importantly, they are learning the professional skills required to keep and progress their careers."

“We are putting this out now because both internal and external customers are like, ‘This thing’s good, let’s go.’”
Quick Suite, which costs $20 per user per month, can integrate with Slack and other tools from close Amazon partner Salesforce Inc., and ingest data from internal databases, social media feeds, as well as Microsoft Corp.’s file storage or Adobe Inc.’s tools for creative professionals and marketers. The software is housed in a web app that can follow users around the internet via a browser plugin.
White said Quick Suite recently rolled out to Amazon employees, who have churned through a series of AI tools in the last few years.
“ChatGPT is great, but, you know, you can’t use it at work,” she said, nodding to the reluctance of many companies to let their workers put sensitive data into unsecured versions of the chatbot.
Plenty of people are anyway, and the largest technology companies have raced to deploy tools capable of competing with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft last week said it would move paid subscribers of its consumer Copilot chatbot into a new tier of its Office suite, an effort to shore up the company’s position with workers who want to bring AI to work. Alphabet Inc.’s Google on Thursday announced the debut of an AI platform called Gemini Enterprise, which is also aimed at everyday workers. The platform will cost a monthly fee of $30 per user, Google said.
Unlike those companies, AWS is a stranger to most laptop-toting workers, and didn’t play a leading role in the introduction of popular AI services. The most successful AWS products are building blocks like file storage and processing power for corporate technology departments and web developers."

It's a massive enterprise that collected $670 billion in net sales in the trailing-12-months, and its market cap sits at an enormous $2.4 trillion.
Despite all the attention Amazon receives, though, these investors might not be tracking all the right data points to gauge the fundamental strength of the company -- and that can lead them astray.
For instance, here's one number Amazon shareholders should definitely be keeping an eye on.
Free cash flow is a critical metric to follow
Free cash flow (FCF) measures the amount of cash a company collects after it covers all operating expenses and pays for capital expenditures. It's essentially what's left over after money goes to running and growing the business. Some might view it as a more accurate indicator of profitability.
Amazon's FCF has soared in recent years. It went from losses in 2021 and 2022 to positive $36.8 billion in 2023 and $38.2 billion in 2024.
Amazon is spending heavily on AI infrastructure
Assessing Amazon's financial success is particularly important, as the company spends a huge amount of capital on artificial intelligence (AI). The hope is that FCF can keep growing, which might indicate signs of positive returns for all those capital outlays made in prior years.
And while the figure grew in the past two years, analysts forecast a notable year-over-year decline in FCF to $23.5 billion this year, likely related to increased investment in AI initiatives. Investors should pay attention to Amazon's FCF going forward, as it will offer real insight into where Amazon's business is going."

The company went public in 1999, raising a record-breaking nearly $5.5 billion at the time, which is still among the largest initial public offerings today.
However, UPS has not fared well in recent years. The company struggled as shipping volume declined following the COVID-19 surge. Then, the sector went through what many experts believed to be a freight recession. At the beginning of the year, UPS surprised many on Wall Street when it announced that it would scale back its partnership with Amazon by about 50%.
Management described the decision as strategic, due to slim margins on the business. But Amazon was UPS' largest customer, so investors did not receive the news well. UPS has also been dealing with the effect of tariffs this year. In the second quarter of the year, UPS continued to see revenue decline. Management did not provide guidance for revenue or operating profits due to ""current macro-economic uncertainty.""
If you'd invested $1,000 in UPS five years ago
Due to these challenges, UPS' stock has been hammered. It's trading down about 30% this year and over 50% in the past five years, which is a tough outcome considering the strength of the broader market.
As you can see above, a $1,000 investment in UPS would only be worth $496 now, while investing in the broader benchmark S&P 500 index would have nearly doubled the $1,000 investment. UPS does have an ultra-high-yielding dividend yield of over 7.5%, but the company clearly has work to do to win back the confidence of investors."

Military and government agencies rely heavily on satellite communication to ensure secure, reliable, and uninterrupted communication in varied operational scenarios, particularly across remote or hostile environments where terrestrial infrastructure is inadequate or nonexistent. Satellite communication provides real-time coordination of military missions, intelligence gathering, and secure transmission of sensitive information across vast distances. It also supports disaster response, border security, and peacekeeping efforts where rapid and dependable communication is critical. The growing complexity of modern warfare and the requirement for global surveillance and reconnaissance fosters further investment in advanced satellite communication services. It makes it an essential factor in national security and defense strategies.
By type, the broadcasting services segment is expected to have the largest market size during the forecast period.
The broadcasting services segment has been particularly impacted by its convergence with technology, as an increasing number of channels and content are offered to draw in new audiences and opportunities for satellite companies through greater vertical integration.

A New E-Commerce Startup Has the Answer — and the Solution
4x6Labels.com aims to provide high-volume shippers with premium thermal labels at industry-low prices
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., October 09, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Why do shipping giants like Amazon, UPS, FedEx, USPS, and DHL all rely on one specific size for their shipping labels?
The answer lies in efficiency, automation, and standardization. The 4x6 label has quietly become the backbone of the global logistics industry — and now, one company is betting everything on it.
Introducing 4x6Labels.com, a newly launched e-commerce website designed exclusively for large-volume shippers seeking the highest-quality 4x6 thermal labels at the most competitive prices online. The Florida-based company was founded with a single focus: to become the most trusted, cost-effective source for 4x6 shipping labels in North America.
""Over the past few years, we’ve seen packaging and shipping costs spiral due to inflation, tariffs, and supply chain instability,"" said Mike Anderson, President of 4x6Labels.com. ""Yet no one has come up with a better way to track and ship packages — the 4x6 thermal label remains the industry’s gold standard. Because it’s used by virtually every major carrier and shipping platform, businesses have little choice but to keep buying it — often at higher prices than they should. We’re changing that.""
Unlike marketplaces that offer hundreds of SKUs and inconsistent quality, 4x6Labels.com is doing just one thing — and doing it better.
The company spent over a year testing dozens of thermal label materials and adhesives to develop what they call the highest-performance label available to high-volume shippers. The result is a durable, jam-free label that’s compatible with virtually every major thermal printer model on the market. And thanks to a direct-to-business model, the pricing undercuts traditional suppliers by a significant margin.
""Labels might not be sexy,"" Anderson added, ""but they matter — especially when you’re shipping thousands of packages a day. We want to be the go-to solution that helps warehouses and fulfillment centers reduce costs without compromising quality.""
Whether you're managing a small fulfillment operation or overseeing logistics for a nationwide retailer, 4x6Labels.com promises a simple, focused solution: no gimmicks, no middlemen, just better labels for less.

Key players like Amazon, Google, and LINE are leveraging Japan's rich digital landscape to localize and enhance consumer offerings.

Japanese Smart Speaker Market
Dublin, Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Japan Smart Speaker Market Trends and Forecast 2025-2033"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The Japan Smart Speaker Market is expected to reach US$ 2.34 billion by 2033 from US$ 442.56 million in 2024, with a CAGR of 20.33% from 2025 to 2033. Urban areas like Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya have the largest smart speaker markets in Japan, thanks to sophisticated infrastructure and tech-savvy consumers. Adoption is slower in rural areas because of poorer digital awareness and less connectivity.
A growing number of tech-savvy consumers who are willing to embrace new, connected devices that improve convenience and home automation, the growing adoption of smart home technologies, and developments in artificial intelligence and natural language processing are some of the major factors propelling the market.
The market for smart speakers in Japan is expanding significantly due to developments in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), which have improved the devices' usability and functionality. As key hubs for managing home automation systems, such as lighting, heating, and security systems, smart speakers are becoming more and more common in Japanese homes. This integration supports Japan's focus on building ""Society 5.0,"" a super-smart society that uses cutting-edge technologies to solve societal issues and boost economic productivity in a variety of spheres of daily life.
Major players like Amazon, Google, and LINE are present in the market and provide devices specifically designed for the Japanese market. For example, in Japan, LINE's Clova Wave smart speaker, which debuted in 2017, was marketed as part of a bundle with Line Music. These businesses have addressed linguistic quirks and cultural preferences by localizing their products to appeal to Japanese consumers. Japan's strong digital infrastructure and government programs to foster smart technologies further encourage the use of smart speakers.
There are also issues, such as worries about data security and privacy dangers related to connected devices, despite the encouraging growth trajectory. Seamless integration is further hampered by the requirement for standardization across many platforms and devices. For the Japanese smart speaker market to continue growing, these problems must be resolved. However, the growing number of tech-savvy consumers and the growing acceptance of smart home technologies point to a bright future for the sector.

Fewer may have noticed, however, that the company's stock has been tanking in 2025.
The stock has fallen sharply since its early pandemic-era highs. A slew of not-so-great news -- from the intent to cut Amazon deliveries to narrowing margins -- has left this stock underperforming the S&P 500 in 2025.
Down about 30% on the year, is UPS stock a bargain, or a hard pass?
The case for optimism
Despite recent troubles, UPS remains one of the most efficient logistics networks in the world. Indeed, one of the reasons to stay optimistic is that UPS is aiming to get even more efficient.
Part of the reason for that is its cost reduction plan. Dubbed ""better, not bigger,"" this plan aims to cut jobs and close warehouses, which could save the transportation giant about $3.5 billion in 2025. In a similar vein, the company is shedding low-margin business like consumer packages in favor of more profitable deliveries like those for healthcare companies and small businesses, which could improve margins over the long run.
Meanwhile, UPS is also investing in automation and data analytics to help it reduce delivery times and costs. Although operating margin has slipped significantly since 2022, these efforts could help it become more profitable over time.
Risks to consider
Although UPS is executing a plan, the near-term picture still looks cloudy.
Average daily package volume in the U.S. has trended downward this year, along with a tighter operating margin. Tariffs have also applied pressure, causing the company to withhold giving guidance about what it expects for all of 2025.
My call
With shares trading around 14 times forward earnings estimates, the stock isn't screaming cheap, but it could be undervalued if its cost reduction plan is successful. Investors looking for growth off a rebound (and a solid dividend; the stock yields over 7% right now) might find it appealing, but those who want stability may want to wait for clearer signs of a turnaround."

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-09T12:15:00,The Body Shop returns to the US market,The beauty company is coming back only through an e-commerce approach after being bought out of U.K. administration in 2024.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=046bbf61427daf26b2377e165a668ab6f62b699c833df4a7812c6b116c614912,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-body-shop-returns-us-market/802483/,https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-body-shop-returns-us-market/802483/,https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-body-shop-returns-us-market/802483/,retaildive.com,200,,"Dive Brief:
- The Body Shop is reentering the U.S. market in October through e-commerce via a dedicated website and an Amazon storefront, per a press release shared with Retail Dive.
- The beauty brand will be selling bath, body, skin care and hair care products, which include previously popular items and plans to extend fragrances.
- The move is part of a “reinvigorated global growth strategy focused on consumer centricity, omnichannel availability and innovation across product and experience,” per the press release.
Dive Insight:
Coming back to the U.S. by prioritizing e-commerce, The Body Shop is taking on a new approach to meeting customers where they are.
“The return of The Body Shop to the U.S. marks a pivotal moment in our global expansion strategy,” The Body Shop Executive Chairman and CEO Mike Jatania said in a statement. “By combining a robust e-commerce presence with a leading marketplace offering, we are meeting customers where they are while delivering on our promise of ethical, high-quality products. This launch will enable us to rebuild connections with loyal U.S. consumers and drive sustainable, long-term growth for our business.”
The Body Shop was bought by a consortium of investors led by Auréa Group in 2024 out of U.K. administration, which is a process similar to bankruptcy in the U.S. The Body Shop’s U.S. arm had separately filed for Chapter 7 liquidation in March 2024, claiming in court that it was given no notice of the U.K. filing and said its U.K.-based parent company took all its cash.
The U.K parent had entered the administration process earlier that year after exploring strategic alternatives. Beauty conglomerate Natura & Co. in 2017 acquired The Body Shop from L’Oréal, but failed to capitalize on the investment despite a rising interest in the cruelty-free and eco-friendly marketing approach The Body Shop took to its merchandise.
Private equity group Aurelius purchased The Body Shop for about $257 million in 2023 from Natura.
Reemphasizing The Body Shop’s “purpose-led beauty, cruelty-free” mission is a core aspect of its return to the U.S. Choosing to do so specifically through e-commerce is meant to help it engage with a wide audience and make itself more accessible.
With the Auréa Group, The Body Shop represents one of its oldest businesses — having been founded in 1976 in Brighton, England — and is part of a portfolio of younger beauty brands including Herbivore Botanicals and DCYPHER."

CHARLESTON, S.C., Oct. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- New research from Omnisend, combining FBI crime data with a consumer survey, found that Americans lost an estimated $15.7 billion from 241 million stolen packages in 2024.
Most stolen packages aren't high-value on their own – the average loss is $65 per package, and 85% are under $100, but the volume of thefts makes the totals add up fast. On the delivery side, stolen packages were reported most frequently from Amazon (72%), followed by UPS (31%), FedEx (30%) and USPS (29%).
When packages go missing, retailers are usually the ones left paying. Around 70% of victims received a refund or replacement and stolen-item refunds alone are estimated at $6.5 billion. Others were offered discounts or store credit (23%), while nearly a quarter (23%) said the retailer refused responsibility.
That experience shapes how consumers shop going forward:
-
44% say they now order online less often
-
27% shift some purchases to lockers or in-store pickup
-
29% buy only from retailers with easy refund policies
""Retailers can't eliminate package theft, but they can minimize future losses by building trust – offering clear refund policies, flexible delivery options, and customer support that reassures shoppers they won't be left on the hook. With Americans already planning to reduce their holiday spending, retailers are particularly vulnerable to theft losses this year,"" says Marty Bauer, Ecommerce Expert at Omnisend.
New York and Hawaii Hit Hard
Three in ten households reported being hit in the past year, but the risk wasn't spread evenly. States like New York (39%) and Hawaii (38%) saw some of the highest share of affected households, while Alabama (5%) and Kentucky (8%) reported the lowest rates.
The frequency of theft also varied dramatically. Nationwide, households averaged 1.9 stolen packages, but in New York (4.9) and Wisconsin (4.6) the problem was more severe. By contrast, states like Oklahoma (0.2) and Maine (0.3) experienced the smallest levels of repeat theft.
""Package theft depends a lot on where you live. In dense states like New York, which dominates our ranking across metrics, repeat theft is far more common because of dense living areas and crowded mailrooms. Meanwhile, in places with more space and tighter-knit neighborhoods, such as Oklahoma, it happens considerably less often. For consumers, that means the risk isn't just about what you buy online, but also where you live and how the packages are delivered,"" says Bauer."

But there's still time to find bargain stocks that are engineering the AI revolution and have massive long-term opportunities. Consider Alphabet (GOOG 2.03%), Amazon (AMZN -0.54%), and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.17%).
1. Alphabet: The world's search engine
Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the largest search engine in the world. But it's a lot more than that, and it's moving AI forward with its Gemini large-language model (LLM) that brings the internet search to a new level. It also offers AI solutions for advertising clients to up their game and achieve greater success, putting more money in Alphabet's pockets, too, and its cloud computing clients benefit from the strength of the LLM in creating their own AI apps.
Companies like Target and Wayfair are using AI through Google Cloud to gather data, personalize the user experience, and improve cybersecurity.
Google has many businesses and varied revenue streams, including devices like smartphones, subscription services like storage, and self-driving cars. Revenue increased 14% year over year in the 2025 second quarter, demonstrating the power of its interconnected platform. But it has a long growth runway as advertisers are just touching the potential in AI-powered campaigns, and cloud users experiment with AI to build better businesses.
It's also highly profitable, and operating income increased 14% over last year with a 32.4% margin.
Despite its robust performance and long-term potential, Alphabet stock trades at a bargain price of 26 times trailing-12-month earnings.
2. Amazon: E-commerce and cloud rolled into one
Amazon is the leader in e-commerce, by far, but it's also tops in cloud computing. That's a combination that's nearly impossible to beat, and both of these industries continue to grow as companies make deeper inroads into these markets and use AI to improve in both spaces.
E-commerce is still less than a fifth of total retail spending in the U.S., but around 40% of that spending goes to Amazon. As e-commerce increases as a percentage of retail sales, Amazon will benefit organically. But the company is not waiting around for that to happen. It's spearheading the shift through its incredible value proposition, especially through the Prime program, which generates loyalty and volume. Fulfillment times keep speeding up, with the percentage of same or next-day deliveries up 30% year over year in the second quarter.
The generative AI business is largely within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud segment, and as of the second quarter, it had a $123 billion run rate. Yet, CEO Andy Jassy thinks it's still in its early innings.
""It's a very unusual opportunity that we're very bullish about,"" he said.
Amazon stock trades at a P/E ratio of 34. That's the highest on this list, but it's below its one, three, and five-year averages.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) produces the chips that make AI possible. When you hear of companies like Nvidia and its peers making chips, it's actually designing the chips and partnering with TSMC to bring them to life. That gives TSMC incredible exposure to AI, and gives investors access to many different AI stocks leading the charge.
TSMC has been around since well before the recent generative AI takeover of technology, and its other categories, like gaming and autonomous vehicles, are still an important part of its business, giving it more stability and protection. But the AI business has become its largest, accounting for 60% of the total, and sales increased 14% year over year in the 2025 fiscal second quarter (ended June 30).
Total revenue increased 44% over last year, and both gross margin and operating margin expanded significantly, to 58.6% and 49.6%, respectively.
To get around tariff issues and generally expand its global reach and cost-efficiency, TSMC is opening an Arizona production location, and the company is well positioned to keep supporting and benefiting from advances in AI.
Taiwan Semiconductor stock trades at a P/E ratio of 33, an attractive entry point for new investors."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-09T10:15:00,What Are the 3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now?,"Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon are three top AI stocks to buy now.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=177c58a37493c9bbd731f7c0b312997e1e50a8aaf150723d6b48cb49388fd12e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/what-are-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/what-are-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/what-are-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-buy/,fool.com,200,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be the biggest theme driving the market today, and for good reason. The technology has the potential to completely reshape the world we are living in, and it is still in the very early days of its development.
Let's look at three AI stocks to buy now.
Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA 0.06%) saw where AI was headed very early in the game, and its decision to give away CUDA for free to universities and research labs paid off big by giving it one of the widest moats in the industry. Developers have built their foundational AI code on Nvidia's software platform, which has effectively locked them into its ecosystem. Even if a rival comes out with a slightly better chip, ripping out years of code and retraining engineers is a nonstarter for most companies, especially when it comes to training large language models (LLMs). That is why Nvidia still controls more than 90% of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market for AI workloads.
The company has also gone far beyond just selling chips. Its proprietary NVLink interconnect allows its GPUs to work as one massive unit, which is a critical edge as AI models get larger and more complex. Now Nvidia has made another big strategic move by investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI. This will give Nvidia insight into where AI models are headed, and the two companies will work together to help shape the future of AI.
CEO Jensen Huang has predicted that data center spending on AI could reach as much as $4 trillion over the next several years, and Nvidia looks positioned better than anyone to capture that spending.
Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.09%) (GOOG 2.03%) is positioning itself to become one of the biggest AI beneficiaries of the next decade. Its Gemini model has progressed rapidly to become one of the leading foundational models. It's helping power both its AI and search efforts, as well as its cloud computing unit.
The company developed a wide moat in search by becoming the default search engine on most devices on the planet. It did this by owning the popular Chrome browser and Android operating system, and then struck a search revenue-sharing deal with Apple. Now, as there is a shift toward AI, Alphabet has incorporated its Gemini model throughout its search platform with both AI Overviews and AI Mode, which lets people easily shift from AI-powered search to an AI chatbot with the click of a mouse. This is leading to more queries and helping the company generate more ad revenue.
Meanwhile, the company's cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, has been growing quickly, and it has an advantage as the only company with a fully integrated AI stack. In addition to its Gemini model, it has taken the lead with custom AI chips that give it cost and performance advantages, while also having leading data analytics and other services.
Meanwhile, longer-term bets like its Waymo robotaxi business and progress in quantum computing could turn into new growth drivers. Combined, all of this makes Alphabet a top AI stock to own.
Amazon
While most people think of Amazon (AMZN -0.54%) as an e-commerce company, behind the scenes, it is a leader in AI and robotics. The company created the cloud computing industry, which today is one of the industries benefiting the most from the AI boom.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is both the company's largest segment by profitability and its fastest-growing. Last quarter, AWS revenue jumped 17.5% to nearly $31 billion, with operating income topping $10 billion. The growth is being fueled by customers looking to use its services and infrastructure to help build and run their AI workloads. On the service front, its Bedrock solution lets customers tap into the top foundation LLMs and customize them, while SageMaker gives them a platform to build and train their own. It has also recently introduced an open-source framework for building AI agents, called Strands, and Agentcore, a secure environment to deploy them at scale. On top of that, Amazon has built its own AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which lower costs for customers and give AWS an efficiency advantage.
Amazon is also embedding AI across its e-commerce business to squeeze out more profits. It already has more than 1 million robots working in its warehouses, which are coordinated by its DeepFleet AI model. Amazon is also using AI to predict where to store items for faster delivery, optimize driver routes, and improve its advertising platform. These changes add up to a better operating margin. Last quarter, North American operating income surged 47% on just an 11% increase in revenue.
Overall, Amazon remains well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI over the next decade."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-09T09:30:51,AI has carried the stock market. Concerns are mounting about a bubble,Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has propelled markets to record highs this year. But the fierce ascent has also raised concerns about a bubble.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2050e4e0d9d6e906e26f1941edbf2faca367285fa2a97113e66d6d481219f555,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/09/investing/us-stock-market-ai-bubble-concerns,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/investing/us-stock-market-ai-bubble-concerns,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/investing/us-stock-market-ai-bubble-concerns,cnn.com,200,,"Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has propelled markets to record highs this year. But the fierce ascent has also raised concerns about a bubble.
AI has been the dominant theme in markets since 2022, when OpenAI first launched ChatGPT. Optimism has since spread among investors about a potential transformative AI boom, and enormous amounts of money have flowed into tech stocks. Valuations have risen to historically expensive levels.
To some analysts and economists, those are red flags that the market might be in a bubble — when investors bid up stock prices beyond what they’re worth, creating an unsustainable rally that often results in a significant downturn, as seen during the dot-com bubble that burst in 2000.
“Fired up by optimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI, global equity prices are surging,” Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech on Wednesday.
“Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” Georgieva said. “If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth.”
Jamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan Chase, said he thinks “AI is real,” but some money being invested now will “probably” be wasted.
“Take AI, there’s a lot of money going into it,” Dimon said in an interview with the BBC. “AI is real, AI in total will pay off. Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off. But most people involved in them didn’t do well.”
Dimon also said he thinks there is a higher chance of a meaningful drop in stocks in the next six months to two years than what is being reflected in the market.
“I am far more worried about that than others,” Dimon said. “I would give it a higher probability than I think is probably priced in the market and by others.”
“The level of uncertainty should be higher in most people’s minds than what I would call normal,” he said, adding that geopolitics and government debt burdens are contributing to the uncertain outlook.
Bubble nerves
Big tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and infrastructure to build out and power AI, and have earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars for more spending.
These companies’ earnings results continue to impress Wall Street, supporting elevated valuations and the rally in stocks.
Yet some investors said there are questions about whether the spending and AI aspirations will eventually generate enough returns to justify the enormous buildout.
Concerns are growing about whether it is sustainable and what the fallout might be if there is a significant drop in stocks.
Concerns about a potential bubble intensified in recent weeks as AI stars like Nvidia and OpenAI announced deals with circular financing that raised eyebrows that the top players might be propping up the market.
The rise in valuations and emergence of circular financing are among aspects that “rhyme with previous bubbles,” according to strategists at Goldman Sachs.
“While it appears we are not in a bubble yet, high levels of market concentration and competition in the AI space suggest investors should continue to focus on diversification,” the strategists said in a note.
Despite concerns, anything related to AI has been in high demand. OpenAI on Monday announced a new deal with chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), sending AMD’s shares soaring almost 24%.
The rally has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble. However, investors said there is a key difference: Big Tech companies now are actually profitable and delivering strong earnings results.
“Unlike the 1990s tech bubble that featured soaring stocks from unprofitable early-stage companies, strong mega-cap company earnings are driving this year’s rally,” Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Asset Management, said in a note.
Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, said the market is signaling “bubble light” territory. He said investor sentiment has not yet reached the levels of exuberance that would signal the market is at peak risk levels.
“Valuations, positioning and flows are all certainly signaling that we’re in bubble light territory, but sentiment has just not got there yet,” Mullaney said. “And so this thing could still run.”
AI’s growing influence on the S&P 500
Big Tech is an increasingly influential part of the S&P 500, which is weighted by companies’ market value. As AI-related stocks have carried the market to record highs, they have also become a more significant part of people’s 401(k) retirement plans.
While the rapid growth of tech stocks lets individual investors and people saving for retirement take part in companies’ gains, it leaves people vulnerable to a potential extended drawdown if a bubble bursts.
Just seven stocks — Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for 55% of the S&P 500’s gains since the end of 2022, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The Bank of England on Wednesday said the risk of a sharp downturn in the stock market has increased.
“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence,” the bank said in a quarterly report.
“This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” the bank said.
1996, 2000 or neither?
In 1996, then-Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan famously asked whether “irrational exuberance” might be taking hold in financial markets.
While Greenspan warned that the stock market could be running too hot on emotion, the dot-com bubble peak did not happen until four years later in 2000.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on September 23 said stocks are “fairly highly valued,” drawing comparisons to his predecessor’s comments 30 years ago.
Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note: “Is the stock market back on the road to the same irrational exuberance that inflated the Tech Bubble of 1999, which was followed by the Tech Wreck of the early 2000s? Perhaps.”
“However, the S&P 500 has been driven to new highs this year by better-than-expected earnings,” Yardeni said. “We are still targeting the S&P 500 to get to 7,700 by the end of next year.”"

Investors are weighing the company's heavy infrastructure spending against its improving profitability in cloud, ads, and retail, trying to figure out if the company's aggressive investments will pay off or weigh on the business. Over the long term, I believe the former will be true.
The company, which operates a global e-commerce marketplace, a leading cloud-computing platform in Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a fast-growing digital advertising business tied to its e-commerce and media properties, offers investors a way to invest in the artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity via an established company with strong competitive advantages.
Here's a close look at the four key aspects of Amazon's business that arguably seal the deal, making the stock worth buying today.
1. Amazon's cloud computing business is a powerhouse
Amazon may be best known for its e-commerce marketplace, but its moneymaker is its cloud computing business, AWS.
In Q2, for instance, AWS contributed more than half of Amazon's total operating income in the period despite representing less than one-fifth of sales. That mix of scale and profitability gives Amazon options. And options are important at a time when the company needs to fund new AI services and continue building fulfillment centers while remaining financially disciplined.
Specifically, second-quarter AWS revenue rose 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion. The segment's operating income came in at $10.2 billion, or 53% of Amazon's total operating income.
For a company of AWS's size, high-teens growth and an operating margin of 33% from the company's most important business segment are a powerful combination, providing the financial backbone for broader company investments.
2. Advertising is gaining scale
Advertising services have become a second profit pillar. In the same quarter, advertising revenue increased 23% year over year to $15.7 billion. That growth rate notably outpaced the company's overall revenue and largely reflects sponsored products ads. And given that advertising is a higher-margin business than retail sales, this fast-growing business should be very beneficial to the company's bottom line over time.
3. A healthy balance sheet
Amazon's financial strength gives it room to keep investing while weathering macro volatility. As of the end of its second quarter, the company held $93.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities -- well in excess of its $50.7 billion of long-term debt. That net cash position, combined with trailing-twelve-month operating cash flow of $121.1 billion, supports heavy spending on further AI investments and logistics without straining the balance
4. Prime deepens customer loyalty
Meanwhile, Amazon's Prime customer membership remains a cornerstone of its business ecosystem. While the company doesn't regularly disclose member counts, investors can track ""subscription services"" revenue -- which includes Prime membership fees along with digital content subscriptions. In the second quarter, subscription services rose 12% year over year to $12.2 billion. Steady growth here suggests Prime continues to attract and retain members, reinforcing high-frequency shopping behavior and creating a captive audience for advertising, Prime Video, and other services.
Prime, which currently costs about $15 per month or $139 on an annual basis in the U.S., bundles fast shipping, exclusive deals, and entertainment, helping keep customers engaged across Amazon's properties. That engagement, in turn, helps support other Amazon segments like third-party seller services and advertising demand, creating a reinforcing flywheel that contributes to revenue diversity and resilience.
Pulling these pieces together -- high-margin revenue from AWS and advertising, a healthy balance sheet, and a sticky Prime ecosystem -- Amazon's diversified set of growth drivers combine to make the business's overall growth profile more resilient.
Of course, shares aren't cheap. But that makes sense for a business like this. Shares currently trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 34. Of course, if AWS and advertising continue to grow faster than the overall business, and if AI investments pay off handsomely over the haul, this valuation could look cheap in hindsight.
There are some key risks to consider, including the possibility of a weak macroeconomic environment. This could negatively impact its e-commerce business, AWS, and advertising. It's also worth noting that competition in both cloud and digital ads remains intense. Finally, heavy capital spending for AI infrastructure could take longer than expected to yield returns.
But with two high-margin growth engines and significant financial flexibility, Amazon offers a compelling way for investors to participate in secular trends in cloud computing, AI, and digital advertising -- all while Prime keeps customers coming back. Overall, the stock looks like a buy."

That means investors who don't own these powerhouse stocks have probably underperformed the broader market over the last few years, but I have some good news: There's a simple way to buy them all right now.
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK 0.70%) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests exclusively in America's largest companies, and a whopping 59.3% of the value of its entire portfolio is parked in the Magnificent Seven stocks alone.
The Magnificent Seven, with a splash of diversification
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index, which covers 70% of the market capitalization of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index. That means if we ranked all 3,508 companies in the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index by size, from the largest to the smallest, the Mega Cap Growth Index would start at the top and work its way down the list until it captured 70% of its total value.
The Vanguard ETF holds just 69 stocks, which shows the U.S. corporate sector is extremely concentrated. To put it another way, just 69 companies represent 70% of the value of all 3,508 companies listed on American stock exchanges. That leaves the remaining 3,439 companies accounting for the other 30%.
Since the Magnificent Seven stocks have a combined value of $20.7 trillion, it's no surprise they collectively have such a dominant weighting in the Vanguard ETF.

Nvidia supplies the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are the main chips used in AI development. Demand is outstripping supply for the company's latest Blackwell Ultra chips, which could fuel significant revenue growth from here.
Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are three of Nvidia's biggest customers. They each develop AI models and software for their own purposes, but they also operate cloud platforms where they rent data center capacity to businesses that use it to deploy their own AI projects.
Social media giant Meta Platforms is another one of Nvidia's top customers. It integrated AI into its content recommendation engine to keep users on Facebook and Instagram for longer periods of time, but it also developed the world's most popular family of open-source large language models (LLMs) called Llama, which power new features like Meta AI.
Apple launched its Apple Intelligence software last year, introducing powerful new AI features for its iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. With 2.35 billion active devices worldwide, this company could be one of the biggest distributors of AI software to consumers. Then there is Tesla, which is a leading developer of AI-powered autonomous driving and robotics technologies.
Despite its substantial exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks, the Vanguard ETF does offer a splash of diversification. Non-technology megacap stocks like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco Wholesale, and McDonald's are among its top 20 holdings.
The Vanguard ETF can help investors accelerate their returns
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 13.8% since its inception in 2007, and an accelerated annual return of 18.9% over the last 10 years, specifically. However, given its high degree of portfolio concentration, investors shouldn't put all of their eggs into this ETF alone.
Instead, the fund could be an ideal addition to any diversified portfolio that has little or no exposure to the Magnificent Seven already. Let's say, for instance, an investor parked $20,000 in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF 10 years ago, which is arguably the most diversified fund money can buy because it holds 3,500 stocks. That $20,000 would have grown to around $78,825 today.
However, had the investor split the $20,000 by placing $10,000 in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the other $10,000 in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, they would be sitting on $95,882 today instead.
This approach aims to ensure that investors aren't overexposed to volatile trends like AI, helping to protect them against steep losses if the technology fails to live up to expectations in the long run."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-09T07:02:00,"Prediction: This Unstoppable Stock Will Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet in the $3 Trillion Club Before 2028",A trio of growth drivers and a long history of strong execution will secure this company's membership in an elite fraternity.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a412dfb1e0e0752a5e43b564cfb69316e86d64cb6100d6a38e0d4f098cef868c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-this-unstoppable-stock-will-join-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-this-unstoppable-stock-will-join-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-this-unstoppable-stock-will-join-nvidia/,fool.com,200,,"The U.S. economy has undergone a paradigm shift over the past two decades. In 2005, the two largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., when measured by market cap, were energy giant ExxonMobil at $392 billion and industrial bellwether General Electric worth $375 billion. Now, just 20 years later, technology companies spearheading advances in artificial intelligence (AI) rule the roost.
Four household names top the list. AI chipmaker Nvidia is the frontrunner at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), regularly climbing to new heights. Cloud and software provider Microsoft takes up second place, worth $3.9 trillion. iPhone maker Apple is nipping at Microsoft's heels at $3.8 trillion, and search pioneer Alphabet rounds out the top four at $3 trillion.
With a market cap of nearly $2.4 trillion, it seems almost a foregone conclusion that Amazon (AMZN -0.60%) will soon join the fold. The company has numerous growth drivers that continue to defy detractors, and the vast opportunity represented by AI will likely take the company over the finish line into the $3 trillion club.
A rare triple threat
What sets Amazon apart from the competition is its triad of successful businesses. While it's impressive for a company to have even one industry-leading business, Amazon has two and a third that's a strong contender in its field.
First up is Amazon's flagship e-commerce platform. The company made its fortune as a pioneer in the nascent e-commerce space in 1994, before ultimately earning the moniker of ""Everything Store"" and becoming the world's largest online retailer. Amazon is also the world's second-largest retailer, behind just Walmart.
Results from the second quarter help illustrate the overall magnitude of the company's success. Net sales of $167.7 billion increased 13% year over year, with 61% of the topline coming from digital retail or third-party seller services. This fueled net income of $18.2 billion, up 35%.
Amazon's second industry-leading business -- and by far its most important segment -- is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud infrastructure services business. AWS provides on-demand computing solutions, software applications, AI, and more.
The company continues to dominate the space it pioneered in 2002, with an estimated 30% of the market, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, with 20% and 13%, respectively, according to Statista. Furthermore, the cloud segment continues to grow at a respectable clip, up 17% year over year in the second quarter. AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income for the first six months of 2025, helping to fund the company's other growth initiatives.
Last but certainly not least is Amazon's fast-growing advertising business, which is fueled by its valuable product search, as well as Amazon Prime Video, live sports programming, Fire TV, and the company's live-streaming gaming platform, Twitch. Advertising revenue of $15.7 billion increased 23% year-over-year in the second quarter, accounting for 9% of total revenue. These statistics place Amazon third in the race for digital advertising dominance, behind only Google and Meta Platforms.
If that trio of successful businesses wasn't enough, Amazon is also one of the foremost authorities on AI, with more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already available for its cloud customers, and plans to offer many more. ""AI will be a substantial catalyst,"" according to CEO Andy Jassy.
The path to $3 trillion
Amazon has a market cap of roughly $2.35 trillion (as of this writing), so its stock price will only need to increase by roughly 27% to reach $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $902 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.
Wall Street is currently predicting Amazon's growth will clock in at roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. However, given its history of strong execution, that target us likely conservative and I predict the company will make the grade sooner.
Finally, at 34 times earnings, Amazon trades at a premium compared to a multiple of 31 for the S&P 500. That said, the company has delivered stock price gains of 712% over the past decade, far exceeding the 239% gains S&P 500. This helps illustrate why Amazon represents a compelling opportunity as it marches toward $3 trillion."

A business making money today isn’t necessarily a winner, which is why we analyze companies across multiple dimensions at StockStory. Keeping that in mind, here is one profitable company that leverages its financial strength to beat the competition and two best left off your watchlist.
Two Stocks to Sell:
Cushman & Wakefield (CWK)
Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 4.3%
With expertise in the commercial real estate sector, Cushman & Wakefield (NYSE:CWK) is a global Chicago-based real estate firm offering a comprehensive range of services to clients.
Why Are We Out on CWK?
-
Sales stagnated over the last two years and signal the need for new growth strategies
-
Performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were much less profitable, as its earnings per share fell by 4.3% annually
-
Low free cash flow margin of 1.9% for the last two years gives it little breathing room, constraining its ability to self-fund growth or return capital to shareholders
At $14.86 per share, Cushman & Wakefield trades at 11.7x forward P/E. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than CWK.
Radian Group (RDN)
Trailing 12-Month GAAP Operating Margin: 58.2%
Founded during the housing boom of 1977 and weathering multiple real estate cycles since, Radian Group (NYSE:RDN) provides mortgage insurance and real estate services, helping lenders manage risk and homebuyers achieve affordable homeownership.
Why Do We Think Twice About RDN?
-
Net premiums earned contracted by 3% annually over the last five years, showing unfavorable market dynamics this cycle
-
Day-to-day expenses have swelled relative to revenue over the last two years as its combined ratio increased by 23.4 percentage points
-
Earnings per share fell by 1.5% annually over the last two years while its revenue grew, showing its incremental sales were much less profitable
Radian Group’s stock price of $34.38 implies a valuation ratio of 1x forward P/B. To fully understand why you should be careful with RDN, check out our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).

It has since planted its flag in the U.S. and is clearly determined to be a major, Amazon-ish player in our market. Investors are clearly starting to notice this and place bets on the company's success. After all, its stock rose a very heartening 12%-plus over the course of September.
Positive notices
Coupang isn't only drawing attention from the investing public; analysts are becoming bullish on the company too.
In the middle of the month, Arete's Shawn Yang initiated coverage of the stock with a confident buy recommendation at a price target of $40 per share.
According to reports, Yang pointed out in a research note that Coupang was highly successful in its original home market of South Korea. In his view, management is capable of replicating this in the far larger and more competitive U.S. Meanwhile, the company has prioritized growth in the broader Asian market, and looks poised to do well leveraging the elements that made it powerful in Korea.
Coupang sure hasn't been shy about raising its profile in the U.S. During the month, it announced an international partnership with Lemme, a vitamin and supplement purveyor cofounded by Kourtney Kardashian Barker. The deal will see it introduce Lemme to the Korean market, in the brand's first expansion to the Asian country.
Also, at the start of September, Coupang announced a multiyear advertising partnership with the National Hockey League's (NHL) Washington Capitals. This will see the e-commerce company's name and logo placed on Capitals home and third jerseys, starting with the current season.
Of course, the Capitals and Kardashian on their own won't make Coupang an instantly familiar name in American households. The deals show determination to make a mark here, however, and as the company grows, we can expect more such tie-ups with increasingly higher prominence.
Major ambitions
Similarly, Coupang won't be a serious threat to Amazon in the coming months, or even years. However, with the juicy U.S. market in front of it, double-digit growth seems to be in the cards for the company.
The clutch of analysts tracking Coupang stock are collectively modeling revenue growth just shy of 15% for this year over 2024. That rate should be more or less maintained the following year, with a further 16% improvement. Despite the considerable spend facing the e-tailer with its U.S. push, it's expected to land in the black on the bottom line, both this year and next."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-08T21:45:06,Amazon (AMZN) Laps the Stock Market: Here's Why,"Amazon (AMZN) closed at $225.22 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.55% move from the prior day.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=fcbce8d91313e926ac433c0fd53a9fb9daa2cad6939f626e39c046dc5df7a375,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-amzn-laps-stock-market-214506545.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-amzn-laps-stock-market-214506545.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-amzn-laps-stock-market-214506545.html,yahoo.com,200,,"In the latest close session, Amazon (AMZN) was up +1.55% at $225.22. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.58%.
Coming into today, shares of the online retailer had lost 6.91% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 2.75%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.68%.
Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Amazon in its upcoming release. On that day, Amazon is projected to report earnings of $1.57 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 9.79%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $177.93 billion, up 11.99% from the year-ago period.
AMZN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.76 per share and revenue of $707.4 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +22.24% and +10.89%, respectively.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the business and profitability.
Our research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.36% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. As of now, Amazon holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Digging into valuation, Amazon currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 32.82. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 21.43 for its industry.
Investors should also note that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.48 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.46 based on yesterday's closing prices.
The Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 59, this industry ranks in the top 24% of all industries, numbering over 250.
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1."

Officials at the Bank of England on Wednesday flagged the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst.
“The risk of a sharp market correction has increased,” the U.K. central bank said.
The head of the International Monetary Fund raised a similar alarm hours after the Bank of England’s report.
Global stock prices have been surging, fired up by “optimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.
But financial conditions could “turn abruptly,” she warned in a speech ahead of the organization’s annual meeting next week in Washington.
Is there an AI bubble?
“Bubbles obviously are never very easy to identify, but we can see there are a few potential symptoms of a bubble in the current situation,” said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics.
Those symptoms include rapid growth in tech stock prices, the fact that tech stocks now comprise about 40% of the S&P 500, market valuations that appear “stretched” beyond their worth and “a general sense of extreme optimism in terms of the underlying technology, despite the enormous uncertainties around what this technology might ultimately yield,” Slater said.
The most optimistic projections about the fruits of generative AI products foresee a transformation of the economy, leading to annual productivity gains that Slater says have not been seen since the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. At the lower end, economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has predicted a “nontrivial but modest” U.S. productivity gain of just 0.7% over a decade.
“You’ve got this incredibly wide range of possibilities,” Slater said. “Nobody really knows where it’s going to land.”
Doubts about the worth of top AI companies
Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and the companies building the costly computer chips and data centers needed to power these AI products.

In a new note, the firm called the artificial intelligence leader “the biggest case yet of Silicon Valley’s vaunted fake it ’till you make it ethos.”
“AI is a game of kings, and OpenAI knows it,” DA Davidson said, adding that the “staggering amount of compute required to build increasingly powerful frontier models” means that only a handful of companies, “MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META and Elon Inc,” can afford to compete.
According to the firm, “OpenAI has the lead with the top frontier model and the top AI chat app, and is trying to leverage that lead to become an instant mega cap.”
But its dominance “is still somewhat tenuous,” as “Google has made significant strides,” while “Anthropic is state-of-the-art for programming,” and “Meta and Elon are deploying tens of billions to catch up.”
DA Davidson said OpenAI is “likely at a $16bn revenue run rate” but “losing around $10bn this year.” Despite that, it “has embarked on its ambitious attempt to fake it ‘till you make it,” with “commitments now exceeding $500bn.”
“This is working so far,” the firm said, citing “the recent release of Sora 2,” which “represents a breakthrough in democratizing video generation.”
The firm concluded, “We prefer core AI winners MSFT and NVDA,” saying that “even if OpenAI does not ultimately succeed in becoming an instant mega cap, NVDA will have plenty of demand for its chips and MSFT will have plenty of AI customers.”

Santa Clara, Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SANTA CLARA, CA October 08, 2025 - -
As leading technology companies increasingly integrate behavioral assessments into their hiring processes, Interview Kickstart has announced an update to its Technical Interview Preparation program to align with Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles—an influential framework shaping hiring decisions across the global tech industry. To learn more about the course, visit: https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/fast-track-your-interview-prep
Over the past decade, Amazon's Leadership Principles—such as Customer Obsession, Ownership, Invent and Simplify, and Deliver Results—have set the standard for evaluating leadership potential and decision-making in high-performance environments. Today, many companies, from startups to major enterprises, are adopting similar competency-based frameworks to assess cultural and professional alignment.
""Technical proficiency alone isn't enough to secure positions at companies like Amazon,"" explained an Interview Kickstart spokesperson. ""Their renowned Leadership Principles form the backbone of their hiring process and workplace culture. Our enhanced curriculum now equips candidates with strategies to effectively demonstrate these principles during behavioral interviews while maintaining our focus on technical excellence.""
The update comes as demand for holistic interview preparation grows. According to a 2024 LinkedIn Workforce Report, 78% of employers in technology sectors now consider behavioral and cultural fit as important as technical skills when hiring. Interview Kickstart's revised program aims to help candidates respond to this trend with a structured, data-driven preparation methodology.
Developed by former Amazon hiring managers and FAANG+ interviewers, the updated curriculum provides practical frameworks for articulating real-world experiences that align with Amazon's Leadership Principles. Through dedicated behavioral interview modules, participants learn to identify which principles best reflect their strengths and to apply the STAR method—Situation, Task, Action, and Result—to craft impactful, structured responses.
""Behavioral interviews at Amazon aren't abstract personality tests—they're evidence-based assessments of past performance,"" said the spokesperson. ""We've designed this course to help professionals connect their technical achievements to these core principles, presenting a unified story of capability and leadership."""

The new in-office kiosks, which are operated by Amazon Pharmacy, let patients pick up their prescriptions immediately after their appointment.
Amazon Pharmacy Kiosks will be available at One Medical locations in Los Angeles starting in December, and Amazon plans to expand to more locations soon after.
After a provider writes a prescription, patients can choose to have it sent to Amazon Pharmacy for in-office kiosk pickup. Patients then use their phone to check out in the Amazon app, after which medications are typically “ready in minutes,” Amazon says.
The kiosks have a range of commonly prescribed medications, including antibiotics, inhalers, and blood pressure medications. Amazon notes that each kiosk’s inventory is customized based on the prescribing patterns of its specific office location, and that controlled substances and medications requiring refrigeration are not available through the kiosks.
Patients will be able to use the Amazon app to see upfront costs, including available discounts and estimated insurance copays, and connect to a licensed pharmacist via video or phone consultation if needed.
“We know that when patients have to make an extra trip to the pharmacy after seeing their doctor, many prescriptions never get filled,” said Hannah McClellan, vice president of operations at Amazon Pharmacy, in a press release.
U.S. pharmacy chains are struggling; Rite Aid last week closed all of its remaining stores; CVS has closed more than 1,000 stores since 2021; and Walgreens closed 500 stores over the past year.
Amazon’s new kiosks could disrupt brick-and-mortar pharmacy businesses even more.
The launch of the kiosks marks Amazon’s latest move to expand its presence in the healthcare sector. In 2018, Amazon purchased online pharmacy PillPack for $750 million and then launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020. Two year later, it bought primary care provider One Medical."

DLO’s trailing and forward P/E were 30.23 and 20.28 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
DLocal (DLO) has emerged as a standout fintech in the high-growth emerging markets payments space, positioning itself as critical infrastructure for global companies like Amazon, Nike, and Spotify. The company’s single API seamlessly connects clients to dozens of fragmented local systems, including cards, wallets, cash, and bank transfers, while handling complex compliance and regulatory requirements across 40+ countries.
This regulatory moat, combined with established local partnerships and licenses, creates significant barriers to entry and ensures strong client stickiness, as switching away from DLO would be costly and time-consuming.The company reported a strong Q2 2025, with total payment volume (TPV) of $9.2 billion, up 53% year-over-year, revenue of $256.5 million, up 50%, and adjusted EBITDA of $70.1 million, up 64%. Free cash flow surged 156% YoY to $48.4 million, while gross profit grew 42%. Net income fell 7% due to a one-time FX impact from Argentina, which DLO has since mitigated by reducing peso exposure. Following the quarter, guidance was raised, with TPV expected to grow 40–50%, revenue 30–40%, and EBITDA 40–50% for FY25.
DLO is further strengthening its position through the acquisition of AZA Finance, expanding operations into 17 additional African countries and enhancing treasury, FX management, and stablecoin capabilities. This mitigates currency risk and turns FX exposure into a competitive advantage. With a market cap around $4 billion and a forward P/E of 16, DLO trades like a distressed company despite its 50%+ revenue and TPV growth. Even in conservative scenarios, shares offer significant upside, with modest re-rates potentially reaching $25–28 and aggressive growth cases $32–36. Overall, DLO combines robust growth, high barriers to entry, and a strategic expansion plan, making it a compelling investment in the emerging markets fintech landscape.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on DLocal Limited (DLO) by Ray Myers in May 2025, which highlighted strong revenue growth, expanding client base, and geographic diversification in emerging markets. The stock has appreciated approximately 26.6% since then, as DLO continued delivering robust results. Ok_Neat9473 shares a similar view but emphasizes Q2 2025 performance, the AZA Finance acquisition, and FX risk mitigation, reinforcing DLO’s growth and strategic positioning."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Amazon said on Wednesday its pharmacy business in December will begin filling some prescriptions for common medications at electronic kiosks in its One Medical primary care locations, which the company says will reduce barriers to access and limit shipping costs.
Amazon plans to start the offer with One Medical patients in Los Angeles for drugs including antibiotics, asthma inhalers and treatments for high blood pressure, the company said.
The kiosks will be the first in-person pick-up service offered by Amazon Pharmacy, which has been providing prescription services primarily by delivery, said Hannah McClellan Richards, a vice president at Amazon Pharmacy.
One Medical offers a membership structure that allows patients to access primary and urgent care at a subscription fee of $199 annually. Patients without a membership are still able to book an appointment and would be able to use the kiosk, the company said.
Richards said in an interview that the company plans to expand the kiosk model outside of California in 2026 and is in talks with external health systems to introduce the machines through partnerships.
Amazon does not plan to offer medicines that must be refrigerated, such as GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, or more tightly regulated prescriptions like controlled pain medicines through the kiosk.
Inventory for each kiosk will be tailored to the provider, and patients would be able to consult a company pharmacist virtually, Amazon said in a press release.
Amazon.com, the $2.34 trillion e-commerce company, launched pharmaceutical delivery in 2018 through its acquisition of PillPack. In 2023, the company purchased One Medical, a national primary care provider.
Analysts this year have flagged shipping and logistical costs as a potential squeeze on Amazon's profits.
Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky, in a second-quarter earnings call, said the company planned to make strategic decisions on product placement in an effort to shorten delivery routes and improve availability. ""We're committed to initiatives that further improve our cost structure,"" he said at the time.
Richards acknowledged that the most expensive part of the e-commerce supply chain is shipping.
""If you put inventory closer to customers,"" she said, ""your shipping costs go way down and your demand goes way up.""

India's digital payment transaction volumes surged 35% in fiscal 2025, with digital payment preferences for offline purchases climbing from 48% to 56% within a single year. The market is projected to reach $7 trillion by 2030, creating substantial opportunities for early movers who can establish dominant positions.
The new ""UPI Circle"" feature enables families in India to manage UPI payments jointly. Primary account holders can add family members with preset spending limits, while maintaining full control over transactions. The service particularly targets digitally-savvy household managers and digital-native teenagers without individual banking access, potentially expanding the addressable market significantly.
The expansion of payment capabilities to smartwatches and wearables through partnerships with NPCI demonstrates Amazon's commitment to ecosystem integration. However, similar features are being developed by competitors, potentially neutralizing any first-mover advantages. The company's rewards ecosystem, offering 5% assured cashback upon meeting monthly transaction milestones, mirrors promotional strategies already employed throughout the industry.
While the parent company experienced strong growth, the Amazon Pay India segment reported a 7% revenue drop for the 2024-2025 fiscal year.
The company’s ability to convert payment users into higher-margin Amazon Prime subscribers and frequent shoppers will ultimately determine the success of this fintech expansion. While the infrastructure investments and partnerships demonstrate commitment, the path to profitability in India's intensely competitive payments market remains uncertain.
How Rivals Compare in Integrated Payment Ecosystems
PayPal PYPL maintains dominant positions in digital wallets and checkout solutions across multiple markets, with its Venmo platform successfully targeting younger demographics through social payment features. PayPal's established infrastructure and regulatory compliance across numerous countries provide advantages that Amazon Pay must replicate market by market.
Block Inc. XYZ, formerly Square, has built its ecosystem around small business merchant services while expanding into consumer banking through Cash App. Block's approach to embedded finance within commerce platforms mirrors Amazon's strategy, though Block focuses more heavily on cryptocurrency integration and buy-now-pay-later offerings.
Both PayPal and Block derive substantially higher revenue percentages from payment processing compared to Amazon, making their fintech operations more central to investment theses than Amazon's diversified model."

Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) stands out as a speculative yet compelling beneficiary of the ongoing data center buildout, which shows no sign of slowing until lenders or hyperscalers curb spending. With U.S. data center construction projected at 10GW annually through 2030, demand for optical transceivers is set to surge, supporting AAOI’s growth trajectory. The company manufactures transceivers critical for converting fiber optic to electronic signals, a market expected to expand from $15 billion today to $35 billion by 2029.
AAOI has been approved as a supplier for at least three hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, and likely Amazon, with SEC filings confirming Amazon holds warrants tied to a potential $4 billion supply agreement. While not yet firm orders, early shipments are already driving performance, with Q2 revenue up 139% year-over-year and trailing twelve-month revenue up 77%. Current quarterly sales of $103 million are projected to rise another 12–23% in the near term.
AAOI’s past failures, including quality issues in 2018 that collapsed its stock from $70 to $2, still weigh on investor sentiment, explaining its high options volatility and cautious valuation. Yet management’s insider buying and growing hyperscaler ties indicate confidence in execution. If AAOI merely maintains its current 2% market share, revenues could surpass $1 billion by 2029, implying a modest doubling of market cap.
However, if it regains a 5% share, revenues could approach $2.5 billion, implying a market value near $9 billion and a stock price above $140, versus today’s $26. The key risks remain quality execution and sustainability of hyperscaler investment, but with hyperscalers generating $400 billion in annual operating cash flow and competing aggressively, the buildout appears durable. This sets AAOI up as a high-risk, high-reward play with asymmetric upside if market share expansion materializes.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Fabrinet (FN) by Industrial Tech Stock Analyst in April 2025, which highlighted the Amazon warrant deal as a strategic validation of Fabrinet’s role in hyperscaler supply chains and a catalyst for long-term growth.

Last month, Amazon Music unveiled a multi-layered collaboration with global Puerto Rican superstar—and outspoken political voice—Bad Bunny, designed to spotlight Puerto Rico on a “global stage while delivering lasting community impact.”
Through the partnership, Amazon’s music division streamed Bad Bunny’s Puerto Rico residency—which generated an estimated $200 million in direct economic impact from its 31-show run, according to Discover Puerto Rico—across Amazon Music, Prime Video and Twitch. While exact figures have yet to be released, Amazon said the show marked its most-watched single-artist performance to date.
The two forces also curated a range of initiatives spanning education, disaster relief and cultural empowerment. These include programs to expand access to technology and STEM education for students and teachers, as well as efforts to support farmers and improve access to fresh produce across the island.
“Bad Bunny embodies the spirit and ambition of Puerto Rico. His vision for uplifting Puerto Rican entrepreneurs aligns perfectly with Amazon’s mission to enable small businesses to reach global markets while maintaining their local identity,” Rocío Guerrero, director of music, Latin-Iberia, Amazon Music, told Sourcing Journal. “From the beginning, our goal was to elevate the artist’s mission, and Benito’s desire to take Puerto Rico to the world resonated deeply with us.”
One of the most notable elements of the partnership, though, is its focus on economic development.
Through a curated storefront on Amazon.com called “comPRa Local,” (Buy Local) Amazon and Bad Bunny are spotlighting Puerto Rican products, authors, musicians and everyday goods under a new “Hecho en PR” (Made in PR) badge—an initiative designed to give Puerto Rican-owned businesses global visibility.
“Our [‘comPRa Local’] initiative [which will be fully functional by Christmas] extends far beyond the initial launch,” Guerrero said. “We’re creating a sustainable platform for Puerto Rican businesses to thrive on the global stage. Success for us means seeing Puerto Rican products reaching new audiences, local businesses growing and the ‘Hecho en PR’ badge becoming a recognized symbol of quality and cultural richness. This initiative is about building lasting economic infrastructure that benefits Puerto Rican communities while sharing their unique products with the world.”
Although the world’s largest e-commerce platform and one of Puerto Rico’s most influential cultural figures are now backing “Made in PR,” can the initiative actually move beyond symbolism and translate into sustainable supply chain growth for the island?
According to Robert Khachatryan, CEO and founder of global freight forwarding and technology company Freight Right, Puerto Rico does have the foundation to become a regional manufacturing hub—but it will require strategic expansion beyond its existing industrial strengths.
Today, Puerto Rico is already a major hub for pharmaceuticals and medical research, serving as a cornerstone of U.S. imports and exports in the sector. In fact, for more than 50 years, the island—often referred to as the “Medicine Cabinet of the U.S.”—has been home to four of the world’s top 10 pharmaceutical companies. Adding to its impact, it contributes more than $50 billion in annual pharmaceutical exports, supplying critical medications to both domestic and international markets, according to PharmaBoardroom.
Khachatryan noted that because the infrastructure to move goods in, out of and around Puerto Rico is already in place, scaling that success into other industries would primarily require targeted adjustments and modernization.
However, he said there are “three key challenges” Puerto Rico must address if it hopes to sustainably expand its manufacturing capabilities.
The first challenge stems from the Jones Act, a 1920 maritime law intended to protect U.S. shipping interests but one that still limits Puerto Rico’s freedom to trade efficiently. Under the act, all goods moving between U.S. ports must be transported on vessels that are U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged and U.S.-crewed—conditions that make logistics costlier and less flexible for the island.
“Coastwise shipments must use U.S.-built, flagged and crewed vessels—a long-standing constraint that many economists say raises costs for the island,” Khachatryan said. “In other words, while Puerto Rico is geographically close to the U.S., the cost of moving goods between the two is, for now, higher than most people realize.”
The second hurdle lies in the island’s power grid, where years of hurricane damage have shaped lingering doubts about reliability, perceptions that Khachatryan says continue to weigh on investor confidence.
“While the grid is actually more resilient today than it’s ever been since the major storms of recent years, the belief remains that it’s fragile,” Khachatryan noted.
Lastly, outside of regulated sectors like pharmaceuticals, smaller producers often struggle to meet the operational standards required to scale. Issues like quality assurance, packaging, barcoding and retailer compliance mirror the growing pains many micro- and small-sized businesses face when entering major marketplaces.
“Energy is expensive, shipping options are limited and the island relies heavily on air and sea freight, making delivery times slow and unpredictable,” said Marty Bauer, director of partnerships and e-commerce expert at marketing automation platform Omnisend, echoing Khachatryan’s sentiment.
Despite these challenges, Khachatryan said that because the “Made in PR” initiative is being championed by Amazon, the company has the ability to leverage its own logistics infrastructure to help offset many of these barriers for Puerto Rican sellers—like it does for vendors around the world.
“Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), Buy with Prime and Seller programs standardize everything from labeling and advance shipment notices (ASN) to returns and service level agreement (SLA) expectations,” Khachatryan said. “Puerto Rico–based sellers can tap into Amazon’s global network. That said, a localized last-mile investment could improve delivery speed on the island, though it’s not yet a full FBA node.”
While both Bauer and Khachatryan acknowledged that “Made in PR” has a long way to go before it can rival manufacturing powerhouses like Mexico or Italy, they noted that Puerto Rico’s unique status as a U.S. territory gives it a distinct advantage—and the potential to scale more quickly than many emerging markets.
“Legally, products made in U.S. territories may qualify for ‘Made in USA’ labeling if they meet the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) ‘all or virtually all’ standard, which includes U.S. territories,” Khachatryan said. “That gives ‘Hecho en PR’ substance beyond a marketing tagline when used alongside compliant ‘Made in USA’ claims. Over time, consistent product quality and strong seller reviews could help the badge carry the same credibility as other respected origin marks like ‘Made in Italy’.”
Stance against Donald Trump
Since Donald Trump took office earlier this year, Bad Bunny has been outspoken in his criticism of the president’s immigration policies and his administration’s failure to adequately support Puerto Rico (echoing frustrations that date back to the federal government’s delayed hurricane relief efforts following Hurricane Maria in 2017, one of the deadliest U.S. natural disasters in more than a century, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).
That criticism recently resurfaced in the music video for “NUEVAYoL,” a track from his sixth solo studio album, DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS (“I Should Have Taken More Photos”).
In one scene, a group of men stand around a radio as a voice mimicking Trump says, “I made a mistake. I want to apologize to the immigrants in America. I mean, the United States. I know America is the whole continent.”
The voice continues: “I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants. This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans.”
The video closes with archival-style shots of the Puerto Rican diaspora in New York—some in black and white, all maintaining a retro tone—before ending on the message: “Juntos somos más fuertes,” aka “Together we are stronger.”
The three-time Grammy winner has also cited frustrations with Trump’s deportation policies as one reason he excluded the mainland U.S. from his current world tour in support of the album.
Given his vocal opposition to Trump and deliberate avoidance of U.S. tour stops, Bad Bunny’s partnership with Amazon—a major American corporation—marks a striking turn.
“This partnership is notable precisely because it bridges a polarizing moment,” said Khachatryan. “You have a private-sector giant, Amazon, joining forces with a globally influential artist who’s clashed rhetorically with Trump—yet together they’re aligning around a domestic-production goal centered on a U.S. territory. It reframes what ‘domestic sourcing’ means, through culture rather than policy, while pointing to tangible economic tools like marketplace access, storefront visibility and the ‘Hecho en PR’ badge.”"

TTD stock has also underperformed peers like Amazon AMZN, Magnite MGNI and PubMatic PUBM. AMZN and MGNI have gained 1.1% and 20%, respectively, while PUBM is down 43.7%.

TTD gained 0.7% last day and closed the session at $53.49, which is way below its 52-week high of $141.53 and closer to its 52-week low of $42.96.
The key question now is, does the recent decline make TTD a buying opportunity, or should investors simply hold on and wait for the storm to pass?
Let’s break down the key advantages and potential risks to help determine the smartest move for your portfolio.
What Triggered the Sharp Decline for TTD?
The recent downturn in The Trade Desk’s stock price can be largely attributed to a cautious ad spending environment. Macroeconomic uncertainty could prove a drag on advertising budgets. TTD remains cautious regarding the impact of the volatile macro backdrop, particularly on the large global brands. If macro headwinds worsen or persist through the remainder of 2025, revenue growth may face further pressure due to reduced programmatic demand.
While The Trade Desk remains a leading independent DSP, the competitive environment is intensifying. Walled gardens like Google and Amazon dominate this space as they control their inventory and first-party user data, allowing for highly targeted ad campaigns. Even smaller players like Magnite and PubMatic are expanding their presence in CTV and retail media and competing for ad dollars. While CTV remains a strong revenue driver, this market is also increasingly becoming competitive. AMZN’s expanding DSP business is giving tough competition to TTD, especially in this space.
Regulatory and privacy-related changes like the deprecation of cookies and tightening data-privacy laws like Europe’s GDPR also pose ongoing challenges.
Higher expenses are likely to weigh on profitability. In the last reported quarter, total operating costs surged 17.8% year over year to $577.3 million. Expenses soared on account of continued investments in boosting platform capabilities, particularly platform operations. Higher costs can prove a drag on margins, especially if revenue growth does not keep pace.
Overreliance on North America for revenues is another concern. Though TTD is focusing on geographic expansion, executing well across disparate markets can be complex and risky."

OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), a company that hasn’t turned a profit, is spending billions building out data centers to power its artificial intelligence offerings.
On Monday, the company inked a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that will see the chipmaker provide next-generation GPUs to OpenAI, which will also have the opportunity to purchase up to 10% of the company. Nvidia (NVDA), in turn, is pouring $100 billion into OpenAI, which is also a major customer.
Meanwhile, tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) continue to spend billions on their own AI data centers. Then there’s the $40 billion Oracle (ORCL) is spending on Nvidia chips to power OpenAI’s Project Stargate, the Financial Times reported in May.
It all makes for a rather confusing array of deals and moves that continue to raise questions about when exactly all of this spending will turn into profits, not to mention the specter of the dot-com crash of the early 2000s.
But even if the AI hype cycle plays out like the dot-com bubble, a good amount of that investment in AI infrastructure will still pay off, at least in the long run.
“I actually do believe that there is significant long-term demand,” Ram Bala, associate professor of business analytics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, told Yahoo Finance.
“I think it's definitely going to pan out. The macroeconomic challenge is ... there's probably going to be this intermediate phase where it seems like we overbuilt a lot of this and demand isn't quite catching up to all of that.”
Bubbling up
Fears of an AI bubble have been percolating for months as AI stock prices and corporate valuations have continued to soar. Nvidia, the world’s AI chip leader, has a market capitalization north of $4.5 trillion. On top of that, OpenAI is now valued at $500 billion, more than Elon Musk’s SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), which is valued at $400 billion.
The explosion in AI interest and the promise of future riches have also sent Microsoft and Google’s valuations above the $3 trillion mark, with Microsoft quickly closing in on $4 trillion.
It’s enough to raise the hair on anyone’s neck.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos last week said that we’re likely witnessing an AI bubble during a discussion at Italian Tech Week, but he added that some of those investments will eventually pay off.
""When people get very excited, as they are today, about artificial intelligence, for example ... every experiment gets funded, every company gets funded,"" Bezos said. ""The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and bad ideas."""

The gross proceeds to Plug Power, before deducting estimated transaction expenses and fees, are expected to be approximately $370 million.
Upon the immediate exercise in full of the Existing Warrants, the investor will receive (i) 31,000,000 shares of common stock and (ii) in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 154,430,464 shares of its common stock. In consideration of the warrant exercise, the investor will receive new warrants to purchase a total of 185,430,464 shares of common stock (the “New Warrants”). The New Warrants will have an exercise price of $7.75, representing a premium of approximately 100% to Plug Power’s last closing stock price on October 7, 2025. The New Warrants will be exercisable upon the Company’s receipt of stockholder approval to increase its authorized shares of common stock and will expire on March 20, 2028. The Company has not reserved shares of common stock underlying the New Warrants and does not expect to effect any exercise of the New Warrants unless and until the Company receives stockholder approval or effects a reverse stock split to increase its authorized shares of common stock. The New Warrants may be cash settled after February 28, 2026, if common stock is not then available to satisfy exercises. The offering is expected to close on or about October 9, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.
If the New Warrants are fully exercised on a cash basis, Plug Power has the potential to raise approximately $1.4 billion in additional gross proceeds. No assurance can be given that any of the New Warrants will be exercised. Plug Power intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Three decades ago, founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos set up an online site that sold books.
Since those early days, the company has evolved into one of the most dominant enterprises the world has ever seen. Amazon is valued at a whopping $2.4 trillion and raked in $670 billion in trailing-12-month sales.
As a result of that meteoric rise, the stock has been a huge winner. In the past two decades, shares have skyrocketed 227,000% (as of Oct. 3). This is one of the most closely watched businesses around, so it makes sense if most investors think they're very familiar with its operations.
But there are still some aspects of the company that might fly under the radar. Here's one little-known fact you shouldn't overlook.
Leveraging data to monetize attention
Investors know Amazon as the leading e-commerce player. Or perhaps they're familiar with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the preeminent cloud computing platform that gets all the attention from Wall Street. There are also other areas, like Whole Foods Market and autonomous-vehicle subsidiary Zoox. I haven't even mentioned Amazon's foray into the healthcare market with the One Medical membership-based primary-care service.
This business seems like it has its hands in all the cookie jars of the economy. However, most investors might not realize that Amazon has become a digital-advertising juggernaut. For context, consider that in Q2 (ended June 30), the company collected $15.7 billion in ad revenue, an increase of 22% year over year. This is more than double the total sales figure from the same period four years ago in 2021.
Amazon's annualized ad revenue in Q2 was nearly $63 billion. When you think about it, though, it might not be that surprising that the company has become a force in this market.
Amazon started showing ads on search results in 2012, and in January 2024, it introduced an ad-supported Prime Video membership option. Its online marketplace had 2.7 billion visitors in August, and that same month, Prime Video commanded 3.9% of all daily TV viewing time in the U.S. It also plays NFL games on Thursday nights.
The business has been able to monetize all the attention on its digital properties, leveraging data in the process. And that data is extremely valuable.
This was clear when Amazon inked deals with Roku and Netflix, allowing advertisers to use the tech titan's demand-side platform to buy ad slots on these streaming platforms. Given Roku's and Netflix's broad reach, it makes sense that both companies wanted to partner with a business in Amazon that has deep consumer insights.
Advertising efforts should be raking in profits
Alphabet, the leader in the industry, raked in $71.3 billion of ad revenue in the second quarter. Meta Platforms, another powerhouse, registered $46.6 billion of ad sales during Q2. Both predominant internet companies are extremely profitable, putting up strong operating margins.
This implies that Amazon's advertising division is raking in sizable profits. Needham and Company analyst Laura Martin estimates Amazon's ad business puts up an unbelievable 70% operating margin.
Amazon's ad segment is growing at a brisk pace, and there's no reason to believe this momentum will abate meaningfully anytime soon. According to estimates from Grand View Research, the global digital-advertising market is expected to reach $1.2 trillion in yearly revenue by 2030. Should Amazon continue its success, with ad sales rising noticeably in the years ahead, it's easy to believe that the company's earnings power will get a substantial boost."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-08T11:05:00,Want to Retire Rich? 2 Growth Stocks That Could Soar by 100% by 2030,Amazon and Luckin Coffee still have plenty of room to run.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=68e3401246ad59724efff6d150adbc1ac35971bb1c2552007641bca1f50ee561,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/want-to-retire-rich-2-growth-stocks-that-could-soa/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/want-to-retire-rich-2-growth-stocks-that-could-soa/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/want-to-retire-rich-2-growth-stocks-that-could-soa/,fool.com,200,,"Historically, the S&P 500 has returned an average of 10% per year, which means investors who invest in an S&P index fund today and hold it until late 2030 will have an expected total return of roughly 61%.
That's not too shabby.
But if you want to double your money or more in that time (or faster), you'll need to look for growth stocks with market-beating potential. Let's discuss some reasons why Amazon (AMZN -0.54%) and Luckin Coffee (LKNC.Y 4.53%) fit the bill.
Amazon
With a market cap of $2.34 trillion, Amazon is one of the largest companies in the world. And the strengths that carried it to its previous successes can help it continue to outperform as it pivots to new technological opportunities like warehouse robotics and generative artificial intelligence (AI).
To be fair, large-cap and megacap companies often aren't popular with growth investors because it can feel like their best growth days are behind them. But while Amazon's top-line gains have indeed slowed, it still has a huge opportunity to improve its profitability through cost-cutting and new technologies. The company's second-quarter results show the impacts of these long-term strategies.
While its net sales grew by 13% year over year, operating income surged by 31% as margins improved across the business. Amazon has been working to improve its logistics and fulfillment network. These efforts include adding more than 1 million robots capable of moving and packing merchandise. CEO Andy Jassy also suggests generative AI will allow the company to replace some office workers. And this will help it continue to increase profitability over the coming years.
Trading now at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 29, Amazon's valuation looks reasonable considering its recent surge in profit growth and exposure to transformational new technologies. For context, the Nasdaq-100 index has an average forward P/E of 27. Often, high-quality, blue chip stocks trade at a premium.
Luckin Coffee
With shares up by a whopping 900% over the past five years, Luckin Coffee's recovery is already in full swing. The China-based coffee shop chain gradually recovered most of the market cap it lost due to the fraud scandal that led to its delisting from the Nasdaq in 2020. Now, investors can look forward to years of potentially explosive top-line growth.
In the second quarter, Luckin's revenue jumped 47% year over year to $1.72 billion, driven mainly by new store openings and same-store sales growth in its home market. The company also enjoys a healthy contribution from partnership stores (franchises), which generated roughly $400 million in revenue (23% of the total). However, most excitingly, Luckin's growth story looks set to go international over the next five years and beyond.
Luckin has already established solid footholds in Singapore and Malaysia. And in late June, it opened its first U.S. stores in New York City, where it will compete directly with domestic giants like Starbucks and Dunkin' in a $88.9 billion coffee market. The company has already established a compelling niche, showcasing its discount-heavy business model and cashier-free experience, where orders must be placed through its mobile app. Luckin is likely operating its U.S. stores at a loss while it works to grow its brand awareness, just like it did in China.
Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 17, the company is valued at a discount to both the S&P 500 average of 31 and Starbucks, which boasts a forward P/E of 32. With a dirt-cheap price tag and plenty of room to grow, Luckin Coffee has all the ingredients needed to generate years of market-beating returns for shareholders.
Which growth stock is best for you?
While both Amazon and Luckin Coffee could potentially double by 2030, they are appropriate picks for different investment strategies. While a blue-chip company like Amazon offers safety and stability, Luckin Coffee's aggressive international expansion carries greater uncertainty with greater potential rewards."

Up until recently, Amazon Prime members could share some of their membership perks with non-members who lived outside their homes. Called the Amazon Prime Invitee program, it enabled members to give their free delivery service to non-members.
But not anymore. Amazon ended its invitee program on October 1, 2025. That means people who live outside of an Amazon Prime member's home will need to get their own membership. An Amazon spokesperson told USA Today that the move will impact less than 1% of its customers, and those people will be offered a 12-month membership for $14.99 that they can redeem any time up to December 31, 2025. That's a pretty decent deal considering that an Amazon Prime membership now costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year.
Meanwhile, Amazon announced it will continue its Prime program for roommates and family members. Amazon Family, formerly known as Amazon Household, enables a member to share the program with one other adult and four children who live under the same roof. The two adult members will be able to get access to free shipping, Prime Day, and other shopping sales events. The adults and four children will get access to Prime Video, a selection of books and magazines, and other digital content through Amazon's Family Library. For parents uneasy about what their kids stream without adult supervision, you can also add in parental controls.
The Invitee program ended just before a massive settlement
Amazon started its Prime Invitee Program back in 2009, but stopped accepting new invitees back in 2015. The Seattle-based corporation started letting invitees know about its coming end back in early September 2025.
The end of the invitee program came less than a week after Amazon settled a $2.5 billion lawsuit that may result in compensation to eligible Prime members. The suit, initiated by the Federal Trade Commission in 2023, alleged that Amazon misled people into becoming Amazon Prime members and then made it difficult for them to cancel the service.
While there's always been some debate about whether Amazon Prime perks are really worth the cost, the end of the Invitee Program and the recent lawsuit really highlight the sneaky ways Amazon tricks people into spending more money. While JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth told Investing.com in 2022 that Prime's services amounts to a roughly $1,100 value, stripping so many people of things like free shipping at once could deter potential customers from using the site at all. After all, customers need to purchase a considerable amount of merchandise for even a chance at accessing that perk without Prime.
Amazon has big plans
In a statement regarding its settlement, Amazon denied wrongdoing, insisted the company always followed the law, and claimed the settlement allowed the company to get back to finding better ways to serve its customers.
And Amazon does have some big plans. In June 2025, the company declared it will invest $4 billion to triple the size of its delivery network by 2026 and to expand its same-day and next-day service — now mainly available to urban and suburban areas — to more than 4,000 smaller cities, towns, and rural communities by the end of 2025. The company also plans to expand its same-day grocery delivery service to 2,300 communities by the end of 2025.
And just as Nvidia made its big money move involving the buildup of artificial intelligence data centers with Intel, Amazon made its own investments in AI. The company aims to use the technology to improve mapping for its delivery crews, predict the product needs of different areas, and improve its robotics in its warehouses."

Billionaire investor Steve Eisman warns of a very different economic reality if one were to remove the gains of AI from the equation.
The financial analyst best-known for predicting the 2008 housing collapse—and made famous by the 2015 film The Big Short—said on a recent episode of The Real Eisman Playbook podcast that the U.S. economy is a “tale of two cities”: While GDP growth may indicate a robust economy, by removing AI expenditures from the picture, you instead see stagnation.
The U.S. GDP in 2024 was $29.18 trillion, estimated to grow by 1.8% in 2025, Eisman said. That 1.8% growth is worth about $530 billion. But if you were to factor in the AI infrastructure spending by Magnificent Seven companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, it would total about $400 billion, by Eisman’s calculations, meaning if you were to subtract that sum from the projected growth of U.S. GDP, it would amount to very little.
“The U.S. economy is not even growing, really, 50 basis points outside of AI,” Eisman said. “So clearly there have to be pockets of weakness.”
A wealth of economists and tech giants have warned of an expanding AI bubble as investments in the technology mount with little robust evidence so far of the technology’s transformative ability. As concerns over little job growth and creeping inflation grow, so too does worry about the health of the U.S. economy.
Signs of a limping consumer piles onto these fears. According to a New York Federal Reserve Bank report released in August, household debt increased by $185 billion to reach $18.39 trillion in 2025’s second quarter, while auto loan balances increased by $13 billion, hitting $1.66 trillion. Student loan balances also inched up $7 billion to total $1.64 trillion.
“The pain is going to happen across the board,” Lakshmi Ganapathi, founder of investment research firm Unicus Research, told Eisman on the podcast. “It’s in the retail. It’s in the buy-now-pay-later. It’s definitely in the auto.”
Warning signs in the auto sector
Ganapathi points to the auto sector as a case study for a hidden way consumers are struggling. During the pandemic, the stimulus checks many Americans received—totaling 476 million payments worth $814 billion—made consumers appear wealthier than they really were to banks, she said. This allowed them to qualify for prime loans, despite not truly having that wealth.
“The credit score prime was an illusion,” Ganapathi said. “Whatever the prime credit scores that are sitting on the [asset-backed security] are technically subprime.”
The pandemic also marked a period of booming car sales, many above sticker price, as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) hiked prices as a result of supply-chain issues and increased consumer demand."

New Amazon Pharmacy Kiosks debut at One Medical offices in Los Angeles, helping patients start treatment faster and improve medication adherence
SEATTLE, October 08, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Pharmacy (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced the launch of Amazon Pharmacy Kiosks, an innovative new service that allows patients to pick up prescriptions within minutes of their medical appointment. Beginning December 2025, kiosks will be available at select One Medical offices across the greater Los Angeles area, including Downtown LA, West LA, Beverly Hills, Long Beach, and West Hollywood. Amazon Pharmacy Kiosk expansion to additional One Medical offices and other locations will follow.
Each year in the U.S., nearly one-third of prescriptions are never filled—a problem compounded by widespread access challenges. One in four neighborhoods are considered pharmacy deserts, leaving millions without convenient medication access. Even when patients do make it to the pharmacy, only half say their prescriptions are filled quickly, according to J.D. Power. These barriers add up to delayed treatments, missed doses, and preventable healthcare costs.
Amazon Pharmacy Kiosks are designed to close this gap—making it possible for patients to pick up their medications within minutes of their appointment, right where they receive care. The service brings the pharmacist to the patient—delivering the same trusted clinical service they would expect at a pharmacy counter, but on the patient’s own terms and without the wait.
""We know that when patients have to make a separate stop after seeing their doctor, many prescriptions never get filled,"" said Hannah McClellan, Vice President of Operations, Amazon Pharmacy. ""By bringing the pharmacy directly to the point of care, we're removing a critical barrier and helping patients start their treatment when it matters most—right away.""
Patients who have their prescriptions sent to Amazon Pharmacy can choose to pick up from the in-office kiosk when they place their order in the Amazon app. After placing their order, their medication is ready for pickup within minutes—with no separate trip to the pharmacy required. For added support, patients can connect with an Amazon Pharmacy licensed pharmacist via secure video or phone consultation.
""As clinicians, we see firsthand how delays in starting medication can impact treatment outcomes,"" said Dr. Andrew Diamond, Chief Medical Officer at One Medical. ""The ability to know a patient is leaving our office with their medication in hand—especially for conditions requiring immediate treatment like infections—can make a meaningful difference in their care journey."""

AI stocks have helped the market jump 14% so far this year -- an extraordinary achievement when you consider that it has battled a shaky economy, tariffs, and high interest rates all year.
And that gravy train will keep going. Grand View Research reports that the AI market was worth $270.22 billion in 2024 and should reach $3.5 trillion by 2033 for a compound annual growth rate of 31.5%. So, if you want to continue to beat the market for the next several years, you need to be looking closely at AI stocks.
There have been many big winners so far, such as Nvidia, Palantir Technologies, and CoreWeave, that have all enjoyed monster gains this year. If you're looking for some great AI names that haven't caught fire yet, then I recommend considering Tesla (TSLA 1.31%), Salesforce (CRM -1.15%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.54%). I think all three are ripe for a bull run.
1. Tesla
Tesla is one of the world's best-known automakers and a true innovator in electric vehicles, battery charging, and autonomous vehicles. But the stock hasn't been a winner so far this year, underperforming the market with only a 6% year-to-date gain.
Tesla has been hampered by a lot of backlash. CEO Elon Musk took a central role in the U.S. presidential election and in setting up the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and he campaigned for a far-right party in German elections. Whether you agree or disagree with Musk's political leanings, it's clear that mixing politics with a publicly traded company comes with risk.
But on the plus side, Tesla is gearing up for a huge quarter. The company announced that it delivered more than 497,000 vehicles in the quarter, a record for the company. A federal tax credit of $7,500 expired at the end of the quarter, likely encouraging buyers to make their purchases before Oct. 1.
Tesla is also working to ramp up its Robotaxi autonomous service with its Model Y vehicles. The Robotaxi service is currently available only in Austin, Texas, but Musk has ambitions to offer it nationally. Self-driving taxis could be a huge tailwind for Tesla stock in the future; Cathie Wood from Ark Invest believes that it could comprise 90% of the company's enterprise value by 2030.
2. Salesforce
Salesforce is a software-as-a-service company that's turning to AI to juice its revenue. The company's Agentforce tool is available to help more than a dozen industries, including financial services, retail, technology, manufacturing, construction, and more.
Salesforce operates customer relationship management software in the cloud. It allows users to see sales, marketing, customer service, and e-commerce tools in an easy-to-use platform that's accessible anywhere. And it says its Agentforce tool helps businesses maximize their autonomous AI agents 16 times faster than traditional approaches.
The company saw revenue of $10.2 billion in the second quarter, up 10% from a year ago, and its data cloud and AI annual recurring revenue was up 120% from a year ago.
The continuing adaption of Agentforce (the company says it's closed 12,000 deals since launching the tool) encouraged management to increase third-quarter and full-year guidance. Salesforce stock is down about 35% on the year, but numbers like this should help push it higher.
3. Amazon
Amazon is a heavy hitter with AI, both in its huge e-commerce division and the fast-growing Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company has more than 1 million robots working in its warehouses and fulfillment centers to help streamline deliveries.
And AWS is increasingly in demand as companies roll out their own AI-powered platforms and need data centers with the computing power to make them work. AWS is the global leader in cloud computing, with a 30% market share.
That segment is smaller than the company's e-commerce network, but it's perhaps more important to its success. Amazon.com sales were $136.8 billion in the second quarter, but because e-commerce has low profit margins, the company earned only $9 billion in profit. Meanwhile, AWS generated $30.8 billion in revenue and a cool $10.1 billion in profit.
The weak margins in e-commerce, combined with international trade challenges this year, have contributed to push Amazon stock lower, and it is roughly flat for the year. But as AWS continues to grow and fuel profits, this AI stock should find its footing.
The bottom line
Artificial intelligence has a long runway, but Tesla, Salesforce, and Amazon haven't taken off yet. I think all three have great potential to turn 2025's reset into a rebound."

Most Wall Street analysts see the drawdown as a buying opportunity. The average target price of $70 per share implies 32% upside from its current share price of $53. And the highest target price of $135 per share (set by Shyam Patil at Susquehanna) implies 155% upside.
A few successful hedge fund managers opened positions in The Trade Desk during the second quarter, as detailed below:
- Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management bought 533,200 shares.
- Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global bought 2.6 million shares.
- Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management purchased 998,900 shares.
Importantly, while none of the hedge funds above started particularly large positions in The Trade Desk, their purchases are still noteworthy. Additionally, all three fund managers beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.53%) during the last three years, which makes them good role models for retail investors.
The Trade Desk has a key advantage in its independent business model
The Trade Desk is the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in the adtech industry. Its software lets brands and agencies plan, measure, and optimize data-driven campaigns across digital channels. Its platform features cutting-edge omnichannel capabilities and artificial intelligence (AI) tools that help media buyers manage budgets, evaluate inventory, and target campaigns, according to Frost & Sullivan analysts.
The digital advertising industry is dominated by walled gardens, ecosystems where a single company controls most of the ad supply chain. Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms are perfect examples. They control ad inventory and data across web properties like Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram; they also own the adtech software required to run campaigns on those websites and applications.
The Trade Desk avoids those conflicts of interest with its independent business model, meaning it does not own web properties or advertising inventory. In turn, the company has earned a reputation for objectivity and transparency that has made it the most popular DSP for the open web. The Trade Desk is especially dominant in connected TV (CTV) advertising due to partnerships with Netflix, Roku, and Walt Disney.
However, the company also has a strong presence in offsite retail advertising, meaning ads that use first-party retail data to target consumers through third-party websites and applications. The Trade Desk sources data from Walmart, Target, Albertsons, and many other large retailers, to help customers grade and fine-tune campaign performance.
Retailers may hesitate to share data with competitors like Google, simply because Google could use the data to sell its own advertising inventory. ""Objectivity is a major factor here,"" The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green told analysts on the second-quarter earnings call. ""We do not compete with retailers and only an independent, objective partner like us can truly help advertisers unlock this opportunity.""
The Trade Desk stock crashed after its second-quarter earnings report
The Trade Desk reported somewhat disappointing financial results in the second quarter, despite beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 19% to $694 million and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings jumped 5% to $0.41 per diluted share. Green said, ""With our leadership in CTV as well as other areas such as retail media, digital audio, identity, measurement, and data, we are winning more business.""
Nevertheless, the stock fell nearly 40% following the report due to intensifying concerns about competition. Meta Platforms and Amazon reported faster advertising sales growth, marking the reversal of a long-standing trend where The Trade Desk regularly outpaced its largest rivals. Additionally, Amazon recently struck deals with Netflix and Roku that could erode The Trade Desk's dominance in CTV advertising.
However, investors should consider the big picture: While The Trade Desk stock has declined 55% year to date due to concerns about competition, shares now trade at 30 times adjusted earnings. That is not cheap, but the valuation is reasonable for a company whose adjusted earnings are forecast to increase by 16% annually through 2027.
Additionally, Wall Street may be underestimating future earnings. The Trade Desk has a competitive moat in its independent business model and its status as the leading demand-side platform for the open internet, which may lead to an acceleration in top- and bottom-line growth beyond what analysts anticipate. In that light, now is a good time to buy a small position."

He is the portfolio manager at Coatue Management, a hedge fund that beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.53%) by 122 percentage points during the three-year period that ended in June.
Laffont made some notable trades in the second quarter. He sold 596,100 shares of Amazon (AMZN -0.54%), trimming his stake 5%. He also bought 3.3 million shares of CoreWeave (CRWV 4.10%), an AI stock backed by Nvidia (NVDA 0.06%), which now ranks as his largest holding at 8% of his portfolio. CoreWeave stock is up 230% since going public earlier this year.
Here's what investor should know.
Amazon: The stock Philippe Laffont sold in the second quarter
Amazon has a strong presence in three big industries. The company accounts for more than 40% of U.S. e-commerce sales and 15% of digital ad spending, and it's gaining share in both markets. Also, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts for 30% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending, nearly as much market share as Microsoft and Alphabet hold combined.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of the growth strategy. In retail, AI tools help allocate inventory, forecast demand, and streamline last-mile delivery. In advertising, generative AI tools help brands create images, videos, and audio for campaigns. In cloud computing, AWS regularly introduces features to support AI workflows, such as recently added tools for building and managing AI agents.
Amazon reported second-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 13% to $167 billion on particularly strong growth in advertising and cloud services. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 1.5 percentage points as AI innovations continued to drive efficiency, and GAAP net income increased 33% to $1.68 per diluted share.
Wall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings seem fair. My guess is Philippe Laffont trimmed his position to rebalance his portfolio after Amazon stock popped in the second quarter. Whatever the reason, I am confident the decision to sell does not reflect a lack of conviction. Amazon is still his third largest position at 6% of his portfolio.
CoreWeave: The Nvidia-backed AI stock Philippe Laffont bought in the second quarter
CoreWeave is the leader among an emerging class of cloud computing platforms known as GPU clouds or AI clouds. Whereas traditional clouds like AWS and Microsoft Azure were built for a broad range of workloads, CoreWeave designed its data centers specifically for artificial intelligence and it was recently ranked as the most capable AI cloud services provider by SemiAnalysis, a research company that specializes in the semiconductor industry.
""CoreWeave's product offerings sets a new standard across the GPU cloud industry,"" wrote Chief Analyst Dylan Patel. ""As demand for high-performance compute continues to grow, CoreWeave's investments in software and hardware infrastructure makes them a clear leader in GPU cloud reliability."" The report highlighted its close partnership with Nvidia as a key strength because it affords the company early access to the latest GPUs.
CoreWeave reported explosive second-quarter financial results. Revenue surged 207% to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income increased 135% to $200 million. Meanwhile, revenue backlog jumped 86% due to expanded contracts with OpenAI and an unnamed hyperscale customer (likely Microsoft or Alphabet). And there has been more good news since the quarter ended. CoreWeave last month announced a $14 billion deal with Meta Platforms.
As a caveat, CoreWeave has a substantial amount of debt due to its furious buildout of AI data centers, so much so that interest expense erased more than 20% of revenue in the second quarter. However, while investors should monitor the metric, borrowing money to capitalize on demand for AI infrastructure is not unreasonable, and CEO Michael Intrator says the company only takes on debt when a signed contract covers the costs.
Wall Street expects CoreWeave's revenue to increase at 90% annually through 2027. That makes the current valuation of 15 times sales look reasonable. Additionally, Nvidia evidently has a great deal of confidence in CoreWeave because 91% of its portfolio is invested in the company. The stock has been volatile since its March IPO, but patient investors comfortable with price swings should consider buying a small position today."

On one hand, this high-flying Latin American e-commerce giant has proven it can deliver impressive growth. Just look at the numbers: up 23.9% year-to-date, with a 162.1% gain over three years. Yet, the past month and week have reminded everyone just how volatile this ride can be, with shares down 9.5% over 30 days and dropping 6.4% in just the past week.
Much of this recent wobble comes as global competitors look to strengthen their own footholds in the region. News broke that Amazon has moved to acquire a stake in Colombian delivery company Rappi, stirring up plenty of speculation about logistics competition and what that means for MercadoLibre. Investors were quick to react, reassessing risks even as the long-term growth story remains strong.
With all this in mind, the big question is: How does MercadoLibre stack up when we look at the numbers behind the headline moves? According to our valuation checks, MercadoLibre comes in with a score of 3 out of 6. This is a solid showing, especially in a sector where growth names often do not measure up on classic value metrics. But numbers alone never tell the whole story. Let’s dig into what makes up that valuation score and, at the end, consider a smarter way to assess MercadoLibre’s true worth.
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model works by projecting a company’s future free cash flows and then discounting them back to the present to estimate the business’s intrinsic worth today. With this approach, investors get an idea of what the company is truly worth if you strip away the market noise.
For MercadoLibre, reported free cash flow over the last twelve months stands at $7.5 billion. Analyst forecasts project continued growth, with an estimated free cash flow reaching $9.6 billion by 2027. Beyond the next five years, further cash flow estimates are extrapolated to reflect longer-term expectations, with projections rising to over $14 billion a decade from now.
All of these future values are then discounted to reflect present-day value in US dollars. Taking everything together, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic value of $2,694.90 per share. This is about 18.8% higher than the company’s current share price, which may indicate that the stock is undervalued at current levels.
Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests MercadoLibre is undervalued by 18.8%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover more undervalued stocks.
Approach 2: MercadoLibre Price vs Earnings
The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a popular valuation metric for profitable companies because it connects a company’s share price to its actual ability to generate earnings. For businesses like MercadoLibre that have a solid profit track record, focusing on the PE ratio cuts through much of the market hype and zeroes in on what investors are really paying for those earnings.
Market participants generally expect higher PE ratios for fast-growing or lower-risk companies, while industries with slower growth or more volatility tend to command lower multiples. So, it is important not to look at the PE ratio in isolation, but to compare it to industry averages, peer companies, and growth expectations to get a realistic benchmark for what’s “normal.”
MercadoLibre currently trades at a PE ratio of 54x. That is well above the Multiline Retail industry average of about 22.1x, but below the average for direct peers which sits at 69.8x. To provide investors with a more tailored benchmark, Simply Wall St calculates a “Fair Ratio” for each company. In MercadoLibre's case, the Fair Ratio is 33.6x, a figure shaped by unique factors like expected earnings growth, profit margins, size, risk profile, and the wider industry landscape.
While comparing to industry and peer averages is helpful, the Fair Ratio provides a more comprehensive yardstick, weighing factors that generic benchmarks overlook. In other words, it sets a more realistic expectation for what MercadoLibre’s PE should be, instead of treating all companies or sectors alike.
With MercadoLibre’s actual PE ratio running significantly above its Fair Ratio, the shares currently look expensive relative to their underlying fundamentals.
Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your MercadoLibre Narrative
Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives, a powerful tool that connects the story you believe about a company directly to its financial forecasts and fair value.
In simple terms, a Narrative is your personal outlook or thesis, built around what you believe will drive MercadoLibre’s business, such as digital adoption, margin expansion, or rising competition. It lets you anchor your assumptions about future revenue, earnings, and margins to actual numbers, turning your view of the company into a specific, dynamic fair value.
Narratives on Simply Wall St’s Community page make this insight accessible to everyone, letting you see and share perspectives used by millions of investors worldwide. As news or earnings come in, Narratives update automatically, so your valuations always reflect the latest reality.
Say you think MercadoPago’s fintech growth and expanded logistics will push earnings higher, your Narrative might produce a bullish fair value above $3,500 per share. But if you are more cautious about competition and margin risk, your Narrative could support a fair value closer to $2,170.
This empowers you to compare your fair value with today’s price and decide if it is time to buy, hold, or sell, all with a transparent story behind your numbers.

At a market cap well under $100 billion, does that make Coupang a better AI bet than its much larger American technology peers?
The answer is clear when you look at the numbers.
World-class e-commerce in Korea, plus much more
Taking inspiration from the other e-commerce pioneers like Amazon, Coupang has built up a fortress business in South Korea defined by fast delivery, customer delight, and an ecosystem of retail offerings that trump all local competitors. Members of its online subscription service called Rocket Wow receive orders by 7 a.m. the next morning if ordered by midnight the night before, which is faster than most Amazon deliveries.
All of this is available for a small membership fee paid each month, which also provides discounts on food delivery through Coupang Eats, free delivery on grocery purchases, and a slew of other perks. It is no surprise, then, that Coupang has 23.9 million active customers in a country with a population of just 52 million. That is impressive penetration for a brand that is barely a decade old.
Now, Coupang is expanding even further as a technology and commerce provider. It acquired the distressed asset Farfetch to get a foothold in online fashion shopping, has expanded successfully into Taiwan, and recently revamped its cloud computing service focused on AI. Called the Coupang Intelligent Cloud, the company is aiming to take advantage of demand for AI workloads on data centers in Korea, especially as the government has proposed grants for homegrown data center builders.
Better growth, cheaper valuation
Coupang's revenue grew 19% year over year on a foreign currency neutral basis last quarter to $8.5 billion, faster than Amazon's 10% growth for its retail operations. Other parts of Coupang's business are growing much faster, such as its expansion into Taiwan, with over 100% year-over-year revenue growth. With $32 billion in trailing revenue, Coupang is at a much earlier phase of its business life than Amazon, which should give it a longer runway to grow, especially if it expands into new geographies. Not to mention the optionality with the cloud computing business.
When looking at other AI technology stocks, Coupang's valuation is much more palatable. Nvidia has an unwieldy market cap of $4.4 trillion that will prevent the stock from being a monster winner over the long term, even though it has gone up by more than 10x for investors in the last few years. Palantir has a market cap of $424 billion and generates less than $3.44 billion in revenue.
Compare that to Coupang with a $59 billion market cap, $32 billion in revenue, and expanding profit margins that should help the company generate heaps of profits in the years to come. Coupang's investments in automation, AI, and robotics at its fulfillment centers should start to bear huge efficiency gains, which will further help the company expand its profit margins. Taken together, all these factors give Coupang stock a cheaper valuation than some of the hotter AI stocks popular with investors right now.
Is Coupang stock a better buy?
When looking at the combination of growth and size of the stock, Coupang looks like a better AI stock for investors hunting for big winners in their stock portfolio.
The company's revenue is up 170% since going public in 2021. Its market cap is just $59 billion vs. $32 billion in trailing revenue. It has plenty of irons in the fire to help revenue keep growing at a consistently strong pace over the next five years. Management is guiding for profit margins to expand to 10% or higher once the business matures.
Compare that to the huge market caps you have to buy with AI stocks like Palantir or Nvidia right now, and Coupang looks like a better buy for investors today."

Bezos Highlights The Importance Of Work Experience For Startup Success
Last week, during an interview at Italian Tech Week, Bezos emphasized that college dropouts like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are the ""exception"" rather than the rule for startup success.
""I always advise young people: Go work at a best-practices company somewhere where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things [like] how to hire really well, how to interview, etc.,"" Bezos said.

He pointed out that gaining practical experience first helped him launch Amazon at age 30.
""That extra 10 years of experience actually improved the odds that Amazon would succeed,"" he added.
Bezos graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and later founded his aerospace company Blue Origin, which he described as ""the most important work"" he does.

Earlier this month, Bezos warned that AI was in ""a kind of industrial bubble"" but stressed its real potential to transform industries.
He noted that both successful and failed AI experiments were attracting funding, making it hard for investors to pick winners, yet the technology remained revolutionary.
Billionaire Mark Cuban highlighted that his success came from outworking others.

- Amazon has purchased a massive warehouse and distribution facility in Ocala, Florida for $97.675 million.
- The sale represents the largest real estate transaction in the county this year.
- The building was constructed on spec by Red Rock Development and completed in 2023.
Amazon has paid $97.675 million for a massive warehouse/distribution facility in Ocala, Florida, located west of Interstate 75 and north of U.S. 27, according to a deed on file with the court clerk.
The facility at 3171 NW 44th Ave. is described in real estate promotional literature as having 1.085 million square feet of warehouse/distribution space sitting on 91 acres. Directly to the east, on the other side of I-75, are Chewy, AutoZone and FedEx distribution centers, as well as an existing Amazon operation.
The seller is listed as Ocala 44 RRL LLC, based in West Palm Beach. The buyer is Amazon.com Services LLC, based in Seattle. LXP Industrial Trust, which describes itself as ""a real estate investment trust focused on Class A warehouse and distribution real estate investments,"" announced the sale in an Oct. 1 news release.
The deed was recorded with the court clerk on Oct. 1. This is by far the biggest real estate sale in Marion County this year.
News of the sale comes just a few weeks after a tenant was signed for a similar huge distribution center just west of I-75 and north of County Road 484 in the Trailhead Logistics Park.
The building that Amazon bought was built on spec, meaning without a tenant. It was built by Red Rock Development. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in June 2021, and according to the Property Appraiser's Office the building was completed in 2023.
At the 2021 groundbreaking, Kevin Sheilley, who then was president/CEO of the Ocala Metro Chamber & Economic Partnership (CEP), called the Red Rock construction project “another homerun for the company, future tenant, and the community,” according to the Star-Banner's account, part of the USA TODAY Network."

What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat?
Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them.
I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility.
On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this.
I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value.
What do you make of that, Dan?
These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future.
They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future.
The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future.
And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out.
The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold.
So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend.
But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."

With Elon Musk’s SpaceX division, Starlink, rushing to overtake it, AST is positioned for “painful corrections,” according to a Scotiabank analyst.
“In the midst of an impressive bull market, extreme volatility in recent days has led to what we see as a valuation bubble,” analyst Andres Coello wrote in a note Tuesday downgrading the stock to sector underperform from sector perform. After a key satellite launch setback, he fears further delays may encourage some carriers to explore ditching AST SpaceMobile and moving to Starlink.

More than 2 billion people across the globe lack access to the internet via a high-speed network, that has Starlink and AST SpaceMobile vying to build networks that connect cell phones directly to broadband via satellite. Such connectivity is also critical during disasters and in conflict zones.
Based in Midland, Texas, AST SpaceMobile’s place as a key player in direct-to-device satellite connectivity has won over investors. The stock has surged this year. In the last month, the stock has jumped about 83%, with its market capitalization vaulting to almost $27 billion.
The biggest risks, according to Coello, are that the Block 2 Bluebird satellite — also known as FM1 — takes longer than expected or that a launch mission from India fails. If that were to happen SpaceX’s Starlink would stand to benefit.
AST SpaceMobile shares advanced to close at a fresh record in New York, erasing an earlier drop in the process and extending a winning streak triggered by the completion of the first successful satellite call over a Canadian wireless network with Bell.
In a recent update, SpaceX said the next-generation of Starlink direct-to-cell satellites would use a wider range of frequencies that would support a capacity increase of more than 100 times that of current satellites, which will enable full 5G cellular connectivity in most environments. Additionally, the Elon Musk-backed company agreed to acquire wireless spectrum from EchoStar Corp. for $17 billion last month.
“Our view is that the more time it takes for ASTS to bring a service to the market, the harder it will be to overcome Starlink’s improvements,” said Coello."

Amazon (AMZN, Financials) received a Perfect 10 Smart Score the highest grade attainable, indicating that analysts and big investors are behind the stock.
Amazon is hopeful because it is releasing new AI-powered devices and Amazon Web Services is growing. The average price objective for analysts is $267.88, which is 21% higher than where it is now.
In the past few weeks, Amazon has come out with a new line of Echo speakers, Fire TVs, and Ring cameras that work with Alexa+. Analysts say these products keep consumers connected to Amazon's devices, Prime services, and e-commerce ecosystem, strengthening its hold.
Institutional investors seem to agree. Hedge funds boosted their Amazon holdings by about 14.2 million shares last quarter, reflecting rising confidence in the company's long-term growth path. Technical indicators also remain positive, showing that momentum is still in Amazon's favor.
Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have both raised their targets to $280 and $275 respectively pointing to improving demand for cloud and AI services as key growth catalysts.
With shares up more than 22% over the past year, Amazon's mix of innovation, data-driven products, and a rebound in AWS is giving investors more reasons to stay bullish heading into 2026."

LAS VEGAS, Oct. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- SuiteWorld -- BERO, the premium non-alcoholic beer brand, is using Oracle NetSuite to support its mission to create beverages for those who seek a more balanced lifestyle, without sacrificing taste, quality, and enjoyment. With NetSuite's AI-powered business management suite, BERO has been able to maximize productivity, increase the speed and accuracy of financial reporting, and create a scalable foundation for growth by automating key business processes.
Founded by actor Tom Holland and beverage industry veteran John Herman in 2024, BERO has grown rapidly across the US and UK and now brews four unique beers, sells direct-to-consumers online, and can be found at major retailers including Target, Amazon, Sprouts, Total Wine, and more. BERO implemented NetSuite's cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution before it launched to support its growth plans and manage the complexity of international sales. With NetSuite, BERO has been able to scale its business to address changing demands and simplify operations across its distribution network. Bero worked with NetSuite Solution Provider Luxent on its implementation.
""From day one, we knew we needed a flexible system that could grow with our business and immediately enable efficiency,"" said John Herman, co-founder and CEO, BERO. ""Neha Soi, our Senior Vice President of Operations is a force, and guided us to the smart decision of onboarding NetSuite early, as she knew it would allow us to maintain real-time insight across financial and operational layers that were integral to our business. In addition, NetSuite has helped us automate administrative processes, which allows our team to focus on more strategic value and growth priorities.""
With NetSuite, BERO has been able to scale its business more fluidly by automating and integrating its financial, order fulfillment, and supply chain processes. For example, NetSuite helps BERO expedite order processing by connecting sales, transportation management system, and order fulfillment workflows. In addition, as orders are approved, NetSuite automates financial and inventory reporting to help ensure data accuracy and provide real-time insights.

Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) continues to cement its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, ranking fifth among U.S. corporate treasuries with approximately $80 billion in digital assets, according to company data and recent regulatory filings.
A chart published by the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla.
Bitcoin Holdings and Valuation
According to the company’s latest Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion.
The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC.
The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date.
The appreciation reflects Bitcoin’s sustained rally through Q3 2025. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense, noting the accounting implications of its Bitcoin-centric balance sheet.
ATM and Preferred Stock Programs
The filing further detailed updates to Strategy’s extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which collectively represent about $63.9 billion in potential capital issuance. These include:
• $2.1 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF)
• $4.2 billion in Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC)
• $21 billion in 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK)
• $4.2 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD)
• $21 billion in Class A common stock (MSTR)
The company reported no new share issuances during the period, noting that any proceeds from potential future sales would be presented net of commissions.
Financial Position and Oversight
As of the end of Q3 2025, Strategy’s digital-asset carrying value remained $73.21 billion, with a corresponding deferred-tax liability of $7.43 billion. The figures reaffirm Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as its core corporate reserve asset.
The financial disclosures were internally prepared and reviewed by KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. With Bitcoin’s market value continuing to climb, Strategy’s holdings now place it firmly among the top five U.S. corporations by total treasury size — a rare achievement for a firm whose reserves consist primarily of digital assets.

Today's Featured Research Reports
Microsoft's shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+24.5% vs. +20.7%). The company capitalizes on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion. Recently, MSFT introduced its first proprietary AI models, MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-1-preview.
Microsoft projects Azure growth of 37% for fiscal first-quarter 2026. Strong Office 365 Commercial demand has been propeling Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth. ARPU is increasing through E5 and M365 Copilot uptake across key segments. Strategic execution through expanding scale and enterprise customer growth is driving non-AI services.
Xbox revenues are benefiting from strength across third-party and first-party content offerings. The Zacks analyst expects fiscal 2026 net sales to grow 12.9% from fiscal 2025. However, elevated operating expenses and Azure investments amid intensifying cloud competition remain headwinds.
(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)
Shares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+20.8% vs. +19.5%). The company's top-line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate is contributing well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio are beneficial.
Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive. Robust advertising business is also contributing well. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on GenAI is a major plus. The Zacks analyst expects 2025 net sales to grow 10.6% from 2024.
However, weak third-quarter operating income guidance of $15.5-20.5 billion and concerns about margin pressure from heavy AI investments totaling $100+ billion in capital expenditure plans are overhangs. Elevated operating expenses amid intensifying cloud competition remain headwinds.
(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)
Johnson & Johnson's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+34.1% vs. +10.7%). The company's Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.
Though in the MedTech segment, sales are being hurt due to headwinds in China and competitive pressure in some categories, the Cardiovascular segment is contributing to growth. J&J expects sales growth in both segments to be higher in the second half than in the first. J&J is making rapid pipeline progress and has been on an acquisition spree lately.
However, the Stelara patent cliff and the impact of Part D redesign are significant headwinds in 2025. J&J's shares have outperformed the industry this year so far. Estimates are stable ahead of Q3 results. J&J has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.
(You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here >>>)
Shares of Willis Lease Finance have declined -9.4% over the past year against the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry's decline of -12.7%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $930.95 million delivered strong Q2 2025 results, with net income up 42% to $60.4 million and EPS rising to $8.43, driven by 88.3% lease utilization and asset monetization. H1 earnings of $77.2 million highlighted operational momentum and scalable margins.
Revenues grew 30.7% YTD to $353.2 million, led by higher lease rents, a surge in spare parts/equipment sales, and 13% growth in maintenance services. WLFC strengthened liquidity with $596 million ABS issuance and extended credit facilities. Shareholder value is reinforced via a 25-cent dividend and $60 million repurchase program.
However, risks include: operating costs climbed sharply, with technical and G&A expenses pressuring margins; maintenance services continue to generate thin or negative profitability; and consulting remains subscale. Shares are down 34% YTD, trading at 4.7x EV/Sales and 8.9x EV/EBITDA, discounted vs peers.

While Warren Buffett said, “our favorite holding period is forever,” occasional investor skittishness is nothing new. Yet has it gone to extremes?
Despite solid stock market performance this year, “I think that we’re in a period where people are not sure about capitalism,” ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi on a new episode of the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (see video above; listen below).
“I do believe we’re still stuck with what happened in 2000 and 2008, which were both horrendous,” he continued. “Although if you held on to the Mercks of the world, you ended up doing fine.”
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Cramer has sat in the host chair of ""Mad Money"" for nearly two decades and is the author of several books, including the recently published ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" He has studied markets and worked to demystify them for the average investor. He was one of the first to call out Nvidia (NVDA) — “my best pick” — when it was just a gaming company. He also had a hand in coining the acronym FAANG (Facebook, now Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG), now Alphabet (GOOGL).

“FAANG was the greatest creator of wealth in my life other than Nvidia, and I think my job was to find great stocks,” Cramer said. “But I wanted people to understand why I thought they were great.”
For many young investors, crypto and the hot stocks of the moment often crowd out the more traditional names and advice, leaving them susceptible to more volatile investments. “Compounding is so boring,” Cramer said. “People think it’s too hard. They don’t understand what the P/E means. They don’t understand what it means to buy and hold a great stock.”
This shorter-term thinking contrasts with Buffett’s sentiment on the stock market. He once said, “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”

Year to date, markets remain stable. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up nearly 15% while the Russell 2000 (^RUT) is up 11.61%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up 9.76%. Top S&P 500 performers during this same time period include Robinhood (HOOD), Seagate Technology (STX), Western Digital (WDC), Newmont (NEM), and Palantir (PLTR).
Impatience and skittishness are only two obstacles, according to Cramer. “The market got a bad rap because it seemed to be the playground of billionaires,” he said. “It got to be the image of the filthy rich, and the billionaires don’t help.”"
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-07T12:30:03,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Tesla Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,"Investing in certain stocks can pay off in the long run, especially if you hold on for a decade or more.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a752288413ee0e8623c21ba7f45814db955f6d55d09cf2f91a300cade76ad8b8,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-tesla-123003386.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-tesla-123003386.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-tesla-123003386.html,yahoo.com,200,,"How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.
The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Tesla (TSLA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TSLA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Tesla's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Tesla's main business drivers.
Over the years, electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has evolved into a dynamic technology innovator. It has transformed the EV space like Amazon changed the retail landscape and Netflix revolutionized entertainment. Tesla, which managed to garner a gold-standard reputation over the years, is now a far bigger entity than it was at the time of its IPO in 2010. However, with growing competition, Tesla's market share in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States has eroded to around 50%, from roughly 80% in 2020.
The firm’s three-pronged business model approach of direct sales, servicing and charging its EVs sets it apart from other carmakers. Tesla, touted as the clean energy revolutionary automaker, is much more than just a car manufacturer. The firm also makes different kinds of technology like self-driving software, charging stations and battery development, et al. The technology titan has also made inroads into the solar and energy storage business. In fact, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk wants the company to be viewed primarily through the lens of AI and robotics rather than solely as an automotive company.
Tesla operates under three segments: Automotive, Energy Generation/ Storage and Services/Others. While Automotive operations accounted for 78.9% of the total sales in 2024, revenues from Energy Generation/Storage and Services/Others constituted 10.3% and 10.8% of the total sales, respectively.
Presently, this Texas-based company produces and sells five fully electric vehicles: The Model S sedan, the Model X sport utility vehicle (“SUV”), the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV and Cybertruck.
Tesla’s first, second and third gigafactory are located in Nevada, New York and Shanghai, respectively. Its fourth and fifth gigafactories, are located in Berlin and Austin, respectively, and commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2021."

Mr. Marsh will continue to serve as CEO during the transition period and has been appointed Executive Chair of the Board, a position he will retain following March 2, 2026. In conjunction, George McNamee has been named Lead Director. Both Board appointments are effective October 10, 2025. Together, these leadership changes underscore Plug’s ongoing commitment to continuity, disciplined execution, and long-term shareholder value creation.
“I’m honored to be entrusted with leading Plug at such a pivotal moment for both the company and the hydrogen economy,” said Jose Luis Crespo. “Andy’s vision and persistence over nearly two decades have positioned Plug as the leader in global hydrogen solutions.

He leads Plug’s revenue strategy and oversees global sales and commercial operations across all products and applications, driving both top- and bottom-line performance through disciplined cost management and a focus on profitability.
Mr. Crespo has been instrumental in strengthening relationships with key customers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot, while driving hydrogen adoption programs that are reshaping industries worldwide. Working side-by-side with Plug’s leadership team, Mr. Crespo has been a key contributor defining the company’s strategy and execution, making his appointment one that ensures continuity during a critical phase focused on operational excellence and sustained financial discipline.
“Jose Luis has been a trusted colleague and partner to our leadership team for more than a decade, always leading with transparency and respect,” said Andy Marsh. “He has built strong relationships across the company and with our customers, and his deep understanding of our business ensures continuity during this important time.

Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) kicks off its two-day Prime Big Deal Days sales. Here's what you need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Steady After Major Indexes Hit New Highs
Stock futures are little changed this morning after the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite set new record highs on Monday, boosted by optimism around the AI spending boom after OpenAI disclosed plans to take a stake in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The U.S. government shutdown entered its seventh day but appears to have little impact on share trading. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence the borrowing costs on a range of consumer loans, ticked higher to 4.17%.
2. Bitcoin Slips, Gold Touches New High
Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is trading at around $124,400 after hitting record highs above $125,000 the past two days as investors seek a hedge amid uncertainty around the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and the waning value of the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin is up more than 50% from its April lows of below $80,000. Gold futures, which have also rallied lately as investors seek safe havens, were up slightly at $3,990 a ounce, trading at record levels.
3. AMD Shares Keep Rallying After Massive OpenAI Deal
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares are rising in premarket trading after surging 24% Monday following news the chipmaker had entered into a major partnership with OpenAI. The ChatGPT owner, which recently surpassed SpaceX as the world's most valuable startup, is buying several generations of AMD's AI chips in a long-term deal that could also see OpenAI acquire a stake in the semiconductor firm. AMD shares were up nearly 4% recently. Meanwhile, some of the companies mentioned by the ChatGPT maker at its DevDay developer conference Monday as partners for “App SDK” continued to rally. Shares of design software provider Figma (FIG) were up 7%, while Coursera (COUR) added 2%.
4. US Takes Stake in Trilogy to Unlock Alaska Mining Deposits
Shares in Trilogy Metals (TMQ) more than tripled in premarket trading on news the U.S. plans to invest $35.6 million to take a 10% stake in the Vancouver mining firm as the Trump administration looks to unlock access to minerals in Alaska and revive the 211-mile Ambler Road project.The U.S has the option to buy a further 7.5% stake in Trilogy contingent on the completion of the Ambler Road project.Trilogy Metals owns copper and other deposits in the Ambler Metals project in Northwest Alaska. The deal to unlock Alaskan mining deposits is the Trump Administration's latest investment in companies deemed critical to national security, coming a week after the U.S. said it would take a stake in another Canadian mine developer, Lithium Americas (LAC).
5. What Does Tesla Have Up Its Sleeves?
Tesla (TSLA) has teased the prospect of an event Tuesday that some analysts speculate could bring a more affordable EV, following two videos the company posted on Elon Musk’s social platform X over the weekend. The EV company, which is run by Musk, on Sunday posted a short video on X depicting a spinning wheel and Tuesday's date. It later shared another showing the headlights of a vehicle, details of which couldn't be easily seen."

- Interstate carrier Epic Lightning Fast Service will completely shutter its business operation at 5670 Kearny Mesa Road in San Diego and lay off 116 workers by the end of October, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification letter filed last month.
- According to a Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration database, the carrier had 59 power units and 93 drivers as of late July. The carrier also had Amazon-branded vehicles to deliver packages for the parcel giant.
- “This closure is expected to be permanent and will affect all” employees, the letter said.
Dive Insight:
The prolonged freight downturn, trade policy pressure and consumer hesitancy continues to disturb the market, affecting truck manufacturers and carriers of all sizes.
That fragile environment has hit Amazon partners such as Epic Lightning Fast Service and Accelore Group, which is laying off 214 workers in Texas on Nov. 1.
Meanwhile, similar service providers such as NFI Interactive Logistics is laying off 79 workers between Oct. 18 and 25 at a Lebanon, Indiana, facility that’s closing, according to a layoff notice.
“It is NFI's intention to attempt to place some employees at other locations with the same or more favorable working conditions,” the notices said.
OEMs have been particularly hit with faltering demand. Cumulative orders for the September 2024 to August 2025 season were down 15%, FTR recently reported."

Butler said the company, which supplies major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Macy’s, has raised prices about 10% this year as tariffs and logistics costs added roughly $6–7 million in expenses.
“The tariffs have affected us … they’ve added cost to our products,” Butler told FreightWaves in an interview. “We’re trying to offset that with price increase … not all the way, but we’ve certainly looked along the value chain as to [whether] our suppliers absorb some of it? How much are we able to absorb? Then how much is the consumer able to absorb through price increases?”

Network with the industry’s best and discover what’s next.
Founded more than 60 years ago and based in Cranford, New Jersey, National Tree Co. is one of the nation’s largest manufacturers and distributors of artificial Christmas trees and holiday décor.
The company supplies major retailers and also sells directly to consumers through its own website. National Tree Co. ships tens of thousands of orders daily during the holiday season and has built its reputation on realistic trees and innovative pre-lit designs.
“For the most part, we’re kind of a digital wholesaler, a dropship wholesaler,” Butler said. “You go into Amazon, you buy an item and then we’ll ship that to you from our warehouse. And being in business for a very long time, the leader really in this space, it’s obviously been a very interesting year for sure.”
Tariffs and other supply chain uncertainties have made executives at National Tree Co. take measure of their inventory and distribution network, Butler said.
“About 90% of the industry has historically sourced from China,” Butler told FreightWaves in an interview. “We’ve been diversifying into Southeast Asia and exploring nearshoring in Mexico, but costs to manufacture outside Asia remain four to five times higher.”
Typically, households will buy a new Christmas tree and other holiday decorations about every five to six years.
“COVID accelerated that, so during 2020 and 2021, when people had lots of money and nowhere to spend it on, we saw a kind of acceleration of buying,” Butler said. “Since then, it’s slowed down quite a lot. We were starting to see an upward curve again here. Hopefully that will happen in 2025.
Butler noted mixed consumer sentiment heading into the 2025 holiday season."

Other tech giants featured on the list included Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms, a contingent that’s spending tens of billions of dollars annually to develop large language models and AI chips to get a competitive edge in the AI arms race.
But the AIQ 50 wasn’t only dominated by the tech sector. In fact, there were 17 other sectors with representation, including financials, health care, retail, energy, and transportation.
This expansive embrace and quick adoption of generative AI differs from past technological advancements. The widespread adoption of the internet in the late 1990s caught many industries completely off guard, including physical retail and banking. More recently, the expensive and complex IT-led shift to cloud computing saw multiple sectors lag behind, including airlines, agricultural producers, and hospitals.
Kate Smaje, a senior partner at consulting giant McKinsey, says that unlike other digital transformation efforts, with AI there have been notable winners and losers within each sector, rather than entire industries falling behind on adoption.
AI, Smaje says, “it’s something that is innately democratized to everyone across the organization. It doesn’t matter whether you’re at the front line, you’re the HR director, or you’re the CEO. Your ability to use it and figure out ways to improve your lot, as it were, is a lot easier.”
Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, which ranked 36 on the AIQ 50 list, has applied AI and machine learning models across all parts of the company’s business, ranging from how it recruits patients to enroll in clinical trials to reimagining the supply chain and helping surgeons perform procedures.
Jim Swanson, J&J’s chief information officer, says that the company created a “lighthouse” framework to organize how it thinks about the value it can extract from AI across the business.
At the top of the lighthouse are use cases that apply to core products and services, including the use of AI to improve surgical outcomes. The middle layer focuses on utilizing AI to improve functions like customer support or patient enrollment in drug trials, while the lowest level involves employee productivity tools. In each case, Swanson says, he prioritizes investments that can generate big outcomes."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-07T07:51:00,News Flash: Amazon Is Piling Into Wall Street's Hottest Quantum Computing Stock,The new apple of Amazon's eye has seen its shares skyrocket by almost 700% over the trailing year.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b99fbb2a7d5c068cc599be52a79295cf397874d343c740a4f45d8fa924c56ddc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/amazon-pile-in-wall-street-quantum-computing-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/amazon-pile-in-wall-street-quantum-computing-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/amazon-pile-in-wall-street-quantum-computing-stock/,fool.com,200,,"For most investors, earnings season is the pinnacle of every quarter. Over a six-week period, the stock market's most-influential businesses lift their proverbial hoods and give investors a look at how they've performed over the prior three-month period. It serves as an excellent barometer of Wall Street's health.
But earnings reports aren't the only way to judge which stocks and trends are firing on all cylinders.
No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing allows investors to track which stocks, exchange-traded funds, and select options Wall Street's shrewdest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter.
However, there's a catch to the above statement: 13Fs aren't limited to individuals. Companies that are investing more than $100 million in AUM are also required to disclose their holdings via 13F. This includes trillion-dollar club member Amazon (AMZN -0.54%), which closed out the June quarter with more than $2.4 billion in AUM.
Amazon is much more than just e-commerce and AWS
Most people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading e-commerce platform, which draws billions of unique visitors to its site each month. Though selling goods online is a key driver of revenue, and e-commerce acts as the consumer-facing brand for the company, it's a generally low-margin segment that isn't too important to profitability.
Arguably the biggest puzzle piece that defines Amazon's success is its cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS), which accounted for 32% of global cloud infrastructure service spend in the second quarter, per tech-analysis firm Omdia.
Despite representing less than 19% of Amazon's net sales through the first-half of 2025, AWS is responsible for close to 58% of its operating income. The operating margin associated with AWS is light years higher than the operating margin associated with selling goods through an online marketplace. AWS has been growing at a consistent high-teens percentage on a year-over-year basis, with the prospect of growth reaccelerating thanks to the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into the platform.
But Amazon is more than just online retail sales, AWS, and a company with fast-growing subscription and advertising services. It's also an investor in some of its business partners.
As of June 30, Amazon held stakes in nine publicly traded companies. The largest of these stakes stems from an investment made in electric-vehicle manufacturer Rivian Automotive (RIVN 2.40%) six years ago. Amazon's logistics division also placed an order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian. When Rivian officially became a public company in 2021, Amazon began reporting its stake via 13Fs.
While Rivian accounts for 89% of the value of Amazon's investment holdings, it's the newest addition to this $2.43 billion portfolio that's turning heads.
Wall Street's quantum computing darling is on Amazon's menu
Although AI has arguably been the hottest thing since sliced bread over the last three years, a strong case can be made that quantum computing stocks are even hotter. Quantum computing relies on quantum mechanics to solve complex problems that traditional computers can't do. It has the potential to be particularly helpful in refining drug development and speeding up the pace by which AI algorithms help systems learn and become more efficient.
Over the trailing-12-month period, as of the closing bell on Oct. 3, we've witnessed gains in quantum computing stocks of:
- IonQ (IONQ -6.11%): 696%
- Rigetti Computing: 5,130%
- D-Wave Quantum: 3,460%
- Quantum Computing: 3,630%
During the second quarter, Amazon's 13F shows the only purchase it made was 854,207 shares of IonQ, which at the time had a market value of $36.7 million. If Amazon hasn't sold a share, this same position would be worth $62.6 million, as of Oct. 3.
Similar to other trillion-dollar club investors, such as Nvidia and Alphabet, the investment positions Amazon takes tend to be in its business partners. IonQ certainly fits the bill.
Although it's a nascent operating model when compared to Amazon's online marketplace, AWS, Prime subscriptions, and advertising, Amazon does have a quantum cloud-computing service known as Braket (which runs on AWS). This on-demand platform allows clients access to quantum computers to run simulations and/or execute algorithms. IonQ's trapped-ion quantum computers are being used by Braket, which is the connection Amazon has to Wall Street's quantum computing darling.
While some industry pundits expect sky-high growth from quantum computing stocks, with Boston Consulting Group projecting $450 billion to $850 billion in economic value created by this technology come 2040, there's quite a bit of frothiness built into the valuation of Amazon's newest investment.
On one hand, sales growth forecasts for IonQ are eyebrow-raising, with revenue projected to increase 112% this year from the prior-year period. On the other hand, IonQ is starting from a low basis. Even with sales forecast to quadruple from 2024 to 2026, its forward-year price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an absurd 138!
To add fuel to the fire, IonQ isn't particularly close to being profitable. In fact, its operating loss more than doubled to $236.3 million through the first-half of 2025 compared to the comparable period last year. Higher research and development costs are likely to keep IonQ in the red for many years to come.
Lastly, every game-changing technological advancement for more than 30 years has needed time to mature and endured an early stage bubble-bursting event. Investors (and businesses) consistently overestimate the early innings adoption rate and/or utility of new technologies -- and there's a very high probability quantum computing isn't the exception to this unwritten rule."

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-07T01:32:00,Is MercadoLibre Becoming a Riskier Growth Story?,MercadoLibre has long been seen as the Amazon of Latin America -- but it's increasingly clear that its story is more complex.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=74f7113bb84efb2c0dd8b7832b5faba9bccf45e94a675d2e1b2a62d6dfbe1da9,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/is-mercadolibre-becoming-a-riskier-growth-story/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/is-mercadolibre-becoming-a-riskier-growth-story/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/is-mercadolibre-becoming-a-riskier-growth-story/,fool.com,200,,"When investors think about MercadoLibre (MELI -2.82%), the story has always sounded straightforward: a dominant e-commerce and fintech platform with enormous growth potential in Latin America. The company has been called the ""Amazon"" of the region, and for years, that comparison worked.
But the latest results suggest a more nuanced reality. Growth is still strong, yet profitability is under pressure, costs are climbing, and competition is intensifying. That doesn't break the thesis -- but it does make MercadoLibre a riskier stock than it was a year ago.
MercadoLibre is growing nicely
Start with the positives. MercadoLibre is still expanding at a pace that most global tech companies would envy. In the second quarter of 2025, net revenue rose 34% year over year to $6.8 billion, driven by nearly 37% growth in gross merchandise value (GMV) on a forex-neutral basis. The company now counts more than 71 million unique buyers, a 25% increase from the prior year.
Its fintech arm, Mercado Pago, is also scaling impressively. The credit portfolio jumped 91% year over year to $9.3 billion, while short-term default rates improved from 8.2% a year ago to 6.7%. Customer adoption is broadening as well: Mercado Pago had 68 million monthly active users, many of whom are using it not just for e-commerce but also for everyday transactions, savings, and credit.
Those numbers reinforce a key point: MercadoLibre's ecosystem is sticky. The combination of marketplace, logistics, and payments keeps users engaged and competitors at bay. For a company operating in 18 countries in Latin America, that kind of scale is formidable.
MercadoLibre is doubling down on investment
At the same time, MercadoLibre is doubling down on reinvestment in key markets Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, estimating an investment of around $13 billion in 2025. Those dollars will go into the development of logistics hubs, technology upgrades, and expanding its payments infrastructure.
In the long run, these investments are essential. Faster deliveries make the marketplace more competitive, better payment rails deepen fintech adoption, and new technology supports the company's scale.
But in the short run, they add to costs -- and make MercadoLibre more exposed to macroeconomic volatility.
But margins are coming under pressure
But growth hasn't come without trade-offs. Profitability was the soft spot in Q2 2025. Net income of $523 million analyst expectations, and operating margin slipped to 12.2% from 14.3% a year earlier.
The culprit was primarily shipping. Facing mounting competition in Brazil -- particularly from Shopee and Temu -- MercadoLibre slashed its free-shipping threshold from 79 reais to 19 reais (roughly $3.40). The move worked, boosting volumes and engagement, but it also hurt margins. Moreover, logistics and shipping costs will likely remain elevated in the near term as the company works to defend its share.
While this move has largely helped the tech company keep customers coming back, it underscores a bigger risk: In markets where consumer purchasing power is limited, price sensitivity is high. If MercadoLibre has to lean on subsidies and free shipping continuously, it could put sustained pressure on its long-term profitability.
In other words, margins could remain depressed -- or even declining further in the coming quarters.
And there are other challenges ahead
Latin America itself adds another layer of complexity. Inflation, currency swings, and political shifts remain part of the equation. The Argentine peso continues to be a headwind, while Brazil and Mexico -- though offering scale -- are also highly competitive markets.
Speaking of competition, Shopee has overtaken MercadoLibre by order volume in Brazil, relying on subsidies and gamified shopping to win cost-conscious consumers. Temu, owned by PDD Holdings, is flooding the region with ultra-cheap goods shipped from China. Meanwhile, Nubank is expanding aggressively in digital finance, challenging Mercado Pago's dominance.
Put together, these pressures make MercadoLibre's execution even more critical. It's not enough to grow; the company must grow efficiently and defensively. The silver lining is that Latin America is a vast market, so many players can compete and still do well in the long run.
What it means for investors
So, is MercadoLibre still a solid growth stock? The answer is yes -- but with caveats.
- The opportunity remains massive. Latin America's e-commerce penetration is still relatively low compared to developed markets, and digital payments adoption has plenty of room to grow.
- The moat is intact. MercadoLibre's scale, logistics network, and fintech flywheel are powerful advantages.
- But the risks are higher. Margin pressure, rising reinvestment, and a more challenging competitive landscape make the path forward less predictable.
MercadoLibre isn't broken. But it's no longer the simple growth story it was five years ago.
For long-term investors, the company still represents one of the best ways to play Latin America's digital transformation. The difference now is that execution risk sits front and center -- and that means investors must actively track the company's performance in the coming quarters."

On Sept. 16, the company announced an AI infrastructure project called Stargate UK, whereby it is partnering with other businesses and the British government to boost AI tech in the United Kingdom.
This followed the government's call ""to make sure that Britain maintains its position as a world leader in AI."" To do so, the country plans to increase its computing capacity by a minimum of 20x by 2030, with Stargate serving as a step toward that goal.
Great Britain's flurry of AI activity this year led Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to declare, ""The U.K. will be an AI superpower."" While OpenAI's Stargate project helps the British government meet its AI objectives, it also creates opportunities for Amazon (AMZN -0.54%) and Alphabet (GOOG 2.03%) (GOOGL 2.10%). Here's what investors should know about Stargate UK's implications for this pair of tech giants.
How Stargate UK helps Amazon and Alphabet
The Stargate UK initiative illustrates why the AI market is expected to see incredible growth in the coming years. Analyst forecasts estimate the industry will hit $244 billion in 2025 and expand to $1 trillion by 2031 as businesses and governments around the world rush to adopt AI. OpenAI's Stargate can't support this level of expansion alone, which will enable Amazon and Alphabet to gain from the rising demand for computing capacity.
Both possess some of the world's largest cloud computing infrastructure. Amazon is the global leader here, and Alphabet is third behind Microsoft. Building on this success, they have constructed custom semiconductor chips to power their AI systems, creating competitors for Nvidia's pricey AI chips. This allows them to enhance AI performance while managing costs, which can help them capture customers.
In addition, Amazon partnered with artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic last year, integrating the latter's AI models into Amazon's services.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's research division, Google DeepMind, achieved a milestone on the path to artificial general intelligence. DeepMind's AI became the first to win a gold medal in an international computer programming competition, demonstrating AI's potential to match human thinking. DeepMind is based in the U.K.
Factors contributing to Amazon and Alphabet's AI might
Such AI advancements mean Amazon and Alphabet are well placed to meet the growing artificial intelligence needs of organizations, which require technologies tailored to the unique demands of AI systems.
The two companies now find themselves in a technological position similar to that of the broadband providers that replaced dial-up providers in the early days of the internet.
Moreover, Amazon and Alphabet continue to invest heavily in tech infrastructure to power their AI ambitions. Alphabet poured $67 billion into capital expenditures over the trailing 12 months through the second quarter. Amazon's capex was an astounding $103 billion over the same period.
Alphabet committed 5 billion pounds in support of the British government's AI efforts, including the opening of a data center near London on Sept. 16, coincidentally, the same day OpenAI announced Stargate UK. Amazon aims to rival Stargate's scale through Project Rainier, which the company calls ""the world's most powerful computer for training artificial intelligence (AI) models.""
The pair can afford these costs. After its $67 billion in capex spending, Alphabet was left with $66.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the last 12 months through Q2. Amazon's FCF was $18.2 billion over that time.
Investing in these quiet winners
With AI as the latest growth driver for Amazon and Alphabet's businesses for years to come, now is a good time to consider scooping up their stocks. Here's a look at each one's share price valuation using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which reflects what investors are willing to pay for every dollar of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.
Contrasting these numbers against those of AI luminaries Microsoft and Nvidia provides some context. OpenAI is collaborating with Nvidia on the Stargate UK project, while Microsoft invested billions of dollars in OpenAI.
The chart shows Amazon and Alphabet sport more attractive valuations than Microsoft and Nvidia, as indicated by the lower P/E ratios. In fact, Amazon's earnings multiple has dropped from last year, and while Alphabet's has risen, it remains considerably below those of its AI counterparts.
This suggests the potential upside from the U.K.'s AI investments may not be fully baked into Amazon and Alphabet's stock prices, given that they are indirect beneficiaries of the Stargate deal. Investing in these major AI companies now offers an opportunity for share price appreciation over the long term as the AI sector expands."

That’s because Amazon‘s October Prime Day sales are slated to start on Tuesday for two days. The online marketplace isn’t the only one jump-starting the holiday shopping season with early specials. Target Corp. said on Sept. 22 that was giving its paid 360 members special perks, including early access to select discounts on apparel and shoes during Circle Week that started Sunday and running through Saturday. Included in its specials is a 20 percent discount on Converse shoes. The mass discounter is also including on shoes from Crocs and Hey Dude among the items slated for daily deals, with prices starting at 40 percent off or more.
Target’s discount competitor Walmart Inc. is also getting into the early holiday shopping war, with its week of Walmart Deals starting on Tuesday, although Walmart+ members get the benefit of a head start beginning Monday night at 7 p.m. ET. Included in Walmart’s fashion specials is a Madden Girl women’s Bells slide-on heeled mule at $25 off.

Adobe Analytics is predicting the pre-holiday discounts during the two-day Amazon event will entice some shopping to start their shopping early. Adobe is forecasting $8-9 billion will be spent on Oct. 7 and 8, representing 6.2 percent growth year-over-year. Discounts off listed prices are expected to peak at 17 percent. Adobe also expects Buy Now Pay Later to drive $723 million in online spend, up 8.1 percent year-over-year, as consumers find ways to gain greater flexibility in their budgets.
Initially, the overall holiday outlook wasn’t promising. PwC’s 2025 Holiday Outlook survey projected a 7 percent to 10 percent decline in year-over-year shoe purchases, but that was based on a study that was conducted in June when there was more uncertainty over reciprocal tariffs. Overall holiday spending is projected to fall by 5 percent from 2024 levels, representing the first notable drop since 2020.
And value this year has been a key theme for consumers. It was the key theme for this year’s back-to-school (bts) shopping season. An AlixPartners study in partnership with the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America — polled in June, with data results disclosed in July — noted that tariffs and shoe prices had parents considering either trade-down options or buying fewer pairs. But those results could be outdated now because trade deals were still being negotiated at the time of the survey, and responses were reflecting expectations that shoe prices could spike by 10 percent to 25 percent.
More recently, Deloitte’s annual holiday retail forecast disclosed last month projected a sales increase of between 2.9 percent and 3.4 percent from 2024 levels to total between $1.61 trillion to $1.62 trillion during the November to January timeframe. That’s a smaller growth pace than the 4.2 percent rise in holiday sales last year.
Shoe brands have implemented incremental price increases. Nike has raised prices, but the athletic giant’s average increase is between $2 and $10, with no increases for items priced under $100. On Holding’s CEO and CFO Martin Hoffmann said in August that the brand selectively raised prices in the U.S. in July. He also said the increases had no impact on the firm’s second quarter profitability. And with a strong order book for the fall/winter season, the company raised its 2025 guidance.
So what does all this mean for shoe companies and retailers?
Back-to-school has become a bellwether for anyone wanting to read the tea leaves on holiday shopping. And this year’s bts selling season held up well. “August retail sales surprised to the upside, with 5.4 percent growth versus August 2024, excluding auto and gas. Modestly rising [inflation] acceleration has not yet deterred U.S. shoppers, echoing sentiments we heard in the recent second quarter reporting season about a reasonable summer selling period,” noted David Silverman, senior director at Fitch Ratings, a credit ratings firm. The credit analyst said August retail sales boded well for the remainder of the bts period, which typicall runs through the end of September. U.S. retail sales for September are due out in a few weeks.
BTIG’s consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst Janine Stichter said Monday in a research note that there are indications of consumer resilience, noting that price increases “have yet to truly hit consumer demand.” She did note that prices could still rise more than initially thought, reflecting higher tariff rates than what many shoe brands had planned in their early projections. That would mean the impact of higher prices probably won’t be felt until later in the year and into spring ’26. That could bode well for early holiday shoppers buying now and taking advantage of sales promotions.
Similarly, a report last week from economists at Wells Fargo concluded that “consumer resilience remains intact,” noting that what stood out to them in the August retail sales report was “growth in discretionary purchases.”
“Continued discretionary spending tells us that, even as household wallets have shifted this year in an effort to mitigate tariff-induced uncertainty, consumers haven’t gone into hiding and are still spending,” they said, adding that while higher prices for necessities may be “crimping” shoppers’ ability to spend elsewhere, they’re “not halting” their spending."

For more, we're going to bring in here Joe Mazzola, Head of Trading and Derivative Strategist at Charles Schwab.
Joe, it is always good to see you because you have such a good line of sight on how investors are feeling given all those many Schwab customers, Joe.
What's interesting is, if if I'm seeing this right, Joe, it sounds like they're adding risk, but also nearly 40% feel bearish here. So, am I reading that right? Reconcile that for me.
No, you got it. That's why uh, that's why we look at the stacks because that's the behavior side, right? So we we we have two surveys that we do or or two measures, is a better way to put it that we do on a monthly basis. The one is the behavior report, which is the Schwab trading activity Index, which is what you highlighted. And then we also provide a uh attitudinal survey if you will, we asked about a thousand traders, how are you feeling right now?
And what's interesting, and Josh, this is kind of the the the wall of worry climbing that we're seeing is that uh not only are they adding risk and staying uh staying invested in the market, you know, they're they're switching to more volatile, higher beta names, but yet they're not feeling very comfortable while they're doing it.
I think uh that comes down to a few things. I think um, you know, there's this belief that the AI trade is maybe a little bit long in the tooth. Uh valuations are high across the technology. and then they look, there's still concern about uh, you know, what could happen with the trade tariff policy and then also some of the um, you know, some of some of the tumult in Washington if you will.
In terms of sectors, Joe, it's interesting because it looks like, it looks like they're selling tech broadly, but then they're they're buying some some of these high beta AI names like Nvidia and Palantir and CoreWeave?
Yeah. No, I mean, you got it. I mean it was one of those things where uh you sell, sell the broad-based index or sell the ETFs as a way to kind of uh funnel that money into more of a certain, you know, a small uh sliver of stocks and I I think that's what we're kind of seeing. I mean, even if you look at outside of what Schwab Schwab clients are doing, we'll just kind of look at the overall uh S&P 500. On a day like today, you know, we basically were even advanced decliners. Um and then if you look at market breadth, uh it's only about 57% of the stocks above the 50 day moving average. So, you know, if you use the analogy of generals and soldiers, it's the generals that are doing the marching right now and we want to make sure that we have some type of uh protection should there be some unknown catalyst that that shakes up the markets a little bit. We need to get those soldiers involved a little bit more. We need to see that breadth uh wide now.
I'm I'm curious, Joe, since we're talking some AI names here. What what do you make of this talk bubbling up of of an AI bubble?
You know, it's interesting in just kind of a circular uh fashion of the the financing that's going on. I I think it's something that needs to be, you know, you you need to be at least aware of that. Um,
and with AMD, a move that we saw today are incredible. I mean, 30% on a the the market cap, the size of AMD, that's a monstrous move. It's it's unbelievable to see something move that quickly. We saw the same thing with Oracle and they, you know, that was number that was number three on our list of client buys in in September. So, you know, the the money's moving into uh small, uh AI AI adjacent, as you mentioned even kind of the crypto adjacent as well, too."

While Snowflake provides a pure-play cloud data warehousing and analytics platform, Amazon, through its cloud computing platform, AWS, offers solutions such as Amazon Redshift and SageMaker, enabling advanced data analytics and machine learning capabilities.
Per the Grand View Research report, the global cloud analytics market size was valued at $35.39 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach $130.63 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 25.5% from 2025 to 2030. Both Snowflake and Amazon are poised to benefit from this rapid growth pace.
Snowflake or Amazon — Which of these Cloud Data stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.
The Case of SNOW Stock
SNOW is benefiting from strong adoption and increasing usage of its platform, as reflected by the net revenue retention rate of 125% in the second quarter of fiscal 2026. The company reported 19% year-over-year growth in the number of customers, reaching 12,062 in the second quarter of fiscal 2026. The company now has 654 customers with trailing 12-month product revenues greater than $1 million and 751 Forbes Global 2000 customers.
Snowflake’s expanding portfolio has been a significant growth driver. The company launched approximately 250 new capabilities in the first half of fiscal 2026, including Snowflake Intelligence, Cortex AI SQL, Gen2 warehouses, Snowflake Postgres and Snowflake OpenFlow. These innovations simplify data management, enhance performance and enable AI-driven insights.
Building on this momentum, SNOW recently launched Cortex AI for Financial Services and a managed Model Context Protocol Server, enabling financial institutions to securely deploy AI models, agents and apps using unified proprietary and third-party data within Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud.
Snowflake’s collaboration with OpenAI, Anthropic and Microsoft Azure is expanding its reach and enhancing its AI capabilities. Azure was the fastest-growing cloud for Snowflake, with 40% year-over-year growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2026.
The Case of AMZN Stock
Amazon is expanding its footprint with Redshift, its fully managed, petabyte-scale cloud data warehouse service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), to provide faster analytics and seamless SQL-based integration for enterprise customers.
The growing adoption of AWS services, including Redshift, has contributed significantly to AWS’s financial performance. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS reported revenues of $30.9 billion, marking a 17.5% year-over-year increase. AWS now has an annual revenue run rate exceeding $123 billion.
Amazon continues to see strong demand for its cloud services, driven by enterprises accelerating their migration from on-premises to the cloud and leveraging generative AI capabilities.
In the second quarter of 2025, AWS supported organizations of all sizes as they transitioned to the cloud, securing agreements with major companies such as PepsiCo, Airbnb, Peloton, NASDAQ and Nissan Motor."

Despite mounting concerns over a government shutdown and fresh warnings of an AI ""bubble,"" strategists across Wall Street say there's still upside for US equities heading into year-end.
Ed Yardeni, veteran market watcher and president of Yardeni Research, raised his S&P 500 (^GSPC) target back to 7,000, describing the current rally as a ""slow-motion melt-up"" fueled by earnings resilience and further support from Fed rate cuts.
Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel echoed that view, keeping a base-case target of 7,750 for 2026 and assigning a 30% chance of a ""bubble scenario"" that could see the S&P 500 hit 9,000 by the end of next year, driven by accelerating capital markets and continued AI investment.
Signs of that exuberance are already emerging: On Monday, OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) announced a multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that gives the ChatGPT maker the right to acquire up to 10% of the chipmaker as part of what executives have described as ""the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.""
That wave of AI spending has prompted several high-profile voices to weigh in. Last week, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos described the current boom as a ""good kind of bubble"" that could spark massive investment and innovation, ultimately benefiting the broader economy.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon offered a more cautious tone, warning that while tech and stimulus tailwinds could keep the economy accelerating into 2026, investors should not be surprised to see a drawdown in the next 12 to 24 months as some capital fails to generate returns.
The debate over whether markets are veering into bubble territory comes as valuations hover well above historical norms.
According to DataTrek Research, the S&P 500 is trading at about 25 times expected earnings for this year, a level the firm said ""reflects complete confidence (and then some)"" that profits will meet expectations. That implies earnings will climb 13% next year and another 10% in 2027.
That means ""higher valuations than historical norms are the key to further upside for the S&P 500,"" DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote. He added that ""solid earnings growth over the next 2–3 years [is] already baked into stock prices.""
In other words, much of this rally still rests on the shoulders of Big Tech."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-06T16:01:00,Amazon Expands Global Footprint: Will It Drive International Sales?,"AMZN's bold global push is paying off, with overseas sales soaring and new tech, AI and video ads driving stronger margins.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=71de0f720aaab0e1bdde84b4f284c9a6ad6bc51ec99f996166e9d5b176a8a0df,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-expands-global-footprint-drive-160100806.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-expands-global-footprint-drive-160100806.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-expands-global-footprint-drive-160100806.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Amazon AMZN continues to gain momentum from its aggressive international expansion strategy. In the second quarter of 2025, international segment sales rose 16% year over year to $36.8 billion, outpacing North America’s 11% growth. Management highlighted it as a strong quarter for both revenue and profitability, with operating margin improving by 320 basis points. The acceleration from just 5% growth in the first quarter underscores how rapidly Amazon’s overseas retail operations are gaining momentum.
A key driver of this success is the expansion of Prime Video advertising into fast-growing markets such as Brazil, India, Japan, the Netherlands and New Zealand. This move not only enhances monetization opportunities but also strengthens user engagement in high-growth regions. Additionally, Amazon is deploying AI-driven tools, generative AI and robotics to streamline shopping experiences and improve delivery efficiency worldwide. The company’s €700 million investment in European logistics and automation aims to accelerate delivery speeds, lift order conversion and lower long-term costs.
While international operations remain sensitive to currency headwinds and early-stage infrastructure costs, the growth trajectory remains strong. The Zacks model projects international sales to rise 8.4% in 2025 and 8.3% in 2026, supported by Amazon’s expanding global reach and efficiency gains.
Amazon’s technology-led expansion and focus on automation and premium services are laying the foundation for resilient, long-term growth in international sales. As emerging markets mature and efficiencies accelerate, its global operations are poised to become a powerful catalyst for sustained top-line expansion.
Amazon’s Biggest Challenges in Global Markets
Walmart Inc. WMT competes with Amazon globally by leveraging its vast physical retail dominance and grocery expertise. While Amazon leads in e-commerce, Walmart’s omnichannel strategy — integrating stores with digital platforms and BOPUS services — drives strong growth. Walmart International’s sales rose 10.5% (cc) in second-quarter fiscal 2026, fueled by China, Flipkart and Walmex. Through localized acquisitions like Flipkart, Walmart strengthens its global foothold, blending scale, logistics and grocery leadership, where Amazon continues to face challenges.
Microsoft MSFT competes fiercely with Amazon through its Azure cloud platform, leveraging deep enterprise integration and hybrid flexibility. Microsoft’s global expansion of data centers ensures compliance and performance advantages across markets. Partnering with OpenAI, Microsoft embeds cutting-edge AI into Azure, strengthening its leadership in enterprise and AI cloud services. With robust infrastructure and trusted enterprise ties, Microsoft remains Amazon’s most formidable rival in global cloud dominance."

OpenAI's E-Commerce Partnerships
Just like Amazon in its early days, OpenAI doesn't have an inventory of products that it can readily offer to consumers. Instead of buying warehouses, OpenAI has joined forces with Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP). U.S. customers can buy directly from U.S. Etsy sellers in ChatGPT, while more than 1 million Shopify merchants will join them very soon.
Etsy and Shopify shares rallied to 52-week highs on the news last week and are firmly outperforming the stock market year-to-date. OpenAI may partner with more e-commerce platforms, including Amazon, in the future. However, even if Amazon partners with OpenAI to retain customers, the e-commerce giant won't make as much from online ads if everyone does their shopping on ChatGPT.
Other large language models like Gemini and Grok may support e-commerce shopping in the future, and it may be the biggest innovation in the industry since Amazon's e-commerce platform and Sears' mail-order catalog in the late 19th century and for most of the 1900s.

ChatGPT Gets More Involved In People's Lives
The push into e-commerce can more deeply integrate ChatGPT into people's lives. It can be the tool you use for everything. It combines Google's ability to find information on any subject with Amazon's ability to let you buy various products and receive enticing product recommendations. However, ChatGPT can also do the shopping for you, just like a virtual assistant.
""This marks the next step in agentic commerce, where ChatGPT doesn't just help you find what to buy, it also helps you buy it,"" OpenAI said in its statement. ""For shoppers, it's seamless: go from chat to checkout in just a few taps. For sellers, it's a new way to reach hundreds of millions of people while keeping full control of their payments, systems, and customer relationships."""

AMZN sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Growth Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. Earnings and sales are forecasted to increase 22.2% and 10.9% year-over-year, respectively.
Three analysts revised their earnings upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $6.76 per share. AMZN boasts an average earnings surprise of 23%.
Looking at cash flow, Amazon is expected to report cash flow growth of 42.8% this year; AMZN has generated cash flow growth of 27.4% over the past three to five years.

Nvidia's (NVDA) next decade could make lawyers — and maybe investors — rethink everything.
""Nvidia is going to make a ... chip reasoning platform,"" CNBC's ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (see the video above; listen below). ""The next one is going to be, 'Let me tell you what I think,' and it's going to be maybe superior to how you're thinking. That's the big breakout ... the reasoning one.""
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Cramer, who was among the earliest to tout Nvidia when it was still dismissed as a gaming chipmaker, said if Nvidia executes, its chips could make judgments with ""far fewer mistakes"" than humans.
That ""chip reasoning"" platform could upend industries far beyond tech. He likened it to astronomer Vera Rubin, who pioneered the existence of dark matter. He used law firms as an example, noting that with the system, ""you don't need that fourth-year associate anymore.""
Cramer's conviction in Nvidia runs so deep that, in 2017, he renamed his dog Nvidia to hammer the point home. At the time, Cramer and Sozzi worked together at TheStreet — the business news publication Cramer founded in 1996.
""I couldn't get people to focus on it,"" Cramer said. ""By the way, no one wanted to believe because it was too crazy.""
What he saw during a visit to CEO Jensen Huang's office convinced him that Nvidia was more than just a gaming company. Early demonstrations of artificial intelligence creating art, theater, and even restaurant scenarios were what he described as ""inconceivable.” At the time, Huang urged him to talk up Nvidia.
""I just saw it with my eyes,"" Cramer said. ""I'm going to tell people they must buy this stock.""
Read more: How does Nvidia make money?
Even today, he tells investors to refrain from asking him about Amazon (AMZN) versus Apple (AAPL) — and to heed his advice from 2017.
""Are you an idiot? Buy Nvidia. NVDA,"" he said.
Still, the question for investors now isn't what Nvidia achieved in the past 10 years, but what comes next. Shares are up more than 1,300% in the past five years.
And Nvidia may also face pressure to strike licensing deals to comply with regulatory rules.
""They [Nvidia] do have to start getting deals with the New York Times,"" Cramer warned, pointing to the battle over training data. ""That's why Cloudflare is such a good stock."" Cloudflare (NET) provides web security services.
Cramer's appearance on Opening Bid Unfiltered coincides with the promotion of his eighth book, ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" Like his Nvidia anecdotes, Cramer said the book blends stock-picking stories with investing lessons — though he admits that calling a company like Nvidia early doesn't happen every cycle."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-06T13:00:00,"Amid Several High-Profile Deals, Is It Too Late to Buy CoreWeave Stock?",CoreWeave rose by more than 35% in September.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0b5895d3b5555f7a04cbe1bc4ac65686133001209ec5da2422002a8a59521b8c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/high-profile-deals-is-it-too-late-to-buy-coreweave/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/high-profile-deals-is-it-too-late-to-buy-coreweave/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/high-profile-deals-is-it-too-late-to-buy-coreweave/,fool.com,200,,"CoreWeave (CRWV 4.10%) stock has logged considerable gains in September. It has benefited from high-profile deals.
The first was with Nvidia, in which the chip giant agreed to purchase CoreWeave's residual unsold capacity. Now, expanded deals with OpenAI and Meta Platforms have added further fuel for a CoreWeave stock surge.
However, CoreWeave has only traded on the market since March 28, meaning investors have not had much time to start buying. Are they too late, or can they still take advantage of this opportunity?
The CoreWeave value proposition
CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider, but it stands out from Amazon's AWS and the Microsoft cloud platform Azure because of its added emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI).
CoreWeave designed its platform specifically to handle workloads pertaining to AI, machine learning, visual effects, and high-performance computing.
As previously mentioned, CoreWeave already has many of these companies as clients. Still, it further benefits because companies like Meta Platforms and Alphabet have allocated tens of billions of dollars in 2025 alone for AI-related capital projects.
Thus, in a sense, it should not be a surprise that Nvidia took an interest in CoreWeave's unsold capacity. Nor should it shock investors that OpenAI made an additional $6.5 billion in long-term agreements with the company. Additionally, CoreWeave concluded September with a $14 billion contract with Meta to provide additional cloud capacity.
Moreover, the growth before this was phenomenal. In the first half of 2025, CoreWeave generated $2.2 billion in revenue, a 275% increase from the same period one year ago. Admittedly, it will likely not sustain that growth rate in the long term, but since those numbers do not include the latest deals, investors can probably expect the rapid increases to continue.
Furthermore, the company raised guidance when it announced earnings in mid-August, before announcing the latest deals. For 2025, it forecast revenue of $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. That will rise 174% at the midpoint if that prediction holds.
Concerns about CoreWeave
Nonetheless, the financial picture appears less rosy below the top line. In the first half of 2025, cost and expense growth surged 350% higher, surpassing the rate of revenue growth and resulting in a modest operating loss.
Its spending also led to interest expenses spiking to $531 million during the period. Consequently, CoreWeave lost more than $605 million in the first two quarters of 2025, well above the $452 million loss in the same period one year ago.
Amid that loss, debt levels spiked considerably higher, leaving CoreWeave with almost $8.4 billion in debt, a tremendous burden for a company with less than $2.7 billion in book value.
Also, the company's $1.1 billion in liquidity will absorb around one year of losses at current rates. While it may attain access to some of the $560 million in restricted cash over time, continued losses may force it to issue additional shares or more debt in the near term.
Another effect of the losses is that they leave CoreWeave stock without a P/E ratio. Still, while its 16 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is not cheap, that level is not unusual for a tech growth stock. Considering the company's growth, it could persuade investors to overlook its financial challenges and continue bidding the stock higher.
Is it too late to buy CoreWeave stock?
Despite the size of the recent deals and the growth in the stock price, it is not too late to buy CoreWeave stock.
Indeed, amid massive revenue growth, CoreWeave is sustaining huge losses and burning tremendous amounts of cash. Such conditions make the cloud stock a riskier holding and could pressure its value in the long term, so this stock is probably not suitable for risk-averse investors.

The move will see AMD provide upward of 6 gigawatts of GPUs to the AI juggernaut over several generations, starting with its MI450 chips in the second half of 2026.
As part of the deal, OpenAI will take a stake in AMD worth up to 160 million shares, or roughly 10% of the company. Shares will vest in tranches as AMD hits specific milestones. The tranche will vest when AMD deploys its initial 1 gigawatt of chips.
""Our partnership with OpenAI is expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD while accelerating OpenAI's AI infrastructure buildout,"" AMD CFO Jean Hu said in a statement.
""This agreement creates significant strategic alignment and shareholder value for both AMD and OpenAI and is expected to be highly accretive to AMD's non-GAAP earnings-per-share.""
The deal comes just a few weeks after AMD's chief rival Nvidia (NVDA) announced it is investing $100 billion in OpenAI to help the startup continue to build out its own data centers that power its AI offerings.
OpenAI is currently valued at $500 billion, making it the world's most valuable startup.
Just last month, OpenAI signed a $300 billion agreement to purchase cloud equipment from Oracle (ORCL), according to The Wall Street Journal.
AMD's stock has generally underperformed Nvidia's over the last year, rising just 1% in the past 12 months. Nvidia's stock price rose 52% during the same period.
Things have picked up over the last six months, however, with AMD shares climbing 75%. Nvidia's shares jumped 84%.
The massive influx of spending on AI projects and Wall Street's enormous investments have raised concerns of an AI bubble. During Italian Tech Week last week, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said we're likely seeing such a bubble, but that AI will still provide benefits to industries and consumers across the globe.

Checkout options that let shoppers purchase items and pay for them over time will drive $20.2 billion in holiday spending, up 11% from a year earlier and more than twice the pace of overall spending growth, according to Adobe, which monitors traffic to retail websites and sales of more than 100 million products.
Online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. offer the checkout options in partnership with financial technology firms like Affirm Holdings Inc. and Klarna Group. The financing is popular among young shoppers with low credit scores, especially when they’re encouraged to splurge on discounted merchandise during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.
Buy-now-pay-later financing appeals to “people who are more financially strapped and strained,” Adobe analyst Vivek Pandya said in an interview.
Influencers on platforms like TikTok and Instagram will play an increasingly important in helping shoppers discover new products and visit their websites, Adobe said. The firm also said consumers will boost their use of artificial intelligence chatbots and browsers to search for products, especially toys, electronics and jewelry. Shoppers visiting a retail website via an AI-powered portal tend to spend more time exploring the site and clicking through various pages than those referred by advertisements or other means, Adobe said.

Stay tuned to learn more about the key factors influencing these analyst updates and ways to keep track of future shifts in Amazon’s investment narrative.
What Wall Street Has Been Saying
Recent analyst research on Amazon.com continues to reflect a mix of optimism and caution, as firms evaluate evolving trends in the company’s operations and future potential. Below are the key themes shaping recent Wall Street commentary on the stock:
🐂 Bullish Takeaways
-
Many analysts are increasingly optimistic about Amazon Web Services, viewing the anticipated expansion of capacity in 2025 and 2026 as a catalyst for accelerated revenue growth and improved profitability.
-
Bullish researchers praise Amazon’s disciplined execution, robust cost control, and sustained momentum in North America retail and advertising. Positive commentary often cites the company’s ability to drive higher order volumes and protect margins despite a dynamic consumer backdrop.
-
Partnerships in artificial intelligence and strategic investments are seen as enhancing growth opportunities. Morgan Stanley recently reiterated an Overweight rating and raised its price target from $250 to $280, highlighting AWS momentum and strong Prime engagement.
-
While some bullish analysts acknowledge ongoing valuation debates, they argue that Amazon's long-term growth prospects and continuous innovation justify recent price target increases.
🐻 Bearish Takeaways
-
Some analysts express caution regarding AWS’s pace of margin recovery and warn that growth could lag peers, with particular emphasis on competition from Microsoft and Google. Goldman Sachs recently held its Neutral view and maintained a price target of $240, citing execution risks ahead.
-
Concerns persist about Amazon’s expansion into sectors like grocery, which may introduce margin risk and greater operational complexity. Bearish commentary notes the potential for diluted operating income if new initiatives do not quickly reach scale.
-
Competitive forces from established tech and retail players, including Instacart and Walmart, are cited as enduring headwinds that could constrain market share gains.
-
Some more cautious firms warn that, despite solid long-term positioning, much of the upside is already priced into the stock, and near-term hurdles such as regulatory and consumer-facing challenges warrant continued vigilance."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-06T11:35:00,Where Will MercadoLibre Stock Be in 5 Years?,"MercadoLibre has mastered synergistic growth, but will it continue?",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=65f976a22d50e63988dee6f9c484c7478c1c880532ab5c2a60f4bb5e246a662c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/where-will-mercadolibre-stock-be-in-5-years/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/where-will-mercadolibre-stock-be-in-5-years/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/where-will-mercadolibre-stock-be-in-5-years/,fool.com,200,,"Investors have long been intrigued by the MercadoLibre (MELI -3.31%) growth story. The company pioneered e-commerce and fintech in Latin America, and it stood out with a sort of ""market jiu-jitsu,"" turning the region's weaknesses to the company's advantage.
Despite those successes, its returns over the last year have not significantly exceeded those of the much larger Amazon and dramatically underperformed its competitor in Brazil, Sea Limited.
But instead of giving up on MercadoLibre, investors have reasons to treat this recent performance as a pause, and instead prepare for market-beating returns over the next five years. Here's why.
The MercadoLibre growth path
MercadoLibre operates e-commerce, fintech, and logistics businesses in 18 Latin American countries. These enterprises work both separately and together to drive returns for investors, and, as previously mentioned, it has succeeded in a sort of ""jiu-jitsu"" in its markets.
When Marcos Galperin co-founded MercadoLibre, he faced a challenge to sell online in a cash-based society. To address that issue, the company launched Mercado Pago to sell financial products to reach these consumers. It was so successful that it began serving customers who were not buying on MercadoLibre.
Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 20% for Latin American e-commerce through 2033. Also, various studies point to a 7% to 19% CAGR in Latin American fintech, which should bode well for the long-term future of its industries.
This ""jiu-jitsu"" approach of using what you have to build a dominant position continued with Mercado Envios, its logistics company. Mercado Envios has made it easier for sellers to get orders processed and fulfilled and made shipping more efficient. Consequently, many parts of Latin America now offer the same-day and next-day shipping that American consumers may take for granted.
Additionally, as an e-commerce conglomerate, MercadoLibre is often compared to Amazon. That is understandable, and like Amazon, it leverages its extensive e-commerce site to sell advertising. Although it does not publish specific numbers on the ad business, MercadoLibre told investors that year-over-year ad revenue increased by 50% in the first quarter of 2025 and 38% in Q2.
What the results tell us
In terms of overall revenue, MercadoLibre generated $13 billion in the first half of 2025, a 35% yearly increase, far ahead of the aforementioned forecasted CAGRs.
The largest revenue driver is total payment volume, presumably from Mercado Pago, which rose 41% annually to almost $123 billion. Over the same period, MercadoLibre's gross merchandise volume grew by 19% to nearly $29 billion.
The struggles appear to stem from operating expenses. Although MercadoLibre earned $1.4 billion in the first half of 2025, net income growth was 24%, dramatically lagging the increase in revenue.
The challenge came from the 57% rise in the provision for doubtful accounts as Mercado Pago struggles with more debtors not paying back loans. Mercado Pago has prospered despite this challenge, but it shows its success comes with consequences that may have soured the stock to a degree.
Nonetheless, when pondering what MercadoLibre might do over the next five years, it makes sense to examine its performance over the last five.
Fortunately, it did not face the post-pandemic missteps of Sea Limited. Also, since MercadoLibre's $127 billion market cap is a tiny fraction of Amazon's $2.35 trillion market cap, high percentage growth comes more easily. Thus, it dramatically outperformed both stocks over the last five years.
Admittedly, some investors may balk at the lack of company guidance. Analysts expect MercadoLibre to achieve 36% annual revenue growth in 2025, though forecasts for 2026 point to 27%, which would amount to some slowing.
Also, MercadoLibre's performance has taken MercadoLibre's P/E ratio to 62, far above Amazon's earnings multiple of 34. Still, investors should remember that Amazon often exceeded 100 times earnings during its growth phase, a fact that should make MercadoLibre's somewhat elevated multiple more tolerable.
MercadoLibre in five years
Over the next five years, MercadoLibre is on track to continue earning market-beating returns.
The high provision for doubtful accounts and the slowing revenue growth may be causes for concern, but the company has successfully turned challenges into opportunities for expansion. Also, the financials for the next year and forecasted industry CAGRs point to continuing growth.
As MercadoLibre continues to perform ""market jiu-jitsu"" and capitalizes on opportunities in its region, its successes should translate into stock gains over time."

The stock market rally, led by large-cap tech, comes even as Washington gridlock delays critical economic data, including the September jobs report. Without those figures, both investors and policymakers are flying blind, turning instead to private-sector readings that point to a sharper slowdown in the labor market.
Yet the missing data hasn’t derailed the market’s recent record run.
“There’s a certain amount of nihilism,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. ""All news is good news, and no news matters. By not getting this [jobs report], that’s one less impediment in the market’s relentless rise.”
That relentless rise comes even as questions mount over how long the optimism can last, with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos warning that today’s AI boom may be blurring the line between innovation and excess.
Speaking at Italian Tech Week, Bezos said investors are funding “every experiment” — the good ideas and the bad — making it harder to separate lasting opportunities from hype. Still, he emphasized the underlying technology is real, predicting AI will enhance productivity and quality across nearly every industry.
""We’re in a wonderful period right now where everybody’s so optimistic,"" said George Seay, founder and chairman of hedge fund Annandale Capital. ""It’s really fun while it lasts, and enjoy it while it lasts. But eventually, these things all end at some point. Markets don’t go up forever.”
Seay added that rather than trying to time the next downturn, investors should focus on getting allocations right and avoiding reactionary moves.
“Investors should just ignore that and pick great companies or great ETFs or index funds and just leave it alone and do as little as possible,” he said. “The less they do, the better. Just get your allocation right, get it in place, and go live your life.”
Still, the absence of official data amid the shutdown leaves the Federal Reserve in a difficult position, adding uncertainty around the path of rate cuts and the broader economy.

“It’s a real problem without the government data,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. “We have private-sector data that’s giving us some information, but it’s not at the level that the government data is. So we’re a little bit in the dark."""

Imagine a future where the biggest US stocks like Tesla (TSLA) or Nvidia (NVDA) can be traded around the clock, with the transactions settled in seconds.
Momentum is building toward that vision. The crypto industry, along with Wall Street heavyweights, wants to bring tokenized stocks, or digital versions of traditional shares that are recorded on a blockchain's digital ledger, into the mainstream.
Last month Nasdaq (NDAQ) asked regulators for permission to allow listed stocks to trade in tokenized form on its exchange. If the request is granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it would mark a pivotal step toward merging traditional finance with blockchain. The SEC opened the proposal for public comments in September, with a decision expected within 45 to 90 days of publication.
“Tokenization is like a freight train. It can’t be stopped, and eventually it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Robinhood (HOOD) CEO Vlad Tenev said at a crypto conference in Singapore on Wednesday. Over the summer, the trading platform launched more than 200 US stock and ETF (exchange-traded fund) tokens in Europe.
Meanwhile, Wall Street firms ranging from Goldman Sachs to asset manager BlackRock have already rolled out tokenized money-market funds. BlackRock is also reportedly exploring the launch of tokenized ETFs.
""Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,"" BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said in the company's annual newsletter in July. ""Markets wouldn't need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds.""
Supporters argue that tokenized stocks make trading more accessible to investors, enable exchanges of assets in just one blockchain transaction, and expand their use in lending or as collateral.
“These are financial tools that the retail investor is not used to,” said Kevin Rusher, founder of real-world asset borrowing and lending firm RAAC. ""It lowers the barrier to entry.""
The market for tokenized real-world assets, which include stablecoins, bonds, real estate, and commodities, could swell from about $600 billion in 2025 to nearly $19 trillion by 2033, according to Boston Consulting Group and Ripple.
The rollout of some tokenized equity products abroad have had a rocky start.
Tokens tracking popular stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) in Europe have struggled with thin liquidity, leading to prices diverging from those of actual stocks.
Concerns about third-party issuers have also surfaced."

Why Beta Technologies Matters for Electric Aviation Future
Vermont-based Beta designs, manufactures, and sells high-performance electric aircraft, advanced electric propulsion systems, charging systems, and components.
Electric aviation represents a small but developing corner of the transportation industry, Reuters reported. Only a handful of companies are currently developing and testing commercial aircraft powered by electricity.
“Beta’s IPO plays into two narratives that are resonating with investors: the long-term electrification trend and renewed appetite for selective growth stories,” Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX, told Reuters.
The company said in the IPO filing that its ALIA CTOL electric aircraft has completed thousands of flights, covering nearly 83,000 nautical miles across operations in North America and Europe. The aircraft has been deployed by the U.S. military in training missions, and pilots from the Federal Aviation Administration have also flown it, Beta Technologies said in the IPO filing.

How Beta Technologies Achieves 42% Cost Reduction
Beta Technologies said operating costs for its aircraft are 42% lower than conventional planes, citing internal estimates. The company attributes these savings to a streamlined design approach.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-04T15:45:00,Prediction: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be Worth More Than Alphabet and Amazon Combined by 2030 (Hint: Not Nvidia),An enterprise-centric recurring business can prove to be more resilient than consumer-exposed business models in an uncertain economic environment.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=40a2392e27b9ccb54b2f3caa77cbcff8fcc0ae863036872e14ef70da70145c76,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,fool.com,200,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major disruptive force, transforming businesses and reshaping our daily lives worldwide. Alphabet (GOOG 2.03%) (GOOGL 2.10%) and Amazon (AMZN -0.54%) are widely seen as key beneficiaries of this revolution. Alphabet (through Google Cloud and Workspace) and Amazon (through AWS) serve enterprise markets. Still, they are also heavily exposed to consumer-driven segments, such as digital advertising and e-commerce.
On the other hand, Microsoft (MSFT 0.13%) is more enterprise-centric, with a business model primarily based on seat-based subscriptions and long-term contracts. This recurring, enterprise-first model gives Microsoft stronger visibility than its peers, which are more reliant on cyclical consumer markets.
This edge may help propel Microsoft's market capitalization ahead of Alphabet and Amazon by 2030. Here are some other reasons why this prediction can become a reality in the next few years.
The case for Microsoft
Microsoft's enterprise-focused AI strategy is proving to be a key advantage. Overall, over 800 million monthly active users are engaging with all the AI features embedded in its portfolio.
The company has integrated Copilot across its core offerings, including Office, Teams, Dynamics, Security, and GitHub, and monetizes it through either recurring subscriptions or consumption-based pricing. The Copilot family of apps caters to over 100 million monthly active users. While Copilot is used by nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies, there remains a significant opportunity to further expand usage within existing accounts.
Copilot is also the fastest-growing product in the Microsoft 365 productivity suite. With an installed base (paid M365 commercial seats) of over 430 million and initial pricing of $30 per seat per month, there is still a long runway for seat penetration and an increase in average revenue per user in future years.
Increasing adoption of cloud computing is also a significant growth catalyst. Azure has become the second-largest cloud infrastructure services player globally, with a 20% market share. By aggressively expanding its data center capacity, which now spans over 400 Azure data centers across 70 regions, Microsoft is preparing to meet the rapidly increasing demand for AI.
The company is also rolling out liquid cooling and software improvements at data centers, which are crucial for conserving power while running complex AI workloads. All this can translate into lower unit costs and better margins for Microsoft, especially as workloads scale.
Beyond compute, Microsoft has also built an extensive technology stack. At the data layer, the company has a complete data and analytics platform called Fabric. The company operates Azure AI Foundry at the model layer, enabling enterprises to build, manage, and customize AI applications and agents at scale. Finally, at the application layer, Copilot, Copilot Studio, Copilot Tuning, and SharePoint enable organizations to create millions of custom agents embedded directly in their daily workflows.
Together, this can position Microsoft as the operating system for enterprise AI -- another exceptional opportunity for the long run. The end-to-end stack helps create a sticky customer base, reduces customer churn, and increases contract size. Microsoft already has a contracted backlog of $368 billion at the end of fiscal 2025. The company also has a 98% annuity mix, implying that 98% revenues are recurring in nature. The company, thus, enjoys high revenue visibility in the coming years.
Microsoft trades at 28.3 times forward earnings, which is not exactly cheap. However, the premium is justified considering the durability of its enterprise-first model and the fact that it is in the early stages of AI adoption. Hence, Microsoft's shares could still offer considerable upside over the next five years.
Alphabet and Amazon may stumble
Although Alphabet and Amazon are formidable players in AI, Microsoft appears far more resilient. Alphabet's Gemini family of models is now helping enhance monetization across its core offerings, including Search, YouTube, and Android. Google Cloud is also the third-largest cloud infrastructure services provider, with a 13 % market share.
However, increasing evidence suggests that the company's flagship Google search business has come under intense threat, especially from AI chatbots and other AI-enhanced search engines.
Alphabet also faces risk to its digital advertising business in the current challenging economic environment. The rising number of antitrust cases in the European Union limits its ability to integrate search and digital advertising with AI capabilities. Hence, while at 22.8 times forward earnings, Alphabet looks cheaper than its peers, the discount can be attributed to the inherent challenges faced by its business.
Amazon is also investing heavily in generative AI technologies to strengthen its e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. The company's Bedrock service (used by customers to develop and scale custom AI applications, while also giving access to multiple foundation models) is gaining traction. The company says its custom Trainium chip is showing 30% to 40% better price-performance than other graphics processing units (GPUs) providers in inference workloads. AWS remains the leader in the cloud infrastructure services market, with a 30% market share.
However, the company's key engine, AWS, saw revenue grow at 17.5% year over year in the recent quarter, far lower than the 34% year-over-year growth reported by Azure. The company's e-commerce margins are also low. Hence, Amazon's ability to fund future AI initiatives without compromising on near-term profitability looks weak. Despite these challenges, the company is trading at an elevated valuation multiple of 28.9 times forward earnings, leaving little room for error.
Many prominent analysts also view Microsoft as a company with significant upside potential. Coatue's Philippe Laffont estimates Microsoft's market capitalization to be nearly $5.7 trillion by 2030. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities expects Microsoft's market capitalization to potentially surpass $5 trillion by the end of 2026 (18 months from June 2025).
Hence, Microsoft appears to be better positioned than Alphabet and Amazon to grow in the current economy. In case Alphabet and Amazon stumble, Microsoft's market value can surpass even their combined values by 2030."

My favorites, however, aren't necessarily always the names behind my best stock-buying ideas.
Which tickers I step into largely depends on their price, valuation, and growth prospects at the time. Since these factors regularly change for every organization, so, too, does my list of buy-worthy stocks.
With that in mind, here's a closer look at three of my favorite stocks to buy right now, as you can step in at a discounted price.
Amazon
There's arguably never really a bad time to buy Amazon (AMZN -0.56%). The company is the dominant name in U.S. e-commerce, as well as the biggest name in the global cloud computing market.
It has also been willing and able to evolve its assets and business model -- a wise approach. For instance, in addition to entering (and arguably creating) the public cloud computing industry by launching Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, it's now leveraging its online shopping website as an advertising medium as much as it is an e-commerce platform. The company has done $61 billion in ad business over the past four quarters, versus companywide annual revenue around $700 billion.
So, why are Amazon shares underperforming this year, and down more than 8% since September's high, when most other stocks are up for the same time frame?
It's due to AWS, mostly. Although Amazon's cloud computing division remains a growing cash cow, its progress is suffering a margin-crimpling slowdown driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that rivals like Microsoft and Alphabet's Google don't seem to be experiencing to the same degree.
Just don't give up on Amazon yet. It's maneuvering to rekindle AI-driven growth for AWS.
Although it will take a few quarters to make a measurable difference to its cloud segment's top and bottom lines, Amazon's development of an AI-powered chatbot called Nova is showing promise as a business-building tool.
And the company's business relationship with AI outfit Anthropic is gaining traction while highlighting the power of its home-grown Trainium processor that it hopes will compete with Nvidia's AI chips. This effort will also take some time to prove itself, but there's certainly good reason to expect big things.
In the meantime, remember that AWS' apparent weakness isn't actually rooted in weak orders; it's a reflection of Amazon's struggle to add capacity fast enough to meet soaring demand. That's a pretty nice problem to have. The cloud segment reported a business backlog of $195 billion as of the second quarter, up 25% from year-earlier levels.
The point is: You just have to be patient.
Twilio
In retrospect, Twilio (TWLO 0.84%) was one of the market's earliest major AI businesses. But nobody fully appreciated that its tech was a kind of AI when the company was launched in 2008.
Twilio helps companies ranging from banks to restaurants to retailers automate their communications with customers, whether by text messages, voice phone calls, online chats, or other means. It automates what was previously (inefficiently) handled by humans.
The advent of modern AI takes this technology to a whole new level. Now, Twilio's solutions include fully automated customer service, customer-specific predictions, and even customer-identity authentication.
The only problem is that although Twilio's services were difficult to replicate in the company's early days, the advent of user-friendly AI has now made it much easier to do so. That's the chief reason this company's stock hasn't made any real progress since late last year and remains well below its pandemic-prompted peak, when consumers were suddenly doing a great deal more online or by phone.
In the bigger picture, last year's tepid organic revenue growth of only 9% underscores this competitive headwind, but Twilio's sales growth for the second quarter of this year has reaccelerated to a pace of 13%, easily topping the company's full-year guidance for organic top-line growth of only 8%.
So that guidance may be understating what actually awaits now that the company has newer and better AI solutions. The analyst community thinks so anyway. Twilio -- now on track to report per-share earnings of $4.55 this year and $5.21 per share for 2025 -- is bargain-priced at less than 20 times next year's expected profits. The stock is also trading nearly 30% below the analysts' current consensus price target of $130.76.
DraftKings
Lastly, add DraftKings (DKNG 3.55%) to your list of investment prospects following the stock's sizable 11.6% setback on Tuesday. That stumble isn't likely to turn into anything more serious, though.
The reason for the sell-off makes enough superficial sense. The website Kalshi reported record-breaking wagering on Saturday. And it then broke that record the next day.
Most of this swell of wagering stemmed from bets on Saturday's college football games followed by Sunday's pro games, so the market understandably viewed Kalshi's growing reach as a threat to more-conventional sport betting platforms like DraftKings and Flutter's FanDuel. And at least some sports fans will opt for Kalshi's offering rather than DraftKings.
But seeing Kalshi as a serious long-term threat to sports-focused sites ignores DraftKings' (not to mention FanDuel's) long-established history as a sports betting service.
First launched as a fantasy sports website in 2012, DraftKings began adding sports-based wagering when the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the federal ban on it in 2018. As of the second quarter of this year, the company operates a conventional online sportsbook in 28 states, with more on the way.
Meanwhile, most U.S. states now permit DraftKings to operate its ""daily"" fantasy sports business, which dishes out prize money to fans who successfully create a new winning fantasy sports team every single day, not unlike Kalshi's offering.
The difference is that Kalshi is still mostly a sociocultural wagering platform allowing individuals to make bets on things like election results, economic data, and which of Taylor Swift's newest songs will be streamed most often. Sure, it also offers sports wagering, but the weekend's sport-based betting surge doesn't feel like the new norm for Kalshi.
It feels like an exception to the norm that will ultimately give way to specialized players like DraftKings, which is still expected to report 33.5% revenue growth this year, pushing profits sharply higher as a result. Next year's growth is projected to be just as impressive.
This might help: Prior to Kalshi's recent head-turning news, 28 of the 37 analysts following DraftKings considered the stock a strong buy, with a consensus target of $54.55 that's more than 40% above the stock's present price. It's unlikely that one good weekend from a rival changed this consensus that much."

But Amazon’s founder says the benefits will be ‘gigantic’
Jeff Bezos joined Sam Altman in admitting the existence of an AI bubble—but Amazon’s founder sees upside.
Recently, many AI-related companies have seen voracious optimism and spikes in valuations. In August, the OpenAI CEO told reporters the AI market was in a bubble. When bubbles happen, “smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Altman warned, drawing parallels with the dot-com boom. Still, he said his personal belief is “on the whole, this would be a huge net win for the economy.”
Now Bezos too is saying an AI bubble exists, and has an even more positive outlook.
The similarity between this bubble and the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s worries investors and comes with high financial risks. But Bezos said the difference in nature of the current AI bubble should provide investors some solace.
“This is a kind of industrial bubble, as opposed to financial bubbles,” he said at Italian Tech Week on Friday.
Ultimately, industrial bubbles can be positive, Bezos added, pointing out that the biotech and pharmaceutical bubble in the 1990s led to the development of life-saving drugs—though in the process, many public companies that IPO’d during the boom went bankrupt or were acquired at a fraction of their starting value by the end. The cumulative net losses to public biotech companies’ bottom lines piled up to more than $40 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2004.
But, Bezos said industrial bubbles are “not nearly as bad” as other bubbles.
“It can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, societies benefit from those investors,” Bezos said. “That is what is going to happen here too. This is real, the benefits to society from AI are going to be gigantic.”
And during bubbles, everything gets funded, he noted. When these periods of excitement come along, investors have a hard time distinguishing the good ideas from the bad, he said, adding this is “probably happening today” with AI investments.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently made similar comments, saying an AI bubble is possible but that he would rather see his company “misspend a couple hundred billion dollars” than be late to superintelligence.
But whether AI is in a bubble or not is separate from its transformative potential, Bezos pointed out: “That doesn’t mean anything that is happening isn’t real. AI is real, and it is going to change every industry.”

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-04T09:15:00,3 Must Own Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before 2025 Is Over,AI investing will continue to be a prevalent theme in 2026.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ee38dbd2ac04a57926cdf6216c263189485341493a32324a148db885300be5f7,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-must-own-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-bu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-must-own-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-bu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-must-own-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-bu/,fool.com,200,,"2025 is three-fourths over. While that may be odd to say, the reality is that a new investing year is almost upon us. However, there are still plenty of stocks that are worth buying now, especially to capture an end-of-year rally that may occur as institutional investors reposition their portfolios to capture gains where they think the market will be heading in 2026.
Three stocks that I think are must-owns heading into 2026 are Alphabet (GOOG 2.03%) (GOOGL 2.10%), Meta Platforms (META 1.25%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.56%). All of these could see significant investor interest over the next year as the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race intensifies, making them excellent stocks to own now.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet is the parent company of Google, among many other brands. While it was initially a laggard in the AI arms race, it has caught up and established itself as a top option in the space. Its Gemini generative AI model consistently ranks as one of the best, and it is likely the most quickly used due to its integration with the Google Search engine via AI overviews.
Alphabet was negatively viewed throughout most of 2025 as investors were worried that generative AI could replace the Google Search engine. Additionally, there were antitrust concerns surrounding Google's search engine business, although those fears were relieved when a Judge only required Alphabet to change a few things and didn't require a breakup.
Now that both of those fears are essentially gone, investors can appreciate Alphabet for the impressive business that it is. I predict this will cause the stock price to increase substantially over the next few years, as it still trades at a discount to most of its big tech peers (when measured by its forward price-to-earnings ratio, as seen in the chart below).
Alphabet is a top stock to own heading into 2026, and buying shares even after its sizable run is a smart move.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms is the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, along with a handful of other social media sites. This makes Meta primarily an advertising business, but it's using AI to increase the effectiveness of its platforms.
Meta continues to improve its AI-powered ad tools, but it has already seen higher conversion rates combined with more time spent on its platforms. This increases Meta's revenue, but the effect is far from complete. We'll see more tools released and other technologies implemented that continue to increase effectiveness over the next few years, and this should lead to continued strong growth from Meta, which grew its revenue by an impressive 22% in Q2.
Additionally, Meta released the second generation of its AI glasses. Time will tell if these are a hit among the general population, but if it can produce a piece of hardware that's a must-own, then Meta will have created a brand-new revenue stream out of nothing. Even if it flops, Meta's AI investments in its ad business will pay off, making Meta a great stock for 2026.
3. Amazon
Nearly every person in the U.S. is familiar with Amazon, but few recognize what really drives Amazon's profits: AWS. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud computing wing, and it is essentially Amazon building out excess computing capacity and renting it out to those who need it. This allows clients to move workloads from expensive on-site hardware that must be maintained by skilled labor to Amazon's servers, where this isn't needed.
This has become a popular option for traditional workloads alongside emerging artificial intelligence workloads. As a result, the cloud computing industry is booming.
AWS is the market leader in this industry, but it has grown more slowly than its two primary competitors (Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure). However, it may be able to turn it around in 2026 and deliver strong growth that boosts Amazon.
Although AWS only accounted for 18% of total revenue in Q2, 53% of operating profits came from AWS. This makes AWS' continued growth key for Amazon investors. If AWS can increase its growth rate from its current 17% pace to a much faster 30% to 40% range (how quickly Google Cloud and Azure are growing), Amazon shareholders could be handsomely rewarded in 2026."

While valuations are high, comparisons to the dot-com era suggest this may be a structural shift.
The combined market value of the United States' Magnificent Seven tech giants has now exceeded the entire output of the European Union, as a relentless rally in technology stocks stretches valuations and stokes concerns over potential market excess.
As of the close on 2 October 2025, the seven leading US tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla — commanded a total market capitalisation of $20.8 trillion (€17.7tn), eclipsing the EU’s total economic output of $19.4tn (€16.5tn).
Nvidia alone, now the world’s most valuable company, boasts a market valuation of around $4.3tn (€3.9tn) — equivalent to the GDP of Germany, Europe’s largest economy.
This extraordinary milestone is fuelling debate. Is this a transformative moment for global capitalism, or are we witnessing the early signs of a new tech bubble?
To assess that, we must ask: What truly defines a technology stock bubble — and how does today compare to the speculative frenzy of the early 2000s?
What is a tech bubble?
A tech bubble could be defined not just by high valuations, but by a widespread disconnect between market prices and the underlying economic reality or business fundamentals.
It’s characterised by speculative fervour, excessive investor optimism, and the belief that rapid technological change will deliver limitless profits — often without regard to earnings or sustainable business models.
Renowned economist Robert Shiller describes bubbles as periods of “social contagion” — where stories of quick riches fuel mass enthusiasm, drawing in more investors and driving prices even higher, regardless of the fundamentals.
In this phase, fear of missing out overrides risk assessment.
“Speculative bubbles are fuelled by the contagious spread of market stories, which inspire enthusiasm and a desire to participate among a growing number of investors,"" Robert Shiller wrote in his 'Irrational Exuberance'.
Hyman Minsky, another influential economist, argued that during euphoric booms, speculation becomes the dominant force in markets.
As asset prices climb, they are increasingly justified by narratives rather than data. Eventually, a trigger — whether macroeconomic, regulatory, or psychological — bursts the illusion, leading to a sharp correction. In tech bubbles, this dynamic is often amplified by the allure of innovation.
Investors project exponential growth onto emerging technologies — from dot-coms in the late 1990s to blockchain in the 2010s, and now potentially artificial intelligence.
‘This is not a bubble, but a reshaping of capitalism’
Jordi Visser, senior managing director and head of macro research at 22V Research, argued that branding today’s rally as a bubble misses the point.
“To separate AI from the lazy shorthand of ‘bubble’, we have to recognise that what’s unfolding is not speculative mania but a structural arms race,” he said, pointing to deep investment by governments and corporations in AI capabilities as a matter of national and economic security.
Rather than being driven by unsustainable euphoria, Visser suggests that AI is accelerating a decades-long process of economic concentration. That's one where wealth and innovation are being compressed into fewer hands, be they companies, households or nations.
“Bubbles lift everyone into euphoria; concentration leaves most behind,” he said.
Still, there are signs that investor sentiment is stretching. The speed of capital inflows into AI-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the speculative rise of small-cap AI names, and the dominance of a few megacaps over the broader market may not suggest a full-blown bubble, but they do indicate heightened risk.
Moreover, the structural bets being placed on AI may not all yield long-term gains. As with previous technological revolutions, not every firm will emerge a winner. The ghosts of AOL, BlackBerry and Yahoo! — once market leaders — still linger as reminders of how quickly innovation can outpace incumbency.
Are we in dot-com-like euphoria?
To assess whether we’re in a bubble similar to the late 1990s, it’s worth revisiting the numbers. The current tech rally can be traced back to November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT — a landmark moment for generative artificial intelligence that ignited a new wave of enthusiasm in Silicon Valley and beyond.
Since then, the Nasdaq 100 — the benchmark index for the largest US tech firms — has surged by 140% in under three years.
That’s impressive, but still modest compared to the dot-com era. In the three years leading up to the March 2000 peak, the Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 500%.
By that measure, we’re still far from the level of euphoria that defined the turn-of-the-century tech boom. Valuations, while elevated, are not yet extreme.
One of the most widely used indicators to assess equity valuations is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company’s current share price to its expected earnings over the next 12 months.
Here’s how the Magnificent Seven currently stack up:
Nvidia: 33.2x
Microsoft: 33.2x
Apple: 33.3x
Alphabet: 24.8x
Amazon: 32.1x
Meta: 25.5x
Tesla: 220.0x
Only Tesla appears significantly out of line, trading at a forward P/E of 220 — the highest in the Nasdaq 100 alongside Palantir, another AI-focused firm. Excluding Tesla, the group’s valuations are actually lower than the broader Nasdaq 100, which currently trades above 40x forward earnings.
In this context, while pricing is undoubtedly rich, it doesn’t yet reflect the frothy excesses of the dot-com bubble, at least not by traditional valuation standards.
Bottom Line
Today’s tech rally is extraordinary in both scale and symbolism.
That the world’s top seven tech companies can collectively outvalue the European Union’s economic output speaks volumes about the shifting balance of economic power in the digital age. But by traditional measures of euphoria — explosive price increases, irrational valuations, widespread retail mania — the current cycle falls short of the dot-com peak.
That may offer comfort to some, but the line between structural transformation and speculative excess is often thin."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-03T23:15:00,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Alphabet,It's difficult trying to choose between these two dominant companies.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=70d308ab4c99347f818395c12d664646ea4ea10687254413cf557a0e645e0901,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-amazon-vs-alphabet/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-amazon-vs-alphabet/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-amazon-vs-alphabet/,fool.com,200,,"Given how much impact the tech sector has on the U.S. and global economies these days -- a trend that might become even more prominent in the years and decades ahead -- it's important that investors allocate some portion of their portfolios to these kinds of businesses. This smart strategy can certainly help to boost portfolio returns over the long haul.
Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) and Alphabet (GOOG 2.03%) (GOOGL 2.10%) are two great options to consider. They each possess very favorable traits that make them worthy investment candidates. But which of these ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks is the best one to buy right now?
Amazon's sprawling empire
What makes Amazon unique is that it has its hands in multiple tech-driven markets. For instance, the company is the undisputed leader in online shopping. As the economy expands, spending activity increases, and more transactions shift away from brick-and-mortar retailers, Amazon will keep gaining.
The business is involved in a more exciting area, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) being the leading cloud computing platform in the world. AWS has become an essential partner for its customers, as they move their IT workloads off-premises and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools more. It's contributing more to the overall company's finances, with annualized revenue of $124 billion in the second quarter (ended June 30) and a stellar operating margin of 32.9%. Investors might be interested in owning this stock simply to have exposure to AWS.
Digital advertising is another high-potential area that Amazon has a strong position in. It helped produce almost $16 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, which represented a 22% year-over-year increase. Just in the U.S., Amazon's ad services can reach an audience of more than 300 million people.
It's already a colossal organization. And Amazon is in a good position to keep growing at healthy clip for a long time.
Alphabet leads the AI race
Alphabet is a top choice for investors who want greater exposure to the AI boom. Given the huge capital investments taking place, as well as the general bullishness surrounding this trend, betting on AI seems like a smart move.
Alphabet is involved in many parts of this powerful secular trend. It works on AI research at DeepMind. It develops its own chips, having a presence in infrastructure hardware.
With Google Cloud, which is a direct competitor to AWS, Alphabet has a key platform that serves AI needs of its customers. The company's Gemini large language models are embedded into its user-facing apps. And Alphabet is leveraging AI to improve capabilities for its advertising customers.
While the market seemed to be worried at first that AI was going to dismantle Alphabet, the business is performing well. Revenue and operating income both increased by 14% during the second quarter. Google Search, the company's bread and butter, saw sales rise 12%. Management points to strong adoption of the product's AI Mode feature.
The business is in an enviable position. It possesses many durable competitive advantages, like network effects and its unrivaled ability to collect and leverage data. Plus, it has a fortress balance sheet that minimizes financial risk.
Think about upside
Amazon and Alphabet are two of the best businesses in the world. They dominate the markets that they operate in, and that isn't going to change anytime soon.
Investors should consider the potential upside over the next five years and beyond. Profit growth is one important area to look at. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Amazon's earnings per share are projected to increase at a compound annual rate of 18.6% between 2024 and 2027, higher than Alphabet's expected 14.6% yearly pace.
Valuation is also another critical component. Amazon shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2. Alphabet's trade at a cheaper multiple of 23.4.
I don't see why investors can't own both of these wonderful companies."

Netflix (NFLX) shares fell Friday, cementing their biggest weekly decline since April 4. The stock dropped nearly 5% over the 5-day trading period ending Friday as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk continued to urge consumers to boycott the streaming giant.
The stock has lagged the broader market, which has climbed about 2% to new record highs over the past week, and has also trailed Big Tech peers like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).
The drop comes as Musk amps up calls for a boycott, urging his 227 million followers on X to cancel their Netflix subscriptions and accusing the streamer of pushing alleged transgender messaging in kids' shows.
Over the past several days, Musk has posted or reposted a series of messages criticizing Netflix’s programming: “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” Musk wrote on Tuesday.
Netflix did not respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.
Musk's campaign comes as the streamer prepares to report third quarter earnings later this month. Since the company no longer discloses subscriber numbers on a quarterly basis, the short-term impact of any boycott may be difficult to quantify.
In its most recent earnings report, Netflix topped Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue outlook, although the results failed to clear what many analysts described as a high bar for performance.
The company expects third quarter revenue of $11.53 billion and EPS of $6.87, both above initial consensus estimates. For the full year, Netflix now sees revenue between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, reflecting solid growth in its ad-supported tier, foreign exchange tailwinds, and steady user engagement.
Executives have said ad sales are on pace to roughly double to $3 billion next year, while new seasons of flagship shows like ""Wednesday,"" ""Stranger Things,"" and ""Squid Game,"" alongside expanding live sports offerings, should help sustain momentum.
This isn’t the first time Netflix has found itself at the center of a social media firestorm. In 2020, the streamer faced bipartisan backlash following the release of the French coming-of-age film ""Cuties,"" which critics accused of over-sexualizing young girls.
At the time, subscription analytics firm Antenna reported cancellations surged fivefold, while YipitData found churn hit a multiyear high. The hashtag #CancelNetflix also trended for days. Still, the company weathered that controversy with little long-term damage to its subscriber base."

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
-
Erste Group upgraded Alibaba (BABA) to Buy from Hold. The firm says the company is ""developing very well"" in artificial intelligence applications.
-
Fox Advisors upgraded Instacart (CART) to Outperform from Equal-Weight. The firm thinks the 24% decline in the stock since August 11, including 16% over the past month, on ""overblown"" competitive concerns has made shares ""oversold,"" the firm tells investors.
-
Gordon Haskett upgraded Zillow (Z) to Buy from Hold with a $90 price target, citing the belief that the negative sentiment weighing on the shares over the past two weeks creates ""a favorable risk/reward.""
-
Wells Fargo upgraded Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $212, up from $170. The firm says its concerns around pharmaceutical tariffs, pricing risk and Stelara's loss of exclusivity are now largely behind Johnson & Johnson.
-
Rothschild & Co Redburn upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $417, up from $325. The firm still expects compression in the company's take rate over time, but believes its retail volume growth will help to mitigate this.
Top 5 Downgrades:
-
Jefferies downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $205.16, down from $205.82. Better demand for iPhone 17, likely driven by no price hike in the Pro and Pro Max models and ""an effective price cut"" on the 17 base model, is already in the price, which has led to ""excessive expectations"" on the replacement cycle and prospects of the 18 Fold, the firm tells investors.
-
Piper Sandler downgraded Instacart (CART) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $41, down from $62. The firm cites the company's rising competitive pressures from Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), Uber (UBER) and DoorDash (DASH) for the downgrade.
-
Wolfe Research downgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Peer Perform from Outperform with a fair value range of $70-$80. The firm believes the shares will be range-bound with investors requiring further proof of branded execution before getting more constructive.
-
KeyBanc downgraded Corteva (CTVA) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target after the company announced its intent to separate into two public companies.
-
Goldman Sachs downgraded Bumble (BMBL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $7, down from $8. The stock's risk/reward is more balanced at current levels, the firm tells investors in a research note."

Analyst Edison Lee cut his rating on the stock to underperform from hold, writing that the stock’s current valuation prices in an “overly bullish iPhone outlook.” Shares fell 0.9% on Friday.
The stock’s consensus recommendation — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — now stands at 3.93 out of five, making Apple the least-loved of the Magnificent Seven except for Tesla Inc. Even so, bearish ratings for the stock are relatively rare. Fewer than 7% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a sell-equivalent rating on the shares. Roughly 57% recommend buying, while that ratio is above 90% for Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Amazon.com Inc.
The stock has risen more than 20% off a low hit in early August, an advance that has returned it near record levels. Despite that advance, the stock is barely positive this year, while the Nasdaq 100 Index has risen more than 15%.
Much of the recent strength has come on stronger-than-expected demand for the company’s latest iPhone, as well as optimism over an upcoming foldable model.
Lee wrote that “better demand for iPhone 17, partly due to a price cut on the base model, is already in the price,” and this “has led to excessive expectations on 18 Fold, and the replacement cycle.”
He added that it was unclear what market there would be for a phone that costs around $2,000, and trimmed his price target to $205.16 from $205.82. The stock last closed at $257.13, meaning the new target points to downside of more than 20%.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-03T12:00:00,Some Brands Are Handing Checkout and Fulfillment to Amazon—Here’s Why,Amazon's Multi-Channel Fulfillment and Buy With Prime programs allow brands and retailers to leverage the e-tail giant's logistics prowess.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=710748e43df5e8adb3ac9f5668d5d71f2f4cd38fa2dcecd13409b837317c1b87,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/amazon-steve-madden-buy-with-prime-multi-channel-fulfillment-1234782265/,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/amazon-steve-madden-buy-with-prime-multi-channel-fulfillment-1234782265/,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/amazon-steve-madden-buy-with-prime-multi-channel-fulfillment-1234782265/,sourcingjournal.com,200,,"Amazon has long held a strong position in the fulfillment and logistics market; the e-tail giant ships goods for millions of sellers that offer goods up on its platform.
But in recent years, it has worked to expand that footprint, leveraging its Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) and Buy With Prime programs. MCF allows brands and retailers to fulfill orders placed on their own sites—or other marketplace sites—via Amazon without indicating that to the customer. Buy With Prime, on the other hand, allows brands and retailers to offer consumers the choice to checkout through their Amazon Prime accounts; when they do, the goods, like MCF, are fulfilled by Amazon.
The strategy sees Amazon creeping closer to competition with traditional third-party logistics players who ship goods on behalf of myriad direct-to-consumer brands or manage the fulfillment for large brands’ e-commerce operations.
Buy With Prime transactions also reap the full benefits of Amazon’s customer service and logistics network. So, for instance, if a consumer purchases a product through Buy With Prime and decides to return that item, they can do so directly through Amazon’s channels, rather than interfacing with the brand or retailer directly. To Wain Yu, director of GTM, sales and marketing for Amazon MCF and Buy With Prime, that’s one of the core benefits of the program to Amazon—existing customers have an even greater use for their Prime membership.
“Amazon has capabilities in [the] supply chain that we’ve had to build for ourselves over the years, and just like we’ve done for other capabilities, like AWS [Amazon Web Services], we think the idea of making that available to other merchants and other third-party businesses to use is just a good business to have. It’s a win-win-win for everyone,” he said.
Today, roughly 300,000 sellers use MCF, and the highest-performing categories are consumer electronics, beauty and apparel and footwear. Steve Madden is one of the companies leveraging Buy With Prime. The footwear purveyor has a section of its site labeled, “Prime,” where consumers can purchase Prime-eligible products and receive them in mere days.
Josh Krepon, president of direct-to-consumer at Steve Madden, said partnering with Amazon decreases the average shipping time by multiple days. If Steve Madden ships an item from one of its warehouses, it can take about five to seven days for a consumer to receive the package; with Buy With Prime, that decreases to one or two days.
“The advantage of the Amazon network is pretty clear, in terms of not only the Prime branding itself, but also the shipping speed,” he said.
Amazon has said publicly that, through its MCF program, it will allow clients to ship products sold on other marketplaces, like Walmart, Shein and Temu. Walmart has long remained a competitor to Amazon, and prior to the collapse of the de minimis provision, Temu and Shein’s market share had started to creep up. But Yu said the e-tail giant isn’t concerned about fulfilling orders from other platforms.
“Amazon’s just really customer obsessed. We really just focus on, ‘What is the thing that really drives a lot of value to merchants as a customer, as well as shoppers as a customer?’ We’re kind of obsessed about that, and a little bit less obsessed on, ‘What might this do to Amazon over time?’ The underlying belief there is, if you’re delivering value to customers, some of that value will come back to you in some way over time,” Yu told Sourcing Journal.
That may, in part, be due to the fact that Amazon’s MCF and Buy With Prime programs require a financial investment from individuals and entities storing merchandise in the company’s warehouses.
Yu said MCF functions similarly to Amazon’s Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) program; sellers pay a storage fee and a fulfillment fee. The storage fee is based on the size of the product, the number of cubic feet the seller’s assortment requires and the time those products spend in an Amazon warehouse. The fulfillment fee hinges on the number of units Amazon ships, as well as how large and how heavy those parcels are. Buy With Prime, on the other hand, includes the service fee, the fulfillment fee and a Prime service fee, which Yu said is “basically a fee that [sellers] pay for having the trust of Prime be on their site.” That cost is a percentage of the order value.
That fee structure, paired with figuring out the early wins of the Buy With Prime program, have seen Steve Madden working to figure out which of its products make sense to list via Buy With Prime.
“The challenge has been trying to find the right assortment,” Krepon said. “The greatest learnings for us have been trying to figure out what items we want to set aside that do have that Prime badge featured. It’s been around bestsellers, [and] it’s been around fashion items that we bought into in a meaningful way that we want to highlight.”
Making decisions about which SKUs it should leverage Buy With Prime for has been more time-consuming than expected for Krepon on and his team. While Steve Madden has four of its own warehouses in the U.S., and about 110 stores, adding another fulfillment option still required additional labor on the brand’s side.
“We’ll go through and allocate units to Amazon, and that will be, in effect, another warehouse for us. We operate with four warehouses of our own, where we ship products to customers, in addition to our 110-odd stores. Effectively, we turn on another warehouse with Amazon,” Krepon said.
And once Steve Madden sends the inventory off to Amazon, the company knows only that the e-tail giant is in possession of it—not where it’s stored.
“We don’t actually know where they’re putting it. That’s the secret sauce of Amazon, of trying to figure out how and where to put our products, so that it can get to customers faster,” Krepon explained.
To Krepon’s point, Yu said Amazon does not give up the data that it uses to determine which of its warehouses it will store MCF and Buy With Prime customers’ inventory at.
Steve Madden shipped about 75 of its fall styles to Amazon for its Buy with Prime footprint. Krepon said the quantity the footwear company allocates to the e-tail giant depends entirely on the SKU and the depth of the buy.
“There might be styles where we’ll send them thousands, and there might be some where we just send them hundreds,” he said.
While he noted that the number of styles Steve Madden is using Buy With Prime for today accounts for “a pretty small subset” of what the brand offers consumers on its site, the company is hoping to triple the number of items it offers via Buy With Prime in the coming months.
But, in doing so, Krepon plans to carefully plan which SKUs should be headed Amazon’s way, in part because of the cost of doing business with the e-tail behemoth.
“One of the trade-offs that people should be aware of is, it’s expensive to get product back from Amazon, so I think having a plan for that entire lifecycle of a product is another important piece that I don’t think everyone thinks about,” Krepon said.
Yu said many MCF and Buy With Prime clients have several options for inventory they’re no longer selling on their own sites.
“Some of them basically just liquidate it and use MCF to fulfill that liquidation, wherever they decide to liquidate it,” he said. “Another option is…we do have a bulk removals process where we’re able to take the inventory out of stock and ship it back to wherever they wanted us to ship it to. Sometimes, they actually just decide to sell it on Amazon.”
Despite the logistics involved in investing in Buy With Prime further, Krepon said his interest comes, in some part, from the lift the company has seen to its conversion rates, but also from the continued desire to delight customers.
“From a conversion perspective, we have found that, apples to apples, the conversion is better via the Prime badge,” he said.
For Yu, that’s about trust.
“The presence of Prime on [a client’s] site really is meant to increase trust in the delivery and returns experience that their shoppers are getting,” he said."

Now they're issuing debt, too.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9ebc8c4a7388b7525a4d5ed5602aae323da0b917095af4f246fabc7eaa943f46,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-increasingly-fueled-debt-115949675.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-increasingly-fueled-debt-115949675.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-increasingly-fueled-debt-115949675.html,yahoo.com,200,,"-
Goldman Sachs warned AI spending is increasingly debt-financed, slightly weakening corporate credit quality. The S&P 500 set a new all-time high driven in part by AI spending from Big Tech. Nvidia, Palantir, and Amazon rose yesterday.
The S&P 500 rose to a new all-time high yesterday, up slightly to hit 6,715. AI stocks led the way, again, with Palantir up 1.1%, Nvidia rising 0.91%, and Amazon climbing by 0.81%.
In the absence of macro jobs data, a result of the U.S. government shutdown, traders are piling into AI stocks, ING told clients this morning: “Financial market volatility is falling across the board, partly driven by the U.S. government shutdown and the delay to key data releases such as the September jobs data. Instead, investors remain transfixed by the AI-driven rally in megacap tech shares, which shows no signs of slowing.” S&P futures were up 0.12% this morning, premarket.
Stocks are benefiting from the massive amount of capital expenditure (capex) coming from companies that are investing heavily in AI. Wedbush’s Dan Ives told clients in a note this morning: “For now, AI is being driven by a handful of U.S. Big Tech players spending almost $350 billion on capex this year with now the cavalry coming as more enterprises and governments from around the world get into the AI spending game.
“The Middle East is a perfect example as now Saudi and UAE are diving into the deep end of the pool with Nvidia and U.S. hyperscalers set to build out massive AI-driven data centers to fuel the use cases for the coming years.”
But where is all that money coming from, exactly?
Goldman Sachs notes that, increasingly, it is coming from debt. Over the past three years, most capex came from the cash sitting on tech companies’ balance sheets. But now those companies are increasingly borrowing money to fund AI build-out.
“These AI-related issuers have accounted for $141 billion in corporate credit issuance in 2025 to date, eclipsing full-year 2024 gross supply of $127 billion,” Lotfi Karoui and his colleagues wrote in a note seen by Fortune.
The shift will marginally reduce the quality of corporate credit, Karoui wrote. “The read-through for credit markets is, on the margin, negative, in our view. While not yet a cause for alarm, given both the high cash-flow generation and low leverage among large tech companies, the shifting funding mix of capex beyond cash is worth monitoring.”
The note adds to recent talk on Wall Street about the quality of corporate debt. Two auto-industry companies, First Brands and Tricolor, recently collapsed into bankruptcy because they issued too much debt to lenders who thought they were safe. Jim Chanos and Pimco President Christian Stracke have both recently bemoaned cracks in the private credit market."

Wearables, mobile apps, and online coaching provide real-time data, customized guidance, and ongoing motivation. Rising awareness of obesity, chronic illness, and mental well-being has only accelerated this movement toward proactive self-care.
Technology giants are playing a critical role in this evolution. Apple (AAPL), through the Apple Watch and its Fitness+ platform, blends health tracking with guided training experiences. Amazon (AMZN) is pushing deeper into healthcare with One Medical, combining artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools with virtual care to make health management more convenient. These innovations are transforming how people approach wellness, merging fitness, healthcare, and daily life in ways that amplify industry growth.
The scale of opportunity is underscored by numbers. The global health and wellness market is expected to reach $11 trillion by 2034, advancing at a 5.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2025. Preventive care initiatives, workplace wellness programs, and supportive government policies continue to reinforce this trend. At the same time, specialized offerings such as boutique studios and premium clubs highlight a more integrated view of physical, nutritional and mental health. This is opening new revenue channels for innovators like United Natural Foods (UNFI), American Well Corporation (AMWL), SunOpta (STKL) and Peloton Interactive (PTON).
For investors, the message is straightforward: wellness is here to stay. As consumers continue to prioritize their health, demand for fitness, nutrition, and digital health solutions should remain robust. Our Health & Fitness Screen is designed to highlight leading stocks in this space — including the four above — helping identify opportunities in a market set for sustained expansion.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-03T10:30:00,1 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stock to Buy Right Now,This is at least one stock Buffett and the investing community agree on.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0514b51db30173c9fcccc2bf506595711bd9040c08c9cfe00d844245cc817fbf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/1-no-brainer-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/1-no-brainer-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/1-no-brainer-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-now/,fool.com,200,,"It's hard to believe that Warren Buffett's time as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway is coming to an end. The legendary investor took the holding company from a textile manufacturer in 1965 to become one of the largest companies on the planet today, owning more than 100 businesses and with an equity portfolio worth more than $300 billion.
Berkshire Hathaway stock has wildly outperformed the market over these past few decades, delivering a total gain of 5,502,284% in per-share market value vs. 39,054% for the S&P 500. Today, Berkshire Hathaway has joined the ranks of the $1 trillion market cap club, and investors everywhere follow Buffett's trades and guidance to become more successful investors.
Most Buffett holdings are the antithesis of the hot growth stock. Buffett is known for his value approach to investing, and he steers clear of high-risk stocks or technology that he's not familiar with. But at least one stock that the broader investing community and Warren Buffett can agree upon is Amazon (AMZN -0.56%).
The classic moat
There are several features Buffett loves in a great stock, and one of them is a moat. An economic moat ensures that the business has a product or service that stands out and a leg up on the competition. Amazon's size and name give it a competitive edge, so even though it's not the classic Buffett stock, it has some clear features that fit the mold.
Its core business is of course e-commerce, and it has almost 40% of the market share in the U.S. That's a massive amount of market share for any business, and Amazon can do so much to keep its share because it's so large and has so many resources. It hasn't reported the number of Prime members it has in a while, but it's estimated at 220 million to 240 million. These members rely on it for their everyday essentials and more, and the membership model generates loyalty and repeat purchases.
It also drives growth in its advertising business, since advertisers get access to Amazon's hundreds of millions of Prime members where they're already shopping and ready to make a purchase. More recently, Amazon has developed a robust video ad business for its Prime streaming platform, and it's also expanding the business outside of the Amazon platform.
Amazon's market share lead isn't quite as big in cloud computing, but it's still hefty at 30% of the global market, well ahead of Microsoft Azure's 20%.
Opportunities in AI
Amazon is in constant growth mode to stay on top of its game in all of its categories. Its greatest opportunities today lie in generative artificial intelligence (AI) through its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in developing the most competitive generative AI capabilities to meet every kind of demand, from the small business through its large enterprise clients.
Its signature AI service is called Bedrock, which provides access to a plethora of large-language models (LLM) for clients to customize, but it also has tools for developers to build their own LLMs and for small businesses to use ready-made solutions.
The AI business already has a $123 billion run rate, and CEO Andy Jassy pointed out, ""How often do you have an opportunity that's $123 billion of annual revenue run rate where you say it's still early?""
Indeed, independent sources point to a massive long-term opportunity. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $3.5 trillion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.5%. What we see today continues to grow at a pace that's hard to keep up with as generative AI moves from wonky results to near-human content creation.
Amazon and its peers are using enormous loads of data to access new levels of training, inference, and reasoning, reaching new capabilities that could further revolutionize daily life. The way it's going, AI could eventually take over as Amazon's larger business and launch its stock into new territory.
A great time to buy
Despite its immense size, Amazon's revenue is still growing by double digits -- 12% in the second quarter. That's quite a feat, and with the potential for the AI business, it could keep that up for a while. However, there's some uncertainty in the business due to tariffs and lawsuits, and the market has soured on Amazon stock recently; it's roughly flat this year, despite the ongoing opportunities.
At the current price, Amazon stock trades at 29 times forward, 1-year earnings, which is an attractive entry point for new investors. If you've been on the fence, now could be a fantastic time to take a position in this no-brainer stock."

Its US-listed shares have more than doubled as investors buy into Beijing’s vision for self-reliance in the new tech landscape. And this poster child of China’s AI hopes remains more than 65% below its all-time high while major American hyperscaler stocks have peaked in recent months.

With lingering caution over the Chinese economy and cutthroat market competition, short bets on Alibaba spiked last month. But a share price that’s still relatively attractive and low investment levels among global funds are seen leaving room for a prolonged rally.
“We expect this underweight position to change,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at Gam Investment Management who still sees “significant upside” in Alibaba. “The sentiment could also be fueled by the fear of missing out following the strong share price rally.”
The stock is still in a deep hole versus its 2020 peak following a yearslong selloff on regulatory crackdowns, internal upheaval and faltering Chinese consumption. Domestic price wars in the food-delivery space that briefly interrupted the recent rebound remain a concern as well.
It’s trading at about 22 times estimated forward earnings in Hong Kong, double its three-year average, though just in line with the Hang Seng Tech Index. And it’s well below Alibaba’s peak level of 29 times, and current multiples for Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
“I don’t think anyone will be calling Alibaba’s valuation egregious anytime soon,” said Richard Clode, who manages Janus Henderson’s $6 billion Global Technology Leaders Fund in London. “That’s likely why many global investors feel more comfortable entering here.”
Shares rose as much as 1.7% Friday to the highest level since August 2021, bucking declines in the broader Hong Kong market.
A key question for investors is how much richer a valuation does Alibaba deserve. AI stock valuations worldwide have been raising some eyebrows once again on concerns that services have yet to go mainstream and earn big revenues.
China AI Leader
One of the major drivers for stocks of late has been how much companies plan to spend on developing their AI businesses: the more the better."

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
David Risher, the current CEO of Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), recently shared a bold career move he made in 1996 that earned him a scathing rebuke from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.
Gates Questions Risher’s Unconventional Move To Amazon
In a recent episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, Risher recounted a conversation with Gates in 1996. At that time, Risher was a successful employee at Microsoft when he decided to leave for a new startup called Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.
Gates was not shy about expressing his opinion on Risher’s decision. “You mean to tell me you’re leaving this company for some tiny, little internet bookstore that nobody’s ever heard of... that has got to be the stupidest decision I’ve ever heard anyone made,” Risher quoted Gates as saying.
Risher's Bold Choices Fuel Lyft's Comeback With Customer Focus
Despite Gates’ strong words, Risher was drawn to the opportunity at Amazon. Reflecting on the decision, Risher admitted it wasn’t “entirely rational,” but it marked a significant turning point in his career. Today, he is tasked with scripting a “comeback story” for ride-sharing company, Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT).
Lyft CEO Risher, who took over in 2023, is focusing on a customer-first approach to revive the company, which had lost market share and profitability. He works undercover as a driver to understand rider and driver experiences, leading to innovations like the ""Price Lock"" feature and a 70% earnings guarantee for drivers, boosting driver preference over competitors.

Gates-Bezos Come Together For Robotics
Risher’s leap to Amazon came at a time when the company was still a startup. His decision was influenced by Bezos’s customer-focused approach, a principle that has been a cornerstone of Amazon’s success. Bezos’s philosophy of obsessing over customers and thinking long-term has helped Amazon grow into a $2.3 trillion company today.
Interestingly, both Gates and Bezos have shown interest in the robotics startup FieldAI. This shared interest suggests that despite their differences, both tech moguls recognize the potential of emerging technologies."

With Rental Registries, Cities Seek to Close Data Gap With Landlords
Global companies — especially big tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. — have been trying to secure clean-power sources to decarbonize their supply chains. Corporate PPAs, which are long-term contracts between buyers and sellers for renewable sources like solar and wind, have become a popular tool. In 2024, the volume of such deals from offsite energy sources increased in the Asia-Pacific region by 51% from the year before to 10.3 gigawatts, according to BloombergNEF data.
The three solar projects linked to Microsoft’s PPAs with Shizen have completed project financing, and are located in Japan’s Kyushu and Chugoku regions in the nation’s west, the person said. One of the projects is operating while the others are under construction, according to the person.
Microsoft signed its first long-term renewable deal in Japan in 2023, also with Shizen. The company has a target of cutting more carbon than it emits by 2030, and its contracted volume of clean power has increased 18-fold since 2020, according to its latest sustainability report.
Shizen was founded in 2011 in the wake of Fukushima nuclear disaster as Japan geared toward expanding solar and wind power. It had developed 1.2 gigawatts worth of projects globally as of 2024, and most recently signed a PPA with Alphabet Inc.’s Google for its data center in Chiba prefecture.

This decline stems from a major news outlet and numerous analysts reiterating concerns for the company as Amazon launches its most aggressive expansion in Brazil (MercadoLibre's largest market) yet.
Amazon announced that it would waive all fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) logistics fees and take rates on FBA orders for new Brazilian merchants through the holiday season.
Prime time to grow in Brazil?
While MercadoLibre has faced no shortage of competition from a wide array of peers over the years, Amazon certainly is the 1,000-pound gorilla in the room (or e-commerce warehouse).
However, as dominant as Amazon is in the United States, it currently has to play the role of underdog (albeit a well-armed one) in Brazil.
Buoyed by its industry-leading logistical network, burgeoning customer ecosystem that not only includes e-commerce but also numerous fintech solutions and credit options, MercadoLibre won't be easy to disrupt.
Over just the last decade, MercadoLibre has been a 24-bagger.
These jaw-dropping results occur despite facing competition from:
- Amazon, Walmart, and Costco moving into Mexico.
- Sea Limited's e-commerce unit Shoppee expanding to Brazil.
- China-based Shein and PDD Holding's Temu providing Latin America with a multitude of low-cost goods.
Latin America is a promising growth area for many stocks -- especially e-commerce -- so this competition is going nowhere.
However, MercadoLibre's immense growth optionality and booming ecosystem for its customers should give it a leg up on its peers.
It'll be worth watching how Amazon does this holiday season as it entices new merchants onto its Brazilian marketplace, but MercadoLibre remains best in class in Latin America."

SANTA ROSA, Calif., October 02, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Union Credit, the marketplace that embeds firm, one-click credit offers into everyday digital experiences, today celebrates the two-year anniversary of its marketplace launch. Over the past 24 months, Union Credit has fueled nearly $1 billion in loans and credit lines, brought 70+ lenders live, and connected nearly 45,000 new members to credit unions — with over one-third of them going on to adopt multiple products.
""Our mission from the start has been to weave credit union products directly into consumers’ everyday experiences — turning credit offers into a natural part of the journey, not an afterthought,"" said Dave Buerger, Co-founder and CEO of Union Credit.
""We’ve effectively become the distribution hub for credit unions, much like Amazon transformed distribution for retailers. By embedding credit union offers across digital channels, we ensure consumers can access local, transparent, and competitive financing the moment they need it,"" added Barry Kirby, Co-founder and Chief Revenue Officer of Union Credit.
Union Credit first launched with pre-approved and prequalified email campaigns through partners like Experian and LendingTree, giving consumers a frictionless way to explore credit union products without a hard credit pull. It has since expanded into direct-to-consumer channels by relaunching GoFurther.app and partnering with leading publishers, enabling instant checkout approvals and point-of-sale financing that convert shoppers into credit union members.
Union Credit is especially attuned to the habits and expectations of younger consumers. Gen Z makes up 40% of the U.S. population but only 4% of credit union membership. By embedding financial offers into the digital platforms where Gen Z already shops and spends time, Union Credit helps credit unions reach a generation that values convenience, transparency, and speed — driving down the average age of membership and positioning credit unions for long-term growth and success.
Union Credit’s momentum has been recognized with distinguished honors across fintech, embedded finance, and workplace culture:

Amazon’s new grocery push comes hot on the heels of a flurry of recent moves, ranging from strategic tech partnerships and logistics expansions to a $2.5 billion FTC settlement and continued investment in its delivery network. Despite these headlines, Amazon shares are close to unchanged in 2025, though the total shareholder return over the past year is a healthy 19.4%, signaling resilient long-term momentum even as short-term price action cools.
If Amazon’s evolving retail strategy has you curious about broader market opportunities, it’s a great moment to explore fast growing stocks with high insider ownership.
After a year of lackluster gains and a slew of recent developments, is Amazon’s current share price overlooking further upside, or is the company’s next phase of growth already reflected at these levels?
Most Popular Narrative: 6% Undervalued
The current narrative from Zwfis prices Amazon.com at $234.75 per share, slightly above the recent close of $220.63. This suggests retail investors see untapped upside, with forward-looking expectations driving a higher fair value than today's market.
• Their E-commerce platform is the undisputed leader, especially with its robust options for customers and the scale of its logistics network.
• AWS is considered one of the best cloud services available to companies, particularly with the growing need for this industry, which continues to validate this segment of the business.
Want to know what powers this bullish scenario? The narrative hints at bold growth assumptions for Amazon’s leading retail and cloud businesses, projecting a future trajectory that could surprise Wall Street. See the underlying drivers and the stand-out financial forecast inside the full narrative.

ACV Auctions Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder in ACV Auctions, you need confidence in the company's ability to convert its digital wholesale auction and data services platforms into sustainable market leadership. The recent alliance with Amazon Autos may boost ACV’s data-driven partnerships and headline potential, but it does not remove the significant near-term risk of flat or declining wholesale volumes, which continue to be flagged by management as the biggest headwind for revenue growth. Among ACV’s latest developments, the expanded revolving credit facility to US$250 million, announced in July 2025, is particularly relevant as it suggests increased financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, especially partnerships like the one with Amazon, that may not deliver immediate revenue but could require up-front investment. This added capital might cushion short-term margin pressures if monetization from these new initiatives lags expectations. Yet despite these positive signals, it is important for investors to be mindful that competition from larger incumbents could still weigh on...

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-02T15:10:00,Why The Trade Desk Stock Fell 10.3% in September,"Following a brutal August for the growth stock, shares plummeted even lower in September on intensifying competition.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c766566a9b8811ebbb23efcb9e2d1e7ef50edbf4388b4a10a2819ad7dd2fd903,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/why-the-trade-desk-stock-fell-103-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/why-the-trade-desk-stock-fell-103-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/why-the-trade-desk-stock-fell-103-in-september/,fool.com,200,,"Shares of The Trade Desk (TTD 0.04%) fell a total of 10.3% in September, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, as sentiment toward the stock remained fragile after a brutal August decline. As investors continued digesting the company's slowing growth and its disappointing third-quarter guidance reported in August, September brought another headwind: new competition for Netflix's (NFLX -0.66%) ad inventory from a major, deep-pocketed tech giant.
Everyone wants in on Netflix's ads
The Trade Desk runs a demand-side platform, or DSP, that helps marketers buy digital ads across the open internet. In September, attention swung to Netflix's growing ad business after Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) struck a deal with Netflix to help marketers purchase ad slots from the streaming service alongside other DSPs (including The Trade Desk). The headline itself was not catastrophic, but it reminded investors that Netflix's ad ambitions will attract well-capitalized ad-buying platforms that will compete viciously to get a piece of the growing pie. Indeed, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Yahoo's DSPs were all already working with Netflix, alongside The Trade Desk. Intensifying competition could pressure The Trade Desk's influence and pricing power around a high-profile stream of premium inventory.
This landed just weeks after the company's August report disappointed investors. The company reported 19% revenue growth and guided for just 14% growth. These figures are well below the 25% growth it reported in Q1 but are notably impacted by tough comparisons from the inclusion of political ad spending in the same quarters for 2024.
What to watch
Even after two straight down months, The Trade Desk unfortunately still trades at a valuation that may be too high. Its price-to-earnings ratio of about 58 as of this writing assumes years of durable double-digit top and bottom-line growth, and continued share gains in programmatic advertising despite a red-hot competitive environment.
Of course, a premium like this can be warranted for a category leader with strong client retention and a long runway as ad dollars shift to measurable, automated channels, and The Trade Desk fits this description. That said, competition from giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet is intensifying across retail media, connected TV, and programmatic advertising, throwing a wrench in the bull case by significantly increasing competitive risks.
The Trade Desk's third-quarter earnings report, which is usually released in early November, will be telling. If third-quarter revenue and fourth-quarter guidance imply a stabilized growth rate, sentiment toward the stock could improve. If not -- or if the competitive narrative around marquee partners like Netflix evolves further toward rival platforms -- hesitation is understandable at today's multiple, and shares could underperform from here or even trade lower.
Overall, it makes sense to approach the stock with caution. While The Trade Desk is a great business, an intensely competitive environment means it may make sense to look for a more attractive entry point that does a better job of pricing in risks."

Canada’s tech sector, despite the country’s well-regarded universities and robust government-funded research, has long been made up primarily of regional offices for U.S. tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, with only a few homegrown tech powerhouses to call its own—notably Shopifyand the once-dominant BlackBerry. But with the Trump administration imposing additional hurdles for visas for top tech talent, the Canadian government sees a chance to break that cycle. And its representatives are talking a big game about making the country a wellspring of world-class AI companies.
Government officials at the city, provincial, and federal levels made their case for tech investment last week at the All In AI conference in Montreal. A cornerstone of the federal government’s plan, announced last month, is to team up with Toronto-based large language model developer Cohere, invest in it, and offer it a ton of government contracts, and thereby create a made-in-Canada ecosystem that will then support smaller, up-and-coming AI players.
“We believe that this could be our global Canadian champion, and we won’t let it become a BlackBerry or Nortel, no way,” Canada’s industry minister, Mélanie Joly, told Fortune on the sidelines of All In. “So we will be behind the company. We will promote it, we will push it around the world.” (BlackBerry lives on as a cybersecurity company at a tiny fraction of its size when it was a leading maker of mobile devices 20 years ago, and the telecommunications company Nortel has long since gone bankrupt.)
The Canadian government sees an opening to attract more tech talent to the country in the wake of the $100,000 fee being imposed on new special skills H1-B visa applications by the Trump administration. It is also betting on global investors tiring of the many U.S. initiatives that seem to come out of the blue and create uncertainty for corporations. Joly argues that Canada’s calmer climate right now is just what talent, as well as investors, are craving.
“People are looking for stability, and there’s a lot of instability right now,” she said. “What we’re seeing right now is that capital is trying to hedge itself, so a lot of investors don’t want to be overexposed to certain markets, including the U.S.”
During her closing speech at All In, the minister avoided taking direct swipes at the U.S. Her colleague Evan Solomon, a former news broadcaster hired in May by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to fill the newly created role of minister of AI and digital innovation, even praised the U.S. as a key partner in his speech."

Dublin, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Europe Generative AI in Software Development Lifecycle Market Size, Share & Industry Analysis Report By End-user, By Application, By Country and Growth Forecast, 2025-2032"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The Europe Generative AI in Software Development Lifecycle Market is expected to witness market growth of 33.6% CAGR during the forecast period (2025-2032).
The Germany market dominated the Europe Generative AI in Software Development Lifecycle Market by country in 2024, and is expected to continue to be a dominant market till 2032; thereby, achieving a market value of USD 225.6 million by 2032. The UK market is exhibiting a CAGR of 32.4% during 2025-2032. Additionally, the France market is expected to experience a CAGR of 34.7% during 2025-2032. The Germany and UK led the Europe Generative AI in Software Development Lifecycle Market by Country with a market share of 20.8% and 18.9% in 2024.
The European Generative AI in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) market is based on a governance-first approach, which is guided by the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, which went into effect on August 1, 2024. This law, along with supporting rules like NIS2, the Cyber Resilience Act, DORA, and the EU Data Act, has made it safe and risk-based to use AI tools in development workflows. The AI Office of the European Commission strengthens oversight, standardization, and international coordination, giving businesses more confidence and clarity. Companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, Atlassian, and JetBrains have changed their products to meet compliance standards.
Some important trends in the market are governance-by-design, platformization with European data controls, and a move from help to agentic workflows. Businesses want integrated platforms that cover the entire SDLC and make it easier to follow rules about auditability, data residency, and risk management. Competition is based on trust and distribution. Vendors are putting AI into code editors, repositories, and planning tools while also providing security, observability, and controlled autonomy. Software engineers and DevOps professionals are the ones who get end users to use AI for things like code generation, workflow optimization, and CI/CD. SecOps teams, on the other hand, get better at finding threats and analyzing vulnerabilities.
Application Outlook
Based on Application, the market is segmented into Code Generation & Auto-Completion, Personalized Development Tools, Natural Language Interfaces for Development, AI-Enhanced Design and UX, and Other Application. Among various UK Generative AI in Software Development Lifecycle Market by Application; The Code Generation & Auto-Completion market achieved a market size of USD $8.6 Million in 2024 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.5 % during the forecast period. The Natural Language Interfaces for Development market is predicted to experience a CAGR of 33.2% throughout the forecast period from (2025 - 2032).
Country Outlook
Germany's generative AI in the SDLC is being pushed by regulations that focus on sovereignty, established businesses, and enterprise-grade coding agents. The EU AI Act, which has phased-in requirements starting in August 2025, and BSI advice on bias, security, and transparency are pushing German companies to make risk management, traceability, and model oversight more formal across their development pipelines."

“Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), you know, they do some cost cutting when they have to and if they have to do that, it usually reflects in the earnings moving forward. And there’s just so many areas logistically they’re doing very very well with the consumer.

And I just think that they’re going to continue to outperform. I mean, you could see Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) not doing as well as some of these other companies so far this year, but all of a sudden we see a quarter and Amazon does really well and the stock then moves up quite a bit higher, which I think we’re going to probably see here as we go and approach the fourth quarter this year.”

“The Fund also started a new position in Amazon.com, Inc.

The proliferation of artificial intelligence has led to an explosion of demand for cloud hyperscalers, where Amazon Web Services has the biggest market share. It’s followed by Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud Platform, with Oracle’s huge growth suggesting there’s a fourth major player on the field. CoreWeave Inc. is also garnering investor attention.
The scope of Amazon’s challenge becomes clear in its dwindling stock market valuation. At roughly 25 times expected earnings over the next 12 months compared with 27 times for the Nasdaq 100 Index, Amazon is close to its biggest discount to the tech-heavy benchmark on record. Oracle, on the other hand, is trading at 40 times estimated earnings, near its highest P/E ratio since the dot-com era, while Microsoft trades at nearly 32 times, above its 10-year average.
Alphabet shares are trading for 22 times forward earnings, a modest premium to the company’s long-term average. Although that’s less than Amazon’s multiple, the gap used to be much wider.
Amazon shares dipped 0.6% on Thursday while Alphabet gained 0.1% and Oracle gained 1.7%. Microsoft was little changed.
While the overall expansion of the cloud services market means there may be room for everyone to co-exist, the rising competition is troubling for Amazon since AWS accounted for more than half of operating profit in the second quarter. In late July, the company reported cloud revenue growth that lagged far behind Microsoft and Alphabet, and it gave a weaker-than-expected forecast for operating income.
“Q2 provided the first warning signal that AWS is falling behind Azure when it comes to winning AI work flows, but they are falling behind Oracle and CoreWeave to an even greater extent,” said Clare Pleydell-Bouverie, co-manager of the Liontrust Global Innovation Team in London, which manages roughly $1.3 billion.
These companies will likely remain industry leaders over the coming years, but Amazon may start coming up short by comparison, she added. “We’re not seeing that same AI induced acceleration in their backlog.”"

Here's why the Oracle of Omaha passed on these tech giants.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f3c75f8f171255ae6eb34651985e56b285c570c6d25032fb2bc44669f3314397,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-biggest-investment-regret-111020273.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-biggest-investment-regret-111020273.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-biggest-investment-regret-111020273.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Warren Buffett is famous for his winning investment picks, but even the Oracle of Omaha has some massive regrets. The surprising part? His biggest mistakes weren’t bad investments. Instead, they were great companies he completely ignored.

At Berkshire Hathaway’s 2018 annual meeting, Buffett made the admission about one of the most successful companies of the past two decades.
The Amazon Confession That Shocked Investors
“I blew it,” Buffett said when discussing Amazon. The billionaire investor explained that he had watched Jeff Bezos build the e-commerce giant for years but never invested in the company during its explosive growth phase.
“Obviously, I should have bought it long ago,” Buffett admitted. “I admired it long ago, but I didn’t understand the power of the model. It’s one I missed big time.”
The regret runs deeper than just missing profits. Buffett recognized Amazon’s potential early but talked himself out of investing. “The problem is when I think something will be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it,” he explained.
In another moment of brutal honesty, Buffett said he was “too dumb to realize” Amazon’s potential and admitted, “I did not think Jeff Bezos could succeed on the scale he has.”

The Google Mistake That Still Stings
Amazon isn’t Buffett’s only tech regret. His late business partner Charlie Munger was equally blunt about missing Google in its early days.
“I feel like a horse’s ass for not identifying Google earlier,” Munger once said. “We screwed up.”
Both Buffett and Munger acknowledged they made the wrong call in not buying Google when the search engine was still establishing its dominance. The company went public in 2004 at $85 per share and has split multiple times since then, creating massive wealth for early investors.
Why Buffett Missed These Obvious Winners
The reasons behind these regrets reveal something important about Buffett’s investment philosophy. For decades, he’s followed a strict value investing approach focused on companies within his “circle of competence.”
Technology companies fell outside that circle. Buffett preferred businesses he could easily understand–insurance companies, banks, consumer goods manufacturers and utilities. He avoided tech stocks because he couldn’t predict which companies would succeed in a rapidly changing industry.
This conservative approach made Buffett incredibly wealthy by avoiding busts and focusing on steady, profitable businesses. But it also meant missing some of the biggest winners of the internet age."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-02T10:51:00,Understanding This Quiet Yet Powerful Catalyst for Amazon Stock Is Key to the Bull Thesis (Hint: It's Not AWS),Investors have a lot to like.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=469851977e37ede08c457ed19019b3bd5036eafd6a9d504d767958a0628499bc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/understanding-this-quiet-yet-powerful-catalyst-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/understanding-this-quiet-yet-powerful-catalyst-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/understanding-this-quiet-yet-powerful-catalyst-for/,fool.com,200,,"Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) is best known for its e-commerce empire and its highly profitable cloud arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The tech giant's shares have rallied over the last year, lifting the company's market cap to more than $2.3 trillion as of this writing. That strength reflects solid execution across the business and optimism about the company's growing role in artificial intelligence (AI). Yet one driver often takes the back seat to AWS: advertising.
Advertising is now a sizable, fast-growing revenue line that benefits from Amazon's unmatched data, the shopping intent of visitors, and its expanding media footprint. Further, ad revenue accelerated again in Q2, and recent management commentary points to more opportunity ahead. Put simply, advertising is an important reason the long-term investment case remains compelling.
Advertising momentum keeps building
Amazon's advertising services revenue rose 23% year over year to about $15.7 billion in the second quarter of 2025 (22% growth excluding currency impacts). This followed 18% growth in the first quarter (19% excluding currency impacts), showing healthy acceleration as the year progresses. Drivers include more shopping activity, improved ad tools and measurement, the ongoing rollout of Prime Video ads, and connected-TV (CTV) partnerships that broaden where Amazon can serve ads. Notably, Amazon highlighted a June integration with Roku, with the partnership reaching an estimated 80 million U.S. households. The company's push into CTV expands advertiser reach beyond retail search into high-engagement streaming, where advertisers are willing to pay more for ad spots.
Together with retail search, brand and display placements, and its demand-side platform (DSP), Amazon is deepening the ways it can match advertiser goals with shopper intent and authenticated audiences across its sprawling digital services. In other words, the company isn't just selling placements; it is selling performance.
Why advertising is key to the bull case
Advertising represents high-margin revenue layered on top of Amazon's massive retail and media ecosystem. While the company does not disclose ad margins, the economics are attractive and scale with traffic, selection, and relevance improvements.
Although management doesn't provide specific commentary on its advertising margins, it often implies that they are key to the company's profit growth story.
""Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability"" in both its North America and international segments, said Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky in the company's most recent earnings call.
While Amazon does not break out operating income for advertising separately, the high-margin nature of the business is a meaningful tailwind for overall profitability in North America and internationally. AWS, of course, remains the largest profit center, generating $10.2 billion of operating income in the quarter, but advertising is an increasingly important profit contributor that diversifies and helps stabilize the overall business through cycles.
It's also worth noting that Amazon's capabilities in advertising are difficult for rivals to replicate, given the company's scale. So it wouldn't be surprising to see Amazon continue gaining market share in advertising for years to come.
But this part of Amazon's business comes with risks. Ad budgets are cyclical, and privacy and regulatory changes can impact targeting and measurement. Additionally, competition from other large advertising platforms remains intense. Meanwhile, Amazon stock's valuation already bakes in healthy growth across its businesses. With a market cap in excess of $2.3 trillion, trailing-12-month sales approaching $700 billion, and net income of $70.6 billion for the same period, shares trade at a premium that assumes steady execution. But advertising strengthens the case that Amazon can sustain double-digit top-line growth and rising profitability alongside AWS over time.
AWS may be the more important profit engine today, but advertising is a quiet force that is enhancing Amazon's profit engine. The business benefits from Amazon's data and distribution, adds higher-margin revenue to retail, and opens new monetization surfaces in streaming. For investors evaluating Amazon's long-term return profile, understanding the momentum and durability of advertising -- not just cloud -- is key."

The strategy is aimed at coping with a shortage of AI data center capacity and letting Microsoft free up its own server farms to provide lucrative AI services to customers.
This is just one of a string of deals Microsoft has struck with so-called neoclouds — a new category of small infrastructure providers that lease out AI-focused computing power. Microsoft has inked more than $33 billion in commitments to such providers, including Nebius, CoreWeave Inc., Nscale and Lambda. The deals demonstrate the company’s growing willingness to use relative newcomers for important infrastructure.
Cloud vendors have generally operated their own data centers, but Microsoft is struggling to bring sufficient computing capacity online. Renting access to servers from neoclouds speeds things up since they have already solved logistical challenges including obtaining sufficient power and chips.
“We are in very much land-grab mode in the AI space,” said Scott Guthrie, who leads Microsoft’s cloud efforts. “We’ve made the decision that we don’t want to be constrained in terms of capacity.”
Nebius shares were up about 5.5% at 10:17 a.m. in New York, while Microsoft was mostly unchanged. Nebius and the other neocloud firms declined to comment.
The advent of power-guzzling generative AI has put enormous strain on data center infrastructure. So Microsoft is freeing up capacity in its own data centers for cloud clients by running some computing for internal and OpenAI work at neocloud facilities, Guthrie said.
For example, the first foundation AI models built under consumer AI chief Mustafa Suleyman were trained at a CoreWeave data center near Portland, Oregon, according to people familiar with the work."

2 Great AI Stocks to Buy in October and Hold for 10 Years
Artificial intelligence spending is fueling the Wall Street bull market as big tech bets big on power-hungry AI data centers and beyond. The AI hyperscalers, including Amazon, Meta, and others, are projected to spend roughly $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone. Global data center infrastructure spending is expected to reach $7 trillion by 2030.
There is no end in sight to the wave of AI spending that extends to energy and grid infrastructure because generative AI platforms like ChatGPT use 10X the energy of an average Google search.
The two AI-related stocks we dive into today are not the tech stocks most associated with AI, such as Nvidia. Nonetheless, Constellation Energy and Arista Networks benefit directly from the AI megatrend that’s poised to dominate Wall Street in the back-half of the decade and beyond.
Let’s dive into why investors should buy CEG and ANET now before possible breakouts in October and the fourth quarter. Both AI-boosted stocks are also long-term buy-and-hold candidates.
Nuclear Energy Stock Constellation is a Must-Buy AI Winner
Constellation Energy is at the forefront of the growing relationship between big tech and nuclear energy. CEG earned 20-year power purchase agreements with Microsoft and Meta over the last year to support their AI expansion efforts.
The largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator is ready to transform into one of the energy industry titans of the AI age through Constellation’s $27 billion deal to buy natural gas and geothermal powerhouse Calpine.
CEG’s acquisition, which is expected to close in Q4, creates the largest clean energy firm and expands Constellation’s footprint into power-hungry, tech-heavy Texas and California.
Constellation stock is poised to be one of the most surefire long-term winners in the AI-driven energy age as the U.S. government aims to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and AI hyperscalers go all-in on nuclear and natural gas.
It’s poised to power large swaths of the economy and AI data centers via CEG’s established portfolio of reliable 24/7 power. Constellation is also expanding into next-gen small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), where it competes against pre-revenue home-run stocks such as Oklo.
Constellation raised its dividend by 10% in 2025 and 25% in 2024 as part of a plan to consistently boost its payout to shareholders. The nuclear energy powerhouse is expected to grow its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 9% in 2025 and 27% in 2026."

Coatue curates the Fantastic 40 Growth & Innovation Index, which ranks public and private companies based on growth prospects through 2030.
The index, last updated in June 2025, currently shows buying opportunities in Arm Holdings (ARM 1.81%) and MercadoLibre (MELI -2.82%), as follows:
- Coatue says Arm will be worth $787 billion by 2030. That implies 430% upside from its current market value of $148 billion, which equates to annual returns of nearly 40% over the next five years.
- Coatue believes MercadoLibre will be worth $300 billion by 2030. That implies 150% upside from its current market value of $120 billion, which equates to annual returns of 20% over the next five years.
Here's what investors should know about Arm and MercadoLibre.
Arm Holdings: An Nvidia-backed semiconductor company
Arm is a British chipmaker that designs central processing unit (CPU) architectures and adjacent technologies like software development tools and compute subsystems. Rather than selling finished chips, Arm licenses its intellectual property to other companies that want to develop custom chips for mobile devices, data centers, and automotive systems.
Arm has long been the chip architecture of choice for smartphones and other mobile devices for its energy efficiency. But that same quality, coupled with the flexibility that its business model affords customers, has led to market share gains in data centers amid the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Over 70,000 enterprises now use Arm server CPUs, a 14-fold increase in just four years.
Nvidia has given the company a particularly strong endorsement: It owns a $178 million stake in Arm, and built its Grace CPU (a core component of its rack-scale systems) on Arm architecture. But Nvidia is not the only technology giant to follow that path. Several major clouds -- including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft-- have designed Arm-based server CPUs for their data centers.
Arm reported mixed results in the June quarter, missing expectations on the top line. Total sales increased 12% to $1 billion on strong growth in royalty revenue offset by a decline in licensing revenue. Operating margin contracted 8 percentage points because of an increase in R&D spending, and non-GAAP net income fell 13% to $0.35 per diluted share.
Wall Street estimates Arm's adjusted earnings will increase at 23% annually through the fiscal year ending in March 2027. That makes the current valuation of 87 times earnings look expensive. Admittedly, Arm beat the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 11% in the last six quarters, but shares would still be pricey even if that continues. Investors can buy a small position here, but I would wait for a cheaper price before buying a big chunk of stock.
MercadoLibre: A Latin American e-commerce giant following the Amazon blueprint
MercadoLibre runs the largest online marketplace in Latin America, a region where e-commerce represents just 15% of total retail sales. Comparatively, more than 30% of total retail happens through digital channels in the U.S. MercadoLibre accounted for about 28% of retail e-commerce sales in Latin America last year and its market share is projected to reach 30% in 2026.
Much like Amazon, the company has solidified its leadership by providing services for logistics, payments, and advertising that pull merchants deeper into its ecosystem. The company has built the ""fastest and most extensive delivery network"" in Latin America. It owns one of the largest fintech platforms (Mercado Pago) in the region, and is expected to be the fastest growing ad tech company in the world in 2025.
MercadoLibre reported reasonably good financial results in the second quarter, despite missing the consensus estimate on the bottom line. Total revenue increased 34% to $6.8 billion, representing 29% growth in the commerce segment and 40% growth in the fintech segment. GAAP net income fell 2% to $523 million, but that was due to foreign currency fluctuations and investments in the business that should drive future growth.
Wall Street expects MercadoLibre's earnings to increase at 32% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 58 times earnings look reasonable. The stock has historically been volatile, dropping more than 20% from a record high two times in the last year, because of somewhat challenging macroeconomic conditions in Latin America. But investors comfortable with price swings should buy a position today."

Beginning September 28, Amazon has raised its average hourly base wage in Canada to $24.50 per hour—up from $23.50 in 2024—representing a 4.3% year-over-year increase. This pay increase means frontline Amazon employees working full-time will earn a minimum annual salary of $50,9601."

“Now, we had another one, Amazon. A few weeks ago, this stock was plummeting. Why? Because we heard that Amazon Web Services was falling behind Microsoft’s Azure, something that actually we picked up loud and clear on the show from Snowflake’s explosive conference call. It didn’t help when a Morgan Stanley analyst asked Amazon CEO Andy Jassy if he was worried about falling behind, and Andy didn’t say, ‘We are spending and getting a great return on our spending, whether it’s on our Trainium chips or NVIDIA chips.’ He didn’t say that. The Street was quick to hammer the stock because he didn’t say that.

Before David Risher was tasked with scripting a “comeback story” for ride-sharing company Lyft, he made a career move so audacious that it prompted a direct, and blunt, intervention from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. In a recent appearance on Fortune‘s Leadership Next podcast, Risher shared the moment Gates told him he was making “the stupidest decision I’ve ever heard anyone made.”
The year was 1996, and Risher was enjoying a successful career at Microsoft during the heyday of Windows. In fact, Risher noted he and his wife just had their 30th wedding anniversary, having met “on the first day” at Microsoft. He said it was a very formative time for him and his career at a very competitive company.
But he had been in talks with a man named Jeff Bezos, who was running a brand-new startup called Amazon. When Risher decided to leave the tech giant to join the fledgling online retailer, Gates himself sent an email and called him into his office.
“He says, ‘Hold on for a second. You mean to tell me you’re leaving this company for some tiny, little internet bookstore that nobody’s ever heard of … that has got to be the stupidest decision I’ve ever heard anyone made,'” Risher recalled.
While Risher admitted the move wasn’t “entirely rational,” he said he was drawn to the opportunity. He had first connected with Bezos a year earlier, when the Amazon founder was conducting a reference check. What ultimately convinced Risher to take the leap was Bezos’s intense focus on the customer. “He was very customer-obsessed,” Risher said, noting Bezos’s logic that on the internet, “everyone is one click away from somebody else, so you have to create a great customer experience.” (In fact, Bezos’s management style stressed to Amazonians that they should approach every day from a “day one” mindset.)
Bezos also laid out a compellingly ambitious vision: to grow the then-$15.6 million business into a billion-dollar company by the year 2000. Risher, an avid reader, was captivated by the chance to build something new at the “crazy intersection of technology and culture.” He joined Amazon as its 37th employee, tasked with helping build the “everything store” by adding music, video, and toy categories. The company hit its billion-dollar target a year early, in 1999. The move paid off so well that a “Thank You” letter from Bezos to Risher, dated February 2002, remains on Amazon’s website to this day."

The AI hyperscalers, including Amazon, Meta, and others, are projected to spend roughly $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone. Global data center infrastructure spending is expected to reach $7 trillion by 2030.
There is no end in sight to the wave of AI spending that extends to energy and grid infrastructure because generative AI platforms like ChatGPT use 10X the energy of an average Google search.
The two AI-related stocks we dive into today are not the tech stocks most associated with AI, such as Nvidia. Nonetheless, Constellation Energy and Arista Networks benefit directly from the AI megatrend that’s poised to dominate Wall Street in the back-half of the decade and beyond.

Let’s dive into why investors should buy CEG and ANET now before possible breakouts in October and the fourth quarter. Both AI-boosted stocks are also long-term buy-and-hold candidates.
Nuclear Energy Stock Constellation is a Must-Buy AI Winner
Constellation Energy CEG is at the forefront of the growing relationship between big tech and nuclear energy. CEG earned 20-year power purchase agreements with Microsoft and Meta META over the last year to support their AI expansion efforts.
The largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator is ready to transform into one of the energy industry titans of the AI age through Constellation’s $27 billion deal to buy natural gas and geothermal powerhouse Calpine.
CEG’s acquisition, which is expected to close in Q4, creates the largest clean energy firm and expands Constellation’s footprint into power-hungry, tech-heavy Texas and California.
Constellation stock is poised to be one of the most surefire long-term winners in the AI-driven energy age as the U.S. government aims to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and AI hyperscalers go all-in on nuclear and natural gas.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
It’s poised to power large swaths of the economy and AI data centers via CEG’s established portfolio of reliable 24/7 power. Constellation is also expanding into next-gen small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), where it competes against pre-revenue home-run stocks such as Oklo.
Constellation raised its dividend by 10% in 2025 and 25% in 2024 as part of a plan to consistently boost its payout to shareholders. The nuclear energy powerhouse is expected to grow its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 9% in 2025 and 27% in 2026."

Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, said in a program on CNBC back in December 2024 that Amazon is a “clear” breakout story. Brown said at the time that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) could touch $250.
“Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a clear and present breakout right now. One of the things that I try to do is understand the fundamental story, but it’s important where you get into a stock sometimes. I’ve been in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a long time, so the question is where do I want to add more. Obviously, in a perfect world you have a genie come out of a bottle and say today is the bottom, but since none of us live in that world, the next best thing is to own it when the market has made up its mind that they want to take a name higher. That’s the idea behind averaging up or down into an actual technical breakout. That’s what I think is happening here. I think the stock could get to $250. That’s really like a $21 stock going to 25 — it’s not that big of a deal. This name has been building a base for a really long time, and I’m going to use this tactical breakout as the trigger to get larger.”
At the time of Brown’s call, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was trading at around $212, while the stock is hovering around $222 as of September 30.
Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Earlier this year, we initiated a position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a company we have long studied and admired. Amazon operates two of the world’s great, category-defining franchises: its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business and its e-commerce retail operations. Both AWS and the company’s retail operations are supported by decades-long secular growth trends, occupy dominant positions in their respective markets, and have significant long-term opportunities for margin expansion. Moreover, despite operating in different industries, both businesses share the core tenets of Amazon’s ethos: a relentless focus on the customer, leveraging scale to be the lowest-cost provider, and continually reinvesting to improve their value proposition."

- Amazon rolled its private food labels into a new brand, Amazon Grocery, and said it will continue to expand its offerings.
- The move comes as other food companies try to reach a rising number of consumers shopping store brands.
Amazon is priming its grocery lineup for the private-label craze as shoppers look for more ways to save on food.
Amazon (AMZN) rebranded its private food labels Wednesday after seeing a 15% jump in the number of company-branded products sold. The new brand, Amazon Grocery, pulls in items sold under the Amazon Fresh and Happy Belly labels, and adds new items, such as cinnamon rolls and lemonade. The brand is sold online and at Amazon Fresh markets, with most items priced at under $5, a press release said.
""We're simplifying how customers discover and shop our extensive private label food selection, while maintaining the quality and value our customers expect and deserve,"" Jason Buechel, vice president of Amazon Worldwide Grocery Stores, said in a statement. The news follows the company's announcement of a beefed-up move into grocery delivery.
Why This News Matters to Consumers
Big retailers like Walmart have said they're aware that many consumers' finances are stretched, and looking to help them save. Some have acknowledged prices will rise to help compensate for the cost of tariffs. Store-brand goods are one tool for both helping companies sustain margins and shoppers to sustain budgets.
As consumers try to save, many are shifting to private-label brands, Bank of America said this summer. So-called store brands cost an average of $2 less than alternatives, the bank said.
Amazon isn't the only food company catering to store-brand shoppers. Albertsons Cos. (ACI) launched a line of marinated meats in May, and said it may further expand its private label. Casey's General Stores (CASY) also discussed plans to beef up its private label assortment this summer. Walmart (WMT) today said it wants to remove synthetic dyes from all its private-label products.

DALLAS, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dalfen Industrial announced today the acquisition of a 192,000-square-foot industrial facility located at 5770 Miami Lakes Drive in Miami Lakes, Florida. The transaction, sourced through a long-standing relationship with CBRE, adds a fully leased property—currently occupied by Mr. Glass Doors and Windows—to Dalfen’s growing portfolio.
Located within the highly sought-after Miami Lakes Business Park, the facility offers direct access to major transportation arteries including State Roads 826 and 924, Interstate 75 and 95 South, and is just minutes from Miami International Airport. This strategic positioning makes it a premier location for last-mile distribution. The area is home to major national and global operators such as Amazon, The Boeing Company, Home Depot, Sysco, FedEx, Caterpillar, Target, Nestle, PODS, and Macy’s.
“Miami is one of the most land-constrained and supply-limited industrial markets in the country,” said Tyler McElroy, Market Officer at Dalfen Industrial. “Acquiring this infill asset aligns perfectly with our strategy of investing in top-tier last-mile logistics locations.”
Chris Segrest, Regional SVP of the Southeast Region, added, “This acquisition underscores our commitment to expanding in markets where demand for infill logistics space continues to outpace supply. We will continue to target well-located assets in dynamic, high-growth regions like South Florida.”
With this acquisition, Dalfen Industrial now owns and operates over 3.1 million square feet of industrial real estate across Florida, reinforcing its presence in one of the nation’s most competitive logistics hubs.

The stock's year-to-date level lingers below as potential support, however, as well as a historically bullish trendline.
More specifically, the stock is within 0.75 of the 200-day moving average's 20-day average true range (ATR), after spending at least 80% of the last 10 days and 80% of the last two months above it. This has happened five other times over the past three years, after which the equity was higher one month later 80% of the time, averaging an 8.4% gain.
A move of similar magnitude from its current perch at $221.65 would put AMZN at $240.26, right around that level of resistance and its record peak. With that potential ceiling in mind, now might be a good time to use options trading to bet on a short-term bounce.
The security is seeing attractively priced premium. AMZN's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 29% ranks in the low 11th percentile of its annual range, meaning options traders are pricing in low volatility expectations."

- Amazon has introduced a value-focused private label food brand that spans a broad range of common grocery items, the retailer announced Wednesday.
- The brand, known as Amazon Grocery, replaces the company’s Amazon Fresh and Happy Belly names and will also include newly introduced products. Most products under the new line will cost $5 or less.
- The rollout of Amazon Grocery reflects an effort by Amazon to streamline its private label strategy by consolidating its selection under fewer brands.
Dive Insight:
Amazon characterized the launch of the new grocery brand as a way to make it easier for shoppers to navigate its private label food offerings while also spotlighting the company’s goal of attracting shoppers intent on saving money.
Amazon Grocery encompasses more than 1,000 items including dairy foods, fresh produce, snacks, meat and seafood. Products under the brand are available online and in Amazon Fresh supermarkets.
Amazon said that it has added a number of products to its assortment that will carry the new brand, including fresh cinnamon rolls, refrigerated lemonade and pizza dough. The company said it intends to add items such as frozen pasta meals and pie fillings and expand the variety of deli meats, frozen vegetables and canned beans it offers.
The retailer touted new packaging for Amazon Grocery products that clearly displays nutrition information, uses less plastic and includes type designed to be easy to read.
“With Amazon Grocery, we’re simplifying how customers discover and shop our extensive private label food selection while maintaining the quality and value our customers expect and deserve,” Jason Buechel, vice president of Amazon Worldwide Grocery Stores, said in a statement.
In addition to Amazon Grocery, Amazon sells products under house brands including 365 by Whole Foods Market, which includes natural and organic products, and the value-oriented Amazon Saver line.
Amazon’s private label grocery business has been picking up speed. Shoppers bought 15% more products under the company’s house brands last year than they did in 2023 on the company’s website and at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods, according to the announcement.
Amazon has taken several steps this year to strengthen its grocery business, including its announcement in August that it would offer same-day delivery of perishable foods to thousands of communities across the country by the end of 2025. Amazon has also sought to draw customers to its Amazon Fresh stores by calling attention to the chain’s focus on low prices.
In June, Amazon said it was bringing Whole Foods and the rest of its grocery operations closer together, an initiative that followed its decision in January to appoint Buechel — who also serves as CEO of Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market — to his current role overseeing all of the company’s grocery retail operations."

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is sharpening its grocery strategy with the launch of a new private-label brand aimed directly at inflation-weary households. Branded Amazon Grocery, the line consolidates the Amazon Fresh and Happy Belly labels into a single offering of more than 1,000 items spanning dairy, fresh produce, meat, and pantry staples. Most products are priced below $5, a positioning management says could give shoppers room to stretch their budgets without trading down on quality. The initiative underscores Amazon's effort to blend the convenience of its online platform with the reach of its expanding network of Amazon Fresh supermarkets.
The move comes at a time when US consumers are increasingly favoring private-label products as food inflation pressures persist. Both Walmart and Kroger reported gains this year in their own-label portfolios, reflecting a broader trend of shoppers seeking lower-cost alternatives to national brands. Jason Buechel, head of Amazon's grocery unit, emphasized that the new line is designed to deliver quality grocery items across all categories that don't compromise on taste while offering competitive pricing. Analysts suggest that this shift could allow Amazon to capture incremental share in a segment where private-label margins are often more favorable than traditional brands.
Amazon's grocery presence is already diversified, ranging from Whole Foods Market to its Amazon Fresh supermarkets and convenience stores. Whole Foods, for its part, has been extending its 365 label into international markets such as Singapore, testing traction beyond the US, Canada, and the UK. By consolidating and expanding its grocery labels under one roof, Amazon is positioning itself more directly against traditional retailers, with price and convenience as the core of its value proposition. For investors, the strategy highlights Amazon's intention to use groceries not only as a channel for market share gains but also as a long-term driver of consumer loyalty."

Amazon (AMZN, Financials) launched a new private-label food brand. It combined its Amazon Fresh and Happy Belly lines into one brand named Amazon Grocery. There will be more than 1,000 goods in the new brand's first collection. These will include commodities like milk, fruits and vegetables, meat, seafood, snacks, and pantry staples. Most of them will cost less than $5 and have at least four-star reviews from customers. You can buy the products online or in Amazon Fresh stores. Amazon claimed that the new label is meant to go along with its other private-label brands, which include Amazon Saver for budget items and 365 by Whole Foods Market for natural and organic items. Amazon Grocery will now be a direct competitor to Costco's Kirkland Signature and Walmart's Great Value, both of which have created significant consumer loyalty in the private-label food categories. Amazon wants to gain more price-conscious buyers by offering low pricing and a wide range of products at a time when inflation has made it hard for families to make ends meet. The company stated it would add more products to the brand's lineup in the coming months."

Oct 1 - Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares fell about 2% on Wednesday morning after TD Cowen downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy, according to a research note.
The brokerage also trimmed its price target to $85 from $90, citing limited visibility around Marvell's custom processor business with major clients Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Analysts said uncertainty about future orders makes it difficult for investors to model the company's performance.
Marvell has benefited from data-center demand in recent years, supported by its extended processing unit chips and networking portfolio. The company signed a five-year supply deal with Amazon Web Services in 2024 and also works with Microsoft on custom AI products.
However, TD Cowen noted that Amazon's shift to its Trainium 3 project may reduce Marvell's market share compared with the Trainium 2 generation. Expectations for Trainium 2 sales could also come in below earlier forecasts, creating potential downside risks to 2026 and 2027 estimates.
While the firm acknowledged Marvell's long-term data-center growth outlook, it flagged volatility in custom AI chip demand as a major challenge for valuing the stock."

""The Canadian tariffs are the issue,"" Duggan told Yahoo Finance at Ford's Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit. ""When you put a tariff on Canada, you’re putting a tariff on cars made in Michigan. And we're starting to feel that, and I hope the president gets that sorted out.""
Detroit has three operating vehicle assembly plants, including the Detroit Assembly Complex, which is owned and operated by Stellantis (STLA).
While some government officials, such as Treasury counselor Joseph Lavorgna, argue that the effect of tariffs, once reflected in government data, will be relatively small, the mayor noted that corporate income taxes are already showing strain.
""Our corporate income taxes are down because they’re off of corporate profits. The tariffs have hit them,"" Duggan said. Still, he noted that personal income taxes ""are not down,"" suggesting that ""people are still working.""

Detroit-based companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) are navigating higher costs from global trade disputes while also spending heavily on electric vehicles. Both automakers rely on cross-border supply chains with Canada, and analysts warn that prolonged tariffs could dent margins and slow investment.
Duggan stressed that manufacturing has driven growth over the past decade, but he acknowledged it is ""soft,"" citing the impact of Canadian tariffs. He argued for more targeted policies.
""Tariffs in general, if they were done the right way with Mexico, I think most people in Detroit would feel good about,"" he said. ""We'd just like to see it be more precise.""
Even with those pressures, Duggan pointed to the cranes dotting Detroit's skyline — new hospitals, research facilities, housing, and high-rises — as evidence of underlying economic strength.
Still, he warned that the city can't rely solely on its industrial base.
The next frontier, he said, is tech — and specifically artificial intelligence. Large companies, such as Amazon (AMZN), are investing billions in new data centers to support AI growth.
""Michigan is behind the curve at having a solid energy grid,"" he said. ""We are not prepared to compete for the jobs of the future.""
Duggan suggested that could change if he were elected Michigan governor in 2026. After serving as Detroit's mayor since 2014, he announced in November 2024 that he would not seek a fourth term. Subsequently, he left the Democratic Party and declared his candidacy as an independent, aiming to offer voters an alternative to the entrenched partisan politics."

Marvell’s data centre revenue has nearly tripled in two years, helped by demand for custom processors used in artificial intelligence systems and networking chips. But TD Cowen said future orders for those processors are uncertain, particularly for projects tied to Amazon’s Trainium platform and other large customers.
Marvell’s custom chip sales tend to fluctuate sharply between product cycles, making it difficult for investors to model future earnings.
TD Cowen now assumes flat revenue from that business in 2026, compared with more optimistic market forecasts.
TD Cowen also flagged risks in Marvell’s optical components business, which makes up about half of its remaining data centre revenue. It said new power-efficient designs and rising competition could erode the company’s lead in that segment.
“Low custom XPU visibility makes it difficult for us to underwrite Street’s datacenter estimates. Combined with growing competition in Marvell’s leading electro-optics franchise, we lower our estimates slightly”
The brokerage said Marvell still stands to benefit from the broader shift to AI hardware but sees clearer investment cases among rivals. It slightly cut its profit estimates for 2027 and said it prefers to stay on the sidelines until there is more clarity on new chip design wins.

The brand offers everything from milk and olive oil to fresh produce, meat, and seafood. Amazon Fresh grocery items will be available online and at Amazon Fresh stores.
The new label combines the Amazon Fresh and Happy Belly lines into one grocery essentials collection, Amazon says.
“During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don’t compromise on quality or taste — from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials — all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further,” said Jason Buechel, vice president of Amazon Worldwide Grocery Stores and chief executive officer at Whole Foods Market, in a press release.
The line will compete with other companies’ private label brands, like Walmart’s Great Value and Target’s Favorite Day.
Amazon says the Amazon Grocery line includes new items such as fresh bakery cinnamon rolls, refrigerated pizza dough, bottled spring water, and more. In the coming months, Amazon will debut new frozen pasta meals, pie fillings, granola, sliced loaf cakes, expanded selections of deli meat, and more.
It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time that Amazon has rolled out a price-conscious brand, as the company launched its “Amazon Saver” brand last year to offer budget-friendly staples like canned goods and condiments at low prices.
Amazon says that its private-label brands continue to gain momentum, with customers purchasing 15% more private-brand products in 2024 compared to the previous year across Amazon.com, Whole Foods Market, and Amazon Fresh.
The company last month announced that it was now letting shoppers in 1,000 cities across the U.S. order perishable food items through its Same-Day Delivery service. The move meant that users could order fresh grocery items, including produce, dairy, meat, seafood, baked goods, and more, alongside everyday household products, electronics, and other items."

Nearly half of the analysts covering CoreWeave now have buy-equivalent ratings after at least three raised their recommendations in September. It’s a stark shift from mid-July, when less than 20% of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommended buying the stock.
The improving sentiment follows recent agreements with companies including OpenAI that quelled fears CoreWeave was too beholden to Microsoft Corp., which accounted for more than 70% of its revenue at the end of June. On Tuesday, CoreWeave said it will provide Meta Platforms Inc. with as much as $14.2 billion worth of computing power. The news sent the stock soaring, capping its best month since June with a gain of 33%.
“The Street is finally seeing the stickiness and the demand story when it comes to CoreWeave,” said Tejas Dessai, director of thematic research at Global X ETFs, which holds CoreWeave shares. “Once you get these data centers up and running, of course the demand exists, and then the infrastructure in terms of using AI compute services can be a very attractive business.”
Since its initial public offering in March that was propped up by long-time backer Nvidia Corp., CoreWeave has been one of the most controversial stocks on Wall Street. Bulls see a new breed of computing services provider that is poised to win more business as spending on AI continues to climb. For bears, it’s a cash-burning trap that’s destined to end badly when demand eventually slows.
CoreWeave shares have gained more than 230% since their debut but remain down 27% from a June peak when the market capitalization of the Livingston, New Jersey-based company briefly exceeded $88 billion. The stock fell 1.9% at 10:05 a.m. in New York trading on Wednesday.
The shares have considerable upside even after September’s run up, with strong demand expected to translate into future profits, Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note on Tuesday initiating coverage of CoreWeave with an outperform rating. The analysts’ 12-month price target is $175, implying potential for a gain of more than 25% from Tuesday’s closing price."

Albuquerque, NM, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UP.Partners, a global investment firm advancing the future of mobility and human progress, announced the launch of UP.Abundance, a venture fund dedicated to driving innovation at the intersection of energy and mobility in New Mexico. The announcement was made at the annual UP.Summit, a gathering of hundreds of company founders and CEOs, corporate leaders, investors, policymakers, and defense officials.
Led by Brian Adams, a multi-time startup leader who helped scale Amazon’s first corporate venture capital fund, and David Ellmann, a three-time founder and startup operator, UP.Abundance invests in energy and mobility companies that have, or commit to establishing, a presence in New Mexico.
UP.Abundance also goes a step further. Through its partnership with the New Mexico State Investment Council (NMSIC), the state’s $66 billion sovereign wealth fund that has committed over $1.7 billion to dozens of leading venture firms throughout the U.S. over the last three years, UP.Abundance acts as a bridge between high-growth companies and those premier firms actively looking to deploy capital in New Mexico.
“New Mexico has quickly become one of the most compelling places on the planet to build or scale an energy, mobility, or climate company,” said Brian Adams, UP.Abundance Co-Founder and Managing Partner. “With commitments from industry-leading venture firms, deep support from multiple state agencies, and abundant resources, our state stands out to some of the world’s most innovative founders deciding where to expand, relocate, or launch.”

While its scale and trust have long been competitive strengths, the company has faced pressure to modernise as rivals gain traction with mobile-first designs, sustainability messaging and social engagement. For eBay, reinforcing its consumer-to-consumer (C2C) foundation is becoming central to driving user stickiness and long-term transaction growth.
The company’s latest move is the acquisition of Tise, a Norway-based social marketplace. Tise differentiates itself by building resale around community features such as followers, likes, comments and personalised feeds, effectively making shopping feel like a social network. eBay had invested in Tise through eBay Ventures in 2022, and full ownership now allows it to bring these engagement-oriented capabilities more deeply into its platform. By integrating Tise’s design and tools, eBay aims to strengthen its appeal to Gen Z and Millennial shoppers who increasingly view resale as both a sustainable and social experience.
How eBay Stacks Up Against Competitors
Amazon AMZN has been testing resale and recommerce pilots. However, it still focuses more on logistics and scale than social engagement, leaving a gap in community-driven commerce. Simultaneously, Amazon remains a formidable rival due to its reach and infrastructure. Shopify SHOP is building momentum in social commerce with creator-led tools and continues to attract smaller sellers and influencers by blending shopping with content. However, Shopify lacks the resale depth that eBay commands. Etsy ETSY has also carved out a strong position with its community-focused marketplace for handmade, vintage and unique items. However, Etsy remains more niche compared with eBay’s broader C2C reach. By acquiring Tise, eBay gains a differentiator, positioning itself between Amazon’s scale, Shopify’s social push and Etsy’s community-driven niche.
Investment Outlook: Positive
The Tise acquisition underscores eBay’s intent to reignite growth by leaning into C2C and social commerce. The challenge will be integrating Tise without losing the authenticity that makes it appealing. But if executed well, the deal could deepen engagement, boost transaction frequency and restore differentiation in a crowded resale market. By marrying scale with social-first design, eBay positions itself to compete more effectively against Amazon, Shopify and Etsy while re-energising its growth profile."

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Shares of this online retailer have returned -2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 0.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share, indicating a change of +9.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $6.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.2%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.6 indicates a change of +12.4% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon."

Is AI a bubble about to burst? Well, many analysts are still saying AI is a strong buy.
Yes, valuations have risen to sky high levels and questions are growing as many AI software stocks have started showing some cracks in recent weeks.
But the huge demand for AI infrastructure is only set to grow further. That's according to many bulls, including analysts at City and Jeffries.
City Group is out with a new forecast saying Big Tech's AI spending is not slowing down anytime soon.
They now see infrastructure spending climbing past $2.8 trillion by 2029.
That's half a trillion more than they were estimating just a few months ago. Why?
Hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are racing to build data centers and secure more compute power with AI capital expenditures projected projected to hit $490 billion by 2026 alone.
And almost every company in the world right now is looking into how to embed AI tools into their operations.
Also, keep in mind that nations around the world from the US to China to Europe are all investing to be more self-sufficient in AI infrastructure.
Just today, the US and Taiwan are negotiating over who should be building more chips.
So, what are the companies that are set to keep growing?
Brent Thill from Jeffries shared his view with Josh Lipton here on Yahoo Finance.
I think the application names that, you know, Salesforce, Adobe, those names, investors are re-underway. They see these open AI demos they just launched about customer care or doing digital signatures and you you start to see what OpenAI is saying, what Sam Altman's saying about wanting to get into SAS or software as a service.
I think that's freaking everyone out. So, you're seeing a lot of money, you're seeing names like Hubspot down 10% today, Braze down 10, Docusign down 11% in one day on the fear of Open AI entering the application game.
It doesn't matter what happens with AI, they're going to need infrastructure. OpenAI is going to need Microsoft, Oracle, Core Weve. And so, I think this the conversation we're having with our clients is the application names are under duress and I don't think it's as bad as the stocks are are telling you, but no one wants to be there right now because there is no S-curve.
So software's kind of a tale of two cities. One side, you know, um, there's zombies and in in trash and in a crazy amount of debris floating in the air and that's in the apps category.
And then on the infrastructure side, it's like the sun's out, you know, temperature's perfect, and everyone wants to be there. And I I'm a little that that's been our our view to stay stay overweight in infrastructure.
I think that trade lasts till 26 before we see money shift back to the broader software coverage. But right now, it's, um, you know, my group continues to underperform semis, AI infrastructure. And and so I think investors will come back to these names at some at some point when they see an S-curve or an inflection in in AI revenue. We don't see that yet in the application names yet.
Brent, since you mentioned Core Weve and I have you here, I want to ask you that they did ink this $14 billion meta deal. I want to get your thoughts on that headline, Brent. And also just you also cover meta.
Whether you have any concerns, Brent, that you have these hyper scalers maybe becoming, are they becoming too relying on kind of one key AI infrastructure name, Brent?
For many that know Meta's infrastructure, they would characterize them as one of the best builders on the planet of data center infrastructure.
And the fact that they would go to Core Weve tells you how good Core Weve is.
And that's all you need to know. Like, Meta can't even keep up with their own plans to build their own infrastructure, and they need to go to Core Weve to help them build that infrastructure.
Same thing, Microsoft, Core Weve, you've heard Google talk. So, all the hyper scalers, all the consumer grade, you know, standout leaders in internet are all turning to Core Weve because they can't make their plans for AI deployments without the help of Core Weve.
And they are considered kind of the master luxury builder if you will of AI.
And many ask, you know, how how long this is going to last, like what's Core Weve's competitive advantage. And over time, I think Core Weve's going to look a lot like Amazon AWS, which is it was the infrastructure to begin with, and then it becomes a software story. and AWS is a giant software story. I think if Core Weve
can pull this off. I said this when Palenteer went public. Like, if Palenteer can go from selling really high-end, you know, was like Tesla, selling really high-end cars to then selling cars that nurses, doctors, you know, can drive, the mass market can drive, then then we're in a great spot. I think Core Weve can get to the mass market over time.
But right now they're winning the best builders in in AI and and and as long as these contracts keep coming and we think they are, you know, stock's going to keep going higher."

Vice Chairman Sang-Hyun Yoon emphasizes the evolution toward blockbuster products as the key driver of K-Beauty's global success
SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Kolmar Korea, a leading global ODM(Original Development Manufacturing) company, joined forces with Amazon to present a strategic roadmap for the worldwide expansion of K-Beauty. The company underscored that differentiated competitiveness built on technological expertise is the central element of K-Beauty's global success, capturing the attention of the industry.
Kolmar Korea announced its participation as the exclusive manufacturing sponsor of Amazon Beauty in Seoul 2025, held on September 19 at the Grand Ballroom of COEX in Seoul. The event brought together more than 3,000 attendees from across the beauty industry, including brand representatives, distributors, influencers, investors, and other stakeholders, both onsite and online. Distinguished speakers included Sang-Hyun Yoon, Vice Chairman of Kolmar Group, and Hwa-Sook Shin, Country Manager of Amazon Global Selling Korea.
During the ""Global Vision"" session, Vice Chairman Yoon delivered a keynote address titled ""K-Beauty Success from a Manufacturer's Perspective."" He stated, ""Without evolution, companies cannot avoid being left behind. Relentless effort and constant innovation are essential to building a successful brand."" Yoon went on to explain, ""Korean consumers are among the most demanding in the world, and it is this intensely competitive domestic market experience that has become the foundation of K-Beauty's global competitiveness. By securing blockbuster products based on a deep understanding of consumers and expanding product lineups, brands can achieve true global success.""
Kolmar Korea also operated a large-scale exhibition booth at the event, showcasing solutions in skincare, makeup, personal care, sun care, and cosmetic packaging. The company provided tailored consultations for both new and global business partners, exploring detailed collaboration opportunities that could lead to sustainable business growth rather than one-off transactions. Many prospective entrepreneurs engaged in in-depth discussions about how to turn ideas into actionable business ventures.
A Kolmar Korea spokesperson commented, ""This event reaffirmed the vital role and importance of ODM companies in driving the sustainable growth of K-Beauty. Moving forward, we will continue to actively support our clients' global market expansion through our strategic partnership with Amazon, while contributing to strengthening the overall competitiveness of the K-Beauty industry."""
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-01T09:30:00,This ETF Has Beaten Every Stock in the Magnificent Seven This Year. Is It Too Late to Buy?,This semiconductor ETF has been an overlooked champ.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4f15f790c8378ed52c410bd25890d55f1e53d0eae62d5a1f6b49e46c71da4fa3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,fool.com,200,,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" has been driving the AI boom ever since its earliest days.
The group of seven stocks, which includes seven of the most valuable stocks on the market -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- all have some exposure to AI and are seen as the leading technological companies.
However, after driving the stock market rally through 2023 and 2024, the Magnificent Seven's performance has been more pedestrian this year. In fact, three of the seven have underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
A basket of all seven of those stocks would have gained 17.5% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 through Sept. 26, which was up 13%. That's a solid return, and investors can get exposure to the Magnificent Seven through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF.
However, there's one ETF that has not only nearly doubled the return of the Magnificent Seven this year, it's beaten every stock in the elite group through Sept. 26. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH 2.52%), which is up 33.2% year to date, and has a long track record of outperforming the S&P 500.
Meet the VanEck Semiconductor ETF
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF aims to replicate the MVIS U.S.-listed Semiconductor 25 Index, and like the Magnificent Seven, its biggest holdings have significant exposure to AI. These are the top 10 stocks in the ETF.
| Stock | % of ETF |
|---|---|
| Nvidia | 21.8% |
| Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) | 10.6% |
| Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) | 9.5% |
| Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) | 6% |
| Lam Research | 4.4% |
| Analog Devices | 4.4% |
| ASML | 4.2% |
| Micron Technology | 4.1% |
| Texas Instruments | 4.1% |
| Qualcomm | 4.1% |
Nearly 40% of the value of the ETF comes from Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom, three stocks that have been top performers in the AI boom. Notably, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has also outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF because the SMH's holdings are more concentrated in those three leading stocks.
While the Magnificent Seven might hold better-known stocks like Apple and Tesla, semiconductor companies have seen their business soar during the AI boom as they are providing the core computing power to make AI applications work. They form the building blocks of the AI revolution, and should as long as the data center buildout phase continues, with companies like Oracle pledging to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure.
Is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF still a buy?
The VanEck SMH ETF is not only outperforming the S&P 500 this year, but it has a long track record of delivering superior returns. Since its inception in 2011, the fund has gained more than 2,000%, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $200,000 and trouncing the S&P 500 along the way, which is up by less than 600% during that time.
Looking at its valuation, the SMH ETF isn't cheap, but it's not as expensive as you might think. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39, which is much cheaper than popular AI stocks like Tesla or Palantir Technologies, and is only moderately more expensive than the S&P 500 at a P/E of 28. Meanwhile, some of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top holdings, like Taiwan Semiconductor, still look cheap considering its growth rate.
Given its exposure to the top chip and AI stocks and its diversification across the industry, the SMH ETF still looks like a strong buy. Over the long term, the fund looks like a good bet to continue to outperform the S&P 500, and given the massive capex spending in AI, it has an edge over the Magnificent Seven group as well."

Can AI-Driven IoT Unlock a Long-Term Path for Comcast?
Comcast operates across broadband, wireless, media and entertainment, but its growth strategy is increasingly pivoting toward enterprise technology. With traditional cable and media businesses facing slower expansion, artificial intelligence has become a critical lever for Comcast to diversify and capture higher-value opportunities. AI allows the company to move from being just a connectivity provider to becoming an enabler of efficiency, automation and smarter decision-making for businesses.
This strategic shift is evident in its MachineQ unit, which has introduced AI-powered insights for enterprises. It currently delivers device-to-cloud IoT connectivity, but the latest upgrade embeds machine learning to transform raw sensor data into actionable intelligence. Instead of simply monitoring connected devices, enterprises can now use the platform to generate predictive and prescriptive insights, reducing downtime, anticipating maintenance needs, improving compliance and even enhancing workplace safety. By targeting industries like healthcare, manufacturing, real estate and hospitality, MachineQ aims to solve real operational pain points, making Comcast an active partner in digital transformation initiatives.
CMCSA’s Competitive Positioning
Amazon has built scale in enterprise IoT with AWS IoT Core and continues to expand AI-driven analytics across its cloud, making Amazon a dominant force in connected services. Microsoft has strengthened Azure IoT with digital twin and predictive AI features and is increasingly seen as a trusted partner for enterprises modernizing operations. Cisco has carved out a strong position with AI-powered IoT networking and edge solutions and remains widely used across industrial deployments.
Against these rivals, Comcast’s MachineQ differentiates by offering a fully integrated, end-to-end IoT service that reduces adoption complexity and brings real-time AI insights to enterprises, allowing CMCSA to compete by focusing on simplicity, while Amazon, Microsoft and Cisco often require broader integration.
Investment Outlook: Positive
The MachineQ expansion highlights Comcast’s ambition to diversify beyond its core media and broadband business. By embedding AI into IoT solutions, it has created a pathway to tap enterprise technology budgets while reinforcing its Connectivity & Platforms segment. Success will depend on scaling adoption and proving efficiency gains for customers. If Comcast can compete effectively with Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft, the AI-driven MachineQ platform could become a meaningful growth lever over the long term."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-01T08:00:00,3 Underrated AI ETFs With Multi-Million Dollar Potential,These ETFs offer three distinct ways to invest in AI over the long term.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=79fbd22b3da857d768f7c0bffa90faebd3c16e38a98ff30154ca59ae22e7d9ad,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/3-underrated-ai-etf-growth-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/3-underrated-ai-etf-growth-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/3-underrated-ai-etf-growth-stocks/,fool.com,200,,"Investing to attain potential multi-million-dollar returns takes time, good ideas, and a bit of luck. One of the easiest ways to miss out on outsized gains is to lack the conviction needed to hold stocks through periods of volatility.
All of today's top companies have undergone multiple brutal drawdowns. It's easy to forget that just a few years ago, in 2022, Nvidia (NVDA 0.10%), Meta Platforms (META 1.13%), Amazon (AMZN -0.56%), Alphabet (GOOGL 2.10%) (GOOG 2.02%), and Tesla (TSLA 1.30%) all saw their stock prices fall over 40% from all-time highs. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia stock is trading up more than 1,100%, Meta is up over 500%, and Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet have all crushed the comparable performance of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.50%).
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can make it easier to hold volatile growth stocks through steep downturns because of their diversification. Here's what makes the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG 0.61%), the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI 1.98%), and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ 1.47%) top AI ETFs to buy now.
1. Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF
The Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF invests in the top 10% of S&P 500 companies by market cap. Many of the most valuable U.S. companies are growth and AI-focused names. The ETF has a staggering 62% invested in the ""Ten Titans"" -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Broadcom (AVGO 2.55%) Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix.
The Ten Titans make up 39% of the S&P 500, which is already a lot. But this ETF takes that concentration a step further.
The fund is a particularly good buy for investors who believe that the largest companies by market cap will benefit the most from AI.
The fund's expense ratio of 0.2% is higher than some passively managed ETFs, but it's still reasonable for investors looking for a simple way to bet on today's existing winners.
2. iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF
With a net expense ratio of 0.55%, this fund is considerably more expensive than the 0.03% expense ratio found in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.
Unlike most passively managed funds, this active ETF isn't market-cap weighted. So its weights are based more on conviction than the value of the company.
Oracle's 5% weighting is nearly as high as Microsoft's 5.7%. Oracle could become the largest cloud purpose-built for AI within the next five years. And Broadcom is at 8.4%, right behind Nvidia at 9.2%.
The fund is very new, having launched less than a year ago in October 2024. So investors should only approach the ETF after doing more research on its holdings and the strategy employed by its active managers.
3. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF
This ETF is ideally suited for investors looking to build an AI portfolio around U.S. companies while also gaining significant exposure to international leaders. Around 31% of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is invested in non-U.S. companies. Alibaba Group, Samsung Electronics, Tencent, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all top-10 holdings in the fund. And you won't find any of these companies in the S&P 500 because they are non-U.S. firms.
Another unique characteristic of this fund is that it isn't top-heavy. No holding makes up more than 4%, which is a stark contrast to the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF, which has over a third of the fund invested in just five stocks.
In this vein, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is a good fit for investors looking for a diversified and global approach to the AI theme. The ETF features an ""unconstrained approach,"" which targets established and up-and-coming innovative companies without regard to stock market sector or geography. Its 0.68% expense ratio isn't cheap, but it could be worth it for investors looking for high growth potential.
Bold bets for risk-tolerant investors
These ETFs are likely to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years if investor appetite for tech-focused companies and AI names remains positive. But eventually, companies will need to convert capital expenditures (capex) into returns. We are still in the early innings of the AI build-out, with droves of data centers coming online in the next few years. But demand for those data centers depends on the usage of AI models by end users.
Agentic AI presents an opportunity to further integrate AI into regular business functions by helping with task completion and organization. And edge AI involves running algorithms directly on devices rather than depending on the cloud.
Despite the long-term potential of AI, there are plenty of reasons why the discussed ETFs could disappoint. A cyclical downturn for factors unforeseen could challenge the lofty valuations of companies that are priced for perfection. Or simply a pullback in capex spending after an initial ramp-up.
In this vein, investors need to consider the risks associated with allocating to AI names through individual holdings and ETFs. Investors should only approach AI-focused ETFs if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term investment time horizon, and if the strategy aligns with their existing holdings and investment objectives."

Chicago, IL – October 1, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Meta Platforms META.
Will Amazon Keep Rebounding This Year?
On the surface, the price performance of Amazon stock has been very respectable. After all, AMZN is only 9% from a 52-week and all-time high of $242 a share (post-split basis).
That said, the rebound in AMZN has been subpar after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs rattled the broader market earlier in the year.
Rebounding +15% in the last six months, Amazon stock is now virtually flat in 2025, being the worst performer out of its ""Mag 7"" big tech peers, just behind Apple’s YTD gains of over +1% with Nvidia’s +35% leading the way.
Keeping this in mind, investors may be wondering if Amazon stock is being overlooked at the moment and if AMZN will keep rebounding.
AI is Streamlining Amazon’s Businesses
As illustrated by the price, consensus, and surprise chart above, Amazon has now exceeded EPS expectations for 11 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, Amazon has posted a very impressive average EPS surprise of 22.98% in its last four quarterly reports.
Most appealing and correlating with this exceptional operational performance is that Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence in nearly every facet of its business, as depicted below.
1. Enhancing Customer Experience
Amazon has integrated generative AI into Alexa, making interactions more natural and context-aware. Also boosting Amazon’s core e-commerce business, generative AI is providing smarter product listings, with engagement being further boosted by AI-generated ads that create lifestyle-themed visuals.
2. Revolutionizing E-Commerce Operations
AI-powered robots: Operating over 750,000 intelligent robots in its warehouses, Amazon has optimized inventory movement and storage while improving efficiency and safety.
Predictive analytics: Amazon is using AI to forecast demand and manage global inventory, reducing waste and improving delivery speed.
3. Driving Innovation Through AWS
Amazon Bedrock: Fully managed generative AI platform that allows developers to access top-tier machine learning models through a single application programming interface (API), including Anthropic’s Claude, Meta Platforms' Llama, and Amazon’s Titan model.
4. AI in Everyday Services
Amazon One: Futuristic, frictionless way to make payments and verify identity, with customers using their palm thanks to AI-powered biometric recognition."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-01T07:15:00,The Secret to Finding the Next Amazon Is Hiding in Plain Sight,These innovators are disrupting massive industries with a customer-centric business strategy.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8c06030f3e4d1edd1773aba82907b790c26c644cab7428d1a04ba6614c17e550,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/secret-finding-next-amazon-hiding-plain-sight/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/secret-finding-next-amazon-hiding-plain-sight/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/secret-finding-next-amazon-hiding-plain-sight/,fool.com,200,,"Amazon's success expanding from books to cloud computing has set the benchmark for the ideal growth stock. By putting the customer first and being willing to take risks, Amazon tremendous wealth for investors.
The great thing about finding these innovative companies is that you don't have to be first line to buy shares. You could have waited until 2005 -- 10 years after Amazon went public -- and still made over $100,000 on a $1,000 investment.
The next 20 years could see similar return possibilities for innovative companies in massive industries like financial services and healthcare. Here are two growth stocks that might be giving investors a second chance at buying an early stage Amazon in these industries.
1. Robinhood Markets: The Amazon of financial services
Robinhood Markets (HOOD -0.53%) resembles an early stage Amazon in the brokerage industry. Robinhood was launched more than a decade ago by co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev. Similar to how Amazon pioneered the concept of ordering books online, Robinhood started as the first mobile-based brokerage service that allowed people to buy any stock in fractional amounts without paying any transaction fees or commissions. Amazon pioneered the idea of shopping online; Robinhood was the first to offer commission-free trading.
Robinhood started with stocks and is now expanding to new products and features that are fueling the company's growth. Options and cryptocurrencies generate most of its transaction-based revenues. But more customers are starting to shift all their assets to Robinhood. Retirement assets on the platform doubled year over over in the second quarter to $19 billion.
Robinhood's competitive advantage is based on two things: a simple app design and innovation, and these two factors are creating perhaps the strongest brand in the brokerage industry.
Tenev, who is 38, understands millennials and Gen Z much better than the big brokers. He started Robinhood to encourage participation in the financial markets for young people, and to say the company has succeeded is an understatement.
Robinhood's market cap has surged to $100 billion this year. While it would be easy for the company's executive team to rest on the validation the market has given them for their success, management is keeping its foot to the metal. It is looking to bring even more value to customers by expanding access to certain products that have historically been reserved for high net-worth individuals. Tenev wants to eventually tokenize private companies, allowing customers to participate in the growth of companies like SpaceX like buying a stock.
Its new banking service is rolling out this fall and is a good example of why Robinhood is gaining so much popularity with younger investors. Robinhood Banking will bring luxury financial services to customers, such as estate planning and professional tax advice, in addition to other perks. This will accelerate its goal of being the go-to destination for all its customers' financial needs.
The steady pace of new features it releases and new products it keeps announcing is leaving the large brokers flat footed much like Amazon outran established retailers. Robinhood's total platform assets have doubled over the last year to $279 billion.
There's a huge opportunity ahead. By 2048, Cerulli Associates estimates more than $100 trillion of assets will flow from baby boomers to their heirs, and that plays to Robinhood's advantage, since it has won a lot of fans with millennials. While Robinhood stock might look expensive, its growth so far shows a clear path to reaching at least $1 trillion of assets on its platform, and it should keep growing in the decades to come. The stock may not be as expensive as it looks.
2. Hims & Hers Health: The Amazon of healthcare
Hims & Hers Health (HIMS 17.62%) is another high-growth business that resembles an early stage Amazon. Healthcare is a massive industry, accounting for around a fifth of the U.S. economy. There's no expenditure more important to a person's happiness than their health. Hims & Hers has the opportunity to be one of the most valuable healthcare companies in the world by bringing the same customer-centric strategy that made Amazon successful to healthcare.
Hims is following the Amazon playbook of starting small before expanding the selection of products to its customers. Hims & Hers has experienced robust growth by making it convenient and accessible to get precise treatment for things like hair loss, weight loss, and sexual wellness, all from the comfort of home. Growth has been phenomenal, with revenue up 90% year over year in the first half of 2025, which signals that it is tapping into a truly enormous business opportunity.
Just as it would have been a mistake to pigeonhole Amazon into the label of an online bookstore 20 years ago, investors shouldn't expect Hims & Hers to remain static. It will most likely look like a different business in 10 years than it is today. This company has big ambitions. Co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum has expressed the long-term goal of expanding its offering to new specialties and significantly expanding its addressable market.
If there's one thing to build conviction around the long-term opportunity for Hims & Hers, it's the company's talented executive team. Chief Operating Officer Nader Kabbani formerly worked at Amazon for almost two decades, where he helped build the operations that support Amazon Logistics, Kindle, and Prime Video. Chief Technology Officer Mo Elshenawy also worked at Amazon, in addition to leading various projects in artificial intelligence (AI) across e-commerce and cloud computing, while Chief Product Officer Dheerja Kaur was formerly vice president of product at Robinhood.
Elshenawy's experience in AI will be a valuable asset as Hims & Hers builds personalized AI agents that can offer 24/7 support to customers. These agents, combined with an expanding assortment of treatments for health issues, could drive tremendous long-term growth in revenue and profits.

The resignations occur while Amazon is aggressively increasing its investment in AI to remain competitive with rivals such as OpenAI and Google. Amazon has invested ~$8 billion in Anthropic, the developer of the Claude model. Claude powers certain features of Amazon’s Alexa and an internal chatbot known as Cedric.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-10-01T00:30:00,3 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,The valuations of these stocks make them very appealing.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=195dab7d7421106fe8253db2fd8debc59e8932a895897fb3233923266f32061f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/3-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/3-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/3-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,fool.com,200,,"Technology stocks are ruling Wall Street these days. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows an 11% gain in 2025, and the S&P 500 is slightly better at 16%, major tech funds are doing much better, with gains around 25% (at the time of this writing).
The takeaway? If you're going to beat the market this year, you need to be looking at tech stocks. But there are pockets of investors who are spooked by the crazy valuations that some tech stocks have -- many of these companies are priced based on what investors believe their growth will be two or three years down the road. And they are reluctant to buy stocks with a sky-high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.
However, there are many tech stocks that are much more affordable compared to their peers. And that's where you can find some cheap tech stocks to buy if you want to get in on the technology bandwagon.
1. Intel
Intel (INTC 4.88%) has been a beleaguered tech stock for a while, but there are a few tailwinds right now that look like they might help the chipmaker turn things around.
Intel is the market leader in the data center central processing unit (CPU) space and recently secured a deal with the U.S. government to take a 9.9% stake. The deal, which is designed to encourage the development of high-end semiconductors in the U.S., gave Intel stock a boost when it was announced in August.
The company followed that up with a $2 billion investment from Japan's SoftBank, and then this month announced a $5 billion investment by Nvidia as part of a collaboration that will have the companies work together on data center and PC products.
Now Intel looks like a completely different company than it did at the beginning of the year. Intel stock is up 75% so far this year, but Intel still can be had for a low P/S ratio of 2.8 -- much lower than you would get from either Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices.
2. Salesforce (CRM)
Salesforce (CRM -1.30%) operates a customer relation management platform and cloud-based software that allows companies to operate their sales, customer service, and marketing.
The company touts its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Salesforce Customer 360 platform as a place where users can get a complete view of its customer data, which allows them to manage relationships, gain insights, and improve productivity.
Salesforce's second-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion was up 10% from a year ago, and its data cloud and AI annual recurring revenue jumped 120% from last year to $1.2 billion. It raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion, which would be up nearly 9% from last year.
But there are concerns -- the stock is down 25% this year because revenue growth slowed to the single digits. CEO Marc Benioff shook off the criticism in an interview with CNBC, saying that the company's results are ""absolutely fantastic"" and the company guidance is ""appropriately conservative.""
This may be a name you can buy on the dip. Salesforce stock is also cheap right now, with its P/S ratio falling to under 6.
3. Amazon
Maybe you wouldn't think that one of the biggest companies in the world would also be cheap. But Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) is, compared to its peers. In fact, it's by far the cheapest member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" grouping of tech stocks that pretty much rules Wall Street (when measured by P/S ratio).
Amazon's e-commerce engine brought in $136.7 billion in sales in the second quarter, but the real power in this company is its cloud computing division. Amazon Web Services is the biggest cloud provider in the world with a 30% market share. It earned $30.87 billion in revenue from AWS in the quarter and $10.16 billion in profits. That's more than $1 billion more in profits than the e-commerce side brought in.
While it's bringing in a lot of money, it's spending it even faster. Amazon says it plans to spend $100 billion this year on capital expenditures for artificial intelligence as it builds out and expands its data centers. The company is building more than 1,000 generative AI applications to support its shopping, coding, advertising, streaming video, and more.
The investments should pay handsomely for Amazon in the future, which makes this a very appealing cheap tech stock to buy.
The bottom line
If you're looking to beat the market today (and tomorrow), you don't have to buy the most expensive tech stocks. Intel, Salesforce, and Amazon give investors exposure to semiconductors, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and enterprise software without paying a premium price.
Each faces its own challenge: Intel must execute its turnaround, Salesforce must improve its revenue growth, and Amazon must find ways to improve its retail margins. But they are compelling names for investors who are looking to buy tech stocks without outrageous valuations."

Whether you're interested in cutting-edge technology, renewable energy, or healthcare innovations, our themes help you invest in ideas that matter to you.
Let’s take a closer look at the ‘Cloud Computing’ theme and analyze a few stocks within, including Amazon AMZN and Arista Networks ANET.
Cloud Computing Overview
Cloud computing refers to the on-demand seamless access of computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (the cloud) on a pay-per-use pricing model.
It marks a paradigm shift from traditional on-premises infrastructure storage to remote cloud-based storage facilities and relies heavily on virtualization and automation technologies. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations access a virtual pool of shared resources from a cloud service provider on an as-needed basis.
This lowers operating costs, increases productivity with greater agility and flexibility, and improves scalability with higher economies of scale.
Amazon
Amazon AMZN shares reflect an excellent opportunity for investors to obtain exposure to cloud computing thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Many are familiar with AWS, whether through the many advertisements across TV or in their own professional work.
AWS is the dominant player in the cloud computing market, flexing a significant market share globally. It provides various services, including computing power, storage, databases, and AI/ML tools.
Arista Networks
Arista Networks ANET is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large AI, data center, campus, and routing environments. Shares have been red-hot over the last year thanks to robust quarterly results stemming from unrelenting demand.
Bottom Line
Thematic investing has emerged as a powerful way for investors to sync their portfolios with emerging trends. A mix of long-term and short-term themes is increasingly dictating which companies lead as economies expand and markets shift.
While stocks in each theme aren't direct recommendations, they offer a solid starting point. Leverage the Zacks Rank and other metrics to identify the best stocks for your strategy. Each featured stock comes with a Zacks report, giving you the tools to analyze performance and potential.
The Cloud Computing thematic list, which currently Amazon AMZN and Arista Networks ANET are part of, focuses on technology companies that provide the related hardware and software to enable cloud computing services, the communication service providers that offer the network facilities and the various firms that utilize the services across diverse sectors like financial, consumer discretionary and industrials."

(UBER) Expecting Non-Restaurant Deliveries To Reach $12.5 Billion in 2025, Bloomberg Report
Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is among the 10 Best Money Making Stocks to Invest In. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the company is anticipating non-restaurant deliveries to reach an annual run rate of $12.5 billion in gross bookings by the end of 2025, according to a spokesperson.
This is 25% higher than the run rate shared in May, underscoring the firm’s efforts to catch up with competitors like DoorDash, Instacart, and Amazon. However, the figures shared by Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) are a forecast, and actual financial results for the full year will not be announced until February 2026.
Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)’s delivery unit accounts for about half of all gross bookings and has been growing at a faster rate than its ride-hailing business for the last three quarters. During the second quarter earnings call in August, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi credited the segment’s strong performance to “robust growth” in retail and grocery orders.
The company has been making a coordinated push to expand delivery services. It has added around a thousand new retailers so far this year, and recently announced weekly discounts for local fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy in several countries it operates in.
Khosrowshahi believes Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) still has “a long runway to drive further adoption” when it comes to delivery services, given that nearly three-fourths of its rideshare clients have so far not ordered retail or grocery goods from the Uber app.

Amazon (AMZN, Financials) will host a devices launch event, with updates expected across its Alexa , Echo, Fire TV, Ring, and Kindle product lines. The event, led by devices chief Panos Panay, begins at 10 a.m. ET.
CEO Andy Jassy has said a brand new lineup of devices powered by Alexa+ would be released this fall. The upgraded assistant, which uses generative AI, has received mixed early reviews since its limited beta launch in June. More than one million users currently have access, but it remains unavailable to the general public.
Alexa+ marks Amazon's first move to charge directly for its assistant, priced at $19.99 per month or free with a Prime subscription. Reviewers have noted improvements in conversational ability, though some users say basic features like weather forecasts have become less reliable.
More than 600 million Alexa-enabled devices have been sold by Amazon throughout the world. These include devices built by Amazon and other companies. Amazon needs to change how it makes and sells hardware and software since other companies, like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, are making their own AI-powered devices.The company has also made acquisitions to expand its AI reach, including July's purchase of wearable startup Bee, and has introduced AI features into its Ring security products.
Investors will be watching for device adoption and subscription uptake as Amazon positions Alexa+ as a central piece of its consumer AI push."

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) agreed to pay $2.5 billion in fines and reimbursements on September 25, 2025, to resolve claims made by the Federal Trade Commission that it had fraudulently signed up millions of customers for Prime memberships. About 35 million customers who registered between June 2019 and June 2025 are covered by the settlement.
Amazon, which did not admit or deny the allegations, stated that it had ""always followed the law"" and that the settlement would enable the company to ""move forward."" Following the announcement, spokesperson Mark Blafkin explained that the company worked ""incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership.""
He added, ""Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers.""
Amazon also pledged to provide more transparent information, streamline cancellation procedures, and conduct independent compliance monitoring. Even though it was a huge win for customers, Amazon, which generates $2.5 billion in sales nearly every 33 hours, only took a small financial hit, and the stock price remained mostly unchanged.
With the settlement, the business may continue to expand while maintaining Prime’s market leadership, which generated $23.9 billion in subscription income in the first half of 2025. The case highlights ongoing regulatory scrutiny as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) balances commitments to consumer protection with its growth strategies.
Through its physical and online stores, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) sells consumer goods, advertises, and offers subscription services. It serves both consumers and companies worldwide through its operations in North America, international markets, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is one of Most Profitable Stocks.

The overall consensus of analysts remains largely positive, but some analysts still hold a cautious stance. On September 25, Bank of America Securities’ Vivek Arya maintained a Hold rating on Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) with a price target of $88. He pointed out that management’s upbeat commentary, coupled with an expanded stock buyback plan, has provided greater confidence in sales growth for fiscal 2027 and 2028. These forecasts now appear more in line with market expectations.
However, Arya noted that Marvell’s AI segment is likely to expand at a slower pace than peers, which could weigh on its competitive position. The company’s largest customer, Amazon, has shown flat demand on a quarter-over-quarter basis, while a new project with Microsoft brings potential but also uncertainty. According to the analyst, the Microsoft engagement involves a customer with limited experience in scaling accelerator ASICs, and competition from established GPU providers remains a significant headwind.
The analyst also highlighted competitive pressures from Taiwan-based rivals, which could challenge margins and market share. While visibility in data center demand has improved and share repurchases support near-term sentiment, risks remain around limited earnings revisions and execution on large custom silicon projects with AWS and Microsoft.
Marvell Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) designs and develops semiconductors for data infrastructure, including networking, storage, and compute solutions. Its products are used in cloud data centers, 5G networks, and enterprise systems.

Shares of online grocery delivery platform Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) fell 6.4% in the afternoon session after BTIG downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy, citing intensifying competitive pressure.
The analyst noted that in just two weeks, grocers representing over 25% of Instacart's gross order value had signed partnerships with rivals like Amazon, DoorDash, or Uber. This raised questions about the company's growth path. The downgrade followed news from the previous session that competitor DoorDash and supermarket giant Kroger were expanding their grocery delivery partnership. This directly challenged Instacart, as Kroger was its third-largest customer and accounted for over 10% of its gross transaction value.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Instacart? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Instacart’s shares are quite volatile and have had 16 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 23 hours ago when the stock dropped 8.7% on the news that reports revealed that rival DoorDash Inc. and supermarket giant Kroger Co. are expanding their partnership for grocery delivery starting next month, intensifying competition.
The news directly impacts Instacart as Kroger is its third-largest customer, accounting for over 10% of the company's gross transaction value. Wedbush analysts noted the move ""directly challenges Instacart's position among intermediaries,"" adding to Wall Street's concerns about the company's ability to compete. This development amplifies existing competitive pressures from major players like Amazon and Walmart, who have been making their own aggressive pushes into grocery delivery. In recent months, analysts have already cited heightened competition from Amazon's expanding services as a reason for concern, suggesting Instacart's market share is at risk of eroding in an increasingly crowded market.
Instacart is down 17% since the beginning of the year, and at $35.74 per share, it is trading 32.8% below its 52-week high of $53.15 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Instacart’s shares at the IPO in September 2023 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,060.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

To showcase the AI’s capabilities, Amazon is releasing four new Echo devices with improved processing power and memory: the Echo Dot Max, Echo Studio, Echo Show 8, and Echo Show 11.
Key to the devices are the Alexa+ integrations, allowing the speakers to respond to more queries than earlier models, offering support for natural language conversations, more complex questions, and soon, more add-ons and capabilities.
This will later include an Alexa+ Store, where users can explore services from brands like Fandango, GrubHub, Lyft, Priceline, Taskrabbit, Thumbtack, and Yahoo Sports. The devices will also be able to manage new or existing subscriptions with Amazon’s own services like Amazon Music, Amazon Kids+, or Alexa Emergency Assist and customize their Alexa experience.
The new Echo devices launching today run on Amazon’s custom-designed silicon chips, the AZ3 and AZ3 Pro, which include an AI Accelerator designed to run AI edge models.
The AZ3 enables better conversation detection on the Echo Dot, letting people talk to the device from anywhere in the room, while still filtering out background noise. The chip also improves detection of the wake word by over 50%, Amazon claims.
The other three devices — the Studio, Show 8, and 11 — use the AZ3 Pro, which adds support for advanced language models and vision transformers.
Plus, the AZ3 Pro-enabled devices include Ominisense, a custom sensor platform for ambient AI that uses the 13-megapixel camera on new Echo Show devices, audio, ultrasound, Wi-Fi radar, accelerometer, and Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). With this feature, the devices allow Alexa to act on events happening in the home, like delivering a reminder when a particular person walks in the room or alerting you to an open garage door before you go to bed at night.
The new Echo Dot Max, $99.99, adds nearly three times the bass for better sound. The two-way speaker includes a woofer for the deep bass and a custom tweeter for the high notes.
The $219.99 Echo Studio, meanwhile, features a new spherical design, allowing it to be 40% smaller than the original, says Amazon. The Echo Studio also includes a high-excursion woofer, spatial audio, and Dolby Atmos, and an upgraded light ring for better visual understanding of what Alexa is doing or processing.
The company notes consumers can connect up to five Echo Studio or Echo Dot Max devices with compatible Fire TV sticks for an immersive sound system in their home, and it plans to sell products in Alexa Home Theater bundles."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-30T15:39:07,Ring cameras can now recognize faces and help to find lost pets,"Amazon unveiled new AI features for its Ring devices, such as the ability to identify familiar faces and help locate a lost dog.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=be620f4936a2d7211cd4b7331dfe84e891b374d4835d422d469b9e32b07e386b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ring-cameras-now-recognize-faces-153907646.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ring-cameras-now-recognize-faces-153907646.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ring-cameras-now-recognize-faces-153907646.html,yahoo.com,200,,"At an event on Tuesday, Amazon unveiled a range of new AI-powered features for its latest Ring cameras and doorbells.
The features will enable Ring users to recognize visitors’ faces and find lost pets by connecting with other Ring users in the same neighborhood. Amazon also launched an Alexa+ feature that functions as a smart doorbell assistant, providing details about visitors before users answer the door.
Ring is also introducing its first 4K product line along with “Retinal Vision,” a new imaging technology designed to provide clearer video.
The most notable feature revealed at the event was “Familiar Faces,” which uses AI to identify friends and family. Users can enroll the faces of their loved ones into the device, enabling Ring to alert them when it recognizes a visitor. The AI will also alert the user when an unfamiliar person is detected, helping them to make informed decisions quickly.
The company explained in today’s blog post that the new feature is meant to empower “customers to reduce notifications triggered by familiar people’s routine activities” and eliminate guesswork for people detection.
“Equally important is that if someone you don’t recognize is lingering, you’ll know immediately [they’re] unfamiliar,” Ring founder Jamie Siminoff told press at the event.
Ring has faced criticism for its close ties with law enforcement and its history of poor data management. Last year, following numerous complaints, the company announced that it would no longer accommodate police requests for footage from Ring users without a warrant.
The Familiar Faces feature can be integrated into the broader Alexa+ Greetings system, which will enable specific greetings when the camera recognizes a specific face. This feature transforms the voice assistant into a smart doorbell attendant, enabling it to interact with visitors, manage deliveries, and identify the purpose of visits to keep users informed.
Another AI feature, Search Party, helps find lost pets by networking Ring cameras. When a user registers a lost pet, neighboring Ring users will receive a description of the pet and can report sightings. The system uses AI to deliver possible matches, although sightings have to be voluntarily reported. The company states that users are in control of their privacy and can choose to ignore the alert if they don’t want to share information with a neighbor.
Both Familiar Faces and Alexa+ Greeting will roll out to customers starting in December. Search Party for dogs will launch in November, with support for cats and other pets planned for release in the future."

The brokerage said it views CoreWeave as uniquely positioned to serve both AI-first startups and traditional enterprises building and deploying AI models, calling it an “at scale AI-as-a-Service pure play.”
CoreWeave operates more than 250,000 GPUs across 33 data centers, making it one of the largest independent GPU cloud operators globally.
Unlike traditional hyperscalers such as Amazon or Microsoft, CoreWeave’s infrastructure is purpose-built specifically for AI workloads, allowing it to deliver more than 20% better hardware utilization, Evercore said.
The bank pointed to several near-term catalysts, including an expanded partnership with OpenAI, the potential addition of Google as a cloud customer, a supply agreement with Nvidia that guarantees any unused capacity will be absorbed through 2032, and upcoming disclosure of a new large-scale hyperscaler contract.
Evercore said CoreWeave has strong forward revenue visibility, with about 98% of its sales coming from multi-year “take-or-pay” contracts, typically priced per GPU-hour.
Customer commitments in backlog recently climbed to about $30 billion, roughly half of which stems from OpenAI.
While customer concentration remains high, Microsoft and OpenAI accounted for nearly 80% of second-quarter revenue, Evercore expects the client mix to broaden as new enterprise wins ramp.
The firm flagged high capital expenditure requirements as a key debate, with CoreWeave expected to double spending to more than $20 billion in 2025 to build out new data centers.
However, it said operating margins should expand from the mid-to-high teens to the mid-20% range by 2027 as the business scales and older GPUs move past their depreciation window.
Evercore values the company at 10 to 11 times estimated 2027 EBITDA, a discount to larger cloud and data center peers.

Amazon (AMZN) recorded the strongest year-over-year growth among streaming services in August 2025, with viewership rising to 3.9%, a 26% increase from 3.1% in August 2024. This marked its highest monthly share since December 2024, when it briefly reached 4.0%. Over the past year, Amazon’s viewing share has consistently fluctuated within the 3% to 4% range, with no sustained breakout, but recent momentum signals a potential shift.
A key driver of this growth is Prime Video’s upcoming addition of NBA games as part of its partnership with the league, which could meaningfully expand its sports audience and strengthen engagement. At the same time, Amazon’s decision to introduce an ad-supported default tier is a notable differentiator in the competitive streaming landscape. By offering a lower-cost entry point compared to subscription-only services, Prime Video is positioned to draw in a broader audience, especially as consumer preferences increasingly lean toward ad-supported options.
This strategy not only enhances accessibility but also unlocks incremental advertising revenue opportunities, aligning Amazon with broader industry trends favoring hybrid monetization models. While historical patterns suggest that Amazon has yet to establish dominance beyond the 4% viewing-share threshold, the combination of live sports rights, pricing flexibility, and scalable ad-supported streaming creates a compelling case for continued growth. With these catalysts in place, Prime Video has the potential to accelerate its market share gains, positioning Amazon as a stronger competitor in the evolving streaming ecosystem.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) by FluentInQuality in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s AWS leadership, integrated logistics, advertising scale, and Prime-driven ecosystem as key growth engines. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 5.8% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as Amazon remains a diversified digital economy platform. Simeon McMillan shares a similar view but emphasizes Prime Video’s growth, driven by NBA rights and the ad-supported default tier.
Amazon.com, Inc. is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 335 hedge fund portfolios held AMZN at the end of the second quarter which was 328 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

With traditional cable and media businesses facing slower expansion, artificial intelligence has become a critical lever for Comcast to diversify and capture higher-value opportunities. AI allows the company to move from being just a connectivity provider to becoming an enabler of efficiency, automation and smarter decision-making for businesses.
This strategic shift is evident in its MachineQ unit, which has introduced AI-powered insights for enterprises. It currently delivers device-to-cloud IoT connectivity, but the latest upgrade embeds machine learning to transform raw sensor data into actionable intelligence. Instead of simply monitoring connected devices, enterprises can now use the platform to generate predictive and prescriptive insights, reducing downtime, anticipating maintenance needs, improving compliance and even enhancing workplace safety. By targeting industries like healthcare, manufacturing, real estate and hospitality, MachineQ aims to solve real operational pain points, making Comcast an active partner in digital transformation initiatives.
CMCSA’s Competitive Positioning
Amazon AMZN has built scale in enterprise IoT with AWS IoT Core and continues to expand AI-driven analytics across its cloud, making Amazon a dominant force in connected services. Microsoft MSFT has strengthened Azure IoT with digital twin and predictive AI features and is increasingly seen as a trusted partner for enterprises modernizing operations. Cisco CSCO has carved out a strong position with AI-powered IoT networking and edge solutions and remains widely used across industrial deployments. Against these rivals, Comcast’s MachineQ differentiates by offering a fully integrated, end-to-end IoT service that reduces adoption complexity and brings real-time AI insights to enterprises, allowing CMCSA to compete by focusing on simplicity, while Amazon, Microsoft and Cisco often require broader integration.
Investment Outlook: Positive
The MachineQ expansion highlights Comcast’s ambition to diversify beyond its core media and broadband business. By embedding AI into IoT solutions, it has created a pathway to tap enterprise technology budgets while reinforcing its Connectivity & Platforms segment. Success will depend on scaling adoption and proving efficiency gains for customers. If Comcast can compete effectively with Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft, the AI-driven MachineQ platform could become a meaningful growth lever over the long term."

“Its crystal-clear profile lends itself to longer, fresher drinks, opening the door to increasingly popular early evening occasions, traditionally the domain of clear spirits like Tequila.”

By GlobalDataNick Blacknell, the global marketing director for Chivas Regal, described the launch of Chivas Regal Crystalgold as “an exciting step into new territory” and said the business was responding to changes in consumer habits.
“Chivas Regal Crystalgold exemplifies the bold thinking that continues to drive this brand forward,” he said. “This is a true first for us, and an example of how a heritage brand can continue to innovate in the industry.”
In Pernod Ricard’s last full financial year, which ran to 30 June, the French giant sold 4.8m nine-litre cases of Chivas Regal, up 2% on an organic basis. Chivas Regal is the fourth-largest of Pernod Ricard’s “strategic international brands” by annual case sales, a list headed by Absolut vodka."

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
-
Morgan Stanley upgraded Celsius Holdings (CELH) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $70, up from $61. Brand Celsius has returned to growth following last year's share slowdown and the firm expects further improvement with much easier comps from December through early June, says the firm, which sees another leg up in the stock to be driven by a greater than expected reacceleration in topline growth.
-
UBS upgraded FIS (FIS) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $82. The firm believes the company's risk/reward is improved with the shares down 20% year-to-date.
-
Oppenheimer upgraded Semtech (SMTC) to Outperform from Perform with an $81 price target after hosting management for meetings. Semtech CEO Hong Hou had a bullish tone and detailed growth opportunities led by active copper cable and linear pluggable optics for data center artificial intelligence, the firm says.
-
BofA upgraded Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $42. After having spoken with President and CEO Kathleen Quirk, the firm reports that it ""gained no material new information,"" but came away increasingly confident that the current valuation sufficiently prices the key risks around its temporarily halted Grasberg copper/gold mine in Indonesia.
-
More bullish on the name, Maxim upgraded Adial Pharmaceuticals (ADIL) to Buy from Hold with a $1.50 price target.
Top 5 Downgrades:
-
BTIG downgraded Instacart (CART) to Neutral from Buy with no price target, citing ""ongoing negative competitive developments."" The week started with ""yet another competitive announcement"" with an ongoing push into the grocery delivery category by Amazon (AMZN), Doordash (DASH) and Uber (UBER), says the firm, which notes that Instacart partners representing an estimated 25%-plus of Gross Order Volume have signed deals with Amazon, Doordash or Uber in the last two weeks.
-
Goldman Sachs downgraded Spotify (SPOT) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $770, up from $765. The firm sees a balanced risk/reward for the shares into the company's Q3 earnings report.
-

-
HSBC downgraded Unity (U) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $40.80, up from $37.50. While Unity remains on the right track, valuation now appears fair after year-to-date share price gains, the firm tells investors in a research note.
-
BofA downgraded NuScale Power (SMR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $34, down from $38. While the firm remains positive on the long-term nuclear theme, current valuations ""leave little room for error and the near-term risk/reward skews negative."""

(SOUN) is doubling down on multimodal AI as its key differentiator in the competitive conversational AI space. The company’s latest foundation model, Polaris, blends voice and vision capabilities to deliver real-time understanding across multiple inputs. Management argues that this approach not only improves accuracy and speed but also expands the range of use cases across industries, such as automotive, restaurants and enterprise services.
The second quarter underscored this momentum. Revenues surged 217% year over year to $42.7 million, beating expectations, with demand rising across verticals. CEO Keyvan Mohajer highlighted how integrating vision AI into the stack “marks a transformational shift” in human-computer interaction, enabling more natural and intuitive engagement with devices. Customers migrating to Polaris are reportedly seeing immediate improvements, which have driven renewals, upselling and stronger close rates.
Financially, SoundHound remains unprofitable, posting a non-GAAP net loss of $11.9 million, or 3 cents per share. Still, its robust pipeline, expanding partnerships and guidance raise to $160-$178 million in 2025 revenues indicate confidence in scaling the business.
The challenge lies in execution. Larger rivals like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google possess deep resources and entrenched ecosystems. However, SoundHound’s specialization in multimodal AI, coupled with 20 years of proprietary data and a growing roster of global automotive and QSR clients, positions it to compete on quality rather than scale.
Ultimately, if adoption of multimodal AI accelerates, SoundHound’s early lead could give it a sustainable edge. However, investors will need to watch closely whether this differentiation translates into lasting profitability.
How Does SoundHound Stack Up Against Big Tech Rivals?
While SoundHound AI is leaning on multimodal innovation to stand out, it faces stiff competition from established players. Amazon, through Alexa and its broader cloud ecosystem, remains a dominant force in voice-enabled AI. Its advantage lies in scale, distribution and integration into smart homes and consumer devices. However, Amazon’s solutions have been slower to adopt multimodal capabilities at the level SoundHound claims with Polaris, leaving room for niche specialists.
Google is another formidable rival, with Google Assistant and cutting-edge AI research under its DeepMind and Gemini banners. The company has the infrastructure and data advantage to rapidly expand multimodal features across devices and enterprise services. Yet, Google’s focus is spread across multiple AI initiatives, potentially diluting attention to specific verticals like automotive or restaurants."

Shares in the delivery firm slipped 2.5% in premarket trading Tuesday.
Analyst Jake Fuller said a recent string of deals signed by Amazon, DoorDash, and Uber raises questions about the sustainability of the company’s growth trajectory.
“In the span of just two weeks, grocers accounting for an estimated 25%+ of CART’s gross order value (GOV) have signed partnerships with AMZN, DASH or UBER,” Fuller wrote. “If we add in the UBER-Costco partnership from last year, the tally rises to ~40%.""
The analyst said the breadth of encroachment makes it much harder to underwrite sustained double-digit growth and that the market will likely default to mid-single-digit expectations.
He pointed to several key developments since August, including Amazon’s launch of perishable grocery delivery in 1,000 cities with plans to reach 2,300 by year-end; its new partnership with Winn-Dixie; Uber’s agreement with Aldi covering its 2,500 stores; and DoorDash’s expanded deal with Kroger to include the chain’s full assortment.
There had been some thought that Amazon’s expansion could push traditional grocers toward Instacart, similar to its Whole Foods acquisition, but the recent announcements suggest that isn’t the case.
While Fuller reiterated a Buy rating on Instacart shares earlier this month, the analyst now believes that the cumulative impact of these announcements “simply tips the balance for us with too many items on the negative side of the ledger at this point.”
He withdrew its $55 price target, estimating fair value between $30 and $50 using a three-year scenario analysis based on 5–8% gross order value growth, 29–32% EBITDA margins in 2027, and an 8–12x multiple discounted back.
Fuller said that “to justify a Buy rating from the current price would require a mid-$40s price and multiple on a now more uncertain ’26 EBITDA of ~10x.”
A double-digit multiple looks unlikely given competitive pressures, with the Street expected to “default to a mid-single-digit (MSD) GOV growth rate vs. the high-single-digit (HSD) to low-double-digit (LDD) consensus that prevailed in early-August,"" he said.

Zoox said in a blog post on Tuesday that it would begin by manually driving Toyota Highlanders equipped with its sensors and self-driving software to map the city. The company plans to start testing its autonomous vehicles (with human safety operators behind the wheel) later this year.
“With its growing population and high demand for flexible transport options, the District is an ideal next location and optimal place to begin testing and mapping our technology on the East Coast,” the company wrote in its blog post.
Zoox wouldn’t share details on how many autonomous vehicles will be used for testing in the city. A spokesperson told TechCrunch the company will start with a small fleet that would grow over time.
The Foster City, California-based company has grown well beyond the confines of Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay since its founding in 2014. Today, Zoox runs hundreds of test vehicles on public roads and private test tracks in Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, San Francisco, and Seattle. Washington DC will be its eighth test site.
Zoox is also working towards launching a commercial robotaxi service with its growing fleet of custom-built robotaxis that lack traditional controls like a steering wheel or pedals. The company recently launched a free robotaxi service in Las Vegas, an anchor market where it has had offices and conducted testing since 2019. Last November, Zoox started testing its custom self-driving vehicles in San Francisco.
The company is ultimately aiming to launch a commercial robotaxi service in multiple markets. It still needs to meet certain regulatory requirements, which include receiving an exemption from the federal government to deploy its custom, driverless vehicles commercially.
Zoox has made progress on that front: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave Zoox an exemption in August to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads, though it only covers research and demonstrations on public roads. Zoox has since filed a separate application that would broaden the scope and pave the way for the launch of a commercial robotaxi service."

NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- MediaRadar, the industry-leading Marketing Intelligence platform, today announced a major expansion into Live Streaming Sports—delivering weekly tracking of ad spend and creative across exclusive streaming coverage. As more than $30 billion in media rights shift from linear to connected TV (CTV), MediaRadar offers comprehensive tracking of CTV sports ad spend, creative, and category activity driving the evolution of sports advertising.
According to MediaRadar's recent research, advertisers are extending their investments well beyond traditional Super Bowl advertising. Spend is growing across the NFL, NBA, MLB, and college football, as well as on new marquee moments like Black Friday and Christmas Day football and mid-season basketball tournaments. At the same time, CTV platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube are reshaping the sports advertising ecosystem.
MediaRadar's live streaming sports coverage enables clients to:
-
Track ad strategy and spend: Monitor campaigns across leagues, teams, and events on Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Hulu, and other CTV platforms.
-
Connect the dots: Link sports ad strategies to cross-media campaigns through MediaRadar's Marketing Intelligence platform, covering $280B+ in spend, 30 channels, and 35M creative assets.
-
Gain market clarity: Access fresh weekly signals on spend, creative, and media mix—turning massive datasets into actionable intelligence.
With this expansion, advertisers can track live sports advertising across leagues and throughout the season, showing exactly where ad dollars are landing and what creative is running.
""Advertisers are betting big on live sports, competing fiercely for limited ad space,"" said Jay Nielsen, VP of Product at MediaRadar. ""With major events like YouTube's record-breaking NFL broadcast in Brazil and Netflix's Christmas Day game inventory selling out almost instantly, we knew we wanted to give our clients the visibility they need on CTV spend, strategy, and creative to move with confidence as the market evolves.""
The new solution expands MediaRadar's capabilities across its four business units:
-
Competitive Intelligence: Benchmark league and team ad trends and identify brands growing live streaming and CTV spend.
-
Commercial Intelligence: Spot new advertisers and categories investing in live sports across streaming and CTV platforms.
-

Its all-in-one body not only gives it a sleek, more compact look but also significantly improves space efficiency—standing in stark contrast to the split-style multi-color setups common on the market. This unique advantage earned AD5X the Silver Winner at the 2025 London Design Awards, marking authoritative recognition in the field of industrial design.
AD5X also strikes a compelling balance between performance and price. Its self-developed Intelligent Filament System (IFS) offers both ease of use and stable output, and it's compatible with a wide range of filaments to meet diverse user needs. Equipped with a standard hardened steel nozzle, it can handle engineering filaments such as PLA-CF and PETG-CF, as well as flexible filaments like TPU—giving it professional-grade capabilities rarely seen in a consumer 3D printer. Priced around $379.99, few competitors can match this combination of performance and affordability.
The recent news that the AD5X has arrived at all 29 Micro Center stores across the U.S. has become a hot topic in the industry. Now, consumers can not only purchase the printer on online platforms like Amazon but also experience and buy it firsthand in-store. This move garnered widespread attention, with coverage from thousands of media outlets, including Yahoo Finance, Associated Press, and Dow Jones MarketWatch. Top industry influencers also visited stores for hands-on reviews and shared their experiences on social media, further amplifying the buzz. By combining online and offline channels with strong media and community engagement, AD5X is well-positioned for sustained sales growth and to become a breakout hit.
By leveraging Flashforge's hit-making legacy, coupled with design innovations, performance upgrades, and expanded distribution, AD5X ticks all the boxes for a standout product. It represents another leap forward in consumer 3D printing and strengthens Flashforge's influence in the U.S. market. With extensive media coverage and ongoing social buzz, the brand's visibility is growing fast, creating a powerful online-offline synergy. While other leading brands like Bambu Lab and Anycubic remain highly visible, Flashforge's rising momentum positions it as one of the most noteworthy names in the industry. Notably, it will also be featured in the upcoming Prime Day sale, with special offers you won't want to miss—stay tuned."

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Ken Gawrelski, Wells Fargo senior internet analyst, said in a recent program on CNBC that while Amazon shares look “stuck in neutral,” they can gain in the coming days. Here is how the analyst explained his bullish case for the e-commerce and Cloud giant:
""You’ve had accelerating industry growth at the same time that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has kind of been stuck in neutral, right? And this is why we upgrade the shares today: we think this is about to change. Anthropic has been a core, key partner of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Note that OpenAI, which has been a very big spender in cloud and the subject of a lot of the headlines you’ve no doubt reported about over the last three to four weeks, is more aligned with Microsoft and also does some work with Google, but really not with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). So Amazon has not had that exposure. We do think Anthropic has great momentum as a business and will be accelerating its compute spend. Notably, we think there will be a big capacity project that the two are working on together, which will benefit next year. We see it as a nice driver to AWS and an accelerant to the business.""

Mairs & Power Balanced Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“The Fund also started a new position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the second quarter, where the company is well positioned to continue capturing market share in retail while also growing its market leading cloud business. The Fund took advantage of weakness in the stock during April to start the position as tariff news and a precipitous market decline provided an opportunity to build a position.”

In online advertising, Mizuho said, “Our favorite name is Meta Platforms (+24% to TP), followed by Pinterest (+49% to TP) and Alphabet (+20% to TP). All OP names benefit from themes we like in the space, particularly Meta where AI is entirely offensive.
“We believe this sector broadly has the most tailwinds from scaling AI in our coverage.”
On e-commerce, the analysts cited Amazon’s “expansion of AWS infrastructure, poised to benefit from the scaling AI inference opportunity and on expanding retail margins, driven by improving efficiency and fast-growing advertising.”

For online travel, the firm said, “We like Airbnb (+22% to TP) on the push into hotel, which stands to unlock a significantly larger market and can drive accelerating top line in 2027.”

(Reuters) -Popular NBC shows including ""Sunday Night Football"" and ""America's Got Talent"" may disappear from YouTube TV as soon as Tuesday if the two sides fail to agree on a new distribution deal, a standoff that could influence the future of television.
Carriage talks have stalled over the rates Alphabet's YouTube TV will pay to distribute to its 10 million subscribers the shows of Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, the two companies have said.
But a bigger negotiation looms behind the scenes, and it reflects the newfound clout of YouTube as the dominant provider of video services in the United States.
YouTube TV wants to show content offered exclusively on NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service - such as hit reality series ""Love Island"" - directly on its platform, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters. Currently, users have to open the Peacock app to see the shows, even on YouTube TV.
Known as ""direct ingestion,"" it is an approach that NBCUniversal opposes, as it wants to preserve Peacock - which it launched in 2020 - as a standalone service that can collect subscriber data and sell targeted ads. For YouTube, securing NBC content would aid its push to become the country's biggest pay-TV distributor and strengthen the core ad business of Google - which is also owned by Alphabet - on smart TVs, where ad slots command premium rates.
These battles ""will have important strategic implications for the future of media,"" LightShed analyst Richard Greenfield said in a note to clients. Disney's carriage deal with YouTube TV is also up for renewal at the end of October and similar talks will likely occur then, he said.
""We suspect YouTube TV cares far less about the rate it ultimately pays and far more about being able to ingest content from legacy media streaming apps,"" he said.
YOUTUBE'S GROWING CLOUT
YouTube now accounts for the largest share of TV viewing in the U.S., ahead of streaming rival Netflix and traditional media companies such as Disney, according to Nielsen.
Its cable-like subscription service, YouTube TV, ranks among the four largest U.S. pay-TV distributors, and Alphabet's deep pockets recently gave it leverage over Paramount and Fox Corp in carriage talks, according to media firms and analysts.
NBCUniversal offered YouTube the same terms it extended to other large TV distributors - including Amazon's Prime Video Channels - and is looking to include its streaming service as part of the bundle of programming YouTube TV distributes, said the person familiar with the negotiations, who requested anonymity because the talks were private."

The list consists of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN -0.56%), Meta Platforms, Broadcom, Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix.
Nine of those Titans crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years. But not Amazon, which has produced a mere 41% total return during that period compared to 116% for the S&P 500.
What's more, Amazon has gone nowhere in 2025 -- up just 0.2% at the time of this writing. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up 14%, and Alphabet, Nvidia, Netflix, Broadcom, and Oracle are all up more than 30%.
Here are three reasons Amazon is worth a closer look, and two reasons investors may want to think twice about smashing the buy button.
Reasons to buy Amazon
1. The stock's value
Amazon is a reasonable value, with the stock trading at 33.1 times forward earnings. That's less expensive than Apple, which isn't growing as quickly as Amazon.
Amazon invests in long-term projects, doesn't pay a dividend, and even dilutes its shareholders through stock-based compensation. Whereas many of its Ten Titans peers pay small dividends or at least repurchase enough stock to more than offset stock-based compensation, thereby avoiding share dilution.
Still, Amazon's attractive valuation is a reason to take a closer look at the stock.
2. AWS is the industry leader
Amazon is the undisputed leader in cloud computing. On its latest earnings call, for the second quarter, CEO Andy Jassy estimated that the second-largest cloud player (presumably Microsoft) is about 65% the size of Amazon Web Services (AWS). That's a commanding lead in an industry with decades of growth potential.
Being the market leader gives AWS a ton of exposure to different industries. It's also not solely dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) to drive cloud growth given its legacy position in general computing and basic enterprise services.
3. Amazon has other levers to pull outside of AWS
AWS is the crown jewel, but Amazon also owns Amazon Prime, Prime Video, MGM Studios, Amazon Music Prime, Prime Gaming, Twitch, Audible, Kindle, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and healthcare services.
This diversification makes the company less dependent on any single market and provides numerous options for capital allocation. Amazon is one of those companies that is never short on ideas. Which is why it spends so aggressively.
Reasons to sell Amazon
1. Growth is slowing
Amazon's valuation has decreased for several valid reasons. The biggest being that growth has slowed.
In its most recent quarter, Amazon grew total sales by 13%, AWS revenue by 17.5%, and AWS operating income by 9.7%. These are decent results, but not great given Amazon's aggressive spending.
For the upcoming third quarter, Amazon is guiding for 10% to 13% revenue growth and operating income to be roughly flat year over year. The company's growth is under pressure due to a slowdown in AWS and strained consumer spending, which is affecting its e-commerce business.
2. AWS is losing ground to competitors
Arguably, the primary reason to pass on Amazon is the intense competition in cloud computing. Amazon has a commanding lead right now, but AWS' once seemingly impenetrable moat is showing cracks.
During its second-quarter earnings call, an analyst asked management why AWS was growing slower than the No. 2 and No. 3 cloud players. Jassy explained that AWS is well positioned from an AI standpoint and that customers care a lot about scale and security. He also said that it's still early for AWS and the industry, which is incredible considering AWS is a $123 billion run-rate business.
However, it's undeniable that both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing faster than AWS. And then there's Oracle, which is making the case for why there should really be the ""big four"" cloud giants rather than just the ""big three.""
Oracle is bringing over 70 data centers on line in just a few years. These are custom-built for AI and high-performance computing. They're fast, new, and ultra-efficient, which is why Oracle is landing huge contracts with OpenAI and Meta Platforms.
Oracle also partners with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud by embedding native versions of its infrastructure into the big three clouds. This approach reduces latency by bringing AI to the dataset rather than moving huge datasets across cloud providers. With its pure-play business-to-business approach, Oracle is arguably the hottest AI growth stock to buy now.
Buying Amazon for the right reasons
At first glance, Amazon looks like a no-brainer buy given its reasonable valuation and noticeable underperformance compared to the rest of the Ten Titans. But dig deeper, and there are some flaws in the business that shouldn't go unnoticed.
Amazon is different than other companies. When Apple and Alphabet were getting clobbered earlier this year, it was easier to make the buy case because of their reasonable valuations, high free cash flow, and ability to return capital to shareholders. Amazon's aggressive spending leads to inconsistent free cash flow. In this vein, it deserves less slack than the other Ten Titans.
That said, investors who believe that consumer spending will improve and AWS' dominance is here to stay are getting the chance to buy Amazon at a good valuation in a market that is becoming increasingly expensive."

Nvidia (NVDA 0.10%) and Broadcom (AVGO 2.50%) are designing cutting-edge AI chips.
Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle (ORCL 1.59%) are pushing the bounds of cloud computing.
Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel manufacture chips using equipment supplied by companies like ASML, Applied Materials, and Lam Research.
There's also the indirect method of investing in AI, which can be achieved through any company that utilizes it to enhance efficiency. For example, Walmart's AI-powered supply chain optimization.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with an AI bent offer a simple way to invest in a portfolio of companies rather than picking and choosing just a handful of names. Here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 0.97%), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX 3.18%), and the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG 0.66%) are AI ETFs that have what it takes to outperform the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.50%) over the next five years.
1. Vanguard Information Technology ETF
This ETF mirrors the performance of the tech sector. Big gains from ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Oracle have made the ETF heavily concentrated in just a handful of names.
Just 10 holdings make up 57.8% of the fund. However, many of those holdings have a ton of exposure to AI.
Not long ago, the tech sector was dominated by software names. However, big gains from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which are powering data centers with AI chips, have given the tech sector much more exposure to semiconductor, materials, and hardware. These industries, along with electronic equipment and components, now make up well more than half of the tech sector.
The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is one of the least expensive ways to invest in the tech sector, with an expense ratio of just 0.09%.
2. iShares Semiconductor ETF
If you like the technology sector's increasing reliance on semiconductor stocks, then you'll love this ETF. It's the ideal pick for folks who believe the semiconductor industry is one of the best ways to invest in AI.
The strategy has paid off, as the iShares Semiconductor ETF has achieved a staggering 184% total return over the last five years, which is better than the 151% total return for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and far better than the 151% total return for the S&P 500.
This fund has a higher expense ratio than the aforementioned Vanguard ETFs, at 0.34%. However, it's a great way to get exposure to semiconductor companies that have very low weightings in the S&P 500 (or aren't included at all).
Advanced Micro Devices has a 7.1% weighting in the fund, Qualcomm makes up 5.8%, and Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Intel, Lam Research, Marvell Technology, Applied Materials, KLA, ASML, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all more than 4%.
3. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF
This fund isn't limited to a single sector. Rather, it essentially filters the S&P 500 by doubling down on top growth stocks and leaving out value-focused companies.
This strategy has helped the fund slightly outperform the S&P 500 over the last five years. But it could easily beat the market over the next five years if mega-cap growth stocks continue leading the major indexes to new heights.
Around 55% of this ETF is invested in the Ten Titans, which have plenty of upside potential from AI. What's more, the ETF has a very low expense ratio of just 0.07%, or $7 for every $10,000 invested.
Add it all up, and it's a simple and low-cost way to get exposure to growth-focused S&P 500 companies.
Winning ETFs with room to run
The discussed ETFs are ideally suited for investors looking to build their AI exposure around today's leading companies. However, they may not be suitable for investors seeking to diversify into newer companies.
A common mistake is duplicating holdings across ETFs, which results in more exposure than an investor may realize. For example, if an investor owns Nvidia stock outright but also has $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund, that's another $720 in Nvidia simply because it makes up 7.2% of the index.
However, it could also be a mistake to ignore today's leaders just because they are hiding in plain sight. Big tech firms are ramping up spending on AI, and a lot of that spending is funneling to the semiconductor industry and associated hardware and infrastructure companies. That gives Nvidia and Broadcom the green light to pour excess profits into research and development to expand their lead over the competition.
In this vein, doubling down on top tech stocks through low-cost ETFs may be one of the simplest ways to potentially beat the S&P 500 over the next five years."

In today's world, we often associate them with sports -- where players, and by extension, the fans -- trade barbs during tense competition. What's more surprising, though, is how similar rhetoric emerges in the corporate arena from time to time.
In recent weeks, Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp all but declared a decisive victory over his company's competition. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, however, didn't let that jab go unanswered -- hinting instead that Palantir's software is overpriced.
One executive who has never been one to mince words or avoid expressing blunt opinions is Elon Musk. In recent years, he has frequently sparred publicly with Sam Altman -- the CEO of ChatGPT creator, OpenAI. In response to disagreements over OpenAI's business model, Musk went on to launch his own competing startup, xAI.
While many initially assumed that xAI was born primarily out of clashes with OpenAI's leadership, Musk now appears to have shifted his gears toward a new rival: Anthropic. Recently, Musk took to social media platform X and had this to say about rising competition in the artificial intelligence (AI) space:
Winning was never in the set of possible outcomes for Anthropic
-- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Sept. 23, 2025
Let's break down Musk's swipe at Anthropic and explore why such a pointed comment could be concerning for Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) investors in particular.
Why did Musk diss Anthropic?
Following the commercial launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, a wave of competing large language models (LLMs) quickly entered the market. Startups such as Perplexity and Anthropic introduced their own platforms, while established tech giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms released proprietary models, Gemini and Llama, respectively.
This rapid proliferation of LLMs led Palantir's Karp to characterize these products as increasingly commoditized. His point was not that LLMs lack significance, but rather the true differentiator revolves around how organizations apply data to these models in order to build enterprise-grade applications.
By dismissing Anthropic publicly, Musk seems to be suggesting that only a finite number of LLM platforms will truly achieve sustained global distribution. For Musk, the advantage lies in vertical integration: aligning xAI with his other companies, namely Tesla and SpaceX. In this context, control over vast computing infrastructure isn't just an operational competitive edge -- it's the ultimate strategic asset.
Does Musk have a point?
In the table below, I've summarized annual revenue growth rates for Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services over the last year:
| Category | Q1 FY25 | Q2 FY25 | Q3 FY25 | Q4 FY25 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Azure | 34% | 31% | 35% | 39% |
| Category | Q3 2024 | Q4 2024 | Q1 2025 | Q2 2025 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GCP | 35% | 30% | 28% | 32% |
| AWS | 19% | 19% | 17% | 17% |
To ensure a fair comparison, I separated the tables since Microsoft's fiscal year timeline differs from the standard calendar quarter used by Alphabet and Amazon. The results are clear: Azure's growth is accelerating, GCP is consistently expanding around 30%, while AWS shows slowing momentum -- growing at roughly half the pace of its peers.
Despite raising billions of dollars to scale its Claude model, Anthropic is competing in an environment where hyperscalers like Microsoft Azure and GCP are rapidly expanding their own AI capabilities. My view on Musk's remark about Anthropic is that the company appears boxed in -- particularly within the Amazon Web Services ecosystem.
Should Amazon investors be worried?
Given AWS's deep ties to Anthropic -- through Amazon Bedrock integration and the use of is custom Trainium and Inferentia chips for model training -- Musk's criticism strikes particularly close to home. That said, it's worth stepping back whenever a competitor engages in public taunting. Musk's post on X was as much a marketing play for xAI's LLM, Grok, as it was a critique of Anthropic's role in AWS's strategy.
The real question for Amazon investors shouldn't be whether Anthropic has won or lost anything, as Musk implies. Rather, the concern should be whether Amazon's broader AI initiatives are keeping pace with the competition.
While headlines may exaggerate Musk's remarks, they fall short of completely negating the Amazon thesis. AWS remains larger than Azure and GCP -- meaning slower growth still compounds on a much larger base. More importantly, AWS continues to generate substantial operating profits -- which Amazon then reinvests in other AI-driven areas such as robotics.
In short, this is not a reason to hit the panic button. Amazon's broader growth story remains intact, even if Anthropic never reaches the scale of ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grok. For these reasons, it's premature to say that Musk has declared ""checkmate"" over Amazon."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-30T08:05:00,Will a Stock Market Crash Follow the AI Boom? Billionaire Ken Griffin Warns About Echoes of the Dot-Com Bubble.,The artificial intelligence (AI) trade has pushed the S&P 500 to a very expensive valuation that has historically correlated with negative forward returns.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=00f74b49494e5508084b7791022c1e6cbd499b84c0ab9f00a3578d8750ea7ccf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/stock-market-crash-after-ai-boom-billionaire-warns/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/stock-market-crash-after-ai-boom-billionaire-warns/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/stock-market-crash-after-ai-boom-billionaire-warns/,fool.com,200,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution began in earnest with the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. The S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.50%) has advanced 72% since then despite headwinds arising from high interest rates, stubborn inflation, and sweeping tariffs.
Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at J.P.Morgan, recently said, ""AI related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched.""
Naturally, some experts have drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble, a period where rich valuations across the technology sector in the late 1990s led to a stock market crash in the early 2000s. Hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin recently told CNBC, ""There are obviously echoes of the dot-com bubble in this moment.""
How the artificial intelligence (AI) boom differs from the dot-com bubble
Billionaire Ken Griffin runs the most successful hedge fund in history as measured by cumulative net gains, so his opinion should carry weight with investors. However, his recent comment about the artificial intelligence (AI) boom echoing the dot-com bubble should be considered in context.
Griffin in the second quarter purchased a substantial amount of stock in three companies at the very heart of the AI boom: Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft. Those stocks now rank among his six largest holdings, which suggests Griffin is comfortable with their valuations and has confidence in their future growth prospects.
Importantly, while valuations are elevated today, they are still a far cry from the valuations seen during the dot-com bubble. The five largest technology stocks in 2000 had a market-cap weighted forward PE ratio of 59, according to JPMorgan. Comparatively, the five largest technology stocks today have a market-cap weighted forward PE ratio of 34.
""During the dotcom bubble, rampant speculation surrounded young companies flaunting internet excitement before profitability,"" according to JPMorgan strategist Stephanie Aliaga. ""In contrast, today's AI beneficiaries are already very profitable companies that make their money selling key infrastructure and resources.""
In short, the dot-com bubble was fueled by speculative bets on internet companies, many of which were losing money, and valuations during that period were much higher than what we see today. Furthermore, many of the most heavily weighted AI stocks in the S&P 500 today are paragons of financial strength.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" in aggregate reported earnings growth of 27% in Q2 2025, while the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 reported earnings growth of 8%, according to FactSet Research. The ""Magnificent Seven"" are on pace to report faster earnings growth than the rest of the index for the third straight year, and analysts expect that trend to remain intact through 2026.
The S&P 500 still trades at a pricey valuation that has historically correlated with negative forward returns
While valuations may have been frothier during the dot-com bubble, that does not mean the stock market is cheap today. The S&P 500 recorded a cyclically adjusted price-to-earning (CAPE) ratio of 38 in August, a material premium to the monthly average of 31 during the last decade.
There have only been 40 incidents where the S&P 500's monthly CAPE multiple exceeded 37 since the index was created in 1957. Even more alarming, economist Robert Shiller has back-tested the data using a precursor to the S&P 500 (called the S&P 90) and there have only been 40 incidents where the monthly CAPE ratio has topped 37 since 1928, a period that covers 1,172 months.
Put differently, the S&P 500 -- widely considered the best barometer for the U.S. stock market -- has only been this expensive 3.4% of the time in history. And the index has usually performed poorly in the aftermath. The chart below shows the median return during the one, two, and three years following monthly CAPE readings above 37.
|
Holding Period |
S&P 500 Median Return When CAPE Is 37+ |
|---|---|
|
1 Year |
(8%) |
|
2 Years |
(13%) |
|
3 Years |
(19%) |
As shown above, the S&P 500 has typically produced negative returns during the one, two, and three years following monthly CAPE readings above 37. And if its performance matches the historical median, the index will decline 19% over the next three years.
Here's the bottom line: The artificial intelligence boom has carried the U.S. stock market much higher in the last three years. Valuations are nowhere close to the those seen in the years preceding the dot-com crash in the early 2000s, but the S&P 500 still trades at a very expensive CAPE ratio that has historically coincided with negative forward returns.
So, investors should avoid risky behavior. That means scrutinize valuations closely before you invest money, and never buy a stock if you aren't prepared to hold through a downturn. Also, good opportunities may be difficult to find in the current environment, so it's OK to focus on building a cash position to capitalize on the next drawdown."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -U.S. delivery companies are on track to handle 2.3 billion packages this holiday season, 5% more than last year, as an extra shopping day helps offset the drag from President Donald Trump's tariff policies, according to a forecast released on Monday.
Investors are keen for information on the holiday delivery season that stretches from Thanksgiving to Christmas because companies like FedEx and UPS can deliver twice the normal number of packages on some days.
The expected increase in holiday deliveries will not be spread equally across companies, logistics technology provider ShipMatrix said on Monday.
That could mean some delivery providers get more customer pushback on so-called ""peak surcharges"" that help shelter carrier profits from higher holiday season costs.
In the first half of 2025, total U.S. domestic parcel volumes increased 6.1% at Amazon.com's logistics arm and 5% at FedEx. Volume at UPS, which is cutting the number of packages it delivers for Amazon, decreased 5.4%, while the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) fell 6.7%, ShipMatrix said.
The volume decline at UPS and USPS combined was more than what Amazon and FedEx gained, and that additional volume of 102 million packages was likely handled by the private delivery networks of large retailers like Walmart or by other carriers, the report said.
If current trends stretch into the holiday season, ""we expect FedEx and Amazon to experience a 5 to 8 percent increase with UPS and USPS being flat,"" ShipMatrix added.
Higher U.S. prices for goods tied to Trump's tariffs as well as the end of import duty exemptions for low-value goods sold via China-linked retailers like Temu and Shein have been sapping already-soft delivery demand.
FedEx and UPS have seen volumes decline since Trump ended the import duty exemption for low-value, direct-to-consumer goods from China and Hong Kong on May 2 and for the rest of the world on August 29. Last year, roughly 1.4 billion packages came into the United States under the ""de minimis"" exemption for goods valued at less than $800.
Trump's ever-changing tariff policy also has put a chill on U.S. business spending and made consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of domestic economic activity, wary about rising prices.

Anthropic, the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)-backed AI company behind Claude, is stepping up its global presence as demand from businesses surges overseas. On Friday, the company said Chris Ciauri will join as Managing Director of International to lead the charge. Ciauri comes with deep experience, having led Unily as CEO and held senior roles at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloud and Salesforce.
The timing makes sense: nearly 80% of Claude's consumer usage now comes from outside the U.S., according to Anthropic's own Economic Index. Per-capita usage in South Korea, Australia and Singapore is already ahead of America. To keep up, the company is hiring more than 100 people across Dublin, London and Zurich, and opening its first Asian office in Tokyo, with more hubs planned across Europe and Asia next year.
Growth has been nothing short of explosive. Anthropic's enterprise revenue run-rate just passed $5 billion, up from $87 million at the start of 2024. Its customer base has ballooned to 300,000 companies worldwide, compared with fewer than 1,000 only two years ago. Earlier this month, Anthropic raised $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation, cementing its spot among AI's biggest players."

The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.57, showcasing a 9.79% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $177.93 billion, up 11.99% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.76 per share and revenue of $707.29 billion. These totals would mark changes of +22.24% and +10.87%, respectively, from last year.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the business operations and its ability to generate profits.
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.

The tech heavy Nasdaq is poised to build on Friday's rebound, but tech stocks in the hot seat as rumblings grow over concerns of an AI market bubble.
Cory Johnson, Epistrophy Capital Research, Chief market strategist, joining us now to discuss. Cory, great to see you, especially on set.
Here.
Here, in the flesh. In the flesh.
In your city. Skyscrapers and everything.
Let's talk, uh, big picture.
There's a Stevie Wonder reference.
Um, I got it. AI bubble.
Yeah.
Talk of this. I heard Ken Griffin telling CNBC uh, echoes of a dotcom bubble.
Mr. Griffin say, David Einhorn, smart guy
Yeah. Great, great short seller.
throwing red flags on all this AI spending.
They love it.
What what do you think? Do you hear echoes of a dotcom bubble?
There are there are sounds that sound familiar, like customers trading things other than cash for product, right?
We've got we've got Nvidia, uh giving selling chips in exchange for commute a compute and both sides maybe recognizing it as revenue. I think these are things that accountants should look at.
Um we see the companies making deals with other companies, making deals with other companies making deals. and sometimes cash is not the thing that is being exchanged. That is something we saw in the .com era.
And this concerns you?
You hear echoes?
These sound like the things we heard during that era. We certainly, certainly have some fake AI companies out there. We have companies that put AI in their press releases so they can get boosts in their stock.
It's marketing fluff you're saying.
There there were some of those and I I'm sure I've been short some of those companies. I'm currently short some of those companies in my little portfolio. I don't give investment advice, but I want to, you know,
full disclosure. Um but I strongly believe that the use of AI is only just beginning and that the chips and things that are being sold in the build out of these data centers are being used. They're not just selling capacity as we saw when dark fiber was being laid for the future of the internet in 1999 and 2000, when it was just there were a lot of accounting scams of companies like Worldcom and Global Crossing and um Quest and others.
These are names you may not even remember or known at the time. But these were these were the big companies of that era, some of them and uh some of them proved to be complete frauds like Worldcom and indeed Enron."

In other words, OpenAI might be on the path to reshaping who holds power in e-commerce.
OpenAI’s new “Instant Checkout” feature is available to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free logged-in users buying from U.S.-based Etsy sellers, with more than 1 million Shopify merchants like Glossier, Skims, Spanx, and Vuori “coming soon,” per OpenAI.
Instant Checkout builds on previous shopping features on ChatGPT that surfaced relevant products, images, reviews, prices, and direct links to merchants in response to shopping questions like “what should I get my friend who loves ceramics?” or “best sneakers to wear to the office.” Now, instead of having to leave the conversation, users can just tap “Buy” to confirm their order, shipping, and payment details (options include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or credit card) to complete the purchase.
Last year, Perplexity introduced a similar in-chat shopping and payments feature. Microsoft also offers merchants the ability to create in-chat storefront capabilities with the Copilot Merchant Program.
This type of frictionless experience has the potential to spark a new movement in how people shop online — one that moves away from search engines like Google and e-commerce platforms like Amazon toward conversational agents with curated recommendations, comparisons, and easy checkout experiences.
It’s also setting the stage for new power brokers to emerge in e-commerce. Google and Amazon have long been the gatekeepers for retail discovery. If more purchases start inside AI chatbots, the firms behind them will suddenly have more control over what products are surfaced and what commissions or fees they charge.
Both Amazon and Google have previously leveraged their dominance to favor their own products or preferred partners, pushing down competitors in search results or charging steep fees to sellers simply to maintain visibility. OpenAI said in a blog post that the product results it surfaces are “organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user,” and that it will charge merchants a “small fee” for completed purchases.
TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for more information."

Shares of online grocery delivery platform Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) fell 8.7% in the afternoon session after reports revealed that rival DoorDash Inc. and supermarket giant Kroger Co. are expanding their partnership for grocery delivery starting next month, intensifying competition.
The news directly impacts Instacart as Kroger is its third-largest customer, accounting for over 10% of the company's gross transaction value. Wedbush analysts noted the move ""directly challenges Instacart's position among intermediaries,"" adding to Wall Street's concerns about the company's ability to compete.
This development amplifies existing competitive pressures from major players like Amazon and Walmart, who have been making their own aggressive pushes into grocery delivery. In recent months, analysts have already cited heightened competition from Amazon's expanding services as a reason for concern, suggesting Instacart's market share is at risk of eroding in an increasingly crowded market.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Instacart? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Instacart’s shares are quite volatile and have had 15 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 2.7% as the company announced a partnership with Vroom Delivery to bring its Carrot Ads platform to 3,500 convenience stores across the United States.
This move aimed to expand Instacart's high-margin advertising business, a key growth area for the company. The collaboration allowed convenience retailers to use Instacart's advertising technology, opening the door for over 7,500 advertisers to reach more consumers.
This news came on the heels of a strong second quarter, where the company's revenue and gross transaction value both grew by 11%, driven by a 17% jump in order volume. The advertising division, in particular, showed robust health, with revenues hitting $255 million, a 12% year-over-year increase. Investors viewed the Vroom partnership as a strategic step to further bolster this lucrative revenue stream, deepening the company's role in the competitive retail media landscape.
Instacart is down 11.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $37.98 per share, it is trading 28.6% below its 52-week high of $53.15 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Instacart’s shares at the IPO in September 2023 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,127.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

ATLANTA, Sept. 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Teamsters at United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) in Atlanta have unanimously ratified a strong first collective bargaining agreement that delivers significant gains for more than 225 warehouse workers. The five-year contract provides a 30 percent wage increase, Teamsters health care coverage, participation in the Western Conference Pension Plan, defined classification bidding, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday.
""This is an excellent contract that will have a lasting impact on our members and their families,"" said Matt Higdon, President of Teamsters Local 728. ""We mirrored the best standards already won by other UNFI Teamsters, and we are proud to have secured such a strong agreement for our newest members at Local 728.""
UNFI, the primary distributor for Amazon-owned Whole Foods, has become a major center for Teamsters organizing in recent years. In the past year alone, more than 1,250 UNFI drivers and warehouse workers have voted to join the union. Since 2022, more than 2,700 workers have organized, bringing total Teamsters representation at the company to over 5,000. Atlanta warehouse workers voted to unionize last year.
""Since we organized in October, we've been fighting for respect and a contract that meets the industry standard,"" said Fernando Woods, a worker at UNFI and Local 728 shop steward. ""I've been with the company for 10 years, and it feels great to reap the benefits of having strong union representation. What used to be a job has turned into a career.""
The Atlanta contract follows a wave of first agreements for newly organized UNFI workers nationwide. In August, more than 300 warehouse workers at UNFI in Sarasota, Fla., ratified a first contract that secured major wage increases, Teamsters health care, and Western Conference Pension benefits. The Atlanta agreement mirrors those victories and continues to raise standards across the company.
""We're building density and using our strength at UNFI to negotiate some of the best contracts in the grocery industry,"" said Tom Erickson, Director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division. ""Workers across this country can see that the Teamsters are delivering real gains in wages, benefits, and protections on the job.""

Amazon (AMZN, Financials) will end its Prime Invitee Program on, removing a 2009-era option that let members share free delivery with non-household users. Invitees will lose access to Prime delivery on that date.
The company said the replacement, Amazon Family, allows sharing a broader set of Prime benefitsbut only within a single household. Eligible sharing includes one additional adult, up to four teens added before April 7, 2025, and up to four children. Members must share a primary residential address, link accounts for household verification, and agree to share payment methods.
Affected users will be offered a limited-time deal: 12 months of Prime for $14.99, available through Dec. 31. Users who lose access can either be added to a household's Amazon Family or purchase their own membership. Family members can leave and rejoin, but must wait 12 months before joining a different household.
The shift narrows account sharing while potentially lifting average revenue per user and tightening controls ahead of the holiday season. Investors will watch Amazon's next earnings update for any impact on Prime subscriber trends and churn."

(Reuters) -Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) unveiled the Claude 4.5 AI model on Monday, saying the newest version can code for longer uninterrupted stretches and handle finance and scientific tasks better, as the startup pushes deeper into enterprise AI.
The Alphabet and Amazon.com-backed AI startup is racing rivals to build models that can reliably operate software and complete multi-step work, key for AI agents, which can perform tasks on behalf of humans.
The Sonnet 4.5 model created a web app from scratch in internal tests, and one customer had the AI chatbot code autonomously for 30 hours, up from a seven-hour run achieved by Anthropic's earlier Claude Opus 4 for a different client, Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger said.
Anthropic is targeting power users and business customers rather than chasing a viral consumer moment, he said.
Claude 4.5 is stronger at finance and scientific reasoning and better at using computers, scoring about 60% on a benchmark that tests operating-system dexterity versus roughly 40% for prior models, the company said.
""It's a lot more visceral when you just see the model using a computer the way a person does if you're not a coder,"" said Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan.
Separately on Monday, Microsoft said it would add new Microsoft 365 Copilot features powered by Anthropic models, including ""Agent Mode"" in Excel and Word and an ""Office Agent"" in Copilot chat, with PowerPoint to follow.
Microsoft last week said it would bring Anthropic's models to Microsoft 365 Copilot to diversify beyond longtime partner OpenAI.
Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives, has positioned Claude for workplace use with guardrails it says reduce risky outputs. The company has been marketing Claude's coding and data-analysis skills to regulated industries and teams that want models to work across multiple software tools.
Krieger said the company's focus is on sustained, reliable performance over long tasks rather than short demos.

Under the new regulation, companies must pay a $100,000 annual fee per H-1B visa application. Following the announcement, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google urged employees abroad to return to the US immediately and keep any dependents from travelling abroad.
Although the administration quickly clarified that the changes would not impact current visa holders, the new fee directly contradicts the Trump administration’s attempt to grow US tech manufacturing. The US tech ecosystem has strongly benefited from its ability to attract global expertise and resources. Restrictive immigration policies not only stifle innovation but also incur millions of dollars in costs for companies trying to reshore production back to the US, potentially disincentivising companies from investing in the US tech industry.
What are H-1B visas?
The H-1B is the US’s largest non-immigrant temporary work visa program. It allows US companies to sponsor foreign employees in specialised fields, including IT, healthcare, and engineering. The scheme is capped at 65,000 visas per fiscal year, with successful applicants granted an initial three-year stay in the US that can be extended up to six years, followed by an opportunity to pursue permanent residency after these six years. According to January 2025 data from fwd.us, there are as many as 730,000 H-1B holders in the US, alongside an additional 550,000 dependents such as spouses and children.
The scheme is primarily used by US and Indian tech companies to bring high-skilled foreign employees to the US. Around 70% of H-1B visa recipients are from India, with another 10% from China. Amazon has the highest number of workers on H-1B visas, with more than 10,000 H-1B approved applications in H1 2025. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Microsoft, and Meta are also big employers of H-1B recipients, with more than 5,000 approvals each in H1 2025.
H-1B visas have been a point of contention in US politics for some time. Announcing the new $100,000 fee, which company sponsors will have to pay per visa recipient, the Trump administration said that the visas were being “abused” to undercut US wages and “outsource IT jobs to lower-paid foreign workers.”
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataThe US tech sector relies on H-1B visas
Alongside its anti-immigration stance, the core of the Trump administration’s economic policy involves reindustrialising the US manufacturing sector. Advanced manufacturing industries, such as the tech and auto sectors, are incentivised to build factories and assembly plants in the US.
While the US has always had a strong auto manufacturing industry, its tech industry has outsourced manufacturing and services to low-cost countries for decades. As a result, the US labour market has limited expertise in those tech areas. The H-1B visa helps companies address that skills shortage by allowing them to import educated and skilled foreign workers.
The use of H-1B visas is even more relevant now that tech companies face high import tariffs and are encouraged to use government subsidies and tax credits from the 2022 CHIPS Act to reshore manufacturing back to the US. In 2024 and 2025 alone, Big Tech has pledged more than $1trn to reshoring efforts. The H-1B visa program helps bridge the gap between the tech industry’s plan to reindustrialise the US and the absence of high-skilled workers in the US tech manufacturing labour force.
As an example: TSMC, the world’s leader in advanced chip manufacturing, is building three chip fabrication plants in the US. This project should be hugely beneficial for the US’s position in advanced technologies, but the US offshored most of its chip manufacturing back in the 1980s and has never developed its advanced chip manufacturing capabilities. For this project’s success, TSMC will rely on high-skilled foreign labour, predominantly from Taiwan, to fill its manufacturing facilities.
Over time, the US academic system will adapt to new industry demands, attract funding, and offer the necessary training to support the domestic tech industry. However, this will not happen overnight. Beyond the skills gap, there are other financial hurdles facing the US labour market. The US tech industry began offshoring manufacturing due to the availability of skilled, cheap labour in countries like India. Today, US wages remain higher than foreign employee salaries.
Repercussions of restrictive domestic immigration policies on the tech sector
H-1B visas only make up around 5% of total immigration visas issued in the US annually. However, this shift towards more restrictive immigration control could seriously impact the US tech ecosystem. It may stifle US tech innovation if imported talent cannot work in the US. Notably, many US-based tech executives, like Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, moved to the US on student or work visas at the start of their careers.
In general, restrictive immigration policies have a detrimental impact on advanced manufacturers’ planned US investments. They increase the cost of moving production to the US and impact the existing labour force. Specifically, the Trump administration’s planned mass deportations will have implications for the cost and availability of labour for constructing factories, plants, and data centers to support the growth of the US tech sector. Altogether, restrictive immigration policies may discourage companies from moving production to the US, as the financial burden of reshoring outweighs the benefits of circumventing the trade restrictions or potential penalties of selling to the US market."

The post FedEx, UPS peak season surcharges could drive shippers to competitors appeared first on FreightWaves.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=909227462b31e21a80ac92149aabffc4f8e91d3007c8341cfd7f5f2c99dfd7cd,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-ups-peak-season-surcharges-140647815.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-ups-peak-season-surcharges-140647815.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-ups-peak-season-surcharges-140647815.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Peak season surcharges by major parcel carriers have been routine for more than a decade, but in a year when demand growth is forecast to be muted critics are questioning the fees’ rationale and warning they will cause a further exodus of e-commerce shippers to alternative delivery companies.
Average daily volume for the busy holiday shopping season is expected to increase by low double-digits from earlier this year, compared to a nearly 100% increase in 2013 and a 50% surge during the 2020 pandemic, according to new research by ShipMatrix, a consulting and technology firm that helps businesses manage their parcel spending.
Peak volume has been essentially flat year over year since 2021. ShipMatrix estimates that 2.3 billion packages will be delivered in the United States during the peak season, 5% higher than the same period of 2024, mostly because of an extra shopping day this year.
UPS on Sunday began applying an $8.25 charge for packages that require additional handling, which will rise to $10.80 on Nov. 23. Beginning Oct. 26, ground and overnight air shipments will be hit with 40 cent and $1.10 surcharges, respectively, rising to 60 cents and $2.05 per package a month later. FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service, Amazon, regional carrier OnTrac and others have also announced demand surcharges. At least 10 smaller carriers have not announced surcharges so far, according to a recent tally by e-commerce logistics consultant Nate Skiver.
“[At] the height of the Covid time period, e-commerce shipments are going bananas, carriers are being pushed to the limits of their capacity, there’s some validity to pretty extreme demand surcharges in that timeframe,” said Glenn Gooding, president of iDrive Logistics on a recent episode of his Parcel Perspectives podcast. “It’s 2025. Retail sales are down. The market is struggling. Carriers are compressing or reducing their capacity. They’re making staffing reductions, so the optics do not look too good when you’re talking about a carrier [UPS] that’s doing early buyouts, layoffs, shutting down operations, drawing down volumes in other places while simultaneously coming to you saying, ‘We need to impose demand surcharges.’ ”
Shippers generally feel surcharges are fair when projected demand abruptly exceeds capacity because carriers do a lot of seasonal hiring and training, lease extra aircraft and other equipment, and take on other expenditures to ensure continuity of operations. In 2013, a spike in demand combined with blizzards severely impacted parcel carriers’ on-time performance, upsetting retailers and their customers, and prompting the move to demand surcharges the following year."

These 12 companies survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs. Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch.
PPL Investment Narrative Recap
To own PPL stock, an investor typically needs to believe in the long-term opportunity tied to surging utility demand from data centers and technology clients, alongside the company’s ability to recover its large infrastructure investments through supportive rate cases. The recent Pennsylvania approval for Amazon’s powerlines aligns well with this growth narrative but does not materially shift the near-term catalyst or the central risk: successful and timely cost recovery on major capital spending remains pivotal.
One of PPL’s most relevant recent announcements is its new joint venture with Blackstone Infrastructure to develop additional generation capacity focused on serving data center clients. This move reinforces the central role that hyperscaler-related demand plays in PPL’s outlook and offers tangible progress toward capital deployment opportunities, yet also reinforces the company’s increasing exposure to data center–driven concentration risk.
However, the bigger risk investors need to keep in mind relates to the possibility of regulatory lag or unfavorable rate decisions that could undermine...

PPL's narrative projects $9.6 billion revenue and $1.7 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 2.8% yearly revenue growth and a $714 million earnings increase from $986 million today.
Uncover how PPL's forecasts yield a $38.31 fair value, a 4% upside to its current price.
Exploring Other Perspectives

After years of steady outperformance, Amazon closed at $219.78, giving investors plenty to consider. Over the past year, the stock delivered an impressive 18.0% return, dramatically outpacing broader indexes, while its three-year gain clocks in at nearly 90%. But not every moment has been a rocket ship. Over the last 30 days, Amazon’s stock slid by 4.0%, and it is just fractionally below where it started this year.
Much of this recent dip can be traced to broader market jitters as investors react to global economic uncertainties and shifting sentiment in the tech sector. Though nothing fundamental has changed in Amazon’s innovation engine or business model, many are re-evaluating what a fair price might look like for a digital giant with global ambitions. The risk-reward equation is evolving. Some see opportunity while others worry the best days might be behind us.
Looking at the numbers, Amazon.com currently scores a 4 on its value scale (with 6 being the highest score for undervaluation), ranking it as undervalued in four out of six key checks. Of course, every valuation method has its own quirks and blind spots. In the next section, we will break down these approaches, but stay tuned, because there may be an even smarter way to determine whether Amazon stock offers true value.
A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's value by projecting its expected future cash flows and then discounting those amounts back to their value in today's dollars. This approach helps investors assess what a business is worth based on its ability to generate cash over the coming years.
For Amazon.com, the current Free Cash Flow stands at $37.6 Billion. Analysts provide detailed cash flow estimates out to 2029, where projections reach $135 Billion. Extending the outlook further using Simply Wall St's extrapolations, Amazon's Free Cash Flow is expected to continue its robust annual growth, moving well into the $200 Billion range a decade from now.
Using the 2-stage Free Cash Flow to Equity DCF model, the intrinsic value per share for Amazon.com comes to $267.04. Compared to the current share price of $219.78, this calculation implies the stock is trading at a 17.7% discount relative to its estimated fair value.
Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Amazon.com is undervalued by 17.7%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover more undervalued stocks.
Approach 2: Amazon.com Price vs Earnings
For profitable companies like Amazon.com, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is often the preferred valuation metric because it links the company’s current share price to its actual earnings power. Investors use the PE ratio to gauge how much they are paying for each dollar of earnings. This makes it a straightforward way to compare companies in the same industry.
Growth expectations and perceived risks play a big role in determining what counts as a “normal” or “fair” PE ratio. Companies with stronger projected earnings growth or lower risk levels tend to justify higher PE ratios. More risky or slower-growing businesses usually command a discount.
Currently, Amazon.com trades at a PE ratio of 33.19x. This is higher than the average Multiline Retail industry PE of 21.90x, but lower than the average among its peer group at 46.07x. To provide a more tailored benchmark, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” based on a range of factors specific to Amazon.com, including its earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap, and business risks. For Amazon, this Fair Ratio comes in at 40.63x.
Unlike industry or peer comparisons that might overlook company-specific strengths and risks, the Simply Wall St Fair Ratio delivers a more accurate view of what Amazon’s PE should be. By weighing all relevant factors together, it accounts for why Amazon might be worth more or less than peers or the broader sector.
With Amazon’s actual PE ratio at 33.19x and the Fair Ratio at 40.63x, the current valuation looks attractive. This suggests the stock is trading below its fair value on an earnings basis.
Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Amazon.com Narrative
Earlier we mentioned that there’s an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a clear, user-driven story—your take on a company’s future—that connects your assumptions about revenue, profit margins, and fair value with a forecasted financial outcome. Instead of just running the numbers, you can articulate your perspective about Amazon.com’s strengths, industry outlook, or competitive position, then instantly see what that means for fair value and potential returns.
Narratives bridge the gap between a business’s story and the math behind valuation, helping you see how your convictions link directly to a projected price. With Narratives on Simply Wall St’s Community page (used by millions of investors), anyone can create, explore, and compare different outlooks. As new information comes in, such as earnings, news, or market trends, Narratives update dynamically, keeping you current and empowering smarter decisions about when to buy, hold, or sell by directly comparing fair value to price.
For example, the most bearish Amazon.com Narrative currently estimates fair value at $151, reflecting caution about global trade and cloud growth. The most bullish Narrative sees a $434 fair value, factoring in rapid AI adoption and aggressive earnings expansion. Your Narrative shapes your investment logic and makes your next step much clearer.
For Amazon.com, however, we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Amazon.com Narratives:
🐂 Amazon.com Bull Case
Fair value: $222.55
Current price is undervalued by approximately -1.2%
Revenue growth rate: 15.19%
Amazon’s true earnings power is being masked by reinvestment. Core businesses like AWS, Advertising, and its third-party seller ecosystem are driving robust long-term growth and profitability.
The company’s aggressive global expansion, operational optimization, and dominance in online retail and cloud services are seen as sustainable competitive advantages.
Continued heavy investment is expected to suppress near-term free cash flows, but is viewed as the right move for maximizing the large opportunities ahead.
🐻 Amazon.com Bear Case
Fair value: $151.21
Current price is overvalued by approximately 45.4%
Revenue growth rate: 7.2%
Amazon’s retail business faces limits to further expansion in the U.S. and rising competition. Maturity is expected to slow growth despite ongoing improvements in advertising and AWS segments.
High capital intensity and slowing sales-to-capital ratios mean larger investments are required for only moderate incremental growth, putting pressure on profit margins and returns.
Risks include trade headwinds, especially from deteriorating U.S.-China relations, and stock-based compensation potentially misaligning incentives as the company shifts focus from growth to profitability.

Amazon anticipates what we want to buy, Netflix knows what we’ll watch next, and Spotify curates playlists that feel almost personal. Against this backdrop, it’s no surprise that customers now expect their banks to deliver the same level of convenience, experience, guidance and relevance.
The problem is, banking hasn’t kept pace. Too often, the relationship between a bank and its customer is still defined by products and transactions. The result is a widening gap between what customers need and what they receive, and that’s exactly where disruption takes root.
Today’s customers don’t want apps that simply log their balances or display past spending. They want proactive, intelligent guidance that helps them make decisions in real time. They want their bank to act less like a service provider and more like a financial partner, or advisor, if you will.
What cognitive banking really means
This is where Cognitive Banking comes in. It marks a shift away from superficial “personalisation” toward deep, data-driven engagement. At its heart, Cognitive Banking is about bringing humanity back to digital channels, delivering the kind of financial guidance that was once available only to the wealthy, but now at scale.
By harnessing AI, banks can analyse behaviours, anticipate needs, and step in with meaningful support. That might mean flagging overspending before it spirals, automatically moving idle cash into savings, or nudging someone back on track with their financial goals. The aim isn’t to overwhelm customers with data, but to translate it into timely, actionable insights that genuinely improve their financial wellness.
From engagement to primacy
Engagement alone is no longer enough. According to Accenture’s Global Banking Consumer Study Report, 73% of customers engage with multiple financial institutions beyond their primary bank, and nearly 60% of primary checking accounts churn due to digital competitors. Customers increasingly shop around for the best deal, not the best relationship. For banks, the challenge isn’t just to engage customers, it’s to become their primary financial institution. That requires a more holistic view of wallet share and customer behavior across the entire lifecycle.
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataCrucially, this means looking beyond a customer’s direct interactions with the bank to understand their broader financial relationships, whether that’s with other providers, apps or payment platforms. Gaining this perspective allows banks to piece together a richer picture of customer needs, leading to more accurate insights, more relevant guidance and ultimately, a stronger relationship. What’s more, it doesn’t require open banking access.
Banks must understand not only how customers use their own products, but also the signals that point to activity elsewhere. With that broader perspective, they can move from offering one-size-fits-all experiences to delivering insights that strengthen loyalty and deepen the relationship.
Innovations now make it possible to segment customers by engagement type and tailor strategies accordingly. For example, new customers in their first 90 days can be nurtured with personalised insights that encourage adoption at the moment when attrition risk is highest. Secondary customers whose activity is drifting can be re-engaged with offers that rebuild trust and capture back wallet share. Customers showing attrition signals can be proactively supported to discourage them from leaving. Each segment receives curated, intelligence-driven guidance that helps them achieve their financial goals while encouraging them to rely more heavily on their primary institution.
Why this matters now
The business case is compelling. Primary customers generate up to 10x more deposits and 8x more fee revenue than non-primary customers. At the same time, research shows that 84% of consumers would consider switching banks to receive more relevant, timely insights. Financial wellness has overtaken health and relationships as a top life priority, and customers are prepared to reward the institutions that help them achieve it.
By harnessing behavioural intelligence and using customer data more intelligently, banks can deliver personalised, contextual guidance, strengthening trust, deepening wallet share, and accelerating the path to primacy.
The road ahead
Cognitive Banking offers more than an upgrade in digital experience; it is a strategy for long-term growth. It gives customers the confidence to make smarter decisions while enabling banks to capture greater loyalty, deposits, and engagement.
The industry is at an inflection point. Customers are demanding more, competition is intensifying, and primacy is the prize. The banks that thrive will be those that combine human understanding with the scale and intelligence of AI to create truly Cognitive Banking experiences; experiences that don’t just engage customers but secure their loyalty for the long term.
Now is the time to act. Customers are ready, the technology is proven, and the path to primacy has never been clearer.

This combination of customer-focused relief and major infrastructure upgrades reflects Entergy's push to support both community needs and the rapid growth of data center and industrial power demand across its service area.

We'll now explore how Entergy's expanded grid investment aims to reshape the company's long-term earnings and infrastructure resilience outlook.
We've found 19 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.
Entergy Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder in Entergy, you must be confident in the company’s ability to deliver steady, long-term earnings growth by executing large-scale capital plans that support surging power demand from industrial and data center clients. While recent announcements like the US$3 million ""Beat the Heat"" initiative reinforce Entergy’s alignment with community and industrial stakeholders, they are not likely to meaningfully impact the short-term catalysts or the biggest immediate risks, such as weather-driven outages or financing strains.
The proposal to increase Mississippi grid investment by 50%, funded by major industrial clients’ demand, stands out as a key recent move tied to Entergy’s core growth story. With a focus on resilience upgrades and reduced outages, this initiative is important as it directly addresses short-term reliability challenges while laying groundwork for longer-term earnings and regulatory outcomes.
However, investors should also weigh the implications if Entergy’s heavy commitment to future capital spending results in...

The company now uses the e-commerce giant’s third-party delivery service to send between 180,000 and 200,000 packages per month, VP of operations Rick Zumpano said at Amazon Accelerate 2025 earlier this month.
KiwiCo made the switch in May, seeking a shipping service that was cost effective and easy to integrate.
According to Zumpano, Amazon Shipping’s ground shipping cost on a per package basis was the most economical compared with other national parcel carriers. He also said that being able to integrate into Amazon’s infrastructure was a differentiating factor.
“It was that efficiency, that cost savings, that ability to plug into [their] network, the comfort level that we had knowing [Amazon] could reach all of those doorsteps, that was key for us,” he said.
During the onboarding process, KiwiCo worked with Amazon to understand the operation and what each company sought from the partnership, according to Zumpano. With most of KiwiCo’s shipments weighing under four pounds and measuring less than the size of a shoe box, the retailer’s “crates” were “very attractive freight from a parcel side.”
Given KiwiCo’s parcel specifications, Amazon employs “a drop and hook process” for shipments, per Zumpano.
“And every four hours, [they’re] bringing in a full trailer and [they’re] picking up the one we just spent the last four hours loading, and it's worked like clockwork for us since the first of May,” Zumpano said.
KiwiCo also is reaping benefits from Amazon Shipping's 24/7 operation, Zumpano said, noting that the company’s previous last-mile carrier didn’t operate on Sundays while offering Saturday deliveries that were “regional at best.”
The expanded scope of delivery days will allow KiwiCo to capture up to four additional sales days during the busy holiday shipping season, according to Zumpano.
“That's before any consideration we need to make to potentially subsidize expedited freight or whatever decisions we make,” he added.
With Amazon Shipping now handling nearly 100% of KiwiCo’s freight, the subscription company is completing deliveries a half day quicker while receiving fewer reports of damaged products.
“That's absolutely huge when you start to talk about those pieces — quicker transit time, reduced damage, let alone the pieces of cost, comfort and use of operations — all of those pieces together made the transition, made the decision a very easy one for us,” Zumpano said."

- Bark is now using Amazon for U.S. deliveries in a bid to boost shipping speed and limit rising costs, executives for the dog toys and treats brand said earlier this month.
- Amazon is accepting the BarkBox owner's products into its last-mile network for delivery seven days a week, according to James O'Leary, Bark's chief supply chain officer.
- ""We've been able to significantly improve our costs,"" O'Leary said. ""We improved our transit times from one to three days for 90% of our customers."" BarkBox shipments in the contiguous U.S. have a standard delivery time of two to eight business days.
Dive Insight:
Rising prices at major delivery services are pushing businesses to seek alternatives, such as Amazon’s growing shipping capabilities. Early last year, Bark used a combination of FedEx, the Postal Service and Pitney Bowes to deliver to U.S. customers, following efforts to consolidate its carrier mix and renegotiate shipping contracts.
""The prices fluctuate like every couple of years,"" O'Leary said. ""You get into agreement, your volume is really important. We ourselves were locked into some long-term agreements with some of these last-mile carriers.""
Bark executives did not provide the timing of the Amazon transition, but the company made the jump after facing increased shipping costs tied to shifts at the U.S. Postal Service. Starting in 2024, the agency ended various discount agreements that allowed shipping partners to drop off packages at the Postal Service's final-mile delivery units at a lower rate. O'Leary pointed to UPS SurePost, now called Ground Saver, as an example of one of the products affected.
""The cost of those products increased significantly and it had a fairly significant impact to us,"" he said.
Bark ships over 1.1 million packages per month, but the dimensions, weight and shipping cadence of its packages are ""fairly consistent,"" O'Leary said. That profile makes Bark ""absolutely perfect"" for Amazon's last-mile network, which caters to direct-to-consumer shippers, he added.
Bark posted an 8% YoY decline in shipping and fulfillment expenses for the quarter that ended June 30. Lower direct-to-consumer volume was the primary driver of that drop, CFO Zahir Ibrahim said on an earnings call last month."

August’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, came in as expected. Core PCE, barring food and energy, rose at an annual rate of 2.9%, while the all-items index recorded a 2.7% increase year over year and a 0.3% monthly gain. These readings, though still above the Fed’s 2% target, reaffirmed expectations for two quarter-point interest rate cuts by the year-end, per the CNBC article.

Consumer Sentiment
Consumer sentiment for September, reported by the University of Michigan, was only slightly weaker than expected and held steady among wealthier households with larger stock holdings. The survey’s index of consumer sentiment recorded a reading of 55.1, just slightly below the Dow Jones consensus forecast of 55.4 (as quoted on CNBC).
The reading marked a 5.3% decline month over month and a 21.6% slump from the same period a year ago.Inflation expectations held stable, with the one-year outlook at 4.7% and the five-year at 3.7%, as quoted on the abovementioned CNBC article.

(Reuters) -Belgian chip research hub imec will appoint Patrick Vandenameele as its new chief executive with current CEO Luc Van den hove becoming chairman, the company told Reuters on Monday.
Belgium's imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has made the change to help it adapt to the changing demands of artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaking, Vandenameele said in an interview.
The rising influence of AI is reshaping the company's priorities as it seeks to deepen its ties with cloud computing providers.
Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta (META.O), and Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O), known as hyperscalers, control about half of the world's data‑center capacity and are rapidly expanding their market share as AI build‑outs surges.
This AI boom has created demand for new, more efficient chips to fill their multibillion-dollar data centres.
""They are screaming for solutions to scale up, scale out, and to do this at a sustainable power balance. Power is the key problem in this case,"" Vandenameele said.
Belgium's imec matches the most advanced and expensive tools of makers like ASML and Applied Materials, with chipmakers and designers like TSMC, Nvidia, Apple and Google.
VENTURE & CHIPS ACT
Vandenameele, 52, began his career at imec in the 1990s, co‑founding four startups—three based on imec technology before taking on senior leadership roles at firms like Qorvo, and Huawei.
Under his leadership, the company plans to launch more spin-offs based on its technology. It will give start-ups earlier access to its chipmaking lines and help European deep tech firms overcome its funding and manufacturing hurdles, he said.
""The barrier for these small companies to get access to leading-edge technology is usually very high because they need to compete with huge companies to get access to these fabs"", Vandenameele said.
The Belgium-based lab is building a sub-2 nanometer chip pilot line, using funding of 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) from the European Union's act, to give European tech firms access to manufacturing technology that would otherwise be economically unattainable.
The research organisation is closely associated with top lithography equipment maker ASML, which was founded the same year across the nearby Dutch border, in Veldhoven.

The programmatic advertising company's stock price is down 60% since the beginning of the year. It plunged dramatically following earnings reports released in February and in August.
The severity of the drop probably changes the investment thesis on the stock. As the leading independent self-service platform for buying digital ad space, it offers a competitive advantage over large advertisers like Alphabet or Amazon, which hold biases toward their platforms.
Given the pace of its growth and the severity of its stock decline, investors have likely turned overly pessimistic on the stock, and here's why.
What happened to The Trade Desk
This year, The Trade Desk has become a tale of disappointing earnings reports. It started in February, when the stock lost most of its value after missing its own revenue estimate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
The stock plummeted, but a recovery accompanied by a favorable earnings report the next quarter helped it recover some of its lost value. However, The Trade Desk took another hit after announcing results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 in August. Concerns about tariffs pressuring large customers and rising competition from the likes of Google and Amazon weighed on the stock.
More recently, investors have found growing dissatisfaction with The Trade Desk's artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Kokai. A confusing interface and the removal of popular features from the old platform Solimar disappointed both users and investors. It was also unclear whether the company had forced users to adopt Kokai or would still allow them to continue using Solimar, making it more difficult for customers to do business with The Trade Desk.
Fortunately, The Trade Desk has moved to address this concern and has partially removed an unpopular interface from Kokai. The company has also moved to address the worries of investors, reporting that over 70% of client spend is now on Kokai as of the second quarter of 2025.
What the financials say
Nonetheless, the financials continue to point to unappreciated strength in The Trade Desk, though revenue growth has decelerated. In the first half of 2025, revenue of over $1.3 billion increased by 22% compared to the same period in 2024. While still a robust growth rate, the rise in revenue was down from the 27% increase it experienced in the previous year.
During that time, costs and expenses almost kept pace with revenue growth. Additionally, a much higher income tax expense resulted in $141 million in net income for the first half of the year, rising 21% yearly.
Indeed, the projected revenue increase of 14% for Q3 is down from prior quarters and could point to continued struggles with the platform. Nonetheless, analyst estimates point to 17% revenue growth in both 2025 and 2026, indicating the company has offered overly conservative guidance. Also, the aforementioned 60% decline in the stock price likely prices in the slowing revenue growth.
Still, the lower stock price has probably helped abate prior concerns about The Trade Desk's valuation. Although its 56 P/E ratio may seem high, it is down from 150 at the beginning of the year, placing its earnings multiple at a multiyear low. Moreover, with rising earnings pushing its forward P/E ratio down to 26, one could argue The Trade Desk is falling into value stock territory.
Buy The Trade Desk stock
Given The Trade Desk's valuation and the opportunity in the digital ad market, the stock looks increasingly like a buy.
Admittedly, the market had likely overvalued The Trade Desk stock at the beginning of the year. As a stock priced for perfection, it had nowhere to go but down as it missed a revenue target in Q4 and dealt with customer dissatisfaction over the Kokai rollout.
Nonetheless, The Trade Desk still stands at the forefront of an opportunity in the digital ad market. As it continues to address some of the competitive and operational concerns, its low valuation and continued growth appear to have made this stock a more compelling buy."

Shares in this ""Magnificent Seven"" component have been more volatile since the report's release and are effectively flat over the past three months. Concerns about the future growth of Amazon's AWS cloud computing segment have been a key factor behind this.
Worries about the impact of tariffs on Amazon's legacy business have also played a role. AWS may be the tech giant's main profit center, but the North America segment, which includes the company's U.S. e-commerce business, still represents a significant portion of its overall business. During the quarter ending June 30, 2025, out of $167.7 billion in net sales, $100.1 billion, or just under 60%, came from this segment. North America also contributed $7.5 billion, or around 39%, of $19.2 billion in total operating income during the quarter.
Hence, any sort of major headwind due to tariffs could severely impact future earnings. However, what if some of the latest changes in tariff policy from the Trump administration could be creating a tailwind for Amazon?
That may be the case, with the recent elimination of one ""tiny"" exemption in U.S. tariff law. Coupled with another key e-commerce catalyst, this recent development may bode well for Amazon shares in the long term.
The recent change in customs law leaves Amazon relatively unscathed
For years, overseas e-commerce companies were able to take advantage of what became known as the ""de minimis loophole,"" or U.S. tariff exemptions on imported shipments valued at under $800. So rather than ship their products in large batches to the U.S. to then sell to U.S. customers (and pay tariffs on the products as a result), these companies would ship each product individually. Thanks to this quirk in U.S. customs law, China-based platforms like PDD Holdings' Temu, as well as Shein, could penetrate the U.S. market and avoid tariffs -- all while minimizing their need to build a costly fulfillment network.
However, in May, this competitive advantage began to disappear. That's when President Donald Trump issued an executive order eliminating this exemption on shipments from China and Hong Kong. The impact on Shein and Temu was immediate, with both platforms reporting double-digit drops in daily active users and weekly sales. On Aug. 29, the exemption was eliminated for all U.S.-bound imports, marking an end to this loophole.
Shein and Temu aren't the only companies experiencing headwinds from this change in customs law. For U.S.-based platforms featuring a high volume of overseas direct ship listings, like eBay and Etsy, this is a headwind as well. For Amazon, however, the impact has been far less significant. Thanks to the company's large U.S.-based warehouse and fulfillment operations, the company and its third-party sellers have been able to adapt to the ""new normal.""
Moreover, beyond facing fewer challenges from this change, Amazon may also benefit from it. Third-party sellers are shifting to the company's fulfillment network, while Shein and Temu shift their overseas focus from the U.S. to Europe.
Short-term uncertainty outweighs new and existing e-commerce catalysts
The elimination of the de minimis loophole may bode well for Amazon's e-commerce business, but there is an even bigger potential catalyst in motion. So far this year, the company has ramped up efforts to integrate generative AI technology into its e-commerce operations.
It's difficult to tell whether these improvements have already started to improve margins. While Amazon's North American segment reported operating margins of 7.5% last quarter, a big improvement from the 5.6% reported for the prior year's quarter, remember that this segment also includes Amazon's faster-growing, high-margin advertising business. Then again, last quarter, while the number of individual orders increased by 12%, shipping costs for these orders increased by only 6%. This strongly suggests that the e-commerce giant's automation efforts are proving effective in reducing operating costs.
Over a multiyear time frame, profitability improvements could prove substantial. As analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out back in February, Amazon's pivot toward next-generation fulfillment centers could result in $10 billion in annual cost savings by 2030. Unfortunately, while Amazon has these two long-term catalysts in its corner, the aforementioned near-term concerns remain top of mind.
Stay focused on the long-term picture
Amazon is scheduled to release its next quarterly results on Oct. 28. In the past earnings release, Amazon guided for total operating income of between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion. As Amazon reported operating income of $17.4 billion in Q3 2024, there may be concern that Amazon will report declining operating income this quarter.
Right now, it's unclear whether these e-commerce tailwinds will enable Amazon to exceed Q3 2025 expectations. However, while ""better than feared"" e-commerce results could again be outweighed by negatives like lower-than-expected Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth, investors should stay focused on the long-term picture.
In the coming quarters, Amazon needs to assuage concerns that AWS (its cloud computing segment) is falling behind cloud competitors like Microsoft and Alphabet. Yet, even if these concerns persist, strength in areas like e-commerce and digital advertising may help to lift investor sentiment.
Trading for 28 times forward earnings, in line with its big tech peers, multiple expansion may prove difficult. Still, with analysts expecting Amazon to experience 15% earnings growth next year, merely rising in tandem with increased earnings would likely mean strong, steady gains for investors."

That disconnect is worth paying attention to. Amazon is firing on multiple cylinders across its businesses and has put itself in a position to generate stronger profits in the years ahead.
While the stock may look stuck, the fundamentals underneath are moving in the right direction.
Cloud growth and operating efficiency
Most investors still think of Amazon as an e-commerce company, but its biggest profit engine is its cloud computing unit. Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue jumped 17.5% last quarter to nearly $31 billion, with operating income climbing past $10 billion. That kind of operating margin profile stands in stark contrast to the thin margins in its e-commerce operations.
What is more important, though, is that AWS is becoming a hub for artificial intelligence (AI) development. Its Bedrock solution lets customers tap into leading foundation large language models (LLMs) so they can customize them for their needs, while SageMaker gives companies a platform to train and deploy their own models. Amazon also has its own AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which give customers a cheaper and more efficient alternative to graphics processing units (GPUs).
With demand for AI workloads surging, AWS has been a strong beneficiary. The company also recently rolled out new solutions like Strands and Agentcore to help build AI agents, which could become another growth driver.
At the same time, Amazon is embedding AI across its entire e-commerce ecosystem. This is where a lot of the company's earnings growth could come from in the years ahead.
One area of Amazon that is often overlooked is its leadership in robotics. Amazon already has more than a million robots working in its fulfillment centers, and the machines today are doing much more than just moving boxes. Some can detect damaged goods before they are shipped, reducing costly returns, while others are actually able to repair themselves. Meanwhile, its Deepfleet AI model orchestrates how these robots move, making sure they are as efficient as possible.
Amazon is also using AI to reduce shipment times. It's using AI to predict which warehouses are the best to store items in, and to optimize delivery routes. It's even using AI to help delivery drivers find hard-to-find drop-off locations in places like large apartment complexes. These are small improvements that can translate into billions in cost savings over time.
In addition to fulfillment and logistics, Amazon is using AI to improve other areas of its e-commerce operations. Its Rufus AI assistant was designed to help customers find the right products for their needs, helping to increase spending and reduce returns. It's also using AI to make its third-party listings better and to help advertisers better target potential buyers.
Advertising is another one of Amazon's underrated growth drivers. Its sponsored ad business carries high gross margins and has been one of the fastest-growing parts of its business. Add it all up, and Amazon is seeing a ton of operating leverage in its e-commerce business. This was on full display last quarter, when its North American operating income surged 47% to $7.5 billion on just an 11% increase in revenue to $100.1 billion.
An investment in Amazon is not risk-free. The company is spending heavily on data centers to keep up with cloud and AI demand, and that kind of capital expenditures (capex) could pressure margins if it overbuilds and ends up with too much capacity. Competition in cloud computing is also intense, with Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle also investing heavily to capture strong demand. Meanwhile, just like every retailer, if the economy slows, its sales could take a hit. That said, these are not new risks, and Amazon has navigated through tougher challenges before.
Is it time to buy the stock?
With Amazon's stock flat on the year, now looks like a great time to scoop up shares. The stock has been a laggard among big tech names, but Amazon is not a stock I would count out.
The company has a history of investing big to win big, and it's no different now with AI. With a lot of good things happening under the hood, the stock looks like a no-brainer buy at current levels."

The S&P 500 added 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%. All three are near their all-time highs set a week ago.
Big Tech stocks ticked higher to lead the way. Amazon added 1.1% following its 5.1% drop last week, and Microsoft rose 0.6% to recover some of its 1.2% decline. While their moves were modest, they were still two of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500 Monday because they’re two of Wall Street’s most valuable stocks.
On the losing end of the market were companies in the oil business, which were hurt by slumping crude prices. Drops of 2.6% for Exxon Mobil and 2.5% for Chevron were two of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.
This week’s highlight is scheduled to arrive on Friday, when a report will be due about how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed last month. The hope is that it will be balanced enough to keep the Federal Reserve on track to continue cutting interest rates.
The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more through the end of next year. That’s critical for investors because U.S. stocks have shot to records from a low in April in large part because of expectations for several cuts from the Fed. Easier rates can give the job market a boost and make investors more willing to pay high prices for stocks and other investments.
If Friday’s job numbers prove too strong, they could make the Fed less willing to cut rates. That could hurt stocks, which already face criticism that they’ve become too expensive following their big rally. If the job numbers are too weak, they could mean a recession that would hurt stock prices on its own.
One wild card may pop up in the interim: The U.S. government is nearing a deadline that could result in its shutdown.
The United States has already had many such shutdowns in the past, which have caused only minimal waves for the U.S. stock market and for the economy. But another shutdown could delay the collection and release of economic data, such as on jobs and inflation. Without those reports, increasing uncertainty on Wall Street could make markets more twitchy.
This shutdown may also be different because the White House may push for large-scale firings of federal workers this time around.
“We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility,” according to Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute."

It's hard not to be pleased with that kind of return, which points to a business that has clearly done extremely well in its various end markets. Prospective investors might also be happy with the fact that shares are down 10% from their peak, presenting an opportunity.
However, there's more to the story. Here's one reason to be very, very excited about Amazon stock right now.
Well positioned in the AI boom
Everyone sees Amazon as the e-commerce juggernaut. That's certainly true. But in the past several years, the huge success of Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit, has gotten a lot of attention.
AWS gives Amazon a strong position in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Companies want to leverage the necessary tools and services to build their own AI apps, and AWS provides that.
CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company plans to spend about $60 billion in capital expenditures in the second half of this year. ""AWS continues to be the primary driver as we invest to support demand for our AI services,"" he pointed out on the Q2 2025 earnings call.
Financial implications
As AWS continues to register robust demand, Amazon should benefit financially. During the latest quarter (Q2 2025 ended June 30), AWS posted 17% year-over-year growth. And it's an extremely profitable segment, with an average operating margin of 37% over the past four quarters. AWS has become a major growth and profit driver for the overall business."

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), a global leader in prestige beauty, offers a broad portfolio spanning skin care, makeup, and fragrance. The company has accelerated its digital transformation, with online sales reaching a record 31% of total sales in fiscal 2025, up three percentage points from the prior year. Growth is driven by expanded presence in Amazon’s Premium Beauty sections, rising engagement in Southeast Asia via platforms like TikTok and Tmall, and AI-driven retail experiments in China. This digital momentum helps offset declines in travel retail, which fell to 15% of sales in 2025.

The firm is also enhancing innovation capacity with the upcoming appointment of René Lammers, Ph.D., as Chief Research & Innovation Officer in October. This move aims to accelerate science-driven product development and shorten time-to-market, strengthening the brand’s competitive edge amid digital growth trends.

IonQ (IONQ) is making a deliberate bet on the commercial viability of quantum computing within this decade, positioning itself to be among the first to scale the technology. The company is deliberately unprofitable today, investing heavily in trapped-ion quantum processors, systems integration, and intellectual property to secure a leadership position, attracting interest from Amazon, Microsoft, and U.S. defense agencies.
Revenue grew 95% YoY to $43 million, and with roughly $340 million in cash and zero long-term debt, IonQ has the runway to fund R&D for several years. Despite this, the business model remains highly speculative, with net margins of -770%, free cash flow margins of -287%, and SG&A at 545% of revenue. Most revenue comes from experimental use cases and government partnerships, as quantum computing is still far from scalable for enterprise adoption, and profitability is not expected through 2027.
Valuation reflects this speculation, with a price-to-sales ratio of 206x and EV/EBITDA of -42x, pricing in commercial dominance that has yet to materialize. Technically, the stock appears to be peaking at the top of a corrective rally, completing a five-wave impulse and an ABC correction, with key resistance near $47–$49 and support at $44.75. Failure to hold this support could trigger a deeper wave toward $34 or lower, while a breakout above $49.90 could signal a renewed upward impulse, potentially targeting $54–$58 if driven by breakthroughs or partnerships.
For traders, this setup may offer short-term opportunities, while medium- to long-term investors should exercise caution, recognizing IonQ as a vision trade rather than a value investment. The risk-reward remains skewed, with substantial upside possible if quantum technology scales commercially, but downside is significant until clearer proof of progress or profitability emerges.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on IonQ, Inc. (IONQ) by Maestroszq in October 2024, which highlighted the company’s rapid revenue growth, patent portfolio, and scalable quantum hardware as key drivers. The stock has appreciated approximately 516% since coverage, as the thesis played out with rising market recognition. Investing With Purpose shares a similar view but emphasizes speculative fundamentals, high cash burn, and technical risks."

On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.
Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI
This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.
It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.
The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.
OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs."

Constellation Energy Group (CEG), headquartered in Baltimore, is the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in the U.S., with 32 GW of capacity—70% from nuclear and the balance from natural gas, hydro, wind, solar, and storage. Its nuclear fleet alone provides ~20% of all U.S. nuclear generation, making it the single largest source of carbon-free power in the country. CEG counts hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google among its key customers and recently announced a 20-year deal with Meta beginning in 2027.
The company also expects to close its acquisition of Calpine in Q4 2025 and has authorized a $400 million share repurchase program, reflecting strong capital allocation discipline. In Q2, revenue grew 11.3% to $6.1 billion, while GAAP EPS rose 3.5% to $2.67. Nuclear output declined modestly to 45,170 GWh due to unplanned outages, but CEG continues to operate at a 94% capacity factor, underpinned by heavy investment in digital optimization through AI dispatch systems and digital twin modeling, which are designed to enhance margins and operational efficiency.
Growth prospects are further supported by secular demand from AI, electrification, and reshoring, alongside favorable policy tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act. While CEG trades cheaply on sales, its 33.8x 2025 EPS multiple is elevated relative to peers like NextEra, Duke, and Southern, though its scale and carbon-free focus justify a premium. With EPS growth forecast at 9.1% in FY25 and 18% in FY26, CEG offers a compelling combination of stability, growth, and strategic positioning in clean energy despite near-term technical downside risks.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG) by jackandjillonthehill in March 2025, which highlighted margin expansion, strong ROE, and undervaluation despite nuclear power volatility. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 47% since our coverage. This is because rising demand and higher pricing played out. The thesis still stands as Oliver | MMMT Wealth shares a similar but emphasizes on strategic growth drivers.
Constellation Energy Corporation is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 79 hedge fund portfolios held CEG at the end of the second quarter which was 83 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

And so does that mean from an investing perspective, um, is that another reason to not look at those broadcast stocks and to maybe focus your attention on streaming?
I mean, look, you already have the headwinds of cord cutting that aren't going away and the shift of advertising over to streaming.
Um, look, the reason investors have gotten excited about these station groups is consolidation. You have a regulatory body, the FCC and Chairman Carr has been very vocal
that these assets need to be made stronger. They can't suffer the the the problems that the newspaper industry suffered by not being able to consolidate soon enough. So he is certainly trying to clear the path for consolidation and that will help in the short term. There's no doubt
greater scale, cost cutting will meaningfully help these broadcasters in the short term. But look, long-term viewership is moving away from linear TV. Sports, you know, is the
the only thing really keeping linear TV alive at this point. It is not local news. I'm sorry for all those new casters. It is sports and it's specifically the NFL.
And the more the NFL shifts content off of linear television, broadcast TV to cable and streaming, that is the ultimate long-term problem facing broadcasters. They've already lost Thursday Night Football to Amazon.
If they were to lose anything else, whether it be Sunday night or Sunday afternoon to streaming, that would be a huge problem for the broadcast television industry. And my guess is over the next three or four years, you start to see those those fears become a reality."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-28T13:00:00,Microsoft Stock Keeps Beating the Stock Market. Time to Buy?,The tech titan's core growth engines are firing on all cylinders.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=19988235cc90a6a0b376225bc469f926082e4493a423e21ecb4ff1740a0d8469,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/microsoft-stock-keeps-beating-stock-market-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/microsoft-stock-keeps-beating-stock-market-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/microsoft-stock-keeps-beating-stock-market-buy/,fool.com,200,,"When Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as Microsoft's (MSFT 0.10%) CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, many investors dismissed the tech giant as a slow-growth stalwart with limited upside potential. But if you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft on Nadella's first day on the job, your investment would be worth $140,000 today and paying out nearly $1,000 in annual dividends.
That same investment in an S&P 500 index fund would only be worth about $38,000 today. Let's see why Microsoft crushed the market -- and if it's still a good stock to buy.
How did Microsoft become a growth stock again?
Under Ballmer, Microsoft struggled to keep pace with Amazon (AMZN -0.56%), Alphabet's Google (GOOG 2.02%) (GOOGL 2.04%), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in the mobile and cloud markets. Its Windows and Office products still relied on periodic desktop upgrades, and its Windows Phones couldn't keep up with iPhones and Androids.
But after Nadella took over, Microsoft adopted an ambitious ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy. It transformed its Office desktop software into cloud-based services, expanded its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, and integrated those upgrades into Windows. It also scrapped its Windows Phone program, launched iOS and Android versions of its top productivity apps, rolled out more Surface devices, and expanded its Xbox business with new products and bold acquisitions.
Microsoft launched more AI services to process all the data that flowed through that sprawling ecosystem. It also started to accumulate a big stake in OpenAI -- the creator of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications -- in 2019. It then integrated OpenAI's tools into its Bing search engine, Azure's cloud platform, and its Copilot AI services.
Microsoft's aggressive investments in the mobile, cloud, and AI markets initially squeezed its margins. But from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2025 (which ended this June), its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%, its gross margin expanded from 64.7% to 68.8%, and its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 5%. It maintained that momentum even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts rattled the global economy.
Most of Microsoft's recent growth was driven by its cloud-based services. Azure is now the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Office suite -- which was rebranded as Microsoft 365 in 2020 -- holds a near-duopoly in the productivity software market with Google Workspace.
Why will Microsoft keep growing?
From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 15% and 16%, respectively. That robust growth should be driven by the secular expansion of the cloud and AI markets. More companies should migrate their data to its public cloud, hybrid cloud, and edge deployments, while the expansion of its data centers should support the development of even more powerful AI applications across its ecosystem.
Microsoft still faces intense competition from Amazon and Google in the cloud and AI markets, but it will likely draw in big companies that compete against those two tech giants in the e-commerce, streaming media, and digital advertising markets. Its Xbox gaming business, which absorbed Activision Blizzard and many other top game publishers, could also generate more recurring revenues with its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming services. The company also still held $94.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2025. That gives it plenty of room to expand its business via more acquisitions or buy back more shares to boost its EPS.
Is it the right time to buy Microsoft's stock?
Microsoft's stock doesn't look cheap at 33 times this year's earnings, but the robust growth of its cloud and AI businesses might justify that higher valuation. Even if it trades at a more modest 30 times forward earnings and it merely matches analysts' expectations through fiscal 2028, its stock could still rise about 26% to $645 over the next two years.
That return might not dazzle growth-oriented investors, but it would likely keep Microsoft's stock ahead of the S&P 500, which has generated an average annual return of 10% ever since its inception. Therefore, I think it's still a great stock for long-term investors to buy, hold, and forget."

Here’s what went down 25 years ago that ultimately burst the dot-com boom
The comparison between today’s artificial intelligence frenzy and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s has become impossible to ignore. As AI companies command valuations reaching into the hundreds of billions—minting dozens of new billionaires in 2025 alone—and tech giants pour unprecedented sums into data centers, investors and analysts are asking a similar question: Are we watching history repeat itself?
The similarities are striking. Like the internet companies of two decades ago, AI firms today attract massive investments based on transformative potential rather than current profitability. Global corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to research from Stanford University, with the sector growing thirteenfold since 2014. Meanwhile, America’s biggest tech companies—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capital expenditures this year alone, much of it for AI infrastructure.
Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company is valued at approximately $500 billion despite launching ChatGPT just two years ago, acknowledges the parallels. “
Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”
But what actually caused the dot-com bubble to burst in March 2000, and what lessons does it offer for today’s AI boom? Let’s take a stroll down memory lane—or, if you weren’t born yet, some plain ole history.
The perfect storm of 2000
The dot-com crash wasn’t triggered by a single event, but rather a convergence of factors that exposed fundamental weaknesses in the late 1990s tech economy. The first critical blow came from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates multiple times throughout 1999 and 2000. The federal funds rate climbed from around 4.7% in early 1999 to 6.5% by May 2000, making speculative investments less attractive as investors could earn higher returns from safer bonds.
The second catalyst was a broader economic recession that began in Japan in March 2000, triggering global market fears and accelerating the flight from risky assets. This one-two punch of higher rates and global uncertainty caused investors to reassess the astronomical valuations of internet companies.
But the underlying problem ran much deeper: Most dot-com companies had fundamentally flawed business models. Commerce One reached a $21 billion valuation despite minimal revenue. TheGlobe.com, founded by two Cornell students with $15,000 in startup capital, saw its stock price jump 606% on its first day of trading to $63.50, despite having no revenue beyond venture funding. Pets.com burned through $300 million in just 268 days before declaring bankruptcy."

Many of those stocks -- including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon -- were in the tech sector. Amazon, the top cloud infrastructure company, also became the first online retailer to join the 12-zero club.
Yet not a single brick-and-mortar retailer has joined that elite group. Could Costco Wholesale (COST 0.85%), with a market cap of $420 billion, cross that threshold in the near future?
How fast has Costco grown since its public debut?
Costco, the world's largest warehouse club retailer, went public at a split-adjusted price of $1.67 per share on Dec. 5, 1985. Today, it trades at about $950 -- a $1,000 investment in its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth nearly $569,000 today and pay out more than $3,100 in annual dividends. That 56,786% gain over the past 40 years was driven by its constant construction of new warehouses, its rising number of cardholders, and its high renewal rates.
From fiscal 1985 (which ended in September 1985) to fiscal 2024, Costco's number of warehouses increased from 11 to 891 locations, its number of cardholders jumped from 1.3 million to 136.8 million, and its annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from $1.1 billion to $254.4 billion.
How does Costco keep expanding?
Costco generates most of its profits from its high-margin membership fees, which allows it to sell a lot of its products at low, break-even, or even loss-leading margins. It also leverages its scale to negotiate favorable bulk rates with its suppliers, and it promotes its own Kirkland private-label products as a cheaper alternative to name-brand products.
Costco carries a narrower selection of products than superstores like Walmart, but it constantly rotates them to draw its shoppers back for return visits. Its gas stations, food court, vision center, and other ancillary services reinforce that strategy. So as long as Costco keeps growing its comparable store sales, opening new warehouses, gaining new cardholders, and locking them in with high renewal rates, its business will flourish. All of those core growth metrics headed in the right direction over the past few years -- even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds rattled the global economy.

Costco weathered the pandemic because it remained a top destination for stocking up on household goods, while inflation drove more cost-conscious shoppers to its stores. It raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years last September to offset the inflationary pressure on its margins, but that price hike didn't impact its growth.
Costco hasn't reported its full-year earnings for fiscal 2025 yet, but it ended the third quarter with 142.8 million cardholders and a healthy global renewal rate of 90.2%. For the full year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow 8% and 9%, respectively.
Could Costco become a trillion-dollar company?
From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Costco's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 8% and 10%, respectively. That growth should be fueled by its ongoing overseas expansion, its rising e-commerce sales, and upgrades for its ancillary services.
We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Costco has a proven track record of expanding through bear and bull markets. But it isn't a bargain at 47 times next year's earnings -- presumably because too many investors bought it as a safe haven play in this choppy market. If Costco matches analysts' expectations, continues to grow its EPS at a CAGR of 10% over the following eight years, and trades at a more reasonable 30 times earnings, its stock could rise nearly 50% to $1,420 over the next 10 years.
That would be a decent gain, but it would only boost its market cap to $630 billion. It could also underperform the S&P 500, which has generated an average annual return of about 10% since its inception. So while Costco is still a stable investment, it's getting overheated and probably won't become a trillion-dollar retailer within the next decade."

If you take an even longer view, GM has returned 33.2% over the last year and has more than doubled in five years, rising 108%.
So, what’s fueling that momentum? Recent headlines include both shakeups and signals of progress. Honda’s decision to stop U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric crossover assembled by GM might look like a setback on the surface, but it could point to smarter resource allocation as the company partners and pivots within a rapidly changing EV landscape. Meanwhile, reports about Amazon quietly testing GM’s BrightDrop electric vans suggest GM is staying relevant as major customers explore cleaner delivery solutions. Ongoing discussions with SAIC in China further show that GM isn’t just standing still; it is actively adjusting its strategy for future growth.
With this backdrop, let’s talk about value. On a six-point undervaluation checklist, GM scores a 5, which pegs it as undervalued by nearly all standard measures. But what does that actually mean for you as an investor? We’ll break down the valuation approaches and then look beyond the numbers for a fresh perspective on what GM could really be worth.
Why General Motors is lagging behind its peers
Approach 1: General Motors Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model attempts to estimate a company’s fair value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today. This provides an intrinsic value that investors can compare against the current share price.
For General Motors, the latest reported Free Cash Flow (FCF) stands at $13.05 billion. According to analyst estimates, FCF is expected to fluctuate over the next decade and reach $8.71 billion by 2029. While analysts supply projections for the first five years, further estimates are extrapolated by financial platforms to present a comprehensive 10-year outlook.
Based on these cash flow projections, the DCF model values GM’s intrinsic share price at $91.90. This suggests that GM is currently trading at a notable 33.4% discount when using the recent closing price of $61.24 as a reference.
In short, the numbers indicate that GM’s stock is trading well below its estimated fair value according to forecasts grounded in cash generation potential and forward-looking assumptions."

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the AI Stocks Every Investor Should Watch. On September 24, Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski upgraded the stock from Equal Weight to Overweight with a price target of $280.00 (from $245.00).
The firm has stronger conviction in AWS revenue acceleration in 2026 driven by Project Rainier capacity additions and peak share losses in 2025.
Gawrelski noted how Project Rainier is a dedicated AWS data center for Anthropic compute in Indiana. It is expected to start coming online in January 2026. His team has estimated that the facility will contribute an estimated $14B annual AWS revenue at full capacity of 2.2GW.
Even though AWS market share will keep declining, growth should pick up pace again as the broader cloud industry expands.
Some risks highlighted by the firm include execution challenges with Rainier, Trainium chip performance, slow core workload demand, and AI-related margin pressure.
“Upgrading AMZN to OW (from EW) on greater conviction in AWS acceleration in ’26. Raising AWS growth to +22% from prior/consensus of +19%/+18%. We see Project Rainier, a significant compute capacity build w/ partner Anthropic, as the primary driver of acceleration, contributing 5%/4% to AWS growth in ’26/’27. See build in our companion cloud industry note. We view AWS revenue acceleration as the key to the reversal of share underperformance YTD (flat vs. NDQ +17%). Increasing our 2026 / 2027 AWS revenue estimates by 3% / 7% as we see Project Rainier capacity additions starting in early 2026 supporting incremental Anthropic compute. Expect Project Rainier Phase 1 (1.3GW) to come online in Jan ’26 w/ 6-month utilization ramp and Phase 2 to start coming online in 4Q26. We estimate Indiana campus at full capacity (2.2GW) contributes ~$14B annual revenues to AWS. We forecast Anthropic contributes 7 points to AWS 2026 revenue growth (vs 3 points in 2025). See AWS market share losses peaking in 2025 (-470bps y/y), improving in 2026 and beyond as AWS accelerates, alleviating competitive concerns. While share losses remain material, we take solace in stronger industry growth and rising AWS estimates. Project AWS share losses modestly improve to -420bps y/y in 2026, -260bps y/y in 2027 and -180bps y/y in 2028. By 2029, see AWS at 32% share, down from 47% in 2024. However, over that period, see cloud industry 31% CAGR to $870B from $230B in 2024. Risks to our call include execution of scaling Project Rainier, performance of Trainium chips, further deceleration of core (non-AI) workloads, and greater AI-related margin headwinds than anticipated. See operational execution of Project Rainier (and data center capacity more broadly) as key risk given ongoing supply constraints and uncertainty around large Trainium deployments. We assume AWS OI margin compression of 270bps / 180bps y/y in 2026 / 2027 tied to scaling AI deployments.”"

Many investors are likely attracted to it as a dividend stock, but that's a risky call. It is more appropriate to see this package delivery giant as a turnaround stock. And if that's how you view it, now could be the time to hit the buy button.
What UPS does is hard to do
Without getting into the logistical details, moving packages quickly and cost-effectively is very difficult. Even after huge capital investments in its own delivery service, Amazon still uses UPS. But Wall Street has a habit of going to extremes, which is a big part of why UPS could be an attractive turnaround stock.
During the pandemic, package demand spiked. Investors extrapolated that demand far into the future, bidding up UPS' stock price. Demand slowed, and UPS' stock price crumbled when the world learned to live with COVID-19. UPS chose to start a major business overhaul as demand was returning to normal levels. The goal is to increase the use of technology to cut costs and to refocus on the company's most profitable business lines to increase profit margins.
This is a multiyear effort with material up-front costs. And exiting low-margin business will lower sales even as it helps improve profitability. (Notably, UPS has chosen to proactively reduce its business relationship with Amazon.) Financial results have been ugly lately, which is what you'd expect. An over 97% dividend payout ratio, however, hints that most income investors should tread with caution.
However, there are positives starting to show through. For example, revenue per piece increased 5.5% in the U.S. business during the second quarter of 2025. That could be signaling that deeply out of favor UPS stock is turning a corner and is, thus, ripe for an upturn as investors get more confident in its business overhaul."

By holding the highest-quality companies for long periods, the miracle of compound earnings works its magic, enabling truly great results without investors having to do anything aside from that initial purchase.
While Buffett and his investing lieutenants have been buying and selling more often over the past few years, many names in the Berkshire portfolio have the qualities of ""forever"" stocks -- like the following three.
Amazon
Buffett only holds two of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, with Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) being one of them.
At first, one might wonder why Berkshire holds Amazon. After all, the stock is not ""cheap"" by any means, and it's also a lower-margin business than its software and internet peers. And while other Mag Seven stocks pay dividends and do share repurchases, Amazon doesn't pay a dividend and hasn't bought back much stock over its corporate life.
However, Amazon management operates much like Berkshire Hathaway, in that Amazon takes a long-term view and is willing to invest lots of money for years to build a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. Most notably, Amazon spent tons of money building a nationwide e-commerce delivery platform, and is miles ahead -- pun intended -- of any would-be competitor in delivering packages within one or two days.
Notably, Amazon hasn't performed as well as other Mag Seven stocks in recent years in the age of AI. However, that may be short-sighted.
While artificial intelligence is a hugely competitive field, Amazon is one of the few companies with the ability to compete. But it's not just its AI offerings, bolstered by its big investment in Anthropic, that will enable Amazon to get its share of AI business. AI also has the potential to greatly enhance Amazon's two large existing businesses in e-commerce and the cloud.
As All-In podcast host Jason Calacanis noted on social media platform X, Amazon's e-commerce operations are set to greatly enhance profitability as a result of AI innovation. In a few years, Calacanis predicts AI robots will soon replace most Amazon factory and warehouse workers, while Zoox self-driving vans may replace most human-driven delivery vehicles.
Amazon's e-commerce business has already improved its profit margins by a lot over the past few years. Its North American business has increased operating margins from 5.2% in the first quarter of 2024 to 7% last quarter, while its international e-commerce business has grown margins from a 0.4% operating loss to a 3.4% positive operating margin over those same six quarters.
As Amazon implements more and more AI and automation into its e-commerce and digital advertising platforms, those margins should continue to rise.
And while Amazon's leading cloud platform hasn't grown as much as some rivals, Amazon Web Services is also the largest player, and it's harder to grow off a bigger base. That being said, AWS still grew a strong 17% pace off a massive $116.3 billion run rate last quarter, with healthy operating margins in the mid-30s. Look for its AI services, such as Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic, to continue boosting revenues by double-digits, while Amazon gains efficiencies from AI on the cost side.
Finally, look for Amazon to cultivate more new business in the future with its innovation-focused culture and long-term mindset. One such new business, satellite-based internet service Project Kuiper, is set to make its first revenues in the next year.
American Express
Some candidates for ""forever"" stocks are luxury brands that cater to upper-income consumers. As long as a company maintains and nurtures a brand that customers associate with excellent service and value, that brand can usually maintain high margins and pricing power.
Pricing power can allow a company to grow at above-GDP rates for long periods of time, which is a recipe for long-term outperformance. It's one of the reasons Buffett has never sold a share of American Express (AXP -0.49%), a stock he's held for 35 years.
Thirty-five years into Buffett's investment, American Express is still growing at above-average rates. Revenues net of interest expense grew 9% last quarter, while adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share grew at 17% as margins expanded. Discount revenue was up 5%, card fees were up 20%, and net interest income on loans was up 12%. And Amex continues to have delinquencies and charge-offs well below the industry average, showing good underwriting and marketing to the right type of consumer.
While the stock doesn't appear as cheap as other banks, American Express' valuation is still much cheaper than the other big card networks Visa and Mastercard.
Meanwhile, American Express just raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card by a whopping $200 to $895, while also adding $1,400 of new benefits. As long as American Express continues to attract partners that seek out its high-spending clientele, it should continue to be able to offer customers more discounts on luxury goods and services -- thereby attracting good credits while also being able to raise card fees, leading to long-term profitable growth.
Chubb Limited
Like American Express, Chubb Limited (CB -2.39%) caters to high-end clients in the homeowner's and business property and casualty insurance market. Unlike other insurers which generally offer standardized plans and then attempt to mitigate costs when claims come due, Chubb takes a different approach.
In its Masterpiece Homeowner's insurance plans, Chubb generally offers customized coverage for high-end items and other features that are usually only add-ons to other plans. When claims come due, Chubb generally pays the full replacement costs of damaged or lost items in full without depreciation, and generally gets payments out very quickly to claimants.
That high level of customer service and peace of mind comes at a higher premium cost, giving Chubb pricing power in the market, which generally allows for consistently high profits and sub-100 combined ratios year in and year out.
The insurance market has also hardened in recent years, allowing insurers to raise prices dramatically, creating a rather favorable environment in the industry. For its part, Chubb continued to deliver stellar results in the second quarter, with a combined ratio of 85.6% in its P&C business.
While natural disasters such as January's Los Angeles wildfires always have the potential to decimate earnings in any particular quarter, Chubb's highly profitable niche should enable the company to bounce back and remain profitable through cycles. With the stock trading at just 12.3 times earnings, now is a solid entry point to buy and hold Chubb for the long haul."

UPS has long been a household name in delivery and logistics, but its share price has taken investors on quite a ride lately.

Even the shorter-term performance has not inspired confidence, with minor drops of 0.4% in the past week and 4.7% over the past month. If you have been following UPS for a while, you will remember that five years ago, this stock sat considerably higher, and the nearly 40% decline since then signals that something has definitely shifted in how the market perceives its risk and growth prospects.
While these moves might spook some investors, they also raise an interesting question: Is UPS now priced for opportunity rather than disappointment? Market sentiment can swing fast when macroeconomic developments or industry trends shake investor confidence, so a company that looks battered on the surface might be quietly building value. Interestingly, when we crunch the numbers using widely accepted valuation methods, UPS currently earns a valuation score of 6 out of 6, meaning it is undervalued on every metric we check. Of course, valuation is a multifaceted topic, and not all checks are created equal. Up next, let us break down how each approach measures up, and later, explore a smarter way to get to the heart of what UPS is really worth.
Why United Parcel Service is lagging behind its peers
Approach 1: United Parcel Service Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates the value of a business by forecasting its future cash flows and then discounting those amounts back to today’s dollars. For United Parcel Service, this approach relies on projecting how much free cash the company will generate in coming years and ensures that those future dollars are weighed against the value of money today.
Currently, UPS generates about $2.75 Billion in Free Cash Flow. Analysts provide detailed estimates up to five years out, projecting annual cash flows to reach $7.05 Billion by 2029. Beyond that, Simply Wall St extends the projections further, estimating consistent growth based on past data and expectations. All these cash flow figures are considered in dollars.
Based on this 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the DCF method assigns UPS a fair value of $166.92 per share. With the stock currently trading at a notable discount, this implies the share price is about 49.8% below its calculated intrinsic worth."

Seemingly not, as nervousness about the state of the world – its worsening conflicts, its economic turbulence – drives growing hordes of investors to seek shelter in the preeminent safe-haven asset. The yellow metal notched a sixth straight weekly increase, boosted by inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds and a risk-off tone in broader markets.
Gold has climbed more than 40% year-to-date, and banks including Goldman Sachs (GS) see the rally continuing toward the $4,000 mark. Silver (SI=F) is enjoying a winning spell too, threatening the hallowed $50 level.
It wasn't such a golden week for chancellor Rachel Reeves, already under huge pressure to plug a yawning hole in the public finances, as the OECD sounded the alarm on growth and inflation. The international policy forum predicts that inflation in the UK will average 3.5% this year, higher than any other G7 nation including the US which is grappling with the effects of Trump's tariff regime.
The OECD sees the pace of price increases easing to 2.7% next year, still well above the Bank of England’s 2% target. It also predicts higher taxes and reduced government spending will act as a drag on economic growth.
There was some good news for the beleaguered chancellor though, as plans for a second runway at Gatwick Airport were given the green light. Reeves, keen to seize on any positive news ahead of her November budget, said the £2.2 billion plan would create thousands of jobs and help “kickstart the economy”. Our readers' poll suggested most of you agreed.
Let’s take a closer look at these and other stories making the financial headlines in the last few days.
Key moments from the last week
UK braced for highest inflation in G7, says OECD
The latest projections from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development made for grim reading, with the UK seen heading for inflation of 3.5% this year as it struggles with flagging growth. That figure – 75% above the Bank of England's target – is seen easing to 2.7% in 2026.
Consumer prices are being pressured by an increase in the minimum wage and employers' national insurance contributions, as well as hikes in utility bills.
The forecasts will add to the burden on Rachel Reeves ahead of her next budget, slated for 26 November, as the government sets out on a growth mission.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP
According to NBC affiliate KGW8 [1], he received an annual check for $260,000, which helped him retire and buy a house on six acres in scenic Bellingham, Washington.
But this year, the checks suddenly stopped after PCH filed for bankruptcy without warning him or other winners. Wyllie told KGW8 the turn of events “feels like a nightmare,” especially as he hasn’t worked in over a decade and can’t find a job now.
Wyllie’s story is a harsh reminder that easy money isn’t always forever. It’s a reality check that could strike anyone who finds themselves scrambling to offset the loss.
From bankable to bankruptcy
KGW8 reported that Wyllie is one of at least 10 winners still owed money they’ll likely never receive.
ARB Interactive, which paid $7.1 million to buy PCH, announced it would only honor prizes won after it took over in July. Past winners still waiting on payments, will “have to seek payment from the bankruptcy estate,” according to The Wall Street Journal [2].
Andrea Coles-Bjerre, a University of Oregon law professor, told KGW8 it’s unlikely those winners will be able to collect their winnings. They’ll be considered unsecured creditors competing for money that simply doesn’t exist.
PCH’s collapse followed a sharp post-pandemic [3] decline after going from nearly $900 million in annual revenue pre-COVID to just over $180 million last year. Analysts blame competition with online giants like Amazon, along with an $18 million Federal Trade Commission [4] settlement in April, for deceptive practices that tricked people into thinking they had to buy products to improve their sweepstakes odds.
The company filed for bankruptcy that same month.

For sure. We, you know, we actually launched our AVd service during the Covid uh lockdowns and the it just kind of took off. It was a pretty amazing run that we had on AVd and fast. But what we've seen is that's continued over the last few years. And even you'll see the subscription services are adding ads back in. So I think ads are going to be part of the the total mix. But do I think it's the only way that content's going to be um consumed? Absolutely not, which is again, I think our AVd catalog is one of the largest and that's great.

So to to answer your question, I think there's going to be some of all of it. Hopefully we'll still have subscription services where we don't have to watch any ads, but there are plenty of, you know, great content options where ads are a part of that and if it it results in a uh less expensive uh overall cost for the end user, I think that's great."

By identifying and investing in these companies, you can shift your focus to other stocks while just letting these safe choices do their thing. However, investors must identify a trend that allows these companies to succeed over the long term; otherwise, they could turn out to be losing picks.
Three stocks that I think are worth buying and holding forever are Microsoft (MSFT 0.10%), Alphabet (GOOG 2.02%) (GOOGL 2.04%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.56%). These three are all considered AI hyperscalers, but they're benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI) through another important business segment: cloud computing.
The boom in cloud computing
Cloud computing is a genius business model, and all three of these tech giants have a thriving operation in it. Most companies don't want to spend huge amounts on computing power or storage. And upkeep on this equipment can be expensive and require specialists. So instead of having to build huge computing capacity, many companies choose to rent it from cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The business model for cloud computing providers is extremely simple: build out capacity and rent it out for more than it costs to build and operate. All three companies have mastered this model and are seeing great results.
AWS is the largest cloud provider, although it's growing the slowest, so that gap is closing. In the second quarter, AWS grew 17% to $30.9 billion and made up 18% of Amazon's total revenue. However, it's a huge income source: It generated 53% of Amazon's total operating profits.
With AWS making up the majority of Amazon's profits while growing faster than its e-commerce business, the cloud segment will continue to become a larger part of the parent company with each year, further transforming it from an e-commerce play to a cloud computing play.
Google Cloud was the last of the three primary cloud services to enter that arena, so it's behind the other two. But it's still doing phenomenally well. Its revenue increased 32% year over year to $13.6 billion in the second quarter, and its operating margin increased to 21%.
Google Cloud is one of Alphabet's fastest-growing segments, and with huge computing demand still emerging, it's a trend that will boost the company's stock over the long term.
Microsoft, in second place in cloud market share with Azure, is growing the fastest of this trio. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending June 30), Azure's revenue rose 39% year over year.
Unfortunately for investors, Microsoft doesn't break out the exact revenue total for this division, so investors are kept guessing how much it generates. However, we still know it's less than AWS, as the divisions that Azure is within (Intelligent Cloud) produced $29.9 billion in revenue, below AWS' total. Still, with continued elevated growth, Azure could surpass AWS as the cloud computing leader soon.
Cloud computing is a quickly expanding business
Clearly, cloud computing is doing well right now, but will that continue?
Once a company has moved to the cloud, it's hard to go back. This creates high switching costs for clients, essentially locking them in for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, cloud computing is a huge part of how AI is being deployed. Few companies are building AI capacity on-premise, and these three are building huge AI data centers to meet computing demand from their clients.
With two major tailwinds blowing in cloud computing's favor (general workloads and AI workloads), it's no surprise that third-party market projections think the business will soar over the next few years. Grand View Research estimates that the cloud market in 2024 was about $752 billion. However, it's expected to rise to $2.39 trillion by 2030.
That's monster growth, and because companies are always launching new workloads, it means continued growth even after these five years.
Cloud computing is an excellent segment to invest in, and this trio is the best way to do it. I think buying all three and holding them forever is a smart idea since they have what it takes to provide long-term market-beating returns."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-27T08:10:00,2 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term,Amazon and Microsoft are market leaders that are adapting to new tech opportunities.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c90e409850351d7b0866cee4218b6b39136c182287ee47b144a9f179da61c7a0,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/2-brilliant-growth-stocks-to-buy-now-and-hold-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/2-brilliant-growth-stocks-to-buy-now-and-hold-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/2-brilliant-growth-stocks-to-buy-now-and-hold-for/,fool.com,200,,"The market is being led higher by megacap tech companies that have shown the ability to grow and adapt. With technology continually shifting, this is the key to long-term success and leadership.
Let's look at two top companies that have not only grown to become the largest in the world today, but also have bright futures, given their ability to adapt and find new opportunities.
1. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) built its e-commerce business by spending years pouring money into warehouses and logistics, and now it is using artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to get more out of that network. Its DeepFleet AI model is now coordinating more than 1 million robots across its fulfillment centers, and these robots are doing more than just moving boxes around. Some can spot damaged products before they get shipped, which means fewer returns, and some can even repair themselves.
But the use of AI does not stop there. Amazon is also using AI to figure out which warehouse should hold a product, the best route to get it to a customer, and even where the driver needs to go in a huge apartment complex to drop a package off. This is leading not only to quicker deliveries, but also to lower costs.
Amazon is also using AI to help advertisers better target users with its high-gross margin sponsored ad business. This is resulting in strong operating leverage in its e-commerce business, with its North American operating income surging 47% last quarter on only an 11% increase in revenue.
At the same time, AWS is still a powerful growth engine. It continues to lead the cloud market with nearly 30% share and grew revenue by more than 17% last quarter. Demand is strong because customers are rushing to build AI models and applications, and AWS makes that simple with tools like Bedrock and SageMaker.
The company is also pushing into agentic AI with Strands and AgentCore, which let customers build AI agents and run them safely. Its custom Trainium and Inferentia chips make training and running those models cheaper and faster, which keeps customers on its platform.
Amazon is making a lot of capital expenditures (capex) to build its AI infrastructure, but it has a history of spending big, then reaping the rewards later. With margins expanding in e-commerce and AWS still capacity constrained, the growth story here is far from over, and the stock still looks like a long-term buy.
2. Microsoft
In the past, Microsoft (MSFT 0.10%) was often viewed as a slow mover, but with AI, it moved quickly, which has proven to be the right move.
The company made a large, early investment in OpenAI, which gave it early access to its GPT models and let it roll out Copilot AI assistants across its Office suite. Those tools are valuable because they can save workers time, and at $30 per user, per month, this can add a lot of growth.
The bigger growth driver, though, is its cloud computing unit Azure. Microsoft's cloud revenue jumped 39% last quarter, and it could have been higher if it hadn't run into capacity constraints. The company is spending heavily to add more graphics processing units (GPUs) and servers, which should allow it to capture even more demand in the quarters ahead. Microsoft is also diversifying its AI stack, adding models from xAI and building its own in-house models, giving customers more flexibility.
What makes Microsoft a compelling stock to own for the next decade is that Azure is the fastest-growing of the big three cloud providers, and it has a chance to eventually challenge AWS for the No. 1 spot in cloud computing. That is where enterprise AI workloads are being run, and Microsoft is quickly becoming one of the top choices for companies that want access to the best models and the infrastructure to run them at scale.
Microsoft has proven it can adapt and act quickly, which is exactly what you want to see from a tech leader."

(Hint: Not Broadcom)","When you're the industry leader by a large margin, growth is on your side.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e04aa76ead8f9ee17cd3da5137fa1db6f5a8becfa2a6b1bc9ec7777a4e0a8323,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-semicon/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-semicon/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-semicon/,fool.com,200,,"Semiconductors (chips) are kind of like the unsung heroes of the tech world. You don't see them, yet they're the brains that power almost every electronic device that we interact with daily. And there's nobody better at manufacturing semiconductors than the appropriately named Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 3.13%), also known as TSMC.
TSMC is the world's leading semiconductor foundry by a large margin. It has around a 70% market share, while second-place Samsung's market share is only around 7%. The foundry model means that TSMC doesn't make chips for general sale. Instead, companies will design the chips they need for their products, and TSMC will use its manufacturing ability to bring them to life.
At the time of this writing, TSMC's market cap is around $1.4 trillion. To hit the $2 trillion mark by 2028, it would need to average around 14% annual returns over the next few years. You should never use past performances to predict future ones, but given the company's growth prospects and its 29% average annual returns over the past decade, I'm confident it can happen.
TSMC's role in the AI ecosystem
TSMC isn't your typical artificial intelligence (AI) stock in the sense that it has a generative AI app or other software people interact with. Yet its role in the AI ecosystem is as important as almost any stock you can name.
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Alphabet all design chips and other hardware that power data centers, which are essentially the backbones of training and developing AI models. Yet most of this wouldn't be possible without TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability.
When it comes to manufacturing advanced AI chips, TSMC is essentially the only go-to. Without it, you could make a valid argument that data centers would be less efficient, which means that AI training would be less efficient, which means many of the AI applications we interact with today would be less capable and scalable.
TSMC is improving its profit and margins
TSMC has long been an impressive moneymaker, but it has stepped it up a lot in the past few years. In the second quarter, it made $30 billion in revenue, which was up 44% year over year and close to 18% higher than the first quarter. If its third-quarter revenue falls between $31.8 billion and $33 billion, as it predicts, that will represent between 35% and 40% year-over-year growth.
In Nvidia's latest earnings report, it noted that it expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure through 2030. With TSMC being a key part of AI infrastructure, this should be music to the company's ears.
The revenue growth is impressive, but TSMC's expanding margins may be the most noteworthy. Since last year, its profit margin has expanded from 36.8% to 42.7%, gross margin has expanded from 53.2% to 56.8%, and operating margin has expanded from 42.5% to 49.6%.
These expanding margins are a testament to TSMC's ability to command premium pricing because of its advanced manufacturing ability, and its customers knowing that it's essentially their only choice if they want the most powerful chips.
TSMC is trading at a good value for long-term investors
TSMC is currently trading at around 23.5 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months. It's not ""cheap"" by most standards, but it also seems like a good value for a company that's as dominant as TSMC and has its growth potential.
TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability isn't something that can be easily caught up to and replicated because it takes many years of experience and billions invested into research and equipment. That gives it a competitive advantage that's likely to last for quite a while, especially because it's not easy for its customers to switch manufacturers without risking performance or reliability.
That edge gives me confidence that TSMC can enter the $2 trillion club within the next few years."

Yet another compound growth story is unfolding in the world of big tech that it would be easy to overlook. With a market-leading cloud computing business, a high-margin advertising business, and a faster, automated logistics network that continues to lower costs, Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) may soon take the investing world by surprise. Here's why Amazon's market capitalization could cross $5 trillion by 2030.
Impressive financial performance
Amazon's recent financial results have been impressive. In the second quarter, revenues were up 12% year over year to $167.7 billion, while operating income surged 31% to $19.2 billion. Its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), saw revenues grow 17.5% to $30.9 billion, while advertising revenues were up 22% to $15.7 billion. Amazon has also generated a robust $18.2 billion free cash flow in the last four reported quarters.
Management expects revenues to fall in the range of $174 billion to $179.5 billion in the third quarter, including a modest positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
AWS Strength
Amazon is the leader in the global cloud infrastructure market with a 30% share, and AWS will continue to benefit from the transition of more IT work from on-premises infrastructure to cloud-based systems. Currently, an estimated 85% to 90% of IT spending goes to on-premises systems, but that mix is set to shift as the adoption of AI accelerates. AWS is also well positioned to capitalize on the increasing shift of enterprise AI spending from model training to inference workloads -- the real-time deployment of AI models. Eventually, inference is expected to account for nearly 80% to 90% of total AI costs as pilot projects advance into commercial use.
Generative AI inference is also expected to become a standard service, similar to computing, storage, or databases. We can expect that companies will prefer to run these workloads in the same cloud regions as their other applications and enterprise data. Since there are more applications running on AWS than anywhere else, and vast amounts of enterprise data are stored there, it could become the preferred cloud computing platform for inference workloads.
AWS is also pushing down its AI costs. Management claims that its custom Trainium2 chip delivers approximately 30% to 40% better price performance for inference than other chipmakers' GPUs. Anthropic is training its next Claude models on Trainium2, and Amazon Bedrock uses it for inference. The company is also working on the third iteration of the Trainium chip, which is expected to be even more effective for computing and inference workloads. Based on all that, the price-performance edge could become a long-term differentiator for AWS.
AWS clocked an impressive annualized revenue run rate of $123 billion as of the end of the second quarter. The cloud computing business also had an incredible backlog of $195 billion, up 25% year over year, giving it significant visibility into its future revenues. Additionally, management expects demand to keep outpacing available capacity. These conditions are expected to improve in the next several quarters.
Advertising business
Amazon's advertising offerings, spanning its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch, Fire TV, and live sports, help advertisers reach an audience of more than 300 million people in the U.S.
In June, Amazon partnered with Roku to give advertisers using the Amazon demand-side platform access to over 80 million connected TV households in the U.S. Amazon has also integrated its demand-side platform with Disney's real-time ad exchange, thereby giving advertisers direct programmatic access to premium ad inventory on platforms such as Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu. With access to customers' identity, Amazon's shopping signals, and premium streaming inventory, advertisers will be better able to effectively target the audiences they're aiming for. This, in turn, is expected to boost the advertising business in the coming quarters.
Improving retail margins
Amazon is focusing on improving its retail margins, too. It reorganized its U.S. logistics network around a regional structure, placing inventory closer to customers, increasing direct lanes, and enhancing product consolidation. All of this cut miles and human touches out of the process, speeding delivery and lowering costs. Combined with large-scale automation and robotics, including its DeepFleet AI system, the retail business is on a path to higher margins
How will Amazon become a $5 trillion company?
Amazon trades today at a cheap valuation of just 3.7 times sales. To become a $5 trillion company, it would not need to expand its valuation multiples to unsustainable levels.
If AWS continues to grow revenues at a low-to-mid-teens percentage as its capacity increases and inference workloads ramp up, advertising grows at a rate in the high-teens to 20% due to robust connected TV partnerships, and retail margins improve thanks to the benefits of the regional network and automation, Amazon will have a potent revenue mix and enhanced margins. While AWS and the advertising business will boost profitability, the retail segment will help reduce the company's cost to serve customers -- translating into higher profit margins, robust cash flows, and better visibility. That setup is far stronger than Amazon enjoyed when its valuation peaked at around 4.6 times sales earlier in the decade. Back then, its advertising business was smaller, its AI opportunity was limited, and its logistics were far less efficient.
Now, we can expect the company to be trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 5 to 7 by 2030, reflecting the blended effect of higher multiples for its cloud computing and advertising businesses, and lower multiples attributed to the slower growth of its retail business. The company can trade at even higher multiples if it continues its leadership in AI inference.
Analysts expect Amazon's revenues will be nearly $1.15 trillion in 2030. Assuming that P/S multiple expands to even 5, then we can expect Amazon's market capitalization to be almost $5.75 trillion by 2030 -- well above the $5 trillion mark."

Amazon (AMZN, Financials) said Friday that Karthik Ramakrishnan, a vice president involved in developing artificial general intelligence, has stepped down after 13 years at the company.
Ramakrishnan was part of the team that created the Alexa voice assistant and Echo devices. He previously worked at Netscape and Tellme Networks, later acquired by Microsoft (MSFT). It was not immediately clear whether he had another role lined up.
The departure is one of several recent exits among Amazons senior AI leaders, including Vasi Philomin, who oversaw generative AI projects, and Jon Jones, who led AWSs startups and venture capital division.
Amazon has been increasing its investment in artificial intelligence to compete with rivals such as OpenAI and Google. The company has invested about $8 billion in Anthropic, whose Claude model powers some of Amazons Alexa features and an internal chatbot known as Cedric.
At an internal all-hands meeting this week, AWS chief Matt Garman urged employees to accelerate product launches, warning that delays risk undermining Amazons competitive positioning in AI services.
Investors will look for further details on Amazons AI strategy in its upcoming third-quarter earnings report in late October."

Everyone knows Amazon started in a garage. What most people miss is that the garage was part of a rental.
In 1994, Jeff Bezos and then-wife MacKenzie Scott were paying $890 a month for a modest house in Bellevue, Washington. According to The New York Post, they didn't own the place—they leased it. The garage that launched Amazon wasn't attached to a tech compound or a luxury estate. It was borrowed space, at a borrowed address, for a company that would go on to reshape the global economy.
That house has since been gutted and rebuilt. The original garage is gone, and so is the look of the place. But the price—$890—still stands out, especially when you line it up against where Bezos lives today. That same rental home eventually sold for $1.52 million in 2019 and was listed again in 2024 for $2.28 million.
He doesn't rent anymore.
He now owns three properties on Indian Creek Island in Miami, one of the most exclusive residential areas in the country. He paid $68 million for the first, $79 million for the second, and picked up a third for $90 million to expand the lot. The island has fewer than 40 homes and its own police force.
Don’t Miss:
-
If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
-
Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.
That's just Florida. He also owns a massive estate in Beverly Hills. A multi-level penthouse in Manhattan. A waterfront property in Medina, Washington. And a Texas ranch that serves as the launch site for his aerospace company, Blue Origin. The man who once paid $890 in rent now owns property in some of the most expensive zip codes in the country.
Bezos's current net worth is estimated at $231.3 billion, according to Forbes. If he spent $890 every single minute from September 26 through the end of the year—roughly 139,679 minutes—he would burn through about $124.3 million. Subtract that from his total net worth, and he'd still have $231.17 billion left. That rent check, once a monthly burden, wouldn't even register.
For anyone who doesn't have beachfront teardown money, there are still ways to start building wealth through real estate. Arrived —a platform he backs himself— lets investors buy fractional shares of rental homes starting at just $100. You don't need to be a landlord or qualify for a jumbo loan. You invest. You collect income. You start building ownership instead of sending rent into a void."

What to know in after FTC orders $1.5B payment to Prime customers
Amazon has reached a settlement of $2.5 billion with the Federal Trade Commission following allegations that it manipulated customers into signing up for and maintaining Prime subscriptions.
The FTC filed what it called a ""historic"" antitrust lawsuit against the retail giant in June of 2023. The lawsuit alleges that it enrolled millions of consumers in Prime subscriptions without their consent and then made the cancellation of these subscriptions exceedingly difficult.
Customers who signed up for Amazon Prime within the past six years may be eligible for a settlement payment if they tried to cancel their Prime subscription unsuccessfully. Some individuals may receive automatic payments, while others will need to file a claim.
Along with compensating customers who the retail giant negatively impacted, Amazon is introducing changes to Prime in October.
Here's what Tennessee residents should know about the case and whether they are eligible for a settlement payout.
Amazon was aware of 'shady' practices: lawsuit
As the trial began, the FTC announced in a press release that investigators found documents showing that Amazon executives and employees were aware of issues with the Prime enrollment and cancellation process. The documents included statements like “subscription driving is a bit of a shady world” and described leading consumers to unwanted subscriptions as “an unspoken cancer.”
Former Amazon user experience researcher Reid Nelson testified in court on Sept. 24, as reported by NPR. He stated that he had identified Amazon's tactics and interface as ""misleading"" and ""confusing."" Amazon asserted that its practices regarding subscriptions and cancellations surpass industry transparency standards and that it has invested millions to enhance the customer experience, according to NPR.
""The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,"" FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. ""Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans’ pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.""
The FTC is taking similar legal action against other major companies. Brendan Carr, Chair of the Federal Communications Commission, mentioned in an interview with FOX Business Network’s Making Money with Charles Payne, where he called it “a major priority of mine.”
Amazon agrees to pay $1.5 billion to customers
As part of the settlement agreement, Amazon admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to adhere to several changes to its interface.
These include ensuring a clear and conspicuous button for customers to decline Prime — removing misleading options like “No, I don’t want Free Shipping”; providing clear disclosures of Prime’s terms, including costs, charges, and cancellation procedures; creating an easy cancellation method using the same sign-up channel; and paying for an independent third-party to monitor compliance.
Amazon also agreed to pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $1.5 billion in consumer relief to approximately 35 million customers who were impacted. According to court documents, some eligible customers will automatically receive up to $51 in relief, while others will have to submit a claim.
""Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,"" Amazon's Senior Manager of Policy Communications Mark Blafkin said in a statement. ""We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.""
Who is eligible for Amazon Prime settlement?
According to the court order, Amazon customers who signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, are eligible for a settlement payment.
The customers are only eligible for the settlement if they have unsuccessfully tried to cancel their Prime subscription, or if they signed up for Prime through a document called a ""challenged enrollment flow.""
The so-called ""challenged"" flow means any subscription that was signed up for through certain pages on Amazon's website, including the ""Universal Prime Decision Page, the Shipping Option Select Page, Prime Video enrollment flow or the Single Page Checkout,"" per the court order.
Customers who are eligible for cash as part of the settlement — in either wave of payouts — will be paid a maximum of $51 each, the court order said.
How do I claim an Amazon refund?
There will be two phases of payments in the Amazon settlement, according to the court order.
- Filing claims: Under the second wave, customers will have to submit a claim to receive payment. Claimants are eligible for this group if they have used Prime benefits fewer than ten times over any 12 months of enrollment. Within 30 days of completing the automatic payouts, Amazon will send claims forms to eligible customers. After that, eligible customers will have 180 days to submit the form.
- Automatic payments: The first wave of payments will be distributed through an automatic payout over the next 90 days. Only eligible Amazon customers who used their Prime benefits three times or less over any 12 months of enrollment will receive an automatic payment. This group of customers does not need to submit a claim to get paid. It's unclear exactly how these payments will be issued.
What's the status of the click-to-cancel rule?
The Amazon case prompted consumer advocates and regulators to seek simpler methods for canceling subscriptions to streaming services, gym memberships, food deliveries, and other services. A court halted the ""click to cancel"" regulations in July, just days before they were set to be implemented.
The regulation, introduced by former President Joe Biden as part of his campaign against ""junk fees,"" would have mandated businesses to obtain consent for subscriptions, auto-renewals, and free trials that turn into paid memberships. The FTC indicated that canceling services should be ""at least as easy"" as signing up for them.
Almost 75% of companies that sell directly to customers provide some form of subscription, according to an industry and background note co-authored by Harvard Business School marketing professor Elie Ofek. In recent years, complaints about the challenges of canceling subscriptions have risen, with numerous customers being billed monthly long after they no longer wish to use a product or service.
At the same time, industry trade groups representing advertisers, news publishers, retailers, and others contended that a multi-step cancellation process protects consumers or allows them to take advantage of better offers.
Murray from PIRG expressed that the organization wishes for the FTC to revive the click-to-cancel rule ""to safeguard millions of consumers from misleading sales tactics, as well as businesses that operate honestly.""
""They are also adversely affected when consumers feel they cannot trust those they are engaging with,” Murray stated. “In the meantime, we hope this Amazon settlement conveys a strong message to any company operating in ways that could potentially confuse customers or hinder their efforts to cease being customers.”
In a Fox Business interview, Carr mentioned that the FTC is contemplating broadening its click-to-cancel rulemaking, asserting his disagreement with the previous administration’s approach to establishing the rule.
Ferguson, the current chair of the FTC, noted that he opposed Biden's ""click to cancel"" rule because it was proposed during the lame-duck phase.
Changes to Amazon Prime
Amazon announced it would end shared shipping benefits for customers outside of the primary residential address.
Starting Oct. 1, Prime members can only share shipping benefits with people who live at the same address. This change replaces the old Prime Invitee Program, which allowed sharing with anyone, regardless of their location.
Amazon Prime members who want to share benefits with others must ensure they:
- Have linked accounts through Amazon Family
- Share the same primary residential address (the address you consider to be your home and where you spend most of your time)
- Agree to share payment methods for household verification
- Have a Buy Now U.S. billing address for Prime Video sharing
How to cancel your subscription
PIRG recommends these strategies if you are having trouble canceling a subscription:
- Think twice about that free trial subscription.
- Never use a debit card. Always use a credit card.
- Read the terms and conditions carefully, and be aware of pre-checked boxes.
- Keep copies of emails or text messages sent to you when you signed up, and any screenshots of your efforts to cancel, or any notes from a phone call, including the name of whom you spoke with.
- Put reminders in your calendar. If it’s a one-year subscription, schedule a calendar reminder for a couple of weeks before the automatic renewal date, and again a few days ahead of time, and then cancel. Don’t wait until the last minute.
- Remove any credit card information from your account if you can, to ensure you aren’t charged for another billing cycle.
- Complain to the FTC and your state attorney general if you have problems canceling.

In the second quarter of 2025, revenue increased 31.1% year over year to $2.68 billion.
In the second quarter of 2025, Shopify signed deals with iconic brands such as Starbucks, Canada Goose, and Burton Snowboards, showcasing Shopify’s ability to cater to diverse industries. Other notable additions included Michael Kors, Miele, Beachbody, and Signet Jewelers, which reflect Shopify’s rising popularity. In the reported quarter, the Shop App saw 140% year-over-year growth in native GMV, driven by Shop Week, where sales more than doubled compared to last year’s event. Sign-ins through Shop increased 46% due to improved availability and a much smoother user experience.
Shopify’s rich partner ecosystem has been a major growth driver. An expanding partner base, which includes Microsoft, TikTok, Roblox, PayPal, Snap, Pinterest, Criteo, IBM, Cognizant, Alphabet’s cloud computing platform Google Cloud, and Adayen, has expanded its merchant base.
The company is at the forefront of agentic commerce, leveraging AI to transform how consumers discover and shop for products. The company’s investment in AI-driven tools, such as Catalog, Universal Cart, and Sidekick, helped merchants improve customer engagement and streamline operations.
Shopify’s strong partner referral system will continue to boost its merchant base, which will eventually drive top-line growth in 2025 and beyond. For the third quarter of 2025, Shopify expects revenues to grow at a mid-to-high single-digit percentage rate on a year-over-year basis.
SHOP Faces Stiff Competition From MELI and AMZN
Shopify is facing stiff competition in the e-commerce marketplace from companies like MercadoLibre MELI and Amazon AMZN.
MercadoLibre’s rising GMV is acting as a key catalyst. In the second quarter of 2025, MercadoLibre reported GMV of $15.3 billion, which jumped 21% year over year and 37% on a FX-neutral basis.
Amazon’s “Buy with Prime,” which combines its payments and fulfillment services and makes them available at checkout on other websites, and promises faster delivery for Prime members, intensifies competition for Shopify. In the second quarter of 2025, Amazon set a global speed record for Prime deliveries, with 30% more items delivered same day or next day than the previous year.
SHOP’s Share Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates
Shopify shares have risen 34.9% year to date, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 21.2%. The Zacks Internet Services industry has returned 29.6% in the same time frame."

Refunds will roll out in two waves [2]:
Wave One: Automatic payments
-
Covers customers who signed up through a challenged flow and used three or fewer Prime benefits in any 12-month period.
-
These customers don’t need to file claims. Amazon will send refunds automatically within 90 days.
-
The maximum payout is $51.
Wave Two: Claim-by-form payments
-
Covers customers who signed up through a challenged flow or unsuccessfully tried to cancel between 2019 and 2025.
-
To qualify, you must have used 10 or fewer Prime benefits in a 12-month period.
-
Amazon will notify you and send a claim form within 30 days of the first payout wave. Fill it out quickly as Amazon then has 30 days to review your claim.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -An Amazon vice president helping to oversee one of the company's highest profile projects, artificial general intelligence, is stepping down on Friday, the online retailer confirmed after a Reuters inquiry.
Karthik Ramakrishnan, a 13-year veteran of Amazon, is stepping down, according to internal communications reviewed by Reuters. It could not be learned if he had another job lined up and Ramakrishnan did not respond to a request for comment.
Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is technology being developed that researchers believe could one day equal or even outperform human-level intelligence. AGI, if perfected, could help to further automate work done today by humans, potentially upending fields as diverse as warfare, healthcare and stock trading.
Ramakrishnan worked on the first iteration of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant and the associated Echo devices. He began his career at Netscape before moving to Tellme Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.
His departure is among several higher profile ones in recent months, including Vasi Philomin, a vice president guiding generative AI development; and Jon Jones, who led the AWS global startups and venture capital business.
Amazon is working to bolster its reputation for developing AI software and services as rivals like OpenAI and Google have captured market share. It has invested around $8 billion in startup Anthropic and uses its Claude AI model in products like Alexa and an internal chatbot known as Cedric.
On Thursday at an internal all-hands meeting, AWS chief Matt Garman pressed employees to meet timelines for releasing products, saying Amazon can ""lose some of that buzz"" when customers have to wait to try out new services, Reuters reported.

As international demand drives the company's momentum, Anthropic plans to hire for more than 100 new positions across Dublin, London and Zurich.
The company also plans to open its first Asian office in Tokyo, besides additional office locations in Europe.
The global expansion is led by Chris Ciauri, who recently joined as managing director of International following Paul Smith's appointment as chief commercial officer.
""The global demand for Claude is extraordinary—from financial services in London to manufacturing in Tokyo, enterprises are trusting Claude to power their mission-critical operations,"" Ciauri said.

Interview Kickstart announced the expansion of its Machine Learning Course curriculum to address the growing demand for professionals skilled in AI technologies optimized for custom silicon architectures. The program responds to recent industry developments where major technology companies are investing heavily in proprietary AI chips, creating new skill requirements for machine learning engineers. For more information, visit: https://interviewkickstart.com/courses/machine-learning-course
The custom AI chip market has experienced significant growth as companies like Amazon, Apple, and OpenAI develop specialized hardware to reduce dependency on traditional GPU suppliers. Amazon's Annapurna Labs recently expanded production of its Trainium chip, which now powers AWS AI infrastructure for cost-effective computing solutions. OpenAI has partnered with TSMC to develop custom AI processors aimed at enhancing efficiency and reducing reliance on external hardware providers.
These developments have created demand for machine learning professionals who understand both software optimization and hardware-specific implementations. Technology companies report difficulty finding candidates with experience in deploying AI applications on custom silicon architectures that offer improved performance and energy efficiency compared to general-purpose processors.
""The shift toward custom AI chips requires machine learning engineers to understand hardware-software optimization in ways that weren't necessary just two years ago,"" said Rachel Martinez, Director of AI Curriculum at Interview Kickstart. ""Companies need professionals who can design AI solutions that leverage the specific capabilities of proprietary silicon rather than generic implementations.""
The expanded seven-month curriculum begins with foundational Python programming and progresses through classical machine learning, deep learning, and applied generative AI techniques. Students work on practical projects including smart retail analytics systems for customer segmentation and conversational AI tools using LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation frameworks.
The program includes specialized modules addressing deployment challenges specific to custom AI hardware environments. Participants learn to optimize machine learning models for different silicon architectures, addressing the performance considerations that have become critical as companies implement proprietary chip solutions."

“We maintain our 3Q25e EPS of $1.30, below Street’s $1.34,” BofA said. The firm slightly reduced its estimate for domestic average daily volume, now targeting a 10% year-over-year decline, or 16.6 million daily packages, versus its prior forecast of a 9% drop.
BofA cited “Amazon glide-down, de minimis volume impacts, and soft volume backdrop” as drivers of the weakness.
BofA offset some of that pressure with improved pricing expectations. “We target rev/package up 7% year-year, from our prior +6%,” the analysts wrote, while projecting domestic margins of 5.1%, representing a 190-basis-point deterioration from the second quarter.
International results are also expected to soften. BofA forecasts flat year-over-year revenue and an operating margin of 15%, down 300 basis points from a year ago.
The decline was attributed to “trade lane shifts from de minimis volume impacts,” with UPS rerouting more than 100 ad hoc air shipments during the quarter.
On strategy, UPS terminated its planned acquisition of Mexican logistics partner Estafeta after failing to meet closing conditions.
At the same time, it expects to complete its $1.6 billion purchase of Andlauer Healthcare Group in the fourth quarter. With that timing shift, BofA raised its 2026 and 2027 earnings-per-share estimates by 1% each.
Despite the adjustments, the firm lowered its price objective to $81 from $83, citing “sustained cost pressures” and volume declines tied to Amazon and de minimis rules.

For once, forgetting to cancel a subscription could actually pay off. Amazon is shelling out a record $2.5 billion to settle accusations that it tricked users into signing up for Prime and then buried the exits. Roughly $1.5 billion of that money will go to customers, and while the checks won’t make anyone rich — the maximum is $51 per person — they mark the rare case where a subscription dark pattern might come back to haunt the company, not the customer.
Suggested Reading
The refund pool covers Prime memberships between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025. Who gets what depends on how you got in — and how much you actually used it. If you were funneled into Prime through one of Amazon’s “challenged enrollment flows” (a checkout page prompt, a Prime Video pop-up, or a one-click shipping nudge) and you barely touched the perks, you’re in line for an automatic payout. Amazon has to process those refunds within 90 days of the settlement’s approval.

For everyone else — the so-called heavier users or the people who got tangled up trying to cancel — there’s a claims process. That group still qualifies if they used Prime sparingly, but they’ll need to file paperwork once Amazon opens the portal. The company is required to send notices within 30 days after the automatic payments are finished, and consumers will have six months to respond.
The settlement doesn’t just cut checks: Amazon also has to simplify its cancellation system, add obvious “decline” buttons, and stop burying terms under layers of friction. So the FTC isn’t just paying you back — it’s rewriting how Prime gets pitched in the first place.
Who’s in line for a Prime refund?
Some people will be paid without having to file a single thing. To land in this bucket, two things generally need to be true:
- You enrolled through a “challenged enrollment flow” (e.g., a checkout prompt, Prime Video sign-up, one-page checkout); and
- You used three or fewer Prime benefits (think: Prime shipping perks, Prime Video, Prime Music, etc.) in any 12-month period during the window. If that’s you, Amazon issues the refund automatically after the fund is set up. Using more benefits makes automatic eligibility less likely because regulators view that as meaningful use.
If you (a) signed up through a “challenged” flow but used more than three benefits, or (b) tried to cancel but got stuck or accepted a “save” offer? You may still be eligible for a refund — but you’ll need to file a claim when the portal opens. Expect to receive some sort of notice after the automatic payouts begin; you’ll get 180 days to submit your claim once you receive the form. Details will come via Amazon or the settlement administrator.
Refunds are capped at $51 or the actual membership fees you paid, whichever is lower. Automatic payments are due within 90 days of the settlement’s approval, while claim-based payouts will come after Amazon processes submissions.
“Challenged enrollment flow,” decoded
The FTC singled out four of Amazon’s trickiest sign-up funnels — the Universal Prime Decision Page, the Shipping Option Select Page, the Prime Video enrollment flow, and the Single Page Checkout — along with their many variations over the five-year window. That means: If Prime was added during shopping/checkout or while starting Prime Video (versus you intentionally navigating to Prime’s sign-up page), you likely passed through a challenged flow.
How to check your account:
- Look up your Prime start date and the bill that first charged you; if it aligns with a purchase date, that supports a checkout-based add.
- Search your email for “Your Prime membership is now active” around that time; messages tied to an order or streaming prompt are a clue.
- Try to recall starting cancellation, pausing, or accepting a “stay” offer. If you ever clicked “cancel” only to hit a wall of prompts, save the receipts — those attempts can support a claim.
What to do now
- Check your dates: If your Prime membership began or renewed between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, you’re in the refund window. Anything outside that range? No refund.
- Know your lane:
- Light user + tricky signup → automatic payout. If Prime slipped in through a checkout nudge or a streaming pop-up and you barely touched the perks, Amazon owes you without paperwork.
- Heavier use or cancellation drama → file a claim. If you leaned on Prime more often or hit roadblocks trying to cancel, you’ll need to go through the claims portal once it opens.
- Gather your proof: Hang onto billing statements, account screenshots, and any cancellation attempts or “stay” offers. The more receipts you have, the smoother your claim will be.
- Stay alert: Keep an eye on the email tied to your Amazon account, and check the FTC’s settlement page. That’s where the claims portal and deadlines will drop.
Why this matters
The other half of the settlement isn’t about refunds at all — it’s about fixing the system that got Amazon in trouble. Going forward, the company has agreed to add clearer “decline Prime” buttons, to put renewal terms upfront, and to make cancellation as simple as signing up. An independent monitor will be watching.
For regulators, this is a marquee win against so-called “dark patterns,” the design tricks that companies use to keep subscriptions sticky. For Amazon, the settlement is an extra-public reminder that the convenience pitch of Prime — free shipping, one-click checkouts, streaming extras — comes with strings attached. And for millions of Amazon subscribers, this is just one more reason to check your inbox."

Let's now take a look at one standout stock that could be a perfect fit for your portfolio.
Why You Should Pay Attention to Walmart (WMT)
Walmart Inc. has evolved from just being a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer into an omnichannel player. In this regard, acquisitions; partnerships; delivery programs like Walmart + and Express Delivery; and investment in online e-commerce platform Flipkart are noteworthy. These position the company to keep pace with the changing retail ecosystem and stay firm in the presence of rivals like Amazon and Target. Markedly, Walmart’s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.
Since being added to the Zacks Focus List on May 30, 2017 at $26.04 per share, shares of WMT have increased 295.74% to $103.05.
For fiscal 2026, three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $2.6. WMT boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.8%.
Earnings for Walmart's are forecasted to see growth of 3.6% for the current fiscal year as well.
Because stock prices react to revisions, buying stocks with rising earnings estimates can be very profitable. Focus List stocks like WMT offer investors a great opportunity to get into a company whose future earnings estimates will be raised, potentially leading to price momentum.

But first it has to avoid the pitfalls that claimed its predecessor, Moxion.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4899ff74f0312213fd0ed9d8af9d0c5f51f6be2fcfb4367ae69f82bc6ff6d416,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/battery-startup-moxion-went-bankrupt-130000810.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/battery-startup-moxion-went-bankrupt-130000810.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/battery-startup-moxion-went-bankrupt-130000810.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Just over a year ago, Moxion Power closed its doors, adding its name to a list of high-profile bankruptcies that roiled the climate tech world in 2024. The portable battery startup had raised more than $110 million in a bid to replace diesel generators at festivals and construction sites, but even that wasn’t enough to get it through the valley of death. Moxion laid off more than 400 employees and its assets were liquidated.
Now, the startup’s co-founder, Paul Huelskamp, and several former Moxion employees are back with another startup, Anode Technology Company, hoping to accomplish the same goal — ideally without repeating the same mistakes.
“We started Anode with that goal to kind of finish what we started,” Huelskamp, now Anode’s CEO, told TechCrunch.
Anode has been operating quietly, but it is now emerging with $9 million in seed funding. The round was led by Eclipse, and its partner Jiten Behl, who spearheaded the deal, was previously Rivian’s chief growth officer.
Behl’s interest in the space was sparked by his experience at Rivian, which once had an agreement to sell 100,000 electric delivery vans to Amazon. But the companies soon realized that the problem wasn’t the cost of the vans, but the charging infrastructure.
“You need a mini power plant to charge 150 vans, and that infrastructure does not exist at depots,” Behl said.
In a pinch, many fleets will turn to diesel generators. Waymo, for example, was found to be using them at its depot in San Francisco. “What businesses are actually looking for is some grid-independent solutions that can provide them flexibility,” Behl added.
Other companies, like SparkCharge and Power Sonic, provide EV charging using mobile batteries, but Huelskamp claims Anode’s integrated hardware should set it apart. The company has designed an inverter that’ll work for the markets it is targeting, including EV charging, construction sites, and live events.
Anode’s mobile battery is also slightly smaller than Moxion’s 600 kilowatt-hour unit, he said, which makes it easier to load onto flatbed trucks.
“We are optimizing for the lowest cost of delivered energy. The things that drive cost are, how much energy can you put on the back of a truck? How many trucks do you need? How many drivers do you need? How many trips do you have to take?” Huelskamp said. “A smaller footprint, less energy, might mean more energy on the back of a single flatbed truck. It’s a little counterintuitive.”
“There’s a lot of those types of requirements that, frankly, we just didn’t appreciate at Moxion.”
The new startup will use contract manufacturers to make its batteries, a key difference from Moxion, which tried to do it all in-house. “One of the main lessons learned is it’s really tough as a startup to take on that part of [the manufacturing],” Huelskamp said."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-26T11:45:00,MercadoLibre Is the Amazon of Latin America ... or Is It?,"MercadoLibre may look like the ""Amazon of Latin America,"" but the real story runs deeper. With fintech fueling its ecosystem, it's positioning itself as the digital backbone of an entire region.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=117e6f833b4f9d160f53ae77a8411239babd27e1f877baf256b2e51a3278461c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/mercadolibre-is-the-amazon-of-latin-america-or-is/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/mercadolibre-is-the-amazon-of-latin-america-or-is/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/mercadolibre-is-the-amazon-of-latin-america-or-is/,fool.com,200,,"When investors talk about MercadoLibre (MELI -2.75%), the phrase that comes up almost automatically is ""the Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) of Latin America."" The comparison isn't wrong. MercadoLibre runs the region's leading online marketplace, has built its own logistics backbone, and is increasingly monetizing sellers with advertising.
But stopping there misses the bigger picture. MercadoLibre isn't just Amazon transplanted south. It's a hybrid of e-commerce and fintech that Amazon itself has never truly built. And that difference could be what makes it one of the most important growth companies in Latin America.
Where the Amazon comparison holds up
At its core, MercadoLibre is first and foremost an e-commerce company. Its marketplace connects millions of buyers and sellers across 18 countries, with Brazil contributing 55% of total commerce revenue, Mexico and Argentina contributing 39%, and the remaining revenue coming from other countries. Unlike traditional retailers, MercadoLibre doesn't hold most of its own inventory. Instead, it provides the digital storefronts, payments, and logistics that make commerce possible in a region where brick-and-mortar retail options can be fragmented.
That business has scaled up impressively. In the second quarter of 2025, MercadoLibre attracted 71 million unique buyers, and more than 550 million items were transacted on its platform -- up 31% from a year earlier. Revenue from the commerce segment rose 45% year over year, fueled by higher transaction volumes and expanding logistics adoption.
The logistics arm, Mercado Envios, is a critical part of the strategy. By taking on shipping itself, MercadoLibre can ensure faster, more reliable deliveries in markets where infrastructure often lags. In 2024, Envios handled 1.8 billion items, with nearly half of shipments in its largest markets arriving within 48 hours. That capability doesn't just make customers happy -- it gives sellers fewer reasons to defect to competitors like Amazon, which has struggled to gain share in the region.
And just like Amazon, MercadoLibre is building a digital advertising business (Mercado Ads) on top of its marketplace. Sellers pay for promoted listings and visibility tools, giving MercadoLibre a high-margin revenue stream that expands alongside its core commerce platform.
On those fronts -- scale, logistics, and advertising -- the Amazon comparison makes perfect sense. But it's only half the story.
Key differences in the business model between Amazon and MercadoLibre
At first glance, MercadoLibre looks a lot like Amazon. Both operate dominant online marketplaces, both run their own logistics networks, and both use advertising to boost profitability. But when you look deeper, the differences are just as significant as the similarities.
1. Fintech as a growth engine
Amazon relies on established banking systems in North America and Europe/
MercadoLibre didn't have that luxury. To make e-commerce work in Latin America -- where large parts of the population are unbanked -- it had to build its own financial rails. That gave rise to Mercado Pago, a payments platform that has evolved into a digital wallet, lender, and asset manager. By the end of 2024, it counted 61 million monthly active users, with a loan portfolio of $6.6 billion and customer assets of $10.6 billion.
Arguably, this integration makes MercadoLibre's digital ecosystem stickier than Amazon's. Payments fuel commerce, commerce fuels credit, and credit drives loyalty. Amazon doesn't have an equivalent.
2. Amazon Web Services and entertainment
On the flip side, Amazon has businesses that MercadoLibre doesn't. The most important is its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which generates high-margin revenue and funds much of Amazon's growth ambitions. MercadoLibre has no cloud arm, which means its margins depend entirely on the balance between commerce, logistics, and fintech.
Amazon also has an entertainment ecosystem through Prime Video, which helps attract and retain Prime subscribers. MercadoLibre has chosen not to expand into media, focusing instead on becoming the backbone of commerce and financial services in Latin America.
These contrasts highlight why calling MercadoLibre the ""Amazon of Latin America"" is both accurate and incomplete. Each company has built around the needs of its home markets -- and MercadoLibre's fintech-first model may prove just as relevant in its own context as AWS and Prime have been for Amazon.
What does this mean for investors?
So, is MercadoLibre really the Amazon of Latin America? The easy answer is both yes and no. It resembles Amazon in its marketplace, logistics, and advertising business. It also puts customer delight at its core.
But tactically, it's approaching the game in a different way, which reflects the market dynamics that it's operating in. By marrying e-commerce with fintech, it's positioning itself as the digital backbone of Latin America's economy, not just a marketplace operator.
This ecosystem approach gives MercadoLibre a huge runway -- probably even larger than Amazon's, considering the latter's already massive size. Investors looking for an overseas growth stock should keep a close eye on this Latin American tech company."

Millions of consumers may now qualify for refunds of up to $51.
Who can claim compensation
The settlement applies to US customers who either signed up for Amazon Prime between 23 June 2019 and 23 June 2025 through certain sign-up flows or who tried but failed to cancel their subscription during that period.

The FTC identified “challenged enrollment flows” that included the universal Prime decision page, shipping option selection, Prime Video enrolment, and single-page checkout.
Consumers who attempted to cancel but instead ended up keeping Prime—sometimes after accepting “save offers”—are also covered.
Amazon will use its internal records to identify eligible subscribers and failed cancellation attempts.
How the amazon prime settlement works

Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalData- Automatic refunds: Customers who used three or fewer Prime benefits in a 12-month period after signing up will receive refunds of all membership fees paid, up to $51. These refunds will be automatic and require no action from consumers. Payments are expected about 90 days after the court grants final approval.
- Claims process: Customers who used up to 10 Prime benefits in a 12-month period and either enrolled through a challenged flow or failed to cancel must submit a claim form. If validated, they may receive refunds up to $51.
Amazon will send claim forms by email, post, or through a dedicated settlement website. Forms must be submitted within 180 days of receipt. If more than $1.5bn is claimed, payouts will be reduced proportionally.
Breakdown of the $2.5bn settlement
The settlement fund includes a $1bn civil penalty, the largest ever imposed for an FTC rule violation, and $1.5bn allocated for consumer redress.
The FTC estimates around 35 million consumers were affected, making this the second-largest restitution award in the agency’s history.
Amazon will cover all administrative costs linked to the claims process. Key dates include automatic payouts within 90 days of settlement approval, followed by claim form distribution within 30 days, and a six-month deadline for claims submission.
The FTC accused Amazon of violating federal consumer protection laws by designing confusing interfaces and complex cancellation steps.
While the company has not admitted wrongdoing, it agreed to the settlement to resolve the case."

But in the hedge fund world, he's practically royalty.
Coleman is one of the ""tiger cubs"" who worked for Julian Robertson's Tiger Fund -- the first hedge fund ever -- and then went on to start his own. Today, Coleman's Tiger Global Management fund manages more than $34 billion in securities.
Last month, Coleman's fund released the list of its latest buys, and it more than doubled its stake in e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN -0.49%), purchasing more than 4 million shares, making it the fund's fourth-largest holding.
Here's why Amazon looks like a worthwhile investment for non-billionaires as well.
A much more reasonable price
Three years ago, when the U.S. was just emerging from pandemic lockdowns, shares of Amazon were undeniably expensive.
The company was trading for 110x trailing earnings -- a higher multiple than even perpetually richly valued Tesla's -- as the economy opened up again. Amazon had significantly expanded its warehouse, delivery, and fulfillment network during the lockdown era, and suddenly found itself with excess capacity and a need to downsize (oh, and the company's $12.7 billion paper losses from its investment in electric truckmaker Rivian didn't help either).
However, Amazon didn't stay that expensive for long. The company's financial woes cut the share price nearly in half during 2022. Since then, Amazon has grown its net income by more than 500% to $70.6 billion, while the share price has nearly doubled. The company's price-to-earnings ratio now sits at a much more reasonable 34x.
But even at this ""more reasonable"" valuation, is the company a buy?
Double-digit growth
For a company that sports a $2.4 trillion valuation, Amazon is growing at a surprisingly fast clip.
In its most recent quarter, the company's net sales grew by 13% year over year, including 11% growth in North American and international e-commerce (once the effects of foreign exchange rates were stripped out) and 17.5% growth in revenue from the company's cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, overall operating income was up 30.6% year over year to $19.2 billion.
You really can't overstate how important AWS is to Amazon. Although it only generates 18.4% of the company's overall revenue, it's responsible for more than half of the company's profits, and it's the fastest-growing segment of the company to boot. That said, considering that e-commerce only accounts for about 15.5% of all U.S. retail sales, there's plenty of room for growth in that business as well.
Keep it coming
The AWS growth isn't showing any sign of letting up.
Each quarter, Amazon continues to announce a host of new AWS agreements with major corporate partners. In Q1 2025, for example, it signed agreements with Adobe and Uber, while during the second quarter, new partners included PepsiCo and Airbnb.
The company also rolls out new AWS tools every quarter, but in Q2, there was a surprising number of new deployments, including Kiro, a new ""agentic integrated development environment,"" and Strands Agents, ""an open-source tool that enables developers to more easily build new agents, offering support for popular open-source frameworks like A2A and MCP.""
Amazon seems likely to continue to use its size and scale to continue to innovate, optimize, and find new efficiencies and revenue streams. No wonder that Chase Coleman is picking up shares hand over fist. With the share price down slightly, it looks like a great time for billionaires and non-billionaires alike to add an Amazon stake to their portfolio."

Amazon has reached a historic $2.5 billion (€1.4bn) settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which said the online retail giant tricked customers into signing up for its Prime memberships and made it difficult for them to cancel after doing so.
The Seattle company will pay $1bn (€860mn) in civil penalties — the largest such fine in the agency’s history for a rule violation — and $1.5bn (€1.3bn) will be paid back to consumers who were unintentionally enrolled in Prime, or were deterred from cancelling their subscriptions, the agency said on Thursday.
The surprise settlement comes just days after the trial began in US District Court in Seattle this week. At the heart of the case is the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act, a 2010 law designed to ensure that people know what they’re being charged for online.
FTC officials said Amazon had its back against the wall and the consumer refund amount exceeded even the agency’s expert projections.
“I think it just took a few days for them to see that they were going to lose. And they came to us and they paid out,” said Chris Mufarrige, director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, on the settlement negotiations.
Amazon, however, said it was confident it would win the case but that it chose to resolve it quickly instead of going through potentially years of trial and appeals. The company admitted no wrongdoing in the case, which was first filed two years ago.
“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,"" said spokesman Mark Blafkin in a statement. ""We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.”
Certain Prime customers who are eligible for automatic refunds of up to $51 (€44) include those who may have signed up for a membership via the company’s “Single Page Checkout”, among other links, between 23 June 2019 and 23 June 2025. Those customers will be reimbursed within 90 days of the settlement order.
Amazon is also on the hook to set up a claims process for more than 30 million customers who may have been affected by the other issues at the heart of the FTC case, including its cancellation process.
Complications when ending subscriptions
Amazon Prime provides subscribers with perks that include faster shipping, video streaming and discounts at Whole Foods for a fee of $139 (€119) annually, or $14.99 a month (€12.80).
It’s a key and growing part of Amazon’s business, with more than 200 million members. In its latest financial report, the company reported in July that it booked more than $12bn (€10.3bn) in net revenue for subscription services, a 12% increase from the same period last year. That figure includes annual and monthly fees associated with Prime memberships, as well as other subscription services such as its music and e-books platforms.
The FTC said Amazon deliberately made it difficult for customers to purchase an item without also subscribing to Prime. In some cases, consumers were presented with a button to complete their transactions — which did not clearly state it would also enrol them in Prime, the agency said.
Getting out of a subscription was often too complicated, and Amazon leadership slowed or rejected changes that would have made cancelling easier, according to an FTC complaint.
Internally, Amazon called the process “Iliad”, a reference to the ancient Greek poem about the lengthy siege of Troy during the Trojan war. The process requires the customer to affirm on three pages their desire to cancel membership.
Automatic renewals for memberships
The FTC began looking into Amazon’s Prime subscription practices in 2021 during the first Trump administration, but the lawsuit was filed in 2023 under former FTC Chair Lina Khan, an antitrust expert who had been appointed by Biden.
The agency filed the case months before it submitted an antitrust lawsuit against the retail and technology company, accusing it of having monopolistic control over online markets.
In 2019, Facebook, now known as Meta, was fined $5bn (€4.3bn) for violating a FTC order against the company on user privacy. The fine Amazon now faces is the largest such penalty for violating an FTC rule that applies to all companies.
As part of the settlement terms, Amazon is prohibited from misrepresenting the terms of the subscriptions. It must fully disclose the costs to be incurred and obtain the customer’s express consent for the charge. For example, it must have a clear option for customers to accept or decline a Prime subscription being offered during a purchase, avoiding potentially confusing language such as: “No thanks, I don’t want free shipping.”
Automatic renewals for memberships must be clearly marked and the company is also required to use a cancellation process, which “must not be difficult, costly, confusing or time consuming”, according to the settlement.
Amazon said the settlement doesn't require it to make any additional changes — only to maintain its current sign-up and cancellation process that it had put in place in recent years."

But the company forcing MercadoLibre to cut shipping costs and rethink its strategy is Shopee.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5cf1d37bffa4c2df841fd468c14f56955ac9eb259cf309730a1e5f30a5b003a5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/mercadolibres-most-formidable-competitor-is-not-am/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/mercadolibres-most-formidable-competitor-is-not-am/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/mercadolibres-most-formidable-competitor-is-not-am/,fool.com,200,,"When investors think about MercadoLibre (MELI -2.75%), the first comparison that usually comes up is Amazon. It makes sense. Both companies dominate online marketplaces, run their own logistics networks, and increasingly rely on advertising as a growth engine. MercadoLibre is often called the Amazon of Latin America.
But if you're trying to understand MercadoLibre's biggest threat, Amazon isn't the company you should be watching. The real competitor is Sea Limited's (SE -7.54%) Shopee.
Why Shopee matters more than Amazon
Amazon is an e-commerce powerhouse, but it has struggled to gain real traction in Latin America. The challenges are structural: fragmented infrastructure, high logistics costs, and a consumer base that often lacks access to traditional banking. Amazon has invested heavily in this region, but it hasn't cracked the formula.
Shopee, on the other hand, has made rapid inroads. The Singapore-based company entered Brazil with a familiar playbook that it has employed in Southeast Asia: low prices, gamified shopping, and seller-friendly policies. The approach has clicked with cost-conscious Latin American consumers.
And the result has been remarkable. In just five years, Shopee has become the market leader by order volume, and yet continues to grow rapidly and profitably. According to SimilarWeb, Shopee's app ranks first in Brazil in terms of usage, followed by MercadoLibre in second place.
The Brazilian e-commerce business isn't just a side business for Shopee anymore -- it has become a serious competitor on MercadoLibre's home turf.
Both companies are competing on the same two fronts
What makes Shopee more formidable than Amazon is that it competes with MercadoLibre on both of its critical pillars: commerce and fintech.
1. Commerce
Shopee has been willing to sacrifice margins to win customers. It offers low seller commissions, frequent promotions, and aggressive shipping subsidies -- Shopee also operates its own logistics network. That has forced MercadoLibre to react, expanding its free shipping threshold in Brazil to purchases above 19 reais (about $3.40), down from 79 reais before, and cutting seller shipping costs by up to 40%.
In other words, MercadoLibre isn't ignoring Shopee. It's already changing its business model to defend its share.
2. Fintech
Sea's financial arm, SeaMoney, has also been growing rapidly in Southeast Asia. In the second quarter 2025, its revenue jumped nearly 70% year over year to $883 million. The business covers digital wallets, credit, and other financial services.
In Latin America, Sea's fintech presence is still small compared to Mercado Pago, which had 68 million monthly active users and a $9.3 billion loan portfolio in Q2 2025. But Shopee has proven it can build a commerce-payments flywheel in other regions. If it manages to replicate that in Latin America, the competitive threat becomes far more serious.
What about Temu and Nubank?
It's not just Shopee chasing MercadoLibre.
Temu, owned by PDD Holdings, has been flooding Latin America with ultra-cheap goods, relying on cross-border shipping from China. It has quickly gained users, but without local logistics or payments infrastructure, it's more of a disruptor in the bargain segment than a full rival -- at least for now.
On the fintech side, Nubank is a real threat to Mercado Pago. It has built a vast user base in Brazil, expanding into deposits, lending, and investments. But they lack the integrated e-commerce engine that ties MercadoLibre's ecosystem together.
That's why Shopee stands apart. It's the rare competitor attacking both sides of MercadoLibre's moat at once.
What it means for investors
MercadoLibre remains the dominant force in Latin American e-commerce and fintech, with a scale advantage, trusted brand, and integrated logistics network. But the competitive landscape is shifting.
Amazon may be the easy comparison, but Shopee is the competitor investors should really watch. It's growing market share in Brazil, forcing MercadoLibre to adjust pricing and shipping policies, and rapidly scaling its fintech arm.
For long-term investors, that means two things:
- Latin America still offers tremendous opportunities, and MercadoLibre's years of operating experience remain a key advantage.
- MercadoLibre now faces a far more serious competitive threat from Shopee, one that could pressure margins and alter its growth trajectory.
All told, keeping an eye on Shopee's momentum could be just as important as tracking MercadoLibre's own results in the quarters ahead."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-26T08:05:00,This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giant Could Increase Its $10 Billion Business 14-Fold in 5 Years,But it doesn't come without some significant risks for investors.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e49e4bfde21dff9133ab40a12487b95a3ac0ae305ee889dae635dd4027961b76,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/artificial-intelligence-ai-giant-increase-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/artificial-intelligence-ai-giant-increase-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/artificial-intelligence-ai-giant-increase-stock/,fool.com,200,,"Global spending on artificial intelligence (AI) is set to reach $1.5 trillion this year, according to estimates from Gartner. Even with the huge amount businesses and tech companies are already spending, that number is forecast to climb even further well into the future. The analysts at Gartner expect total spending to hit $2 trillion in 2026. Many analysts see total spending climbing through the end of the decade in order to take advantage of the massive opportunity and promises of generative AI.
One company managed to build a massive $10 billion business out of demand for artificial intelligence compute in just a few years, and it expects to capture a significant amount of market share over the next few years. In fact, management said it expects that $10 billion in annual sales to grow to $144 billion in sales within five years. And it has the contracts to back it up.
The massive opportunity ahead
A handful of companies are rapidly building out data centers and leasing space and equipment in order to meet the demand of tech companies training and using large language models. Some contracts from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, two leading LLM developers, are worth tens of billions of dollars per year. And the biggest cloud computing platforms -- owned by Amazon (AMZN -0.49%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.10%), and Alphabet (GOOG 2.02%) (GOOGL 2.04%) -- are unable to keep up with the growing demand.
As AI companies look to diversify their compute providers, Oracle (ORCL 1.59%) has emerged as a strong alternative with excellent networking capabilities and competitive pricing. However, its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is lacking in scale relative to the three market leaders. That didn't stop OpenAI from committing $300 billion to Oracle's cloud business over five years starting in 2027.
As a result, Oracle reported a huge increase in its backlog of remaining performance obligations. The amount stood at $455 billion as of the end of the company's first quarter, up from $137 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. While $300 billion of that is tied to OpenAI, Oracle added another $18 billion in contracts on top of that.
And management expects to sign additional contracts in the near future. It said OCI's remaining performance obligations will likely exceed $500 billion by the end of the current quarter.
If management succeeds in growing OCI from $10 billion to $144 billion over the next five years, it'll end the decade with a cloud business similar in size to Alphabet's, based on current growth rates. If it can manage to earn similar operating margins as the three big providers today (20% to 37%), it could produce a huge boost to its existing earnings.
While management notes it already has the backlog to support its revenue outlook, it's important to consider the significant risks that come with investing in Oracle stock right now.
The future is not guaranteed
Oracle burned $5.9 billion in cash over the past 12 months as it expanded OCI capacity. It took on $27 billion worth of debt over the past year, and it now holds $111 billion of debt on its balance sheet. It'll have to take on more debt and burn more cash to build out the capacity needed to meet demand for its cloud computing business.
To put things in perspective, Microsoft is committing to $30 billion in capital expenditures for the current quarter, and it'll likely maintain that pace throughout the year. Amazon expects to spend over $100 billion in 2025, mostly on additional compute capacity. Alphabet updated its target spend to $85 billion for the year, as demand for its cloud infrastructure continues to outstrip supply.
They all have significant backlogs, but none is as big as Oracle's is now. Oracle plans to spend $35 billion this year, with OCI revenue of $18 billion.
Meanwhile, its three biggest competitors are producing strong positive free cash flow thanks to the fact that they already have large, established cloud businesses and massive businesses outside of cloud computing. Oracle's legacy software business doesn't generate nearly enough cash to keep up with the demand for AI compute.
But it's not just the financing risk Oracle faces. It also takes on the risk of a long-term contract with OpenAI. The generative AI leader has committed to spending $30 billion on Oracle's compute starting in 2027 and ramping up from there. But the company itself is only bringing in $13 billion in revenue this year, according to its CFO's outlook. It's also committed to spending $10 billion with Broadcom, not to mention its existing cloud computing deals with Microsoft and Alphabet.
It's also unclear how profitable the OpenAI deal will be if it comes to full fruition. Oracle must have offered very attractive pricing relative to its larger competitors to attract such a big commitment. That could result in a significantly worse margin profile relative to Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet.
Nonetheless, shares of Oracle have now skyrocketed in price, reaching a forward PE ratio of 45 based on estimates for fiscal 2026. That's far higher than its larger cloud competitors, making the stock a much riskier investment. If Oracle can execute, build the capacity it needs, and OpenAI holds up its end of the deal, it could be a huge winner over the next five years. But the other three cloud computing providers' stocks look like much better values with much less risk right now."

Their collective market value is currently $4.7 trillion. I think Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) can surpass that figure by 2030. Here's what my prediction means for shareholders:
Amazon is currently worth $2.3 trillion. Its market value must increase 109% to reach $4.8 trillion, and reaching that figure by 2030 implies shareholders would see annual returns of roughly 16% over the next five years. Here's why that seems like a distinct possibility.
Amazon is a major player in three growing industries
Amazon reported encouraging financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 13% to $167 billion, operating margin expanded 150 basis points, and GAAP net income increased 33% to $1.68 per diluted share. Amazon is well positioned to maintain that momentum due to its strong presence in three growing industries.
- Amazon runs the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe in terms of gross merchandise volume. Retail e-commerce sales are projected to increase at nearly 12% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.
- Amazon is the third largest ad tech company and the largest retail advertiser in the world as measured by revenue. It is also the fourth-fastest growing ad tech company worldwide. Digital ad spending is forecast to increase at 15% annually through 2030.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) operates the largest public cloud platform as measured by infrastructure and platform services spending. Cloud computing sales are projected to increase at 20% annually through 2030 driven by demand for data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
Importantly, if Amazon merely matches the growth rates in those three markets, total revenue could increase at annualized pace of 13% to 14% through the end of the decade. But earnings could grow even faster. The company is using artificial intelligence to make its business more profitable, particularly across its retail operations.
Amazon is innovating with artificial intelligence and robotics
Amazon has designed over 1,000 generative AI applications to improve efficiency across its retail operations. That includes tools to optimize inventory allocation, demand forecasting, and last-mile delivery. The company recently introduced an AI model to help its robot fleet navigate warehouses more quickly, and another model in development will let warehouse workers engage fulfillment robots in natural language.
Additionally, The Information reports Amazon is developing humanoid robots to assist its drivers with package delivery. Initially, robots could carry packages from delivery vans to doorsteps while human drivers wait in the vehicle. But the entire process could eventually be automated because Amazon is also testing robotaxis with its autonomous driving subsidiary Zoox.
Elsewhere, Amazon developers are using an AI coding assistant (Amazon Q Developer) to automate tedious and repetitive tasks. CEO Andy Jassy told analysts last year, ""With Q's code transformation capabilities, Amazon has migrated over 30,000 Java JDK applications in a few months, saving the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years compared to what it would have otherwise cost.""
Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley says Amazon is ""one of the companies best positioned to deliver material financial return from physical AI and robotics"" over the next three to five years. He estimates costs related to shipping and fulfillment currently consume about 36% of retail sales, so the company should become much more profitable at those workflows are automated.
Why Amazon could be a $4.8 trillion company by 2030
Amazon shares currently trade at 34 times earnings, a reasonable valuation for a company whose earnings are forecast to increase at 18% annually over the next three to five years. If Amazon meets that consensus estimate, its market value can increase 109% to $4.8 trillion by late 2030, while its valuation falls to 31 times earnings.
In the scenario I described, Amazon in five years would be worth more than the combined market values of Nvidia and Palantir today."

Researchers at cybersecurity firm UpGuard discovered in late August a publicly accessible Amazon-hosted storage server containing 273,000 PDF documents relating to bank transfers of Indian customers.
The exposed files contained completed transaction forms intended for processing via the National Automated Clearing House, or NACH, a centralized system used by banks in India to facilitate high-volume recurring transactions, such as salaries, loan repayments, and utility payments.
The data was linked to at least 38 different banks and financial institutions, the researchers told TechCrunch.
The spilling data was eventually plugged, but the researchers said they could not identify the source of the leak.
Following the publication of this article, Indian fintech company Nupay reached out to TechCrunch by email to confirm that it “addressed a configuration gap in an Amazon S3 storage bucket” that contained the bank transfer forms.
It’s not clear why the data was left publicly exposed and accessible to the internet, though security lapses of this nature are not uncommon due to human error.
Data secured, Nupay blames ‘configuration gap’
In its blog post detailing its findings, the UpGuard researchers said that out of a sample of 55,000 documents that they looked at, more than half of the files mentioned the name of Indian lender Aye Finance, which had filed for a $171 million IPO last year. The Indian state-owned State Bank of India was the next institution to appear by frequency in the sample documents, according to the researchers.
After discovering the exposed data, UpGuard’s researchers notified Aye Finance through its corporate, customer care, and grievance redressal email addresses. The researchers also alerted the National Payments Corporation of India, or NPCI, the government body responsible for managing NACH.
By early September, the researchers said the data was still exposed and that thousands of files were being added to the exposed server daily.
UpGuard said it then alerted India’s computer emergency response team, CERT-In. The exposed data was secured shortly after, the researchers told TechCrunch.
Despite this, it remained unclear who was responsible for the security lapse. Spokespeople for Aye Finance and NCPI denied that they were the source of the data spill, and a spokesperson for the State Bank of India acknowledged our outreach but did not provide comment."

- Amazon in a settlement with the FTC agreed to pay a $1 billion penalty and even more in refunds to settle government claims alleging deceptive practices related to enrollment in and cancellation of the Prime subscription service.
- Customers meeting certain requirements will get more than $50 as part of the settlement.
Tech and retail giant Amazon agreed to pay billions of dollars in refunds and penalties to settle allegations of ""deceptive"" practices involving the Prime subscription service, the government said Thursday.
The company, among the world's most valuable, agreed to pay a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds to customers, the FTC said. The government called the penalty the largest-ever civil penalty associated with an FTC violation; it resolves an action that began more than two years ago. Amazon did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
Amazon (AMZN) ""used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,"" Federal Trade Commissioner Chair Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. Customers meeting certain requirements will get a $51 payment, according to court documents.
Why This Matters to Your Money
A $2.5 billion settlement looks comparatively small compared with Amazon's market cap above $2 trillion. A $51 refund may not seem like much ahead of what could be sizable holiday shopping bills. The biggest takeaway for consumers may be a reminder to read the fine print when shopping online—or anywhere else—as merchants look to make it easier to spend.
The FTC in its statement said Amazon created ""confusing and deceptive"" interfaces that led consumers to enroll in Prime without knowing it and made it ""complex and difficult"" to quit the service. The company, the government said, agreed to make a button for declining Prime ""clear and conspicuous"" and to make it easy to cancel.
""We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""We will continue to do so.""
Amazon's Prime service, which includes shipping benefits along with streaming music and video offerings, costs about $15 a month or $140 a year. It is estimated to have some 200 million members worldwide."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-25T22:00:03,Why Amazon actually got off easy despite ‘historic’ $2.5 billion Prime deceptive practices settlement,The surprise settlement between the online retail giant and the Trump administration happened just a few days into the trial over one of Amazon’s most important businesses.

The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday announced a $2.5 billion settlement with Amazon just days into a trial over the tech giant’s alleged use of deceptive practices that the commission said for years tricked millions of consumers into signing up for a Prime membership without their knowledge, and made it unreasonably difficult for them to cancel the service.
But the most exuberant celebrations Thursday may be occurring within the executive suites at Amazon’s D.C. and Seattle headquarters.
And for good reason.
The case, first filed by the FTC in 2023 under then-Chair Lina Khan, outlined a variety of ways that Amazon utilized misleading web design tactics, known as “dark patterns,” to get online shoppers to unknowingly enroll in its Prime program when making a purchase, or make it frustratingly difficult for someone to cancel a Prime membership (which cost $139 a year when the case was filed). The FTC cited a “four-page, six-click, fifteen-option cancellation process”—referred to internally by Amazon insiders as “Iliad”—that the agency said distracted or derailed customers on their way to cancel the membership.
It was a bad look for Amazon, and given that the case was aimed directly at one of Amazon’s most important products, the stakes were high.
The outlook for Amazon appeared to brighten in January when Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 47th president and Khan was replaced as FTC chair. Whether accurate or not, the perception inside Amazon was that new FTC leadership would be much more amenable to a settlement than Khan was. (Prior to leading the FTC, Khan had made her name as a critic of Amazon in law school and later helped lead the House Judiciary Committee’s Big Tech investigation in 2019 and 2020.)
But no settlement occurred. And then things got worse for Amazon.
Last week, before the trial was set to begin, the federal judge presiding over the case gave the FTC a partial win by ruling that some of Amazon’s actions violated consumer protection law by not disclosing the terms of a Prime membership before collecting a consumer’s billing information. The judge also ruled that the executives named in the FTC suit could be personally liable if a jury ruled against Amazon.
That might have been enough to push the company to settle. But this week, the trial started. At this point, if you were a betting man, you probably would not find Amazon’s odds very encouraging.
And Amazon’s decision to shell out billions to settle the case just a few days into the trial certainly seems to confirm Amazon’s weak hand.
So why a win for Amazon?
Of course it’s easy to start with the numbers. To call $2.5 billion a slap on the wrist would be absurd. But let’s be clear: The $2.5 billion total settlement amount is equal to about 13 days of profit for Amazon based on its financial results over the past 12 months. Or, when it comes to revenue, less than two days of sales."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-25T20:10:19,Amazon Agrees to $2.5 Billion Settlement With FTC Over Prime Subscription Case,The FTC alleged that Amazon deceived consumers about Amazon subscriptions and made it difficult to cancel.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7c0b21d310dc488d6c23ee7cfb84bbfd3c25f3597cdfce1b0e506a43ed1b144b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/business-news/amazon-prime-federal-trade-commission-lawsuit-settlement-1234781693/,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/business-news/amazon-prime-federal-trade-commission-lawsuit-settlement-1234781693/,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/business-news/amazon-prime-federal-trade-commission-lawsuit-settlement-1234781693/,sourcingjournal.com,200,,"Just days after a trial began, Amazon has settled a consumer lawsuit brought on by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2023.
The agency announced Thursday that it had secured a settlement with Amazon on a subscription-related lawsuit it brought against the e-tailer, alleging that the company deceptively influenced consumers to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then made it “exceedingly difficult to cancel.”
The $2.5 billion settlement earmarks $1.5 billion for consumer refunds. The FTC said that money will be disbursed to people “harmed by [Amazon’s] deceptive Prime enrollment practices.” The remaining $1 billion is a civil penalty Amazon will pay directly to the agency.
According to a LinkedIn post from Zak Stambor, an analyst for eMarketer, the $2.5 billion represents a single-digit portion of Amazon’s at-large Prime subscription revenue.
“This won’t dent Amazon’s dominance. Prime raked in $44.37 billion in subscription revenue last year, so the $2.5 billion settlement amounts to just 5.6 percent of that total. With more than 200 million global members—including roughly three-quarters of U.S. households—Prime remains the backbone of Amazon’s flywheel,” Stambor wrote.
Still, regulators remained optimistic about the size of the settlement. The FTC said the civil penalty accounts for the largest-ever fine delivered to company over a civil violation.
Andrew Ferguson, chairman of the FTC, called the settlement a “monumental win for the millions of Americans who are tired of deceptive subscriptions that feel impossible to cancel.” The agency estimates that about 35 million Americans were impacted by Amazon’s alleged actions.
“The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,” Ferguson said in a statement. “Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans’ pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again. The Trump-Vance FTC is committed to fighting back when companies try to cheat ordinary Americans out of their hard-earned pay.”
In addition to the financial penalties the company will pay the FTC and consumers, it will be required to make changes to the marketing behind the Prime model.
As part of the settlement, the FTC has mandated that Amazon remove a button that reads, “No, I don’t want Free Shipping,” thereby creating what it calls “a clear and conspicuous” way for consumers to decline a Prime membership.
The e-tail and technology giant will also be required to disclose “all material terms of Prime” while a consumer is actively enrolling in the service; that kind of information includes the cost, the frequency of the billing and more. What’s more, the company will be required to make it easier for consumers to cancel their subscription.
Amazon said it has already made these changes and plans to maintain them in line with the terms of the agreement. Despite the settlement, the company did not admit guilt on the FTC’s allegations.
Amazon spokesperson Mark Blafkin told Sourcing Journal via email that the company and its executives have “always followed the law.” Blafkin further noted that the company sees the agreed-upon settlement as a vehicle by which to “move forward and focus on innovating for customers.
“We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world,” Blafkin said in a statement."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Amazon Web Services' top executive admonished staff on Thursday for what he called slow product rollouts by the cloud computing provider at its premier Reinvent customer event in December, according to a transcript of a meeting reviewed by Reuters.
The Amazon unit typically announces its most ambitious new products and services at the annual conference in Las Vegas. Last year, for instance, AWS showed off its Nova chatbot, pitting it against OpenAI and other artificial intelligence rivals.
""Increasingly, we're finding that when we launch innovative new things at Reinvent it's valuable if we can actually launch them, as opposed to just pre-announce them,"" Matt Garman said at an internal all-hands meeting.
""Customers want to be able to use our products when we talk about them, and we find that when we're slow and coming out with products, you lose some of that buzz.""
It was unclear which products Garman was referencing.
""Reuters is grossly misinterpreting a second hand account of what was an inspiring internal conversation where we encouraged the team to work hard to keep delivering meaningful value to customers at Reinvent, just as we do every year,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
Amazon has been grappling with a reputation for slipping behind rivals in developing AI products. On its most recent earnings call, a Morgan Stanley analyst asked Amazon CEO Andy Jassy about what he said was a narrative on Wall Street that ""AWS is falling behind in genAI with concerns about share loss to peers.""
Jassy defended the company in an unusual eight-minute rebuttal, saying AI was in the early stages of development and there will be multiple winners.
Still, Garman pressed his staff on Thursday. ""The first and very most important thing we've got to do is make sure that we deliver on the roadmap that we have,"" he said.
Garman also pushed staff to ensure that AWS customers attend Reinvent in person, saying the December 1-5 conference is ""not interesting if customers aren't there."" The goal is to have over 60,000 attendees, said Garman, which would roughly match last year's total.
At the meeting, Garman demonstrated a new product for internal testing called Quick, a type of AI known as ""agentic,"" meaning it will perform tasks with minimal or no additional prompting.
It can analyze a variety of documents and web pages to improve productivity, he said. ""You can actually build customized workflows for things that you do on a regular basis that you can automate."""

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has moved to close a major chapter in its regulatory battles, agreeing to a $2.5 billion settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission. The agreement includes $1 billion in civil penalties and $1.5 billion in customer refunds, addressing allegations that the company pushed millions of users into Prime subscriptions and made cancellations deliberately cumbersome. The settlement also places restrictions on executives Neil Lindsay and Jamil Ghani, who are now prohibited from repeating the practices at the center of the case. The decision came only days after a Seattle jury was empaneled, avoiding the risk of a prolonged trial with potentially larger penalties.
Prime continues to be the backbone of Amazon's consumer ecosystem, with adoption still climbing. As of March, an estimated 196 million people in the US lived in households with Prime, a 9% increase year-over-year, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Members pay $139 annually, or $15 a month, for benefits ranging from free shipping to streaming services, and have historically spent more than non-members. That engagement translated into $12.2 billion in subscription revenue globally for the June quarter, up 11% from the prior year, underlining the program's role as a stable growth driver.
The outcome highlights the delicate balance between big tech and Washington as regulatory pressures remain uneven under President Donald Trump's administration. While the White House has promoted lighter oversight on artificial intelligence, other firms such as Meta (NASDAQ:META) have yet to resolve their disputes with the FTC. For Amazon, this settlement removes an immediate overhang but signals that regulatory exposure could continue to shape investor sentiment, particularly as scrutiny of digital platforms intensifies both in the US and abroad."

In addition, the company made the cancellation process difficult by delaying or completely rejecting changes that would have made the process much easier for people, the FTC said.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has long advocated for consumer rights, criticized the settlement, saying the Trump administration failed to hold Amazon accountable.
""Amazon allegedly tricked people into signing up for Prime and then trapped them with a monthly subscription by making it next to impossible to cancel,"" Warren said in a statement. ""This settlement fails to hold Amazon executives accountable for their actions and the fine is effectively a slap on the wrist – it’s less than 1-percent of Amazon’s revenue last year.""
""When the government does not fight for real accountability, giant corporations like Amazon treat fines for potentially illegal conduct as just the cost of doing business and it risks incentivizing future lawbreaking that costs people money,"" she added.

Amazon (AMZN, Financials) is paying $2.5 billion to end a long-running fight with the Federal Trade Commission over how it signed up customers for its Prime membership.
The surprise settlement landed just days into a trial in Seattle that was expected to stretch for weeks. The FTC had accused Amazon of tricking millions of people into joining Prime and then making it unnecessarily complicated for them to cancel.
As part of the deal, Amazon must spell out Prime's terms more clearly, get a customer's direct consent before charging for a subscription, and provide an easy way to cancel.
Prime has been one of Amazon's biggest growth engines since launching in 2005. More than 200 million people now pay $139 a year for perks like free shipping and streaming, and they spend more than non-members. That makes Thursday's settlement a notable regulatory challenge to one of Amazon's most profitable businesses.

- Entergy Mississippi plans to ask for a $300 million spending increase to improve its power grid.
- The company aims to cut power outages in half for its customers within five years.
- Funding for the grid improvements will come from new revenue generated by large industrial customers like Amazon.
- The upgrades are intended to support Mississippi's growing data center economy without raising costs for existing customers.
As Mississippi gets deeper and deeper into a data center economy that is going to require copious amounts of energy over the next decade, Entergy Mississippi has decided to push all its chips in the middle of the table.
Entergy Mississippi is meeting customers’ power needs to provide more and better power by making a five-year investment in reliability, while keeping rates far below the national average. And the large industrial investments that companies like Amazon have made in Mississippi will help fund the effort.
Entergy announced late on Sept. 24 that it will be asking the Mississippi Public Service Commission for approval to increase total spending on grid improvements by 50%, or $300 million, at what the company says would be at no cost to Mississippi customers.
The spending increase to strengthen the power grid, Entergy said in a statement, is possible because of new revenues provided by Amazon and other large industrial customers’ investments in Mississippi.
""It will help us target a significant goal for the first time — to cut power outages for Entergy Mississippi customers in half within five years. With $600 million in grid improvement investments already included in current and future plans, these new investments will bring the total improvement project to almost $1 billion toward a stronger grid,"" the statement reads.
The plan aims to reduce the overall frequency and duration of outages for the average Mississippi customer by approximately 50%, excluding major weather events. The reliability work includes:
- Installing stronger poles that are designed to withstand extreme weather conditions;
- Implementing more smart devices and real-time monitoring systems, and exploring additional self-healing networks, that automatically identify faults, re-route power and restore service faster;
- Increasing tree-trimming and dead tree removal measures to help prevent and decrease outages throughout Entergy Mississippi’s service area.
“Superpower Mississippi will transform the power grid like we’ve never seen before with better power at a lower cost. With this additional $300 million dollars, we’re investing 50% more in reliability to reach a 50% reduction in outages, all at 0% added cost to our customers,” said Haley Fisackerly, president and CEO, Entergy Mississippi.
Feeding the data centers
In the last two years, Mississippi has seen major data center construction announcements in Madison, Meridian and just last month in Brandon.
Two of the three will be served by Entergy, while the Compass Data Center project in Meridian will be served by Mississippi Power.
During the discussion of the potential of recruiting data center-type development into Rankin County for the Brandon project, Fisackerly was front and center.
“Mississippi continues to lead the southeast region into a new economic and innovation era, with the announcement of AVAIO Digital’s data center hub in Brandon,"" Fisackerly said at the time about the new project. ""The development proves why Entergy’s investment in reliable, clean and efficient power generation is essential to attracting new business and the state’s growth. Thanks to the Mississippi Development Authority and Rankin First Economic Development Authority for a partnership that is allowing us to meet our customers’ needs while supporting sustainability and economic growth.”
The one thing that both AWS and Compass have talked about is the ability of the state's energy companies to deliver at a breakneck speed. In the case of Compass, it has been Mississippi Power, but for AWS, at least at the Madison campuses, it has been Entergy.
""Everything in economic development is so infrastructure driven these days,"" Garrett Wright executive director of the Rankin First Economic Development Authority, previosly told the Clarion Ledger. ""They are already at the table, but we have to provide solutions to be able to win projects that are on the table. If you look at the most successful communities across the nation, they have prime sits that are ready to go, and their utility partners are sitting there at the table investing in those sites and having them ready to go. In today's world, that is what we need.""
When Compass Data Center CEO AJ Byers took the stage to celebrate his company locating its next hyperscale data center campus in Lauderdale County in January, he lauded the state's ability to move quickly on the energy front as ""The Mississippi Advantage.""
""Mississippi and Meridian, specifically, is uniquely situated along one of the major fiber routes across the Southern U.S. which was a clear advantage,"" Byers said. ""Clearly, Mississippi is embracing the digital economy and ready to take advantage of the many benefits it can bring. A bright future is ahead for Mississippi as a location for more data centers.""
Not just about data centers
Entergy and the Mississippi Public Service Commission both say the investment is about more than data center construction.
“This historic grid upgrade aims to provide measurable reliability improvements to our communities. I have been a vocal proponent of better power reliability and more investment in the power grid for some time,"" De’Keither Stamps, Central District Mississippi Public Service Commissioner said in the statement about Entergy's investment. ""I am pleased to see this effort launched and encouraged that it is being done at a lower cost for my constituents thanks to AWS’s investment in our region. The investment reflects a focused collaboration between the Commission, a utility and state leadership like we’ve never seen before. I’ve been intentionally engaging with Entergy Mississippi on this effort, and I’m encouraged by the plan to ensure a brighter future for our state.”

India currently prohibits foreign e-commerce companies from selling goods directly to consumers either at home or abroad, allowing them only to operate a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers for a fee.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's government has drafted a proposal to ease foreign investment rules to allow e-commerce companies such as Amazon to buy products directly from Indian sellers and then sell them to overseas customers, a document showed.
India prohibits foreign e-commerce companies from selling goods directly to consumers at home or abroad, allowing them only to operate a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers for a fee.
The policy has been a matter of dispute between New Delhi and Washington for years, and Amazon has lobbied the Indian government to ease the rules for exports, Reuters has reported.
The proposed changes coincide with efforts by India and the U.S. to overcome their differences over a long-delayed trade deal.
INDIA'S SMALL RETAILERS DISAGREE
The proposals also rebuff the demand of groups backing millions of small Indian brick-and-mortar retailers that the government should dismiss Amazon's request on the grounds the U.S. company's financial strength is a threat to their businesses.
Less than 10% of small Indian businesses selling online domestically participate in global e-commerce exports, ""constrained by complex documentation, compliance requirements,"" said a 10-page proposal from The Directorate General of Foreign Trade, which is not public but was seen by Reuters on Thursday.
""The proposal envisages a third-party export facilitation model, wherein a dedicated export entity linked to e-commerce platforms would manage compliance.""
The directorate and Amazon did not respond to Reuters' queries. The proposal will require a sign-off from India's cabinet.
Reuters has reported Amazon said the move will help Indian exporters, but the Confederation of All India Traders, which represents millions of bricks-and-mortar retailers, opposed the proposal on Friday. It said it could be abused by foreign companies and give them more control over supply chains.
""It will create a slippery slope, making it nearly impossible to monitor whether goods are genuinely meant for exports or being diverted into the domestic market,"" said B C Bhartia, the confederation's national president.
The directorate's draft said the relaxed rules would only apply to exports, and any breaches of the policy would attract stiff penalties along with criminal action. It has proposed implementing the model on a pilot basis, and scaling it up after a review.
Amazon said in December it helped to generate $13 billion in cumulative exports for sellers from India since 2015, and plans to increase that to $80 billion by 2030."

NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Amazon Teamsters rallied today at New York City Hall in support of the Delivery Protection Act, a groundbreaking bill introduced by Councilmember Tiffany Cabán (D-22nd District) that would protect workers and communities near last-mile delivery facilities in New York City.
The legislation would ban Amazon's exploitative Delivery Service Provider (DSP) model, making it illegal in New York City. It would also include licensing requirements for facilities and prohibit the use of third-party subcontractors for employment.
""The Teamsters will not allow Amazon to hide behind a smoke-and-mirrors subcontracting scheme to exploit workers and engage in illegal union-busting,"" said Randy Korgan, Director of the Teamsters Amazon Division. ""The Delivery Protection Act is the blueprint for fighting back against Amazon's greed and obstruction. Thank you, Councilmember Cabán, for showing the rest of the country how we can deliver for Amazon workers.""
""For too long, companies like Amazon have gotten away with terrible conditions in their last-mile facilities, while using subcontractors to dodge responsibility for unsafe delivery conditions and dangerous streets,"" said Councilmember Tiffany Cabán. ""The Delivery Protection Act will end that charade. It forces these companies to take responsibility for the conditions their delivery services create, and treat delivery workers as the essential workers they are, not as disposable labor. This bill is a game-changer for workers in New York and for every city fighting to hold corporate giants accountable. We're proud to stand with the Teamsters in the fight for accountability, for safety, and for fairness.""
Earlier this month, Amazon unilaterally and illegally fired over 100 unionized drivers at the DBK4 facility in Maspeth, Queens. The Teamsters are calling on the New York City Council to pass the Delivery Protection Act this year to defend New York City delivery drivers and warehouse workers from corporate greed and keep streets safe.
""I wear an Amazon uniform, drive an Amazon truck, and deliver Amazon packages. But Amazon wants to profit off my labor without having the responsibilities any other employer has,"" said Lamont Hopewell, an Amazon driver at the DBK4 warehouse. ""The Delivery Protection Act will stop Amazon's abusive business practices and make our communities safer. The New York City Council needs to pass this important legislation."""

Amazon agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a Federal Trade Commission case over whether it duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it difficult for customers to cancel their membership.
As part of the settlement, announced Thursday, Amazon will provide $1.5 billion in refunds to customers that were harmed by what FTC referred to as ""deceptive Prime enrollment practices."" About 35 million Prime customers who were impacted by the practices could qualify for $51 each as part of the settlement, the FTC said in legal documents.
Amazon is also required to pay a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest in any FTC rule violation case to date. The FTC said the $1.5 billion payout to customers is the second-highest restitution award in the agency's history.
Prime customers who are eligible for the payout include those who may have signed up for a membership via the company's ""Single Page Checkout"" between June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025. Amazon must distribute the payments to all affected customers within 90 days, according to the court order.
""The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,"" FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a statement, adding, ""Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.""
Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the complaint, according to the legal documents. In a statement shared with CBS News, the company said Amazon and its executives have ""always followed the law"" and that the settlement allows them to ""move forward and focus on innovating for customers.""
In addition to offering compensation to impacted customers, the FTC said Amazon was also required to make changes to its Prime enrollment and cancellation practices, which documents showed that company executives and employees knowingly discussed. The changes included adding a ""clear and conspicuous"" button to its site for customers to decline a Prime membership offer.
In addition, the e-commerce giant was told to make it easier for Prime members to cancel their membership.
""The process cannot be difficult, costly, or time-consuming,"" the FTC said in its statement.
A spokesperson for Amazon said in an email that the changes outlined by the FTC press ""have already made, many of them years ago.""
The FTC's efforts to make it easier for customers to cancel subscriptions extend beyond Amazon. In 2024, the commission approved a ""click-to cancel rule,"" which would have allowed consumers to more quickly end streaming services, gym memberships, product deliveries and other subscriptions. The rule had been set to take effect July 14, but was blocked by a federal court that month.
""We hope the FTC resurrects the click-to-cancel rules to protect millions of consumers from shady sales tactics,"" said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonprofit public interest group, in en email. ""In the meantime, we hope this Amazon settlement sends a strong message to any company operating in ways that could conceivably confuse customers or thwart their efforts to not be customers any more.""
Thursday's settlement, which came two days after a jury trial kicked off in Seattle, represents the culmination of a two-year case that the FTC began in June 2023.
Amazon Prime provides subscribers with perks that include faster shipping, video streaming and discounts at Whole Foods for a fee of $139 annually, or $14.99 a month.
It's a key and growing part of Amazon's business, with more than 200 million members. In its latest financial report, the company reported in July that it booked more than $12 billion in net revenue for subscription services, a 12% increase from the same period last year.
That figure includes annual and monthly fees associated with Prime memberships, as well as other subscription services such as its music and e-books platforms.
In a separate case, the FTC is looking into whether Amazon has allegedly engaged in monopolistic behavior that allows it to inflate prices and suppress competition from rivals in violation of antitrust laws."

The company will be required to pay a $1 billion civil penalty and provide $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million consumers harmed by the company’s “deceptive Prime enrollment practices,” the FTC says. Amazon is also required to stop its “unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices.”
The suit, filed in June 2023 under the Biden administration, claimed that Amazon created confusing and deceptive user interfaces to lead consumers to enroll in Prime without their knowledge. It also created a complex process for consumers looking to cancel their subscription by making them go through unnecessary steps, the FTC alleged.
The settlement comes as Amazon and the FTC had just begun the trial this week, during which a jury was supposed to decide the outcome.
“The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,” said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson in a press release. “Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans’ pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.”
As part of the settlement, Amazon is required to include a clear button for customers to decline signing up for Prime. This means that the company can no longer have a button that says “No, I don’t want free shipping.”
Amazon must also clearly disclose the subscription cost during the enrollment process, along with the billing date and frequency, whether the subscription auto-renews, and the procedure for cancellation. Additionally, the company is required to create an easy way for consumers to cancel Prime, using the same method that consumers used to sign up for the service.
“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” Amazon said in a statement. “We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world. We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we’ll deliver for Prime members in the coming years.”
The settlement is one of the largest in the FTC’s history. In 2019, Facebook (now Meta) reached a $5 billion settlement with the agency for violating consumers’ privacy.
It’s worth noting that Amazon still faces another federal lawsuit, in which the FTC has accused the company of illegally stifling competition on its way to becoming a ubiquitous retail presence and one of the world’s most valuable companies."

The Seattle company will pay one billion dollars (£749 million) in civil penalties – the largest FTC fine in its history – and 1.5 billion dollars (£1.1 billion) will be paid to consumers who were unintentionally enrolled in Prime, or were deterred from cancelling their subscriptions, the agency said.
The surprise settlement comes just days after the trial began in US District Court in Seattle this week.
At the heart of the case is the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act, a 2010 law designed to ensure that people know what they are being charged for online.
FTC officials said Amazon had its back against the wall and the consumer refund amount exceeded even the agency’s expert projections.
“I think it just took a few days for them to see that they were going to lose. And they came to us and they paid out,” said Chris Mufarrige, director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, on the settlement negotiations.
Amazon, however, said it was confident it would win the case but that it chose to resolve it quickly instead of going through potentially years of trial and appeals.
The company admitted no wrongdoing in the case, which was first filed two years ago.
“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” said spokesman Mark Blafkin in a statement.
“We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.”
Certain Prime customers who are eligible for automatic refunds of up to 51 dollars (£38.26) include those who may have signed up for a membership via the company’s Single Page Checkout, among other links, between June 23 2019 and June 23 2025.
Those customers will be reimbursed within 90 days of the settlement order.
Amazon is also on the hook to set up a claims process for more than 30 million customers who may have been affected by the other issues at the heart of the FTC case, including its cancellation process.
Amazon Prime provides subscribers with perks that include faster shipping, video streaming and discounts at Whole Foods for a fee of 139 dollars (£104) annually, or 14.99 dollars (£11.23) a month.

A trial over whether Amazon had tricked almost 40 million customers into signing up for its Prime service had just gotten underway
Daria Nipot
Three days after its trial got underway, Amazon has agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that it tricked nearly 40 million customers into signing up for Prime and made cancelling that subscription especially challenging.
Suggested Reading
Opening arguments in the trial started on Tuesday and Amazon, in a statement the day before the trial began, insisted ""neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong – we remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first.""
Related Content
Under the terms of the settlement, Amazon will be required to pay a $1 billion civil penalty and provide $1.5 billion in refunds back to consumers, the FTC said in a media release. The $1.5 billion in refunds is the second-largest restitution amount ever obtained by the FTC, the organization said.
Amazon, in a statement, told Quartz, ""Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers.""
The FTC called the settlement ""a record-breaking, monumental win for the millions of Americans who are tired of deceptive subscriptions that feel impossible to cancel.""
The lawsuit against Amazon was originally filed two years ago. The FTC alleged Amazon had created a “labyrinthine” cancellation process, which was designed to deter customers from finishing the act of cancelation. Customers wishing to cancel their Prime subscription, it said, were required to “navigate a four-page, six-click, fifteen-option cancellation process.” Warnings on missing deals and discounts were also included to discourage customers.
Amazon has changed its cancellation policies since the fight with the FTC began. A standalone cancellation page lets members see the options available to them on pausing or ending their membership.
Under the terms of the deal, Amazon will provide a clear and conspicuous button for customers to decline Prime. The company can no longer have a button that says, “No, I don’t want Free Shipping.” It also will have to pay for an independent, third-party supervisor to monitor its compliance with the settlement.
Amazon does not regularly report Prime subscriber numbers, but they're currently estimated at north of 200 million. Prime customers also tend to buy more than non-subscribers, making them more valuable to the company.
This suit was separate from the FTC's antitrust case against Amazon, which was brought with the assistance of several state attorneys general. That case remains on track to go to trial in 2027."

The Seattle company will pay $1 billion in civil penalties — the largest such fine in the agency’s history for a rule violation — and $1.5 billion will be paid back to consumers who were unintentionally enrolled in Prime, or were deterred from canceling their subscriptions, the agency said Thursday.
The surprise settlement comes just days after the trial began in U.S. District Court in Seattle this week. At the heart of the case is the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act, a 2010 law designed to ensure that people know what they’re being charged for online.
FTC officials said Amazon had its back against the wall and the consumer refund amount exceeded even the agency’s expert projections.
“I think it just took a few days for them to see that they were going to lose. And they came to us and they paid out,” said Chris Mufarrige, director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, on the settlement negotiations.
Amazon, however, said it was confident it would win case but that it chose to resolve it quickly instead of going through potentially years of trial and appeals. The company admitted no wrongdoing in the case, which was first filed two years ago.
“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,"" said spokesman Mark Blafkin in a statement. ""We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.”
Certain Prime customers who are eligible for automatic refunds of up to $51 include those who may have signed up for a membership via the company’s “Single Page Checkout,” among other links, between June 23, 2019, to June 23, 2025. Those customers will be reimbursed within 90 days of the settlement order.
Amazon is also on the hook to set up a claims process for more than 30 million customers who may have been affected by the other issues at the heart of the FTC case, including its cancellation process.
Amazon Prime provides subscribers with perks that include faster shipping, video streaming and discounts at Whole Foods for a fee of $139 annually, or $14.99 a month.
It’s a key and growing part of Amazon’s business, with more than 200 million members. In its latest financial report, the company reported in July that it booked more than $12 billion in net revenue for subscription services, a 12% increase from the same period last year. That figure includes annual and monthly fees associated with Prime memberships, as well as other subscription services such as its music and e-books platforms."

(Reuters) -Amazon.com will pay $2.5 billion in fines and reimbursements to Prime subscribers to settle the Federal Trade Commission's allegations that it deceived its customers to generate subscriptions, the FTC said on Thursday.
While a win for consumers and the FTC, the settlement is relatively painless for Amazon: the company takes in around $2.5 billion in sales every 33 hours. Shares of Amazon were nearly unchanged after the news.
Around 35 million Prime customers will be eligible for payout from a $1.5 billion fund, the FTC said. Amazon will pay $1 billion in fines to the FTC. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
Customers who signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025 through certain offers -- and who used few Prime benefits afterward -- will automatically receive $51, according to court documents.
The settlement also allows customers to submit claims for payment if they tried to cancel Prime and failed during that time.
Amazon said in a statement that the deal allows it to move forward and focus on customers.
""We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world,"" the company said.
As part of the settlement, Amazon has agreed to create a ""clear and conspicuous"" button to allow customers to decline a Prime subscription, and to make it easier to cancel. Amazon has also agreed to more clearly disclose the terms of a subscription during enrollment and pay an independent supervisor to monitor compliance.
Amazon said the settlement largely requires it to maintain changes that are already in place, rather than make new ones.
The FTC alleged in its case that, between 2017 and 2022, Amazon executives rejected changes that would make its sign-up and cancellation processes clearer. The company later adopted changes in 2022, while it was under investigation by the FTC. The agency sued Amazon the next year.
FTC'S SECOND-BIGGEST CONSUMER PAYOUT
The settlement is the second-largest restitution amount ever for an FTC action, agency officials said, and represents a major win for the FTC's tough-on-tech agenda, which began during the first Trump administration.
FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson called the deal ""a record-breaking, monumental win for the millions of Americans who are tired of deceptive subscriptions that feel impossible to cancel.""
The FTC announced the settlement days into a trial in Seattle federal court, where the agency argued to a jury that Amazon sought to enroll members whether or not they wanted the service."

""Stablecoins are a catalyst for blockchain’s ChatGPT moment in institutional adoption,"" wrote Ronit Ghose, global head of future of finance at Citi Institute, and Ryan Rugg, global head of digital assets at Citi Services.
Citi now forecasts stablecoin issuance could reach $1.9 trillion by 2030 in its base case, up from a previous estimate of $1.6 trillion. In a bull case, issuance could soar to $4 trillion. The revision reflects ""strong"" 2025 growth in the market, plus a flurry of project announcements from crypto-native firms to traditional financial players.
Stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar — are increasingly being used in crypto trading, e-commerce, and by offshore households seeking easier access to dollars. They have grown from a $200 billion market cap to $280 billion this year alone, per Citi.
The expansion could be evidence that blockchain technology is finally breaking through in the way large institutions transact and settle money. The bank compares the moment to the ""early days of the dotcom boom,"" when skeptics doubted whether the internet would truly reshape commerce.

""We don’t believe crypto will burn down the existing system,"" the firm notes. ""Rather it is helping us reimagine it.""
The report estimated that $1.9 trillion in stablecoin issuance could support nearly $100 trillion in annual transaction, but notes those numbers remain small compared to the $5 trillion to $10 trillion leading banks already move each day.
Still, Citi is careful to temper its enthusiasm, emphasizing that stablecoins ""are not the answer to everything.""
Domestic payments in many countries already function in real time at a low cost. Cross-border transactions remain a pain point, but fintech and banks have made progress in lowering fees and speeding up settlement.
""It is not a digital format war that we foresee,"" Citi analysts wrote, ""but a continued progress towards smarter, faster finance.""
That skepticism matters as most corporate firms remain ""curious rather than enthusiastic"" about adopting stablecoins. Many companies prefer so-called bank tokens, otherwise known as tokenized deposits, which mirror the safety and regulatory oversight of existing money in the banking system. Citi said transaction volumes for bank tokens ""could exceed stablecoins by 2030."""

The CSN has brought a legal action against the U.S. multinational following the closure of its seven Québec warehouses in January 2025.
In a complaint filed on February 20, 2025, the CSN described Amazon's move as a ""massive subterfuge"" aimed at evading its legal obligations and eliminating any union presence within the company. ""Amazon isn't ceasing its online sales activities in Québec. It is reorganizing its operations to escape its obligations as an employer under the Labour Code,"" reads the complaint, filed pursuant to sections 12, 13, 14 and 53 of the Labour Code.
The trial before Judge Irène Zaïkoff will open with the testimony of Jasmin Begagic, President of Amazon Canada Fulfillment Services. He will be asked to explain how the closure of the seven distribution centres was simply a business decision unrelated to the unionization of Amazon's DXT4 warehouse in Laval and the organizing campaign that was underway at its other Québec warehouses.
""We believe it is clear that the main purpose of the closing of Amazon's warehouses in Québec was to shut down the organizing effort and avoid signing its first collective agreement in North America,"" said CSN President Caroline Senneville. ""After Amazon's many preliminary objections and other delaying tactics, the trial can now go ahead. It is time for workers to get justice for these closures, which are unlawful in more ways than one.""
Amazon's decision defies logic
On behalf of numerous complainants, the CSN is asking the ALT to overturn Amazon's decision.
Since ""Amazon's actions are an attack on Québec's legal system [and] this employer does not hesitate to lay off thousands of people to set an example,"" the CSN is asking the ALT to order the resumption of operations at the seven warehouses covered by the complaint and to award each employee more than a year's salary in compensation, in addition to moral and punitive damages.
The complaint contends that Amazon's decision to close its Québec warehouses is in direct contradiction with the business plan it has been pursuing in recent years. The CSN points out that Amazon's four newest facilities in Québec, including the unionized DXT4 warehouse in Laval, were opened just three years ago as part of the company's massive investment in its ""last mile"" strategy."

By pairing its self-service Roku Ads Manager with deeper integrations across major demand-side platforms, the company is expected to build an ecosystem that broadens its addressable market while strengthening monetisation capabilities. This transformation has lifted platform revenues by 18% year over year to $975 million in the second quarter of 2025.
Roku Ads Manager is designed to drive long-term expansion by targeting performance advertising budgets historically dominated by social media and search. The self-service tool allows small and medium-sized businesses to launch professional video ads within minutes. Features such as Shopify integration and shoppable overlays are expected to attract more direct-to-consumer advertisers, positioning Roku to capture spend migrating from traditional digital channels.
Enhanced integrations with major Demand-Side Platforms (DSP), including Amazon and The Trade Desk, are expected to drive stronger bid density and fill rates across Roku’s advertising inventory. These partnerships are likely to leverage the company’s authenticated base of over 90 million logged-in households to deliver precise targeting capabilities and support flexible pricing across advertiser segments and inventory types. The Roku Channel’s 80% viewing-hour growth is expected to provide the content foundation for greater advertising scale, while its 5.4% share of all U.S. TV streaming time (per Nielsen’s The Gauge) highlights market penetration that should enhance Roku’s advertising value proposition going forward.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2025 Platform revenues is currently pegged at $1.04 billion, indicating 16% year-over-year growth. Backed by advertising innovation that is opening new demand channels and deepening engagement, Roku is expected to sustain platform growth and secure a durable share in the connected TV advertising market.
ROKU Faces Competition in Connected TV Advertising
Roku faces stiff competition from Disney DIS and Netflix NFLX, both of which are accelerating their advertising strategies to capture connected TV budgets. Disney is expected to scale its Hulu and Disney+ ad tiers, leveraging blockbuster content to attract premium advertisers. Netflix is rapidly building out its ad-supported offering, drawing strong interest from brands seeking global reach and high engagement. While Disney and Netflix intensify pressure in the market, Roku’s integrated ad platform, self-service tools and authenticated user base are projected to help sustain platform momentum."

LONDON (Reuters) -When Amazon opened its first grocery store outside the United States in 2021, its choice of a site in west London for a cashier-free store was seen as the start of a major assault on Britain’s $290 billion food market.
That store closed in 2023 and this week the group said it planned to shut its remaining 19 Amazon Fresh stores - a failure that highlights the brutal economics of UK food retail, and how one of the most powerful retailers in the world may still be feeling its way on how to compete globally in groceries.
Amazon, which also runs Amazon Fresh stores in the United States as well as the upmarket Whole Foods Market chain, never confirmed UK store targets, but 2021 media reports suggested plans for over 260 Fresh outlets by end-2024.
Last year, it also dropped Amazon Fresh delivery in five cities but still serves over 100 UK towns and cities, including London, Birmingham and Manchester. It also ended its own grocery delivery service in Germany.
Amazon's announcement does not impact its more than 60 Amazon Fresh stores and more than a dozen Amazon Go stores in the United States or its over 539 Whole Foods Markets locations across the U.S. and Canada, the company said.
PLANS TO EXPAND ONLINE DELIVERY
Amazon insists grocery remains a key part of its UK ambitions — its third biggest market overall after the U.S. and Germany.
It said on Tuesday it plans to expand UK online delivery of everyday essentials and fresh groceries through its main Amazon.co.uk site, the Amazon Fresh site, and partnerships with supermarkets Morrisons, the Co-op, Iceland, and rapid delivery firm Gopuff, where orders are placed via Amazon's site but delivered by the retailers.
Amazon plans next year to introduce perishable groceries on Amazon.co.uk with same-day delivery, a service it recently launched in the United States. It will also convert five Amazon Fresh locations to the Whole Foods Market format, giving it 12 stores by the end of 2026.
But after over 15 years selling groceries, analysts estimate Amazon's UK market share remains below 1%, despite its stock market value being over 60 times that of industry leader Tesco.
Amazon does not publish financial results for UK grocery.
According to Reuters interviews with former employees, rival executives, consultants, analysts and academics, Amazon misjudged the challenge of adapting its global retail model to the nuances of UK food retailing, where 14 household names fight for margins under 5%.
One former UK grocery retail CEO, who declined to be named, said building a mass food retail operation in Britain required a very different skill set from Amazon's general merchandise expertise, such as specialist logistics and systems."

They're missing the bigger prize. The real money lies in robots that do things: picking packages, welding parts, moving inventory. Goldman Sachs just tripled its humanoid robot forecast to $38 billion by 2035, while industrial robotics could climb to a whopping $94 billion. And thanks to AI foundation models, robots are suddenly 10 times cheaper to train.
Look at Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) warehouses. More than a million robots already work alongside people to move billions of packages. That's not science fiction, it's happening today. Tesla (TSLA 1.26%) is scaling humanoid production from hundreds toward thousands. Nvidia (NVDA 0.03%) supplies the Isaac platform that powers both companies, along with nearly every other serious robotics program. Together, these three tech giants give investors distinct paths into the $130 billion robotics wave that's only just starting to break.
Tesla's $20,000 gamble
Tesla claims Optimus could one day represent 80% of its future value. That sounds extreme, but CEO Elon Musk has a track record of turning audacious ideas into reality -- often years later than promised. In 2025, the company managed only a few hundred units, far short of its 5,000-robot goal, and leadership turnover has raised questions about execution.
The bet comes down to cost. Tesla is targeting $20,000 to $30,000 per humanoid, while rivals like Figure and Boston Dynamics price well above $100,000. If Tesla can hit that price point, humanoids move from rare capital expenditures to scalable operating expenses. Even its diner deployment, which looked like a publicity stunt, generated real-world data that no lab simulation can match.
Tesla's advantage is vertical integration. The same neural networks guiding cars can guide robots, its electric vehicle (EV) batteries can power humanoids, and its factories already scale in volumes that competitors can't touch. Shares are up about 5.5% this year, and at 166 times forward earnings, the stock assumes near-perfect execution. Still, if Optimus delivers even a fraction of its promise, the upside could dwarf today's core automotive business.
Amazon's million-robot advantage
Amazon doesn't chase hype. It quietly runs the world's largest robotic fleet -- more than 1 million units already deployed across its fulfillment network. These aren't prototypes, but production systems that move millions of packages every day.
With the rollout of DeepFleet, Amazon says it improved travel efficiency by about 10%, a modest gain that compounds massively at a global scale. Its Hercules robots lift 1,250 pounds, while Proteus units navigate safely among human workers, blending heavy-duty capability with human-friendly design.
The advantage isn't just volume but integration. Next-generation facilities now operate an order of magnitude more robots than older sites, yet they also employ more skilled technicians in maintenance and reliability.
Amazon's model proves automation shifts work rather than erases it, while driving throughput and lowering unit costs. Competitors show off demos; Amazon embeds robotics into daily operations. That discipline creates a durable edge -- and an earnings flywheel few rivals can replicate.
Nvidia's robotics platform lead
Nvidia doesn't build robots -- it builds the software and chips that make them work. The tech giant's Isaac GR00T foundation model trains humanoids, Isaac Lab and Sim provide the simulation environment, and Jetson Thor brings high-end inference to the edge. This stack is quickly becoming the default toolkit for robotics teams from Boston Dynamics to Agility, even as some companies layer in their own custom systems.
The playbook mirrors Nvidia's CUDA dominance in AI training: Create indispensable software and let hardware demand follow. By selling the brains, tools, and pipelines, Nvidia captures value no matter which robot design wins. At roughly 50 times earnings, the stock already assumes excellence, but if robotics adoption scales toward the trillion-dollar forecasts, a platform-style take rate on physical AI could still leave plenty of upside."

The managed service lets clients handle front-to-back-office workflows, risk, and compliance with quicker rollouts and regular updates, helping firms modernize legacy stacks in a more resilient environment.
Magnus Haglind, Head of Capital Markets Technology at Nasdaq, called this moment “a strategic inflection point” as market participants confront fragmented systems and rising regulatory needs.
According to Benzinga Pro, NDAQ stock has gained over 19% in the past year. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Listed Funds Trust Horizon Kinetics Blockchain Development ETF (NYSE: BCDF).
Haglind said cloud-managed services deliver the flexibility and scale required to respond, and the AWS expansion positions Nasdaq to lead that change.
John Kain, Director of Financial Services Market Development at AWS, described a “technological paradox” for banks, innovating rapidly while supporting mission-critical legacy operations.
He said the tie-up boosts Calypso’s performance, scalability, and security, offering a more future-ready framework.
Customers gain standardized implementations, a simpler testing environment, and faster access to new features.
The model also supports streamlined data flows that can power AI-driven analytics across trading, risk, margin, collateral, and data management.
Nasdaq says its technology supports 97% of global systemically important banks, half of the top 25 stock exchanges, dozens of central banks and regulators, and more than 3,800 financial-services clients.
Extending Calypso on AWS is intended to bring mission-critical systems closer together, reduce data-flow friction, and enable advanced analytics for efficiency and growth.

Revenues jumped 207% year over year to $1.2 billion, marking the company’s first billion-dollar quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $753.2 million compared with $249.8 million in the prior-year quarter. This translated to an EBITDA margin of 62%, only a shade below last year’s 63%.
Despite the rapid scaling and focus on product innovation, margins being almost in line with the year-ago quarter reflect CoreWeave’s differentiated position in the structurally undersupplied AI-cloud market. Management emphasized that growth remains constrained by capacity, not demand, as backlog expanded to $30.1 billion, up $4 billion from the first quarter and doubling year to date. Expansion with OpenAI contract and other contracts with hyperscalers while increasing foothold in sectors like finance and healthcare, and AI start-ups, is driving backlog increase.
Nonetheless, going ahead, sustaining margins at such high levels will be tested by CoreWeave’s increasingly aggressive expansion strategy. The company had 470 megawatts (“MW”) of active power and contracted power of 2.2 gigawatts at the end of the second quarter. It targets more than 900 MW of active power by year-end. Key projects include a $6 billion data center investment in Lancaster, PA, and another data center in Kenilworth, NJ, through a joint venture with Blue Owl.
CoreWeave needs to watch out for increasing expenditures. In the last reported quarter, total operating expenses were $1.2 billion compared with $317.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Capex was $2.9 billion, an increase of $1 billion from the last quarter. Interest expense climbed to $267 million in the second quarter, reflecting heavy use of debt to finance growth, while net loss totaled $291 million.
For the third quarter, it expects interest expenses to be between $350 million and $390 million, owing to high leverage. Higher interest expenses can exert pressure on the adjusted net income and potentially affect free cash flow generation and undermine near-term profitability.
As the AI infrastructure race gains pace, investors will closely scrutinize CoreWeave's ability to manage massive capex and rising costs while maintaining consistent margins. The recent deal with NVIDIA for residual unused capacity is likely to offer some cushioning.
Taking a Look at Profitability Numbers for Competitors
Nebius N.V. Group NBIS, while smaller in scale, has emerged as an intriguing challenger to CoreWeave. The company’s revenues surged 625% year over year to $105.1 million in the second quarter of 2025. NBIS achieved positive EBITDA in its core AI infrastructure business, driven by hyper revenue growth earlier than expected in the second quarter."

This $7 Trillion Clue May Reveal The Truth.,"Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are trading at lofty valuations, causing some investors to worry that a bubble is about to burst.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=470cbf28d61e8ef2b3ba73a991c3d2000e32b3b1ff72cf03e5172372a84adf22,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,fool.com,200,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution fueled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to repeated all-time highs in recent years.
Much of this momentum can be traced to a small basket of companies. Relentless demand for AI vaulted Nvidia (NVDA 0.03%), Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing into the trillion-dollar club. Established giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla have each enjoyed a new wave of investor enthusiasm.
Yet with valuations stretched to historic levels, some investors may worry that the AI trade is drifting toward bubble territory. A new report from consultant firm McKinsey & Company, however, offers a different perspective: a $7 trillion clue that could reshape how skeptics view the future of AI.
Data center capacity is just getting started
According to McKinsey's forecast, global data center capacity is set to nearly triple by 2030 -- climbing from 82 gigawatts today to 219 gigawatts at the start of the next decade.
Crucially, roughly 70% of this growth will be driven by AI workloads, while the remainder will be tied to traditional cloud and information technology (IT) applications.
In total, McKinsey projects that capital expenditures to fund this infrastructure expansion could approach $7 trillion over the next five years.
Why do these trends matter for AI valuations?
During the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco traded at peak price-to-sales (P/S) multiples between 30 and 40. Today, skeptics contend that some AI leaders are exhibiting similar signs of excess -- with some trading at elevated P/S and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios relative to historic norms. Tesla and Palantir Technologies, in particular, stand out with valuations that may be stretched to unsustainable levels.
But the comparison to the dot-com era overlooks some critical differences. At the height of internet euphoria, many technology darlings had minimal sales traction, persistent cash burn, and valuations built on metrics such as clicks and user growth.
By contrast, AI already enjoys enterprise-grade adoption across industries ranging from cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research to autonomous systems, retail, and robotics.
What's more, McKinsey's data indicates that companies can count on continued cash flow as data center spending continues.
Put simply, as AI infrastructure continues to increase rapidly, the revenue and profits generated by companies powering this accelerated transformation are likely to translate into sustained premium valuations over time.
$7 trillion of opportunity suggests long-term upside
History's prior bubbles were primarily supported by hope, which can be fleeting. However, continuous spending on chips, servers, networking gear, and efficient energy systems is converging on the next generation of products and services that can be measured and benchmarked against financial growth.
Far from signaling a bubble, the upcoming $7 trillion investment marks the first wave of an infrastructure supercycle reshaping entire economies. In other words, this is the foundation for the next technology roadmap.
For investors, the takeaway is clear: Volatility is inevitable, but structural demand from AI is locked in. Semiconductor designers and manufacturers, cloud hyperscalers, and energy innovators sit at the center of this demand -- positioned to capture powerful secular tailwinds over the coming years.
Viewed in this context, today's investments represent early entries into a historic growth narrative that continues to expand. For long-term investors, megacap AI stocks remain some of the most compelling buy-and-hold opportunities in the modern AI infrastructure boom."

- Amid rising healthcare costs, Amazon announced benefit updates Sept. 17 that include a “reduced-cost” healthcare plan for its fulfillment and transportation employees. Workers on the plan will only need to pay $5 a week and $5 for copays starting in 2026.
- Those costs amount to about $22 per month or $260 per year for employees. This results in reductions of weekly contributions by workers by 34% and copays for primary care, mental health and nonspecialist visits by 87%, Amazon said.
- The changes were made based on feedback offered by workers, Udit Madan, senior vice president of Amazon Worldwide Operations, said in the announcement.
Dive Insight:
Employers have faced “sobering” healthcare cost increases in recent years, Ellen Kelsay, president and CEO of the Business Group on Health, said in August. While employers projected 6.5% cost increases for 2024, actual increases measured out at 7.5%, BGH found in its recent report.
Mercer also flagged cost increases that could hit a 15-year high in a report this month.
Employers try to absorb as many of these increases as possible, Kelsay said, but employees may increasingly be on the hook to pay up. Three-fourths of employers surveyed by the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions last year said that these costs could lead to trade offs with salary and wages increases.
In the benefits announcement, Amazon also flagged wage increases targeted toward rewarding tenure.
“Some of our most tenured employees will see an increase between $1.10 and $1.90 per hour, and full-time employees will, on average, see their pay increase by $1,600 per year,” Madan wrote in the announcement. “We also have an annual step plan where pay increases each year someone is with us, and as part of these changes we’re adjusting that plan so the increases are bigger each year than they’ve been in the past.”"

- Global ad spending will be more robust than previously anticipated in 2025, with full-year growth now expected to increase 7.4% to $1.17 trillion, according to a Q3 update from WARC.
- The upward revision, the first WARC has issued in over a year, marks a 1.2 percentage-point jump from prior estimates published in June. Driving momentum are digital-first ad platforms, which will snap up nine in 10 dollars of incremental market growth, and what WARC described as a “pre-tariff windfall.”
- Social media is attracting a plurality of new ad dollars at 40.6% market share, while non-retail search and retail media will take up 22.2% and 21.5% of spend, respectively. Just three companies — Google owner Alphabet, Amazon and Meta — are positioned to take over half (55.8%) of global ad spend this year, excluding China.
Dive Insight:
As other industry watchers slash their ad-spending outlooks for 2025, WARC foresees more robust growth than anticipated just a few months ago. The researcher’s Q3 report, which takes a global versus U.S.-specific view, highlights how the digital triopoly of Amazon, Google and Meta continues to entrench its dominance amid a period of deep economic uncertainty. The findings also indicate that marketers enacted a blitz of activity in the second quarter, a “pre-tariff” period where many brands rushed to stockpile inventory and promote value ahead of expected price hikes.
On the latter point, social media spending spiked 20.2% year over year in Q2, well above prior projections of 12.4% growth and the equivalent of about $4.9 billion in additional value. WARC tracked “sharp” increases in spending from retailers on social media in Q2, with the category pouring more dollars into Meta-owned Instagram (18.8% growth) and TikTok (56.8% growth), whose future in the U.S. is still being sorted out. Retail is now the largest category on both of those platforms, per WARC monitoring assisted by Nielsen. Technology and consumer electronics, other verticals vulnerable to tariffs, recorded notable lifts in spending on those sites as well.
“Despite economic headwinds, including disruption to global trade and reduced purchasing power among consumers, brands are doubling down on Meta, Alphabet and Amazon, while emerging players like TikTok are growing fast but from smaller bases,” said James McDonald, director of data, intelligence and forecasting at WARC, in a statement. “The global market is set to nearly double in value since the pandemic, underscoring the resilience of advertising in a tougher economic climate.”
Retail media is on track to grow 13.7% in 2025, achieving $175 billion in spend, or a 14.9% share of the total global market. Like other pockets of digital, just a few companies loom large in retail media, with Amazon primed to account for over a third (35.4%) of its advertising pie. That said, retail media’s upward climb is set for a “marked slowdown,” with an average rate of growth of 12.6% over the next few years.
By contrast, traditional media channels, including newspapers, broadcast TV and radio, remain on the wane. A big upshot from WARC is that digital has firmly entrenched itself as the leading advertising engine in the post-pandemic world despite repeated fits of macro volatility. The firm estimates that the nominal value of the global ad market will effectively double by 2027 compared to 2020 figures, reaching about $1.36 trillion.
Not everyone is as optimistic about 2025’s prospects as the impact of tariffs are more strongly felt by brands. U.S. automotive and retail spending on digital ads is sharply retreating due to the trade war, eMarketer said in a report published earlier this week that somewhat conflicts with WARC’s assessment. Total digital spending in the U.S. is forecast to grow 9.5% YoY to $338.27 billion, per eMarketer, a revision two percentage points lower than earlier estimates.
Informa, which owns a controlling stake in Informa TechTarget, the publisher behind Marketing Dive, is also invested in WARC. Informa has no influence over Marketing Dive’s coverage."

3PLGuys, a third-party logistics provider specializing in Amazon FBA and eCommerce services, has announced the launch of comprehensive fulfillment solutions specifically designed for the rapidly expanding peptide market. The company's FDA-registered facilities and specialized infrastructure address the unique regulatory and logistical challenges facing peptide brands in a market projected to exceed $48 billion by 2030.
The peptide industry has experienced unprecedented growth across health, wellness, and biotechnology sectors, with applications ranging from anti-aging skincare to sports performance supplements and medical research. However, bringing peptides to market presents distinct challenges including regulatory compliance, temperature-controlled storage requirements, and complex shipping restrictions that standard fulfillment providers cannot adequately address.
3PLGuys has developed specialized capabilities to serve peptide brands, including batch and lot tracking systems for full traceability, temperature-controlled storage environments, and expertise in navigating regulations and international shipping requirements. The company's fulfillment centers feature contamination prevention protocols and secure handling procedures essential for maintaining peptide integrity throughout the supply chain.
""The peptide market represents one of the most dynamic sectors in eCommerce today, but many brands struggle with the regulatory complexities and specialized logistics requirements,"" said Mike Gevorkyan, spokesperson for 3PLGuys. ""Our infrastructure and compliance expertise allow peptide companies to scale confidently while maintaining the highest standards of product integrity and regulatory compliance.""
The company's peptide fulfillment services include seamless integration with major eCommerce platforms, including WooCommerce, Shopify, and Amazon, enabling automated fulfillment workflows. With facilities strategically located near the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, 3PLGuys provides two-day nationwide shipping capabilities critical for maintaining customer satisfaction in the competitive peptide market.
A recent case study demonstrates the impact of specialized peptide fulfillment services. One growing peptide company partnering with 3PLGuys achieved 100 percent batch traceability, reduced shipping times to two days nationwide, and successfully passed all compliance audits while scaling from hundreds to thousands of monthly orders."

US-listed American Depository Shares (ADRs) jumped 8% after CEO Eddie Wu said during a conference in China that a worldwide investment in artificial intelligence is estimated to reach $4 trillion over the next five years, and Alibaba must keep pace.
Wu said the company will expand on its February plan to devote over $53 billion toward building AI models and infrastructure over three years, though he did not specify how much higher the investment would go.
The company also unveiled Qwen3-Omni, an open-source model that can handle text, images, audio, and video as it pushes into generative AI.
Alibaba also announced a software deal with Nvidia (NVDA) to integrate the chip giant's AI development tools used for training for robotics and self-driving cars. The financials of the deal were not released.
The agreement marks a collaboration between the two companies at a time when US-Beijing trade relations remain fragile.
Alibaba and other Chinese tech companies have been working on developing AI chips to fill the void left by regulatory challenges concerning Nvidia's role in China as Beijing has made moves to wean itself off of its reliance on US chips.
During his talk at the conference in Hangzhou, China, Wu underscored the company's cloud ambition to establish itself as a top ""full-stack"" artificial intelligence provider, which includes its AI chip technology.
Alibaba's cloud unit, which services clients abroad including the US and Australia, will expand data center openings into Brazil, France, and the Netherlands.
The company's lean into AI comes as Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are set to invest a cumulative $364 billion in the technology in their respective 2025 fiscal years, up from their prior estimates of around $325 billion.
While Alibaba is often compared to Amazon for its outsized e-commerce business, its cloud computing business has been rapidly growing, helping send the stock up more than 110% year to date.
Cloud revenue grew 26% year over year during its April to June quarter, with Wu saying AI and cloud are Alibaba's engines of growth alongside e-commerce.
Ark Invest's Cathie Wood bought more than $16 billion in Alibaba stock for the first time since 2021 on Monday, with about half going into the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARK-F) and the other half into ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARK-W)."

The exemption request was first reported by Bloomberg. A Zoox spokesperson confirmed that it has submitted a petition for a “555 exemption” and continues to work closely with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through this new exemption process.
An NHTSA spokesperson told TechCrunch that Zoox applied for a temporary exemption from eight Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards applicable to its passenger car equipped with an automated driving system. The NHTSA is reviewing Zoox’s application and will publish a notice seeking public comment after the agency conducts its initial review.
The request follows two milestones that put Zoox closer to operating a commercial robotaxi service.
Earlier this month, Zoox launched a free robotaxi service that is open to the public in Las Vegas. And in August, the NHTSA gave Zoox an exemption to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads.
While the August exemption cleared up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox’s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, it only covered research and demonstrations on public roads. This latest application is separate and would broaden the scope and pave the way for Zoox to launch a commercial robotaxi service.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Now time for some of today's trending tickers. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma joins me for a look. We're going to talk Alibaba, maybe Amazon, throw in some Campbell's. We're going to start with Alibaba.
Chinese company planning to hike its AI spending. Uh, this one stock was surging. Uh, plans to invest more than 53 billion in AI, Brooke. That is above an original uh, bogey it put out there. CEO saying overall investment will accelerate to some 4 trillion globally over the next few years and Alibaba intends to be a part of that move. We're up almost 10% here.
Yeah, up almost 10%, jumped as much as that. And really, you say the word AI and it seems like investors go flocking. That's certainly what we saw play into today's Alibaba share. This is the highest level since October of 2021.
it did fall off from an all-time high of about $304. Right now, the stock is sitting around $177. But keep in mind, the optimism that's on the street right now. There are 46 buys and just three holds. And so certainly there's lots of momentum moving into this. Of course, Alibaba is often compared to Amazon here in the US. This major e-commerce business, this major cloud computing business. And we are hearing some expectations for the cloud revenue as well.
We know that the cloud revenue grew 26% year-over-year during its April to June quarter. Now we're saying that we could see even more growth there. So there is lots of optimism moving into that. Of course, we are seeing just a tiny bit of a sell-off here from you know, major tech players that we've also been hearing around investing in AI, like Google, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, but all in all, they are major, major investments going into AI,
something like $360 billion dollars of uh those Mag 7 leaning into the AI investment here. So Alibaba winning off of that back tail as well.
Alibaba up more than 100% in 2025. Did you miss your shot to get in, Brooke? Did you miss your chance? Analysts don't think so. 94% of them, 94% even after that move, they say Alibaba's still a buy here.
Yeah, lots of buys, lots of momentum. Also another Chinese stock seeing a win today, jd.com.
Yeah, there you go. All right, turning now to Amazon. That stock is getting upgrade over at Wells Fargo. Uh so this one, Wells Fargo says, you know what, we're going to take this one to overweight. So they're fans. See AWS achieving 22% revenue growth in 26. Previously thought it would be more like 19%, it looks like. Its unit share losses, they say peak in 25, see improvement in 26. Target goes to 280.
Yeah, and another factor here is they did they are seeking out wider clearance for their driverless vehicle business that Zoox. So we're seeing, I liked what the guest previous, Horley Torres had said that we're seeing some profit taking rather than selling today and that's why maybe why you see Amazon just roughly flat today. But this excitement around Amazon playing into this driverless vehicle market. They are expecting that they're preparing for this larger deployment of their driverless vehicles, as many as 2,500 vehicles.
We saw Tesla do really well when they announced investments in the driverless vehicle operations. Also Google has Waymo, but also similar to what we just said about Alibaba is really that cloud computing business or rather AWS, what sort of growth we could see there and the momentum that we could see on the back end, achieving something like 22% revenue growth in 2026. Uh and so really this this strong conviction around that AWS business. It feels like Amazon really does it all these days. So certainly some puts and takes there.
All right, lastly, BNP Paribas warning of a risk coming for the Campbell's company. And what is that risk, Brooke? Well, they call out losing market share due to chunky price increases in its ready-to-serve soup portfolio. The price increases, they say they've outpaced those taken by rivals that has seen volume and dollar sales declines worsen over the past eight weeks. What do you think?
Yeah, there's been a bit of hesitation on Campbell's right now. Of course, they have that major portfolio. They have everything from Cape Cod chips to soups. It's also soup season, did you know that?
I did not know that.
Autumn to winter. So happy soup season, Josh.
It does feel chilly. Yeah.
So they're really trying to lean into what exactly this can be and this is their biggest momentum moment. Uh we know that soup season accounts for something like two/thirds of of Campbell's sales. And so there's been some hesitation like I said before. There's only three buys, 15 holds, four sells on the street. The average price target right now is sitting around $35. Right now it's $33, so not really much momentum there. And really just trying to understand how does Campbell's play in when they have everything from Cape Cod chips to these soup business?
It's a good chip. It's a really good chip.
I do love Cape Cod chips. I do love them as well. But there's also some question, you know, with all this under their portfolio. We've seen so much big breakup in food and not necessarily this analyst from BNP mentioning this, but other sources that I've spoken to on the street saying, could we see a breakup come from Campbell's? Are they next? Given that they have so much on their business. They have that recent acquisition of even the sauce business, Rao's, and so just trying to understand where Campbell's plays and the consumer demand that we see right now in terms of pricing power that this company might have.
Stock is down about 20% this year, most on the street at a hold on this one. Average target looks to be 35.
Yeah.
Brooke, thank you. Appreciate it."

Sep 23 - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ticked higher in premarket trading Wednesday, rising 1.5%, after Wells Fargo shifted its stance on the stock to Overweight from Equal Weight. The firm pointed to growing confidence in Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue momentum as the key driver behind the upgrade.
Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski highlighted Project Rainier, a dedicated AWS data center being built in Indiana for Anthropic's compute needs. The facility, expected to come online in January 2026, could deliver up to 2.2 gigawatts of capacity. At full scale, the project may generate around $14 billion in annual AWS revenue, according to the analysts.
The firm lifted its AWS revenue growth outlook, raising its 2026 forecast by 3% and its 2027 estimate by 7%. That translates into projected growth of 22% year-over-year in 2026, compared with Wall Street's current expectation of 18%.
Still, Wells Fargo cautioned that the heavy upfront infrastructure costs tied to Project Rainier will likely pressure AWS margins by about 50 basis points in 2026. Even so, the firm believes long-term revenue expansion will outweigh near-term margin headwinds.
Is AMZN Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 68 analysts, the average target price for Amazon.com Inc is $263.47 with a high estimate of $306.00 and a low estimate of $206.00. The average target implies a upside of +19.38% from the current price of $220.71.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Amazon.com Inc in one year is $210.96, suggesting a downside of -4.42% from the current price of $220.71."

Intel shares have been on a tear over the past month, after the U.S. government, SoftBank, and then Nvidia all invested in the chipmaker, giving it much-needed votes of confidence as it ramps up its all-important 18A node.
Then today, the company got even better news from another outside party in the form of Micron, which announced its fourth-quarter earnings last night.
Micron lifts guidance for PCs and traditional servers
On its earnings call last night, Micron management lifted guidance for certain end markets that are of utmost importance to Intel: personal computers (PCs) and traditional servers.
Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the traditional-server market had ""strengthened significantly,"" with Micron now predicting growth in the mid-single digits for 2025 after previously forecasting flat unit growth, which is a significant change.
Intel has been criticized for missing out on the AI server market for graphics processing units, which is still going like gangbusters, as expected. But Intel is still a strong leader in enterprise traditional servers, which is the sub-segment Mehrotra described here.
It appears that business may be waking up after a few down years. About a year ago, Intel partnered with Amazon to make a custom Xeon central processing unit (CPU) for Amazon's agentic AI and inference ambitions. That partnership could see a lot of growth in the third and fourth quarters as a result.
Micron also lifted its outlook for PCs, which make up Intel's largest segment and where it still has about 76% market share of x86-based PCs. Mehrotra said that the Windows 10 end-of-life, which is occurring in October, as well as the adoption of AI PCs, are spurring a better-than-expected outlook for the PC market in 2025. Micron now sees this market up in the mid-single digits, compared with low single digits previously.
Stronger end markets could be Intel's bridge to better times
The fourth quarter will see the first sales of Intel's Panther Lake CPU for the PC market, and will be the company's first chip produced on its 18A node. That node is the culmination of the company's ""five nodes in four years"" strategy announced in 2021, in which management believed its technology would become competitive with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing once again.
So if Intel can sell Panther Lake CPUs into a stronger PC market and revenue comes in higher than expected, that will give the company more of a financial bridge to 18A high-volume manufacturing next year. And if the company is stronger financially, it can afford to invest in expanding 18A, and potentially attract more third-party foundry customers for both 18A and the upcoming 14A node, which is scheduled for 2028."

Handovers will start Oct. 1 and run through Jan. 1.
RELATED: L’Oréal USA Names David Greenberg Chairman and Alexis Perakis-Valat CEO
Fabrice Megarbane is being appointed president of the Consumer Products Division, following Perakis-Valat’s departure. Megarbane, currently the group’s chief global growth officer since January 2024, has spent the last 24 years working at the company. Among his leadership roles has been serving as CEO of L’Oréal China and president of the company’s North Asia Zone.
As chief global growth officer, Megarbane has helped shape L’Oréal’s future path. “In this critical function, he has brilliantly strategized growth, and fostered a more integrated, multizone approach across the group, including driving significant e-commerce expansion with key platforms like Amazon and TikTok,” the company said in a statement.
“He has also spearheaded several of the group’s key transformation projects, helping drive agility, optimize the group’s ways of working and ensure the company is ‘future fit,’” L’Oréal said.
While at L’Oréal China, he lassoed record market share and doubled sales. “He also positioned the region at the forefront of digital and data excellence, mastering the complexities of modern consumer engagement, and ensured all industrial sites achieved carbon neutrality by 2022.
“Fabrice’s unique blend of strategic insight, deep market knowledge and exceptional leadership qualities, proven during his transformative tenure in China and most recently as chief global growth officer, makes him the idea choice to lead our Consumer Products Division,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L’Oréal, in the statement. “I am confident that he will continue to drive innovation, accelerate growth and inspire our teams in this new chapter.”
Vianney Derville is succeeding Megarbane as chief growth officer. He most recently has served as president of Europe for the group.
L’Oréal called Derville “a distinguished leader renowned for orchestrating profound transformations, driving exceptional growth and fostering strategic market leadership.”
His is a new global role in which he is meant to leverage his in-market experience, strategic vision and ability to inspire teams to accelerate L’Oréal’s growth, the company added.
Derville was appointed to his role overseeing Europe in 2016, after jobs in Japan, Spain, France and the U.S. Sales in Europe last year reached more than 11.4 billion euros, and the continent was the biggest contributor to the company’s growth overall.
“The Europe zone has also consistently gained market share and demonstrated strong online dominance,” L’Oréal said.
Derville has also been credited with bolstering public affairs within Europe, which has a complicated regulatory terrain.
“Vianney’s deep understanding of our markets, his proven track record of driving significant growth and transformation, coupled with his exceptional ability to unite and inspire teams make him the perfect choice to be our new chief growth officer,” Hieronimus said. “I look forward to working with him closely as we shape L’Oréal’s future growth trajectory, continue the ‘One L’Oreal’ transformation project leveraging AI and write the next chapter of the group’s history.”
Taking the role of president of Europe is Emmanuel Goulin, who is currently president of travel retail. The executive has been credited with navigating the post-COVID-19 world. He spearheaded the “beauty experience” in travel retail, which refocused L’Oréal’s activities in airports around the traveler’s journey. Goulin transformed the organization and optimized the company’s operational footprint in the channel.
Goulin started at L’Oréal 25 years ago. He has held positions in Japan, Hong Kong, the U.K. and France. The executive returned to Europe in 2022, taking the role of general manager of L’Oréal Italy, where he instigated double-digit growth and helped forge the group’s sustainable development.
“Emmanuel has a deep understanding of the European landscape, forged through leadership roles in three of its key markets,” Hieronimus said. “This, together with his great track record of delivering major business and transformational impact, positions him as the ideal leader to drive innovation, accelerate growth and inspire our teams in our biggest region.”
Eva Yu is being named president of travel retail, and is to join L’Oréal’s extended executive committee. Currently president and managing director of L’Oréal Hong Kong, she will be based in both Paris and Sinagapore.
“Eva has led the subsidiary through an extraordinary evolution, resulting in a significant increase in market share, in addition to widespread recognition for its retail excellence,” L’Oréal said.
Yu started at the company in 2000 as brand manager for Biotherm in Hong Kong, where it became among the top brands market-wide. In 2011, she became the first Asian and first woman appointed managing director of travel retail in APAC, where she helmed L’Oréal’s duty-free business in 27 markets.
“Eva’s remarkable career, marked by her vision, and incredible ability to foster unity and harmonize efforts across different functions and markets, makes her an outstanding leader,” Hieronimus said.
“Her deep understanding of the Asian market and her proven track record in driving both business transformation and people development, positions her as the ideal choice to lead our strategic travel retail business into its next chapter of growth and innovation,” he said."

(Reuters) -AI startup Modular said on Wednesday it raised $250 million in a funding round valuing it at $1.6 billion, as it aims to challenge Nvidia's software stranglehold on the AI computing market.
The funding, which nearly tripled the company's valuation from two years ago, was led by U.S. Innovative Technology fund. DFJ Growth and all existing investors, including GV, General Catalyst and Greylock also joined the round.
Founded in 2022 by veteran engineers at Apple and Google, Modular's platform is designed to allow developers to run their AI applications across a variety of computer chips without having to rewrite code for each one. It now serves cloud providers such as Oracle and Amazon, as well as chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.
Nvidia controls over 80% of the high-end AI chip market, partly thanks to its proprietary CUDA software, which locks over 4 million global developers into its ecosystem.
Modular says it has adopted what it calls a ""Switzerland"" strategy to be a neutral software layer.
Chris Lattner, co-founder and CEO of Modular, said the goal is not to defeat the market leader. ""What we're focused on is not like pushing down Nvidia or crushing them. It's more about enabling a level playing field so that other people can compete,"" he said.
It plans to sell the software directly to enterprises on a consumption basis and through revenue-sharing partnerships with cloud providers.
The company's strategy has attracted investors betting on a multi-vendor future for AI hardware. Sam Fort, partner at DFJ Growth, compared Modular to ""VMware for the AI era"", which supported companies to work across CPUs.
""Modular is trying to create the AI hypervisor that will allow you to port workloads across different vendors,"" Fort said.
The company, with about 130 employees, plans to use the new capital to expand its engineering and go-to-market team. The funds will also help the company expand from its current focus on AI inference into the AI training market.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.
Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Freeport Macran, Rivian and Homebuilders.
First up, Freeport. Those shares are falling as the company declares force majore at its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia.
This comes after a September 8th accident at its facility that killed two workers. Production in the Grasberg Minerals district had been halted following the event as teams are working around the clock to clear mud and debris.
A prolonged disruption at the copper mine, which is the second largest for the metal in the world, is likely to boost copper prices.
Next up Rivian, US Auto safety regulators opened an investigation into the company over issues with the seat belts in its electric delivery vans.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it is aware of six reports of potential failures with the seat belt anchorage system for the driver's seat in Rivian's Vans.
Rivian said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg that its vehicles meet or exceed all applicable safety requirements and it will cooperate with the investigation.
The automaker produces delivery vans in large numbers for e-commerce giant Amazon.
And finally, home builders, they're getting a boost today after US new home sales unexpectedly jumped by over 20% in August.
That marks the fastest pace of growth since early 2022. Sales of new single family homes increased by 800,000 at an annualized rate with the estimate looking for 650,000.
The data suggests that US home builders are successfully luring buyers off the sidelines with aggressive sales incentives.

The initiative aims to combine these capabilities and SAP’s enterprise expertise with AWS’s infrastructure and operations to address growing digital sovereignty demands across Europe.

This will give organizations more choice in how they meet their sovereignty requirements while leveraging best-in-class cloud technologies.”

With SAP Sovereign Cloud already live on AWS in markets including Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Canada, and India, its arrival in Europe marks an essential step in expanding secure, sovereignty-focused cloud options for customers in the region.
This service is designed to help organisations innovate securely, meet local regulatory requirements, and scale according to their needs.
SAP Sovereign Cloud on AWS European Sovereign Cloud will launch with SAP BTP and SAP Cloud ERP, enabling secure innovation, compliance, and scalable operations.
The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will operate independently from existing AWS Regions, with no reliance on non-EU infrastructure.

Popular influencer Jessica Roderick has received a lot of support from her followers for her parenting rule that her 12- and 14-year-old children must pay for their personal purchases.
While applying makeup in a TikTok video, Roderick explains that while she covers all family necessities, her two oldest kids are responsible for their wants, such as ordering food from DoorDash and buying things from their Amazon wish lists.
""They want their own DoorDash, they're gonna be the ones that are paying for it,"" said Roderick, who gives her kids a weekly allowance and pays them for appearing in her social media posts. ""My daughter has even DoorDashed herself a jar of pickles.""

TikTok users agree, saying it's a great way to teach financial responsibility and help prepare her kids for the future.
""I honestly think you have a brilliant balance,"" TikTok user Callie Witts wrote. ""I started giving my daughter her allowance for clothes and toiletries now after watching your videos. I think it's a brilliant way to teach them about money.""
Christina Burns29 said the strategy will help her kids become more independent. ""They are learning to treat money with respect. They are learning to budget, be responsible, and this will hopefully stop them getting into financial trouble in the future,"" she wrote. ""Excellent parenting.""
Several kids commented that their parents follow the same strategy.

Roderick's video received overwhelming support for her parenting style, but there's still a long-standing debate about how best to teach children about money.

Research suggests that an authoritative parenting style, which combines boundaries with communication, is often most effective in helping children develop solid financial habits, according to financial planning firm PringTurner."

The statement said: ""We’ve made the difficult decision to launch a consultation with employees regarding the proposed closure of our Amazon Fresh UK stores, following a thorough evaluation of business operations and the very substantial growth opportunities in online delivery.
""In case of closure, our goal is to offer redeployment opportunities to as many affected employees as possible.""

Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is stepping into a high-stakes courtroom battle that could reshape the future of its Prime subscription business. The Federal Trade Commission has accused the company of using deceptive tactics to push consumers into Prime and then making it unnecessarily complicated to cancel. The case, now unfolding in Seattle before a nine-member jury, is expected to last about four weeks and could expose Amazon to billions in penalties and refunds. Analysts note that with Prime serving as one of Amazon's most critical loyalty engines, the outcome could carry lasting implications for both growth and profitability.
At the center of the FTC's case are claims that Amazon designed a cancellation process so cumbersome it was internally referred to as the Iliad. Nearly 40 million customers may have been impacted, and internal memos dating back to 2017 flagged the problem as an unspoken cancer inside the company. The FTC alleges that Senior Vice Presidents Neil Lindsay and Russell Grandinetti, along with Vice President Jamil Ghani, knowingly rejected proposals to simplify the system to protect revenue. Amazon has pushed back, arguing that its enrollment process is transparent, customers give consent before being billed, and cancellation tools are already straightforward.
Judge John Chun has already ruled that two of the executives are liable and that Amazon failed to disclose Prime's terms adequately, adding pressure ahead of trial. Under the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act, penalties could exceed $53,000 for each violation, a figure that analysts warn could lead to multi-billion-dollar exposure. Some see settlement as the likelier path if jurors lean toward the FTC, though Amazon may still argue it lacked clear regulatory guidance. With Prime priced at $139 a year and functioning as the cornerstone of customer retention, investors are watching closely for signs of whether this trial could alter the economics of one of Amazon's most profitable franchises."

Analysts led by Ken Gawrelski said the recent wave of compute contracts, including nearly $320 billion tied to OpenAI, shows “the cloud market opportunity [is] much larger than forecast.”
They now project the industry will expand to $873 billion by 2029, up from $230 billion in 2024, representing a 31% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
While Oracle and new entrants such as CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) are expected to gain share, analysts argued that the overall market expansion leaves more revenue for incumbents. Wells Fargo estimates Oracle’s share could rise to 15% by 2029 from 4% in 2024.”
The bank’s upgrade of Amazon comes as Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) share losses are seen peaking in 2025 before stabilizing, aided by Project Rainier, a new data center campus for Anthropic in Indiana.
Phase one is set to come online in January 2026 and could contribute about $14 billion in annual AWS revenue at full capacity.
Wells Fargo lifted its 2026 AWS revenue growth estimate to 22% year-on-year, compared with consensus of 18%. It also raised its price target on Amazon to $280 from $245.
Google Cloud was also highlighted for showing momentum, supported by growing TPU adoption and its Gemini AI platform.
Wells Fargo raised its 2027 and 2028 GCP revenue estimates by 3% and 6%, respectively. The analysts said that “Gemini’s success, recently topping iOS app store rankings, serves as a strong reference point for TPUs”.
For Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the team cited large third-party compute deals worth more than $25 billion as evidence of persistent demand and supply shortages.
They raised 2026 and 2027 Azure revenue forecasts by 1% and 3%, highlighting new capacity from partners such as Nebius and Nscale beginning in late 2025.
Overall, while competitive shifts remain important, “stronger cloud market growth will result in more revenue dollars for all participants,” the analysts said.

Amazon.com Investment Narrative Recap
To own Amazon.com, you need to believe that the company can continue to drive long-term growth by expanding beyond e-commerce and leveraging its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform to capture a greater share of global IT and enterprise digital transformation. The announced AWS partnership with SAP for the European Sovereign Cloud highlights Amazon’s efforts to address regulatory and security demands for cloud customers, but this is not expected to materially impact the biggest short-term catalyst: AI-driven growth in AWS. The largest risk remains intensified regulatory scrutiny, particularly legal and compliance challenges, which could disrupt business momentum if not managed carefully.
Elsewhere, Amazon’s recent expansion of its Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) to enable third-party logistics for major marketplaces like SHEIN, Shopify, and Walmart is also worth noting. While not directly tied to the European cloud move, it illustrates Amazon’s broader push to simplify operations and capture additional market share through logistics innovation, a key driver behind its pursuit of high-margin revenue streams outside retail.
However, investors should be aware that in contrast to AWS’s growth story, the evolving regulatory environment presents serious risks to...

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-24T00:15:00,"Prediction: This AI Stock Will Join Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in the $3 Trillion Club by 2026",Amazon will benefit big time from data center spending.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a12bc481f5741bc9d5a283b9ded4452763f9f17663dca2ec553bcca04b15b15d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/prediction-this-ai-stock-will-join-nvidia-microsof/,fool.com,200,,"All everyone wants to talk about is Nvidia. The computer chip company is now the largest stock in the world by market capitalization, quickly joining the $3 trillion club along with Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Investors are betting with their wallets that the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power will drive huge earnings growth for the likes of Nvidia.
They are forgetting one company that will be an underrated beneficiary of AI growth: Amazon (AMZN -0.49%). The company has a cloud and computer chip deal with start-up Anthropic, as well as numerous ways to benefit from AI in its media business.
At a market cap of $2.5 trillion today, I think it is an easy hurdle for Amazon to surpass a $3 trillion market cap by sometime in 2026, if not by the end of this year.
Here's why.
AWS and Anthropic
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the original cloud computing juggernaut. In the age of AI, the market is feeling like it is left behind. Alphabet has its own AI infrastructure to build with Google Cloud, while Microsoft won a huge partnership with OpenAI to drive growth for its cloud business. Now, even Oracle is winning contracts from OpenAI in a reported $300 billion deal.
While it would have been nice to see AWS win some of these deals, the division is much more focused on generating positive return on investment than other players, which is likely why Oracle won the recent deal from OpenAI.
Anthropic is AWS' bet as an AI partner, and it is currently flying under the radar. Anthropic is an AI software provider focused on the enterprise and coding markets. Its revenue is exploding higher, growing from annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 billion at the start of this year to $5 billion as of its latest update. AWS is Anthropic's key cloud partner, where it plans to spend billions of dollars to train and run its AI systems. The partnership is so deep that Anthropic is now working with Amazon to build custom computer chips to compete with Nvidia.
Revenue at AWS grew 17% year over year last quarter to an ARR topping $123 billion, although it is growing slower than competition like Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. However, with Anthropic hitting a growth inflection, AWS' revenue should start to accelerate in the coming quarters. With fat operating margins of 37% over the last 12 months, AWS can be a strong contributor to Amazon's consolidated earnings growth through the next few years.
Bringing AI to e-commerce
Not only will AWS earnings benefit from AI, so too will Amazon's e-commerce and media business. Specifically, it will help with its fast-growing advertising segment. Advertising revenue is currently growing 22% year over year and likely has fantastic profit margins.
This week, Amazon released a new agentic AI tool for building advertisements. In the creative studio, even small businesses can now build robust advertisements that will go on the Amazon marketplace, Prime Video, and other Amazon partner platforms. This will greatly expand the addressable market for Amazon's advertising services. With so many small businesses around the world selling on the platform, Amazon is the perfect advertising platform that can connect sellers to willing buyers of its products.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Amazon can deploy AI for robotics, delivery systems, and customer search to improve the value proposition and efficiency of its e-commerce ecosystem. Altogether, it should help retail expand its profitability, which still has a lot of room to grow with just 7.5% profit margins over the last 12 months.
Why Amazon will join the $3 trillion club
Amazon's market cap will surpass $3 trillion shortly because of the huge potential for earnings growth in the next few quarters. The company's EBIT -- earnings before interest income and taxes -- shot up to $77 billion in the last 12 months on margin expansion. As revenue growth at AWS accelerates and margins keep expanding in North American retail due to advertising, investors should see trailing-12-month EBIT cross $100 billion at some point in 2026.
For a high-quality business like Amazon, a multiple of 30 times its trailing EBIT is entirely reasonable. It actually trades at a higher multiple than that right now. Thirty times EBIT on $100 billion in earnings is a $3 trillion market cap. That is the math behind my Amazon prediction, and why I think it is now the best AI stock to add to your portfolio today."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-24T00:05:00,6 Stocks Billionaires -- Such as Warren Buffett and Bill Ackman -- Recently Bought -- Including UnitedHealth and Amazon.com,It can't hurt to see where the smart money is going.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bb5c0f059fb9ecf48cb25a93ec348d8cb37356f8dc5405354071a270984ef2b7,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/6-stocks-billionaires-such-as-warren-buffett-and-b/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/6-stocks-billionaires-such-as-warren-buffett-and-b/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/23/6-stocks-billionaires-such-as-warren-buffett-and-b/,fool.com,200,,"It's not cool to peek over the shoulder of the smartest kid in your class to see what answer she gave for question No. 7 on a test. In the same spirit, you might peek to see what some of the richest investors have been buying -- and that's far less problematic. It's natural, in fact, to wonder where the supposed smart money is going.
Here, then, are some relatively recent purchases made by some billionaires. I found them by checking their most recent 13F filings, which reveal purchases and sales.
1. Warren Buffett
Let's start with the most well-known of this bunch, Warren Buffett, who's famous for, among other things, growing the value of his company, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.22%) (BRK.B -0.25%), by an annual average of around 20% for a whopping 60 years. In recent times, Berkshire's investment decisions have occasionally come from his investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler, and Todd Combs.
As I write this, the latest 13F for Berkshire Hathaway reveals that the two biggest purchases in the quarter ending June 30 were UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.30%) and Nucor (NUE -0.87%).
UnitedHealth has seen its shares drop in the wake of multiple Department of Justice investigations and misconduct allegations (yikes!) -- not to mention the assassination of its CEO last year. Buffett is known for capitalizing on opportunities, and he or his lieutenants clearly viewed the market reaction as overreaction. Indeed, UnitedHealth has been offering promising news lately, including meeting its Medicare Advantage plan enrollment targets.
Nucor, meanwhile, is a low-cost steelmaker, and a really big one at that. It's also been strategically savvy, as when it started producing building parts for data centers. Steel is a cyclical business, trending up and down depending on the economy, and Nucor is recently at a low point, offering a nice entry point for long-term believers.
Both UnitedHealth and Nucor offer dividends, too -- recently yielding 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively.
2. Bill Ackman
Then there's hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, of Pershing Square Capital Management. In the same quarter, his biggest purchases by value were Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) and Google parent Alphabet. It's not hard to see why anyone might invest in either of those. (It's worth noting that Ackman is famous for running a concentrated stock portfolio, with only 12 holdings in his fund, which was valued at $13.7 billion in late June.)
Amazon has multiple irons in the fire, most notably its massive marketplace and its dominant Amazon Web Services (AWS). Despite its huge size, recently valued at $2.5 trillion, it's still growing at a respectable clip, posting second-quarter results that featured net sales up 13% year over year.
CEO Andy Jassy noted: ""Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out as we've expanded Alexa+ to millions of customers, continue to see our shopping agent used by many millions of customers, launched AI models like DeepFleet that optimize productivity paths for our 1M+ robots, ... and released Bedrock AgentCore to enable [AI] agents to be operated securely and scalably.""
Speaking of AI, Ackman recently had 45% of his portfolio in three AI stocks, and Alphabet is one of them. Alphabet's Google search is an 800-lb. gorilla, but many had wondered if AI would threaten its dominance. Instead, the company has been using AI as a tailwind, with search revenue growth actually accelerating recently.
3. Stanley Druckenmiller
Less well-known, Stanley Druckenmiller heads the Duquesne Family Office, which was valued at $4.1 billion mid-year. The fund's top purchases by value in the second quarter were Entegris (ENTG 4.37%) and Microsoft (MSFT 0.01%).
Microsoft's growth potential is clear, as it encompasses the widely used Office productivity software, its Azure cloud computing platform, the popular Xbox gaming platform, and the Windows operating system, among other assets. It's another massive tech company that's somehow still growing rapidly, with its fourth-quarter revenue up 18% year over year and net income up 24%. It's another heavy investor in AI.
Entegris is less well known, but it's a critical support company for the semiconductor industry, offering ""purification solutions and advanced materials."" Druckenmiller is investing in a ""pick-and-shovel"" manner with this stock, as it's an adjunct to the fast-growing chip industry, with its offering critical for chip makers.
These are just some of the investments that some financial bigshots made recently. If you search for 13F filings now and then, you'll find plenty more. Of course, always do your own digging into any portfolio candidate before buying."

Earlier, London ended the day flat and Paris and Frankfurt added barely half of one percent as investors digested purchasing managers' index (PMI) data -- a closely watched gauge of economic health.
The index showed eurozone business activity hit a 16-month high in September, partly driven by solid growth in Germany, while France weighed on performance.
Britain's reading came in below expectations, suggesting the economy is losing momentum, analysts noted, as inflation fears linger.
With trade subdued by a holiday in Japan and an approaching typhoon in Hong Kong, Asian markets mostly drifted as Hong Kong and Shanghai both closed lower.
Taipei jumped more than one percent, with chip titan TSMC soaring over three percent as it tracked US counterpart Nvidia, which announced a $100-billion investment in OpenAI for next-generation artificial intelligence.

Nvidia on Monday said it will invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI to help the ChatGPT maker support a massive build-out of data centers equipped with Nvidia’s chips — a deal that some analysts say raises questions about whether Nvidia is investing heavily to prop up the market and keep companies spending on its products.
“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note after the deal was announced.
Those concerns have followed Nvidia, to varying degrees, for much of the AI boom. The chipmaker participated in more than 50 different venture investment deals for AI companies in 2024, and is on pace to top that number this year, according to data from PitchBook. Some of these companies, which include AI model makers and cloud providers, then use that capital to buy Nvidia’s expensive graphics processing units.
But the size of the OpenAI investment “appears to dwarf all the others,” Rasgon said. The deal will “likely fuel these worries much hotter than what we have seen previously, and (perhaps justifiably) raise concerns over the rationale behind the action,” Rasgon wrote. Nvidia has said the investment in OpenAI will not be used for any “direct purchases” of Nvidia products, Rasgon added.
Nvidia and OpenAI said Monday that some details of the agreement are still being hammered out. But OpenAI plans to lease rather than buy the AI processors from Nvidia, according to executives involved in the effort. They also said it’s difficult to predict the rate at which AI chips depreciate.
Other large tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., have also made strategic investments in top AI startups intended to drive business to their cloud computing offerings. But Nvidia occupies a unique spot in the AI ecosystem by dominating the market for advanced chips that are essential for training cutting-edge AI models. As a result, the company has arguably been the single biggest beneficiary of the AI fervor to date."

O'Kelly also added that having a self-imposed wealth cap helps to keep him centered. ""We never wanted to have so much money we didn't have to make choices. It's meant that we can't be completely ridiculous about our life,"" said O'Kelly. ""We have an amazing life, we can do almost everything we want.

AppNexus is a cloud-based app that allows users to create fully integrated ad campaigns across mobile and desktop devices. O'Kelly's company platform functioned so well that AT&T (NYSE:T) acquired it in 2018.
O'Kelly told Fortune he wanted to limit the impact that coming into such a large amount of money would have on not just his own life, but also on his children's. He said he had long discussions with his wife to figure out how much money they would need for themselves.

""I don't believe in billionaires. I think it's just ridiculous,"" O'Kelly said.

He said that they decided to keep $100 million and give the rest of the money to charities and causes they believed in.
Keeping himself centered wasn't O'Kelly's only motivation. He was also thinking about how having such a large sum of money might affect his children. He said he didn't want them to become spoiled and admitted to Fortune that he still struggles to strike the right balance between privilege and tough love.

Companies that operate AI infrastructure like Amazon and Alphabet are racing to build new data centers that are powered by renewable energy. The main challenge isn't in building new data centers, but in scaling up the required amount of renewable energy.
This is where hydrogen fuel comes into play. Hydrogen fuel has long been a promising power source for the renewable economy. But high costs have prevented the technology from being adopted at mass scale. The massive buildout of infrastructure to enable the AI revolution could change all of that. Does that make Plug Power stock a buy? You might be surprised by the answer.
Artificial intelligence is creating a huge surge in power demand
The world's energy systems are about to be transformed thanks to a huge surge in demand for AI technologies, a surge that is expected to be sustained for decades to come. Energy use by data centers -- critical infrastructure that is largely powering the AI revolution -- has historically grown by 12% or more annually. The sharp uptake in AI demand more recently should see that growth rate rise even higher.
Not only will we see a sharp increase in power demand, but the type of power that will be demanded is expected to change. That's because many technology companies have internal mandates that require high levels of renewable energy. The existing grid isn't transitioning to renewable energy fast enough, causing some companies to build out their own energy supplies. Google, for example, is funding the development of three new nuclear sites in the United States to maintain its position as a carbon neutral business.
According to data from the International Energy Agency, electricity demand from data centers will more than quadruple by 2030. The organization believes that this transition has the ""potential to transform how the energy sector works."" In other words, expect major shifts in how energy is created, stored, and used in the future. This will include a massive build-out in renewable energy, but also a shift toward private energy generation versus simply tapping into the grid. Companies like Google will create energy generation facilities designed mostly for its own use.
Plug Power has already recognized the opportunity to supply the AI industry with localized, renewable energy. Companies may build out their own hydrogen solutions, but grid operators can also turn to hydrogen in order to compensate for highly variable demand. The company said in a blog post:
As AI demand grows, power grids are struggling to keep up. Hydrogen steps in to help when the grid is under pressure. Hydrogen production systems can quickly adjust how much energy they make based on real-time needs. This helps reduce power costs and prevent blackouts.""
For years, the primary issue with hydrogen adoption has been cost competitiveness. But much of hydrogen's high costs come from a lack of scale. Tech giants armed with big budgets could change all of that. After all, nuclear power in the U.S. was long deemed ""dead"" due to the related exorbitant costs. The rise of AI could finally tip the scales for the world's hydrogen buildout.
Is Plug Power stock a buy due to rising demand for AI?
Expect big things when it comes to hydrogen's potential to power the AI revolution. Does that make Plug Power stock a buy? Surprisingly, no.
The challenge with Plug Power stock today isn't necessarily the viability of hydrogen power -- though there are still legitimate questions related to that issue as well. Instead, at least from an investor's perspective, the problem is the company's mounting losses.
In recent years, Plug Power has been posting net losses of around $200 million to $300 million per quarter. That's more than 10% of the company's entire market cap every 90 days. To compensate, the company has turned to government loans and share dilution. Over the past three years, for example, the company's total share count has nearly doubled.
While the AI revolution shows promise for hydrogen power over the long term, heavy share dilution means that Plug Power shareholders today will see their gains diluted heavily, possibly leading to minimal or even negative gains over the long haul. Additionally, there are concerns that Plug Power's technology -- which focuses on proton exchange membrane fuel cells over more efficient and adaptable solid oxide fuel cells -- isn't even the best fit for AI applications. So while hydrogen has the potential to power part of the AI revolution, Plug Power stock in particular still isn't a buy for wise investors."

In the past decade, the consumer electronics giant's shares are up 723% (as of Sept. 17), while the e-commerce juggernaut's shares have climbed an even better 777%.
These are two of the most valuable enterprises on Earth. But which of these dominant tech stocks is the best one to buy today?
Apple's strong brand supports huge profits
Apple is a phenomenal company. I don't think there are many people who would argue with that statement. There are three key reasons why investors should think this way.
The first reason Apple is a great business is because of its powerful brand, which resonates so well with consumers across the globe. Apple's products and services are extremely popular and user-friendly, supported by the company's successful history of innovation that includes adding new features and devices to the mix. This also aids ongoing pricing power.
Apple's ability to seamlessly blend hardware and software is what creates its robust ecosystem. This is another reason to appreciate the business. The ecosystem is what essentially locks users in, discouraging them from switching to competing products and services. This helps Apple generate recurring revenue from its suite of services.
Apple doesn't struggle when it comes to profitability. It generated net income of $23.4 billion just in the last quarter (Q3 2025 ended June 28). And in the past decade, the company's net profit margin has averaged a superb 23%. This gives the company the financial horsepower to return lots of capital to shareholders, mainly through stock buybacks that totaled $21 billion just in the last fiscal quarter. Apple's financial strength is a third reason investors will like this business.
AWS is Amazon's most promising segment
Amazon is also a high-quality business. I believe there are also three reasons that support this perspective.
For starters, Amazon operates in multiple growth markets. It not only benefits from the popularity of online shopping, the area that it's a dominant player in, but it's also involved in streaming entertainment and digital advertising. Many investors might not realize that Amazon generated $15.7 billion just in ad revenue in Q2, up 22% year over year. This introduces a high-margin revenue stream.
Another growth engine, which is another reason to admire this business, is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cloud computing has been a major growth industry in the past decade, and it should continue going forward. This is especially true as companies not only move IT spending off-premises but start to invest significant resources into developing artificial intelligence. AWS generated more than half of Amazon's entire operating income last quarter, a share that will probably rise in the future.
The third reason why Amazon is a wonderful business is because it's proving that it can scale up in a profitable manner. Credit goes to running the business with a focus on operational efficiencies, which is exactly what CEO Andy Jassy has done in recent years. Amazon's Q2 net income was 250% higher than in the same period five years ago.
The best opportunity
Apple and Amazon are two of the best businesses on the face of the planet. Companies obviously can't get their market caps measured in the trillions of dollars without doing some things right. But which is the better stock to buy right now?
I believe that title goes to Amazon. It has better growth prospects, as it operates in numerous industries that have meaningful expansionary potential over the long term. Slower growth, particularly in the retail operations, can be offset by the gains with AWS and digital advertising. Amazon might also enter new markets in the future.
Plus, its valuation is reasonable at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30.1. Amazon is positioned better to produce a higher return over the next five years."

Companies are rushing to ensure thousands of employees around the globe do not trigger hefty new immigration fees after Washington announced sweeping changes to the H-1B foreign worker visa relied on by US tech groups.
US President Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 application fee for the visa, but did not clarify whether the change would apply to existing H-1B holders.
Companies including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) issued emergency guidance to employees, urging H-1B holders not to leave the country until the new rules were clarified. They also asked staff currently overseas to return to the US before the measures came into force on Sunday.
The two technology giants had more than 15,000 H-1B visas approved in the most recent fiscal year, according to the US Department of Homeland Security.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.
JPMorgan (JPM), the largest US bank by assets, also advised its staff on H-1B visas not to travel outside the US for now, according to a person familiar with the matter. JPMorgan declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a memo to employees holding the visas that they should be “exercising caution around international travel”.
Fragomen, an immigration law firm that processes many H-1B visas, advised its clients with approved H-1B petitions or visas to return to the US by Sunday.
The White House on Saturday sought to clarify the scope of the changes amid the confusion.
Press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the one-off fee would apply only to new applicants, not current H-1B holders or those renewing their visa. She added that the new fees would only kick-in in the next cycle.
“Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter,” she wrote on X.
“H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would.”
Her comments appeared to differ from those offered by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, who said the fee would be applied annually.
The director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services Joseph Edlow wrote to staff on Saturday ordering immigration officers to “ensure that their decisions are consistent” with the clarified terms.
A White House spokesperson said the move aimed to encourage companies to hire American workers and give certainty to those hiring foreigners.
About 400,000 H-1B applications were approved last year, the majority people renewing their visas.
Silicon Valley relies heavily on H-1B visas to hire engineers, scientists and coders from overseas. The non-immigrant visa is also widely used by specialist industries, including accountancy firms and healthcare companies."

Given their decades of sustained success, it's easy to see why this is the case.
In general, the average investor shouldn't take investing moves by a billionaire and a trillion-dollar corporation as the gospel because the goals and risk tolerance aren't always aligned. However, getting inspiration from Buffett and Berkshire has proven to be a good choice for many investors.
If you have $1,000 available to invest, the following two Berkshire stocks are great choices for long-term investors.
1. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) isn't one of Berkshire's largest holdings (less than 1% of its portfolio), but it's one of the most thorough companies in its portfolio. Although Amazon became a household name because of its e-commerce business, it has grown into a full-blown conglomerate covering many different industries.
E-commerce continues to be Amazon's biggest moneymaker, accounting for close to 60% of its revenue in the second quarter, but its largest growth engine is undoubtedly its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was only 18% of its Q2 revenue, but it's the bulk of its profits.
Amazon's revenue growth has been slower than that of other big tech competitors like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in recent quarters, but its profits (looking at operating income) have been growing impressively. In Amazon's case, it helps to focus on its profit growth instead of revenue growth because its high-margin businesses like AWS and advertising are driving a lot of its earnings growth. These segments are also on the earlier ends of what they can grow to be.
AWS is still the leading cloud provider, but Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud have been gaining ground. That said, the cloud computing industry is expected to grow to the point where AWS can organically benefit as the industry's largest player. I suspect it'll be the top player in the industry for quite a while.
As far as advertising, artificial intelligence (AI) and Amazon's growing web of businesses are unlocking new ways to monetize Amazon's technology. It has Amazon Prime, Twitch, Amazon Music, and, beginning this year, NBA broadcasting. Combined, these platforms give Amazon premium advertising opportunities across shopping, streaming, gaming, and live sports.
Amazon is a business that I feel comfortable holding on to for the long term because it's diversifying its business and solidifying itself as a major part of many different industries. That's a recipe for long-term success.
2. Visa
Visa (V -0.48%) is the largest payment processor in the world by a large margin, giving it a competitive moat that's built to last for quite some time. That's one of the characteristics Buffett is known for wanting before investing in any business.
Visa is accepted by over 150 million merchants worldwide, and in the 12 months leading up to March 31, it processed close to 316 billion transactions totaling around $16.1 trillion. Needless to say, Visa is an important part of the global financial ecosystem.
One of the best parts of Visa's business is that it's able to operate with extremely high margins because once the initial infrastructure is put in place, it can reap the benefit of increased transactions without needing to spend extra money or take on more overhead. Its profit margins are routinely the highest in the business and one of the highest you'll see from a company in most industries.
Visa has routinely outpaced the S&P 500, especially over the past decade. It has averaged close to 17% annual returns in that span, compared to the S&P 500's 12.7% average. We can't predict if it will continue outpacing the S&P 500, but it has plenty of growth opportunities ahead of it that suggest it has a real chance at doing so.
On a broad level, Visa should be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the growth in digital payments. Many places in the world are becoming less cash-dependent and embracing card transactions (both physical and contactless). This bodes well for Visa, whose business model revolves around taking a percentage of each transaction that occurs on its network.
Given that it is the most widely held and accepted card worldwide, potential cardholders and merchants have an incentive to choose Visa. That's a large part of why I also feel comfortable holding on to Visa's stock for the long haul. It has solidified itself as a business that's too important to the global financial world to go away."

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-21T08:15:00,2 Top AI Growth Stocks to Buy in September,These stocks offer attractive growth prospects at a reasonable price.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=14cf73b690444fa1603ed3c00123fbccfd5c414dd7db9b155b55e96f5ae876cf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,fool.com,200,,"Tech giants continue to announce more capital investment in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Demand remains strong from large enterprises looking to gain better insights from their data using AI-powered services in the cloud.
Two companies that are benefiting from these trends are Alphabet (GOOG 1.95%) (GOOGL 2.04%) and Amazon (AMZN -0.49%). These companies are in a strong competitive position to bring AI innovation to consumers and enterprises, and better yet, their stocks are reasonably valued relative to their earnings potential.
1. Alphabet
Shares of Alphabet have surged in 2025 as investors begin to recognize Google as an AI juggernaut. Google's Gemini AI model powers intelligent features across all the company's services, including Search, Google Cloud, and other apps. With 2 billion people using services like Google Search and Gmail every day, that makes Google one of the top consumer brands profiting from AI.
Google Search is having a strong year, all thanks to AI. Search revenue grew 12% year over year in Q2. New features like AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving more search frequency and new use cases for Search that is fueling more advertising revenue.
On the enterprise side, Google Cloud is seeing tremendous demand for AI services. Businesses are migrating their data to leading cloud platforms to access AI-powered analytics and application-building tools. This drove an impressive 32% year-over-year increase in cloud revenue last quarter, while the segment's operating profit more than doubled.
AI is also bringing internal improvements to Google's operations, such as automating more than 30% of its code. This frees up time for Google's engineers to work on new ideas that can speed up its product development. This has the potential to accelerate its growth over the next decade, which isn't reflected in the stock's valuation.
Management plans to spend $85 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, up from the previous estimate of $75 billion. This is to meet the growing demand for cloud and other services, signaling that Google's future growth is undervalued.
Even after the recent climb, the stock still trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23 based on 2026 estimates. This is attractive for an AI-first company that should deliver double-digit annualized earnings growth over the long term.
2. Amazon
Amazon is another tech juggernaut that would make a solid addition to any investor's portfolio right now. Its financial results have been solid this year, with improving sales and profitability in its largest business, e-commerce. But Amazon is also the leading cloud services provider, which is raking in billions in annualized revenue for enterprise AI services.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) generates $116 billion in annualized revenue. This represents 18% of the company's total revenue, but produces most of the company's profit. While AWS is facing greater competitive pressure from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, it continues to sign major deals with global brands. Last quarter, AWS signed new agreements with PepsiCo, Peloton, and Warner Bros. Discovery, among others.
Demand for AI is so great it is stretching AWS' computing capacity. Specifically, generative AI solutions are experiencing triple-digit year-over-year growth. This means as Amazon invests in bringing more compute capacity online, AWS revenue could accelerate in 2026.
AI is also benefiting Amazon's e-commerce operations through more intelligent delivery routing, inventory placement, and faster order processing, with more than 1 million robots at its warehouses. This shows a valuable synergy taking shape where AI improves the efficiency of the e-commerce business, while higher revenues from e-commerce help fund more investment in research and development for AI innovation in cloud services.
In many ways, Amazon has become an AI-first business, making it a solid choice for investors looking for a relatively safe business to invest in AI for the long haul.
The stock is trading at a forward P/E of 30 times, using next year's earnings estimate. This is reasonable for a business that just posted a year-over-year earnings increase of 33%, partly driven by AI-driven cost efficiencies in e-commerce. Analysts expect the company to deliver 17% annualized earnings growth, which could double the stock by 2030."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-20T23:05:00,Hertz Stock Pops Following News of Amazon Deal. Time to Buy?,It's an unexpected team-up between the auto rental veteran and the retailing powerhouse.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=35ed78aa2c1e127444ff20494464f0406a1e188ab744a27f8d0891e96ffd1e23,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/hertz-stock-pops-following-news-of-amazon-deal-tim/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/hertz-stock-pops-following-news-of-amazon-deal-tim/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/hertz-stock-pops-following-news-of-amazon-deal-tim/,fool.com,200,,"In the popular imagination, Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ 2.26%)isn't an ideal, or even appropriate, choice of business partner for Amazon (AMZN -0.49%).
After all, the former company is an auto rental incumbent of longstanding, and the latter is a monster retailer. Yet the two businesses announced a collaboration in mid-August, and investors liked what they heard about the deal. Here's a look at why, and whether it makes Hertz stock a buy now.
Surprisingly, also a seller
Hertz is a retailer through its Hertz Car Sales unit, although of course it's almost entirely identified as a rental agency.
So it might have been surprising to read Hertz's announcement that it is going to be a seller on Amazon Autos. Customers purchasing a Hertz used vehicle will be able to pick it up at one of the 45 Hertz Car Sales outlets in this country. At first, this service will be offered in Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston and Dallas as a pilot program. If successful, it'll expand nationwide.
Judging by the market's reaction to the news, investors are thinking the deal will surely be beneficial to Hertz.
Known unknowns
It's highly uncertain by how much, however. The company provided almost no details of the Amazon Autos deal, and that includes financial particulars like estimated revenue. That isn't all that surprising because the rental king is awfully mum about the performance of Hertz Car Sales. In fact, the division gets merely two mentions in the company's 22-page second quarter of 2025 earnings report.
In that document, Hertz only says that Hertz Car Sales' volume was the highest in all of the second quarters stretching back five years. No further information is provided.
Hertz probably doesn't break out the unit's fundamentals because they (likely) aren't impressive. Given that, I don't think the Amazon deal will be any kind of game changer, and I wouldn't trade the stock purely on the news. If it gets Hertz to be more transparent about its retail efforts, however, at least that will be a small victory for shareholders."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-20T19:15:00,Prediction: These 2 Warren Buffett Stocks Could Beat the Market in the Next Decade,These stocks have strong track records of success and offer investors who initiate positions today plenty more to look forward to.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0d7e27c91b07528e2267665a4aaccfe98baa7305a5012baf58bf363eb6707fb0,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-warren-buffett-stocks-could-bea/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-warren-buffett-stocks-could-bea/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-warren-buffett-stocks-could-bea/,fool.com,200,,"Warren Buffett will step down from his role as the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. Although his legendary decade-long tenure is coming to an end, investors can still learn a great deal by studying the man's investing philosophy and examining the conglomerate's famous portfolio, which contains many excellent buy-and-hold options.
Two of the top picks among Berkshire Hathaway's 41 holdings are Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) and Visa (V -0.48%). These market leaders have the potential to deliver superior returns over the next decade.
Here is why.
1. Amazon
Amazon is a highly profitable company with U.S. and international operations in e-commerce, grocery shopping, video and music streaming, advertising, and cloud computing. However, outside of its cloud operations, the company's business is relatively low-margin.
In the second quarter, Amazon's North America and international segments had operating margins of 7.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Here's the good news: In the next decade, e-commerce should continue expanding internationally, granting significant growth prospects to these parts of Amazon's business.
In the meantime, the company will seek to improve its margins by implementing artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across its operations. The company has deployed more than a million industrial robots in its warehouses to that end. Amazon's North America and international segments generate hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue. Even modest margin improvements annually over the long run could have a meaningful impact on the company's bottom line.
Then there is Amazon's fast-growing cloud unit. It is responsible for most of the company's operating and net income, thanks to its much juicier margins. With a suite of AI services whose demand continues to grow, Amazon Web Services should maintain this momentum for the foreseeable future. Lastly, some of Amazon's newer initiatives are expected to make a meaningful impact in the next decade as well.
Consider the company's Amazon Pharmacy. The U.S. prescription drug market is expected to be worth approximately $374 billion in revenue this year. Amazon boasts 180 million Prime members in the U.S. and offers a range of perks, including fast and free shipping, allowing patients to avoid the long lines at pharmacies. If the company can scale this business and the rest of its healthcare operations, it could have a meaningful impact on its results by 2035.
Even without that, though, Amazon's prospects for the next decade look highly attractive. Investors can safely add shares of the e-commerce specialist and hold onto them for a long time.
2. Visa
Visa owns one of the world's leading global payment networks. The company facilitates credit and debit card transactions, earning a fee for each. So, every time anyone swipes or taps a card branded with Visa's logo, the company pockets a percentage of the transaction amount. That's quite the business model.
To get an idea of the scale of Visa's business, consider that there are about 5 billion of its branded cards in circulation across some 200 countries, and the company supports hundreds of billions of transactions annually and trillions in total payment volume.
The result: Visa generates consistent revenue and profits, and it has for the past decade. The company also boasts a high-margin business. Visa's network infrastructure is already in place and can support its transaction volume with minimal additional cost.
The financial specialist also avoids the headaches associated with credit risk, as it does not issue the credit card itself. This also means it doesn't receive money from interest. Still, Visa's fee-based, capital-light model yields gross and net margins of around 80% and 50%, respectively, which is exceptional for a company of its size.
Although Visa has already achieved tremendous success, there is still plenty of room to grow, as the world increasingly requires digital (non-cash or check) methods of payment. Besides the fact that cash is clunky and less convenient to carry in high amounts than a credit card, the growth of e-commerce is also playing a role in this, since cash is an option in physical retail stores, but digital methods of payment are practically mandatory on e-commerce platforms.
Visa still estimates there's trillions worth of cash and check transactions to bring into its ecosystem. The company should ride that wave in the next decade and deliver excellent returns along the way."

The White House announced Friday that Trump had signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. In response, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reportedly emailed their employees telling those with H-1B visas to stay in the United States and avoid foreign travel for now — and if they’re already traveling, to try to return before the proclamation takes effect at 12:01am Eastern on Sunday.
Business Insider published the memos from Amazon and Microsoft, while Sources published a similar memo from Google. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to Amazon and Google.
According to government data, Amazon employees have received the most H-1B visas so far this fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, then Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, with Google ranked sixth.
Meanwhile, a White House official told Axios that the fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing H-1B holders or renewals. And White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation.”
This post has been updated with a quote from Karoline Leavitt."

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-20T12:08:00,"If You'd Invested $1,000 in Amazon 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today",Amazon is one of the world's largest companies. Here's a look at its recent performance.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=833c61816f002cc720dbd85beeb1af2af9a3792567748600d0424982bfd2643c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/if-youd-invested-1000-in-amazon-5-years-ago-heres/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/if-youd-invested-1000-in-amazon-5-years-ago-heres/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/if-youd-invested-1000-in-amazon-5-years-ago-heres/,fool.com,200,,"I won't sugarcoat it: Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) hasn't exactly been the best-performing stock over the past five years, with a gain of about 56% during that time period. In other words, a $1,000 investment in Amazon five years ago -- on Sept. 17, 2020 -- would be worth $1,560 today.
That is significantly less than the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.48%), which has delivered a 112% total return over the past five years. So, why did Amazon produce less than half of the gains as a simple S&P 500 index fund?
Why did Amazon underperform?
Let's be clear: It isn't that Amazon is performing poorly. And before you judge the last five years of performance, it's important to put that time frame into context.
Specifically, five years ago, in mid-September 2020, the world was essentially still locked down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, e-commerce demand was incredibly strong. In fact, from the start of 2020 through mid-September, Amazon had already risen by 63% versus just a 5% total return from the S&P 500. In other words, when looking at the past five years, Amazon was already starting from a place of strong performance.
As a matter of fact, if we look at Amazon versus the S&P 500 from the beginning of 2020 through today, Amazon is actually ahead by about 26 percentage points."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-20T09:55:00,5 Top AI Stocks Prominent Billionaires Are Buying,Billionaire investors were piling into these names in Q2.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9453a9e12f8b0fd08d65b624dd1f2464628870eccf7dab641c3ae6d4fed31a16,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/5-top-ai-stocks-prominent-billionaires-are-buying/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/5-top-ai-stocks-prominent-billionaires-are-buying/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/5-top-ai-stocks-prominent-billionaires-are-buying/,fool.com,200,,"Billionaire portfolio managers typically become billionaires because they are good investors. That is why it can sometimes be smart to make note of the moves these investors are making to see if you might want to do the same.
Let's look at five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that billionaires were buying in Q2 and see if they might help you in your efforts to boost your portfolio.
Philippe Laffont: Nvidia and Broadcom
Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, which is a technology-focused hedge fund. While he may not be a household name, Laffont manages money for rich and powerful clients, including Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) founder Jeff Bezos.
Public filings show the billionaire was buying two top AI chip stocks in Q2, adding to his positions in Nvidia (NVDA 0.03%) and Broadcom (AVGO 2.12%). He increased his Nvidia stake by 34% and those shares now account for 5% of his overall portfolio. He upped his Broadcom position by 58%, and it now represents 4.3% of his holdings.
With Nvidia predicting that AI infrastructure spending could climb from $600 billion to as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade, it's easy to see why Laffont is bullish on AI chip stocks. Nvidia is obviously the undisputed leader and has been the biggest beneficiary of the race to build out new AI data centers. Given the wide moat it's created through its CUDA software platform, the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are likely to remain the primary chips powering AI workloads long into the future.
However, Broadcom is also becoming a major player in the space by helping customers design custom AI chips. As good as Nvidia's chips are, customers do not want to solely rely on the chip giant, and those with deep pockets that are building massive data centers have been increasingly turning to Broadcom. While custom chips lack the flexibility of GPUs, they often can have higher performance and cost savings for the specific task for which they've been designed.
With AI chip demand surging, both Nvidia and Broadcom look like they will be long-term winners.
Stanley Druckenmiller: TSMC
Stanley Druckenmiller manages the Duquesne Family Office. This basically means that Druckenmiller became so rich that he no longer needs to manage the money of outside investors and is happy just investing his own money.
Druckenmiller was also investing in the AI chip theme, but instead of buying shares in chip designers, he added to his position in the company that manufactures the advanced chips: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.18%). Druckenmiller boosted his position by 28%, taking it up to a 4.3% position in his portfolio.
The beauty of investing in TSMC is that Druckenmiller doesn't have to pick a chip winner. TSMC is currently the only foundry that is able to make advanced chips with a high yield rate (this means with only a few defective chips per wafer) at scale. That has made it a close partner to every chipmaker and given it strong pricing power.
With the need for AI chips growing and potential in emerging industries like robotaxis and quantum computing, TSMC looks like a long-term winner.
Bill Ackman: Amazon and Alphabet
Famed investor Bill Ackman is head of Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman has always been fond of the consumer space, and he's playing AI in much the same way, making a large investment in Amazon in the quarter and increasing his bet on Alphabet (GOOGL 2.04%) (GOOG 1.95%). Amazon was a new investment for Ackman, and it represents a little over 9% of his portfolio, while he boosted his position in Alphabet so it now accounts for 15% of his holdings.
Both Amazon and Alphabet are cloud computing leaders that are seeing huge demand for their services. They also both have their own custom AI chips, which can help improve performance and reduce costs. This space is booming, and both are investing aggressively to take advantage of the opportunity.
Meanwhile, both companies are also deploying AI to help power their core businesses. Amazon is using AI to make its e-commerce business more efficient. This includes everything from having AI-powered robots in its fulfillment centers to using AI to optimize delivery routes and improve supply chain management. It's also using AI to drive its fast-growing sponsored ad business. This is all leading to strong operating leverage in its retail operations.
Alphabet, on the other hand, is using AI to help power its search business. AI Overviews is leading to more search queries, and it's just started rolling out its new AI Mode globally. In addition, newer features such as Lens and Circle to Search are also driving more queries, with many having a commercial intent (this is when a user is searching for products or services to purchase).

“It was the realisation that I needed to do things very differently. You're talking about a 45-minute journey to college, making new friends and understanding that the world is maybe broader than everything I've seen up to that point.”
It didn't take him long. When Tobun completed his health studies degree in 2001 he began to take a shine to business. He read newspapers, listened to the news and took in that the then-Labour government was starting to change how schools were funded.

He conceived a ‘one-stop shop service’ idea to oversee support, facility and construction services, which were previously under local authority remits. Tobun pitched the idea to The Prince's Trust for a £3,000 grant but was turned down.
However, his bus journey home from Clapham cemented a desire to succeed. “I was just going to try and that clearly was one of the greatest decisions I ever made,” he says.
Living in a crowded home, he used a £500 undergraduate overdraft to secure two months’ rent on a small office space nearby. It was a former boiler room with no windows and Tobun recalls dripping with sweat, even with the door open, as he scoured the Yellow Pages and hit the phones.
His business break came at age 22 when the female head of London's Walworth Academy asked him to tender for its support services. Tobun wore a suit for the first time and, realising he couldn’t compete with the other experienced companies in the room, focused on what he could do.
“That shifted my pitch completely because it became about, ‘You need this done in six weeks. You need people who are flexible and agile to be able to meet this'. I said I'll do whatever it takes to make sure this is delivered. This is the only opportunity I would ever get.”
Tobun won the £250,000 contract, marking the beginning of a journey into multiple sectors spanning three continents. His company, GV Group, has now grown into one of the UK's largest independent transport and logistics companies. Twenty years after Tobun entered the business world, GV Group had sales of £33m.

New RMI and Center for Green Market Activation initiative will enable Amazon, Prologis, Meta, and other leading organizations to participate in a first-of-its-kind joint purchase of sustainable concrete attribute certificates, driving investment into cutting-edge production facilities, low-carbon cement blends, and emerging technologies.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In a landmark step for the cement and concrete sector, RMI (founded as Rocky Mountain Institute) and the Center for Green Market Activation (GMA) today launched the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA), bringing together founding members, including Amazon, Prologis, and Meta, alongside other leading organizations to accelerate adoption of low-carbon cement and concrete for 21st century buildings and infrastructure. SCoBA is the first buyers group formed to collectively procure environmental attribute certificates for low-carbon concrete, aiming to turn demand into real-world offtake agreements that enable producers to invest at scale in new infrastructure and pioneering technologies.
The cement and concrete sector accounts for around 8 percent of global carbon emissions and is predicted to grow significantly by 2050, but low-carbon options are currently not available at scale. The emissions from construction of factories, warehouses, data centers, and offices are difficult to address due to the embodied carbon from construction materials. SCoBA will leverage an innovative book and claim system to enable companies to purchase the environmental attributes from sustainable concrete and upstream products such as cement and clinker, reducing their associated supply chain emissions, and generating additional revenue to help finance capital-intensive decarbonization projects.
""The cement and concrete sector's decarbonization challenge is also one of its greatest economic opportunities,"" said Jon Creyts, CEO at RMI. ""By aggregating demand from major buyers and establishing rigorous standards, we're creating the market conditions for breakthrough low-carbon cement innovations to scale. RMI is proud to work with GMA and leading organizations to launch SCoBA and enable concrete producers to invest confidently in clean and resilient materials that lead to economic benefits.""
Later this year, SCoBA will begin to connect members with leading producers through a first-of-its-kind competitive procurement process for low-carbon cement and concrete certificates to meet the collective demand of its founding members and spur clean tech innovation. The first request for information (RFI) is open now, seeking information from suppliers about the current availability of low-carbon cement and concrete and its performance characteristics, prospective use cases, and operational approaches for environmental attribute certificates, as well as any opportunities or challenges related to participating in a book and claim system."

Under the multiyear deal, Oracle would provide the social media giant with computing power for training and deploying artificial intelligence models, according to people familiar with the talks. The total commitment amount may increase and other deal terms could still change before a final agreement, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.
The contract would add to a series of wins for Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business. Last week, the company reported a huge increase in bookings that vaulted its stock price to an all-time high. Oracle has previously disclosed cloud business with Meta and other companies that train AI models, including Elon Musk’s xAI.
Oracle shares climbed 4.1% to $308.66 at the close Friday in New York. The stock, fueled by the company’s cloud success, has jumped 85% this year.
Known for its database software, Oracle is emerging as a key provider of AI computing capacity, competing against cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
Meta declined to comment. Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
In August, Bloomberg reported that Oracle was in talks with Meta for additional cloud capacity.
Still, investors have voiced concern over how much of Oracle’s booked cloud deals are attributable to a single customer, OpenAI, which is the leading AI company. Earlier this year, Oracle won a deal to provide the AI company with 4.5 gigawatts of computing power, an unprecedented sum.

(Reuters) -Oracle is in talks with Meta for a multi-year cloud computing deal worth about $20 billion, underscoring the social media giant's drive to secure faster access to computing power, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Oracle would provide Meta with computing capacity for training and deploying AI models, in addition to Meta's existing cloud computing providers, the person said.
Meta declined to comment, while Oracle did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters.
Oracle offers integrated cloud technologies along with flexible deployment models, enabling it to meet a range of customer demands.
The potential deal comes just a week after a Wall Street Journal report on OpenAI signing a contract to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years from Oracle, marking one of the biggest cloud contracts ever signed.
The company has struck deals with Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft to let their cloud customers run Oracle Cloud Infrastructure alongside native services. The revenue from these partnerships rose more than sixteen-fold in the first quarter.
Oracle unveiled four multi-billion-dollar contracts last week, amid an industry-wide shift, led by companies such as OpenAI and xAI, to aggressively spend to secure the massive computing capacity needed to stay ahead in the AI race.
The enterprise software maker said it expects to sign up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in the next few months, and that booked revenue at its OCI business would exceed half a trillion dollars.

The U.S. and U.K. governments agreed Thursday to cooperate in developing the two countries' artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and nuclear energy sectors, and to spend $350 billion doing so.
$350 billion in total investment -- but how much for nuclear?
The British government says 150 billion pounds (US$195 billion) will be invested in the U.K., which it calls a ""record-breaking investment,"" leaving $155 billion for the American AI, quantum, and nuclear sectors. But how much of this money goes to Nano Nuclear?
- Britain's Urenco and America's Radiant will supply $5.3 million worth of HALEU fuel to the U.S.
- America's X-Energy will help Britain's Centrica build ""up to 12 advanced modular reactors"" worth ""at least 40 billion pounds.""
- Last Energy and DP World will build ""one of the world's first micro modular nuclear power plants"" in London.
That's all they have to say on the subject of nuclear investments -- no mention of Nano Nuclear Energy stock at all.
Is Nano Nuclear Energy stock a buy?
Fact is, the biggest beneficiary here appears to be X-Energy (and its partner Centrica). If you recall, X-Energy is a private company backed by Amazon, partnering to build several gigawatts-worth of nuclear reactors for Amazon's data centers in the Pacific Northwest.
That's good to know if you want to keep an eye on X-Energy as a potential investment, should it ever go public. But it's terrible news for investors betting on Nano Nuclear stock to benefit from the $350 billion U.S.-U.K. deal.
Nano Nuclear stock therefore remains a sell for me."

Teradyne (TER) is often categorized as a cyclical semiconductor test-equipment supplier, but this view overlooks the company’s growing robotics franchise, which management has highlighted as its long-term vision. By integrating AI, industrial automation, and electrification themes such as EV and ADAS, Teradyne is positioning itself as more than just a test-equipment player.
The company has built a strong robotics portfolio through acquisitions of Universal Robots, Mobile Industrial Robots, Energid, and AutoGuide, placing it at the center of structural growth drivers like Amazon’s warehouse automation rollout and accelerating automation across automotive factories. These catalysts, including Amazon’s Vulcan robot deployment and Nvidia-driven advances in robotics AI, remain underappreciated in the stock’s current valuation.
Near-term, the semiconductor test downturn, exacerbated by auto and industrial weakness and trade-related delays, has weighed on the share price. Trading around $110, Teradyne sits near multi-year lows, reflecting cyclical pressures rather than the value of its robotics platform. While peers such as Fanuc and Yaskawa trade at 12–17x EV/EBITDA, Teradyne’s ~24x multiple is tied primarily to its existing semiconductor and robotics businesses, with little recognition for potential upside. A meaningful re-rating could occur once robotics adoption gains traction, especially with high-profile contracts and accelerating factory automation, pushing the stock toward automation technology multiples of 30–35x EV/EBITDA.
With virtually no debt and a healthy balance sheet, Teradyne offers asymmetric upside. The combination of depressed sentiment from semiconductor cyclicality and underappreciated long-term robotics value creates an attractive entry point with significant potential for rerating as adoption accelerates.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) by The Antifragile Investor in May 2025, which highlighted its critical role in semiconductor manufacturing and high-margin service flywheel.

Chewy, Inc. (CHWY) is an online retailer specializing in pet food and animal pharmacy products, distinguished by its exceptional customer loyalty and service. The company’s auto-shipping model locks in repeat customers, creating a highly sticky user base, while price-matching with Amazon ensures competitiveness. Currently focused primarily on the U.S., with some presence in Canada, Chewy has significant international expansion potential, particularly in Europe, though progress in that region has been slower than anticipated.
The company has consistently grown revenue year-over-year and has maintained profitability for several years, reflecting the resilience of its business model. Its customer service approach, while costly and difficult to replicate with AI, reinforces loyalty and brand strength, potentially providing a competitive moat as rivals increasingly rely on automated solutions. Challenges include executive compensation levels that appear high relative to company size, the slow pace of European market entry, and the inherent costs of a service-intensive business model.
While these factors could pressure margins, they may also reinforce customer preference for Chewy over lower-service alternatives. The recent stock price decline offers an attractive entry point for long-term investors, given the company’s robust fundamentals, consistent revenue growth, and strong market positioning. The combination of a loyal, expanding customer base, pricing competitiveness, and potential international growth supports a positive outlook. Overall, Chewy presents a compelling investment opportunity, with solid downside protection from its entrenched U.S. operations and the potential for substantial upside if European expansion accelerates and operational efficiencies are realized, making the current valuation a potential discount relative to its long-term growth trajectory.

Buying electricity has become an increasingly urgent challenge for technology companies including Meta, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. They’re all racing to develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems and tools that are notoriously resource-intensive. Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft are already active power traders, according to filings with US regulators.
While big tech companies consume huge amounts of electricity, they also have contracts for power that they can flip around and sell when prices are high.
“There will be opportunities to sell electricity into the wholesale markets and make a little extra money doing that,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James.
Plus, tech companies that have batteries or on-site generators at data centers can sell power from those back to the grid when prices spike, said Andy DeVries, a utilities and power analyst at CreditSights Inc.
Power demand from data centers used to build and run AI models is set to quadruple in 10 years, based on projections from BloombergNEF. At the same time, power prices are rising amid this surge in electric demand. In fact, capacity payments — which generators get in some US markets — hit a record in an auction held this year by the country’s biggest grid, which stretches from Washington to Chicago.
The demand is so robust that some tech firms that touted their climate goals are now considering natural gas a key source to help power their data centers. Last month, for instance, Louisiana regulators approved utility Entergy Corp.’s plan to build three natural gas plants to power Meta’s data center there.
Meta’s application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks authorization “to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services.” It didn’t identify, however, where in the US it would seek to trade power. The company would be required to file for membership in order to trade in one of seven competitive power markets, such as the Texas grid or the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which encompasses the Louisiana data center."

Shares of online grocery delivery platform Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) fell 4.7% in the morning session after its key competitor, Amazon, announced a new partnership with grocery chain Winn-Dixie to expand its grocery delivery service in Florida.
This collaboration focused on the Jacksonville and Orlando areas, offering customers over 16,000 items via Amazon's platform. The strategic move positions Amazon as a formidable competitor in the grocery delivery market. Investors reacted to the heightened competitive pressure, which sparked concerns about Instacart's ability to defend its market share in these key Florida regions.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Instacart’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 14 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 1.3% on the news that the company announced a partnership with UK-based supermarket Morrisons to launch its AI-powered smart trolleys, marking the technology's first deployment in the United Kingdom.
The ""Caper Carts"" will allow customers to scan items as they shop, track their spending in real time, and complete their checkout seamlessly. This collaboration will begin at a single Morrisons store in early 2026, with the potential for a wider rollout in the future. The move signifies a key international expansion for Instacart's retail technology. This news follows another recent partnership, where e-commerce provider Vroom Delivery linked with Instacart to offer digital advertising tools to Vroom's network of 3,500 convenience stores, further extending the reach of Instacart's services.
Instacart is up 0.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $43.35 per share, it is still trading 18.4% below its 52-week high of $53.15 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Instacart’s shares at the IPO in September 2023 would now be looking at an investment worth $1,286.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Open Door, Instacart, and Alphabet.
First up, Open Door. The real estate company announcing the departure of its CFO. The move comes just days after the company appointed a new CEO and as its founders returned to the board. Open Door has appointed Christy Schwartz to fill the role as interim CFO. She previously served as the interim chief financial officer from December 2022 to November 2024.
The C suite changes come amid renewed interest in the company following hedge fund manager Eric Jackson's bull case. Uh retail investors have since also shown some interest.
Next up, Instacart. Shares falling on reports that Amazon has partnered with Southeastern supermarket chain Win Dixie for grocery delivery in Florida. Wedbush analyst Scott Devid, who has an outperform rating on Amazon and an underperform on Instacart, writes that the Win Dixie tie up is a quote incremental step forward in Amazon's broader strategy to capture share in the category.
Instacart and traditional grocer shares took a hit last month after Amazon rolled out same day grocery delivery in 2300 US cities.
And finally, Alphabet. The Google parent will meet the European Union's deadline to propose changes to its advertising technology business. That's according to Bloomberg. Google was fined $3.5 billion earlier this month by the EU over what it views as dominance in that ad tech business. Google had previously considered selling parts of the business to resolve anti-trust concerns, but those were at the time not deemed to have met the bar required by regulators.
This month's penalty pushed the US tech giant's EU anti-trust bill close to 10 billion euros over the past decade. The company has vowed to appeal it.

The company's recent announcement to expand its Wisconsin datacenter plan to $7 billion underscores a broader commitment to building the computational backbone necessary for AI and cloud services dominance.
The scale of Microsoft's datacenter ambitions is staggering. Operating over 300 datacenters across more than 60 regions globally, the company has positioned itself as one of the world's largest datacenter operators. This extensive network directly translates into revenue potential, as evidenced by the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, where Azure and other cloud services revenues grew 29% year over year, driven largely by AI services demand that relies heavily on this infrastructure.
The Wisconsin expansion, building upon earlier investments, reflects Microsoft's strategic bet that datacenter capacity will become the limiting factor in AI adoption. This $7 billion commitment alone could generate thousands of jobs while providing the computing power necessary to serve enterprise AI workloads at scale.
Microsoft's datacenter investments create multiple value streams beyond direct cloud revenues. These facilities enable the company to offer lower-latency services, improve data sovereignty compliance for international customers, and maintain competitive advantages in the rapidly growing AI-as-a-service market. With capital expenditures in datacenter infrastructure exceeding $50 billion annually, Microsoft is essentially building a moat that few competitors can match, positioning the stock for sustained growth as digital transformation and AI adoption accelerate globally.
How Amazon and Google Stack Up in the Datacenter Race
Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services operates approximately 105 availability zones across 33 geographic regions, with Amazon continuing to expand its infrastructure footprint through multi-billion dollar investments. Amazon's datacenter strategy focuses on maintaining its cloud market leadership, with the company announcing plans for additional regions in Malaysia, Mexico, and New Zealand.
Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform runs 40 regions and 121 zones globally, with Google investing heavily in subsea cables and edge locations to differentiate its infrastructure. Google's recent commitment to invest $3.3 billion in South Carolina datacenters demonstrates its determination to close the gap. While Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader by market share at roughly 31%, Google has accelerated its datacenter buildout to capture more enterprise AI workloads, though both companies trail Microsoft's geographic reach of more than 300 datacenters worldwide."

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 3.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5%.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.76 points to a change of +22.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.8%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.6 indicates a change of +12.4% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon."

3 Reasons to Avoid Netflix Stock Despite Its +28% Surge in 6 Months
Netflix has emerged as a dominant force in the entertainment industry, raising its revenue forecast for 2025 to $44.8-$45.2 billion, up from $43.5-$44.5 billion, reflecting management's confidence in sustained growth momentum. The stock has returned 28.2% in the past 6-month period. Yet beneath these headline numbers lie structural concerns that warrant a more cautious investment approach, particularly for those seeking optimal entry points in the evolving streaming landscape.
Operating Margin Pressures Signal Near-Term Headwinds
While Netflix achieved an impressive operating margin of 34.1% in the second quarter of 2025, an improvement of nearly 7 percentage points from the year-earlier period, management has warned investors about forthcoming profitability challenges. The company cautioned that operating margin in the second half of 2025 will be lower than in the first half due to higher content amortization and sales and marketing costs associated with the larger second half slate. This guidance suggests that the company's margin expansion story may face temporary setbacks as content investment accelerates.
The deteriorating margin trajectory reflects Netflix's strategic imperative to maintain content leadership amid intensifying competition. With major releases scheduled for late 2025, including high-budget original productions and licensed content acquisitions, the company faces mounting pressure to balance growth investments with profitability targets.
These elevated content costs, combined with increased marketing expenditures to defend market share, create a challenging operating environment that could constrain earnings growth despite revenue expansion. Management's warning about second-half margin compression indicates that profitability improvements may stall, potentially disappointing investors expecting continued operational leverage.
Intensifying Competitive Landscape Threatens Market Dominance
The streaming wars have evolved from Netflix's monopolistic advantage to a fiercely contested battlefield where deep-pocketed rivals continue gaining ground. In the United States, Netflix leads the streaming market with 27% of the share, but Amazon owned Prime Video follows closely, holding 26%, demonstrating how quickly competitors have closed the gap. Disney -owned Disney+ and Apple -owned Apple TV+ continue expanding their content libraries and technological capabilities, while leveraging unique ecosystem advantages unavailable to Netflix."

In a note to clients, BMO said, “A recovery in demand remains elusive, particularly in the important B2B segment. Macro challenges have been further heightened by shifting U.S. trade policies, including the ending of de minimis exemptions.”
The analysts pointed out that global trade conditions remain weak. “PMIs of the major economies that drive global trade remain in contraction territory, with limited visibility into an inflection point in the freight cycle,” BMO wrote.
Shifting U.S. trade policies, including higher tariffs, have hurt profitable China–U.S. trade lanes, pulling forward shipments and dampening expectations for the 2025 peak season.
Domestically, UPS continues a costly transformation of its delivery network, according to BMO.
The company is moving away from Amazon volumes and insourcing Surepost, while targeting $3.5 billion in cost savings by 2025.
However, BMO cautioned that “cost reductions are lagging the step-down in revenues, and Surepost volumes have proven more challenging to network density than originally expected.”
BMO lowered its earnings estimates for 2025 to $6.29 per share, down from $6.94, and to $6.86 for 2026, from $7.92. Consensus currently stands at $6.50 and $7.19, respectively.
“The timing of our shift to a more constructive outlook on UPS proved to be wrong, as the expected recovery in the freight cycle, specifically B2B, did not materialize in 2025,” the analysts admitted.
While they see potential improvement when B2B demand rebounds, trade uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook.

Recent volatility has cracked open entry points in three platforms growing 13% to 27% annually, with moats that deepen as they scale.
Unlike the artificial intelligence (AI) darlings trading at 100 times sales, these businesses already generate meaningful cash while riding secular trends untouched by Fed cycles or politics. Read on to find out more about these three incredible growth stocks.
The Everything Store's second act
Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) posted $167.7 billion in 2025's second-quarter revenue, up 13% year over year, proving the $2.5-trillion giant still grows like a challenger. Its India marketplace cut losses by 89%, showing international units are finally nearing profitability. Meanwhile, Amazon's rolling out AI-powered ""Seller Assistant"" tools to help merchants optimize operations, potentially creating a high-margin software stream Wall Street hasn't priced in.
While Amazon Web Services (AWS) faces tough competition from Microsoft and Alphabet, advertising and international markets are expanding margins and diversifying growth. Trading at around 30 times forward earnings, Amazon is still growing faster than many software peers at richer multiples. The risks -- regulation and cloud deceleration -- are real, but its scale, diversification, and steady margin gains make execution the story that matters.
The metaverse that actually makes money
Roblox (RBLX 3.36%) generated $1.08 billion in Q2 2025 revenue, up 21%, while daily active users reached 111.8 million -- network effects that every metaverse ""wannabe"" envies. The platform's user-generated content model means Roblox doesn't pay for game development, though it invests heavily in infrastructure and content moderation. Revenue jumped 27% over the trailing 12 months to $4.02 billion, fueling the stock's 195% rally over the same period.
Unlike Meta's cash-burning metaverse or Epic's closed ecosystem, Roblox's virtual-goods economy generates substantial revenue even while the company invests in growth. Its expansion beyond gaming into concerts, education, and brand experiences multiplies the addressable market. Content moderation, child safety concerns, and current net losses remain legitimate risks. Still, with users creating content for each other, Roblox owns a metaverse generating real revenue growth rather than just promises.

Shopify (SHOP 2.42%) reported Q2 2025 revenue of $2.68 billion (up 31% year over year), with gross merchandise volume climbing to $87.8 billion, up from $67.2 billion a year ago. The core platform is accelerating after exiting capital-intensive logistics powered by subscriptions and merchant services that scale without heavy fulfillment costs. Unlike marketplaces that compete with sellers, Shopify is aligned with merchant success, which strengthens loyalty and reduces regulatory risk.
Free-cash-flow margin reached 16%, showing the model generates real cash even as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability remains uneven. Risks from small business pressures and broader macroconditions are real, but global e-commerce penetration is still early. AI tools for inventory, marketing, and checkout optimization make merchants more successful, driving higher transaction volumes that flow directly into Shopify's results.
The growth gauntlet
Amazon, Roblox, and Shopify illustrate what separates true compounders from fleeting fads. Each delivers double-digit annual revenue growth, business models that strengthen with scale, and cash generation instead of endless burn. Amazon anchors global digital commerce, Roblox owns the social graph of Generation Alpha, and Shopify empowers entrepreneurs at every level.
These are secular trends that will persist regardless of Fed policy or political noise. Volatility may shake near-term conviction, but companies doubling revenue every few years create wealth that value traps never can. After recent gains, these growth stocks still stand out as compelling long-term buys."

This is an interesting time in tech. We saw the Nvidia Intel news.
Is this a good thing to see these tie-ups like this?
Well, there's some good in this, always. Look, the United States, as we know,
has to become a chip manufacturer. We cannot be dependent on the rest of the world for chips. Look, we came out of COVID
understanding the supply chain better than we ever did before. We understood that without chips being imported to the United States,
our economy, our manufacturing economy shut down. You literally could not buy most of the things that we want in this country, even simple things as toasters today, somehow have to have chips.
We got to connect to your phone, Gary. I need to know when my toast is done.
I I guess you have to hit your phone in bed to put the toast down in the morning so you you can do that. So, look, we now are in an economy where everything we buy has a chip in it.
We can't be beholden to the rest of the world. So, to the extent that the federal government is getting involved and encouraging chip manufacturing in the United States. And this started in the last administration with the chips Act and we continue to press on this independence of vital necessity goods in this country, I do think is a good thing.
Do you view it as the administration picking winners and losers?
I hope the administration is not picking winners and losers. It's not their job to pick winners and losers. What it is the the federal government's job is is to protect the citizens, protect our safety, protect our well-being. And we know that chips are a vital part of protecting our our our country. You know, simple missiles today have 300 plus chips in them.
So to be to be able to defend ourselves, to be able to build military equipment, we need to be in the chip manufacturing business here. So that I do applaud that we understand the risk of not having chip manufacturing in the United States.
IBM investing uh just billions of dollars in in AI and its own infrastructure. Where do you think we are in the AI CAPEX build out?
You know, look, it's it's the AI CAPEX build is pretty transparent. There's an enormous amount of money being spent in data centers. These data centers will come on
sort of over the next three to four to five years. You know, we'll continue to see more and more use of AI. What what what's going on right now is, you know, people are using AI, but they're using sort of independent software, independent programs to solve a specific AI problem.
Like an agent. Yeah.
Yeah, like an agent.
Do my payroll.
Oh, do my payroll, uh handle my HR, read my, read my documents, help me with my tax return, help me with my tax returns.
Where I believe this is going, where IBM believes this is going, this is going to an enterprise-wide solution where all of these AI programs, these in these these, um, AI facilities will work together. They'll be more coherently, more cohesively related and they'll have a big infrastructure behind that.
And look, that's going to lead us into a really interesting world as people get their data and databases in a more coherent place, and that's what it takes to make I I work. It's going to lead us into a quantum quantum revolution. We think by the end of this decade, we're going to have quantum, you know, be a major part of this equation."

As this technology offers new innovations and transforms existing industries, these company's shareholders will likely reap the benefits.
Although investors may widely understand some of these available opportunities, the range of lucrative AI investments will likely extend far beyond AI stalwarts such as Nvidia and Palantir. As the technology brings more transformation, investors should prepare for these stocks to rise amid an increased AI focus.
Amazon
At this point, investors widely understand the success of Amazon (AMZN -0.49%). As a pioneer in e-commerce and cloud computing, it has evolved into a conglomerate supported by several consumer-related and tech businesses.
Still, if that leads consumers and investors to overlook it as an AI company, they are likely making a huge mistake. As the world's leading cloud infrastructure company, Amazon Web Services (AWS) plays a critical role in supporting AI-related functions for its clients.
Its generative AI application builder, chatbots, and code builders are just a few examples. Considering that AWS makes up the majority of the company's operating income, this success is crucial to its growth.
The examples are also extensive on the e-commerce side of the business. It supports shopping services and customer service functions for its customers. That underpins fast-growing enterprises within the company, such as digital advertising and third-party seller services. Additionally, AI bolsters robotics and supply chain management to improve efficiencies within its logistics network.
Even though it generated $323 billion in net sales in the first half of 2025, its 11% annual growth is slower than in past years. Still, Amazon kept cost and expense growth in check, meaning its $35 billion in net income for the period grew by 48% compared to year-ago levels.
Overall, the stock is up by about 25% over the last year, which lags the aforementioned rate of profit growth.
However, its 35 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is not far above the S&P 500 average of 31, meaning the stock sells at a significant discount compared to past years. With its profits likely to continue growing at a rapid pace, now appears to be a great time to add shares.
Upstart Holdings
Upstart Holdings (UPST 0.42%) applies AI to a business long overdue for a technical upgrade -- loan evaluation.
The Fair Isaac Corporation controls the dominant loan evaluation metric, the FICO Score. Nonetheless, the scoring system has not undergone a significant update since its introduction in 1989, leaving the industry vulnerable to competitive challenges.
Upstart continues to upgrade its technology, updating its AI-driven model and approving 92% of loan applications without human intervention. Thanks to the added factors it considers, its model can approve 101% more applicants without increasing risks to lenders, according to Upstart.
Additionally, Upstart has derived the majority of its revenue from evaluating personal loans. Still, it is gaining traction in the auto loan market, and it has begun evaluating applicants for home equity lines of credit. Those avenues should dramatically expand the company's addressable market.
Amid those initiatives, investors should expect considerable growth for Upstart over the next few years. Also, on a macro level, the Federal Reserve moved to trim interest rates, a factor that should further supercharge growth.
Indeed, growth has returned to Upstart after recent declines in loan volumes. In the first half of 2025, revenue of $471 million increased by 84% compared to the same period last year.
During that period, it limited the rise in expenses to 24%, returning the company to profitability. Though the net income for the first two quarters of 2025 is just $3.2 million, it is a vast improvement from the $119 million loss during the same time frame in 2024. Investors have noticed these improvements, and the stock is up by almost 75% over the last year.
Admittedly, the profit levels are too modest to yield an applicable P/E ratio. Still, the forward earnings multiple of 40 is arguably cheap when considering its AI-driven potential for transformation, making Upstart stock an attractive choice for investors."

(BAC)strategists.
A BofA team led by Michael Hartnett studied 10 equity bubbles since the start of the previous century, finding that these periods of extreme overvaluation produced average trough-to-peak gains of 244%. That suggests that, after rising 223% from their March 2023 low, the so-called Magnificent Seven cohort has “more to go,” the strategists wrote in a note.

Current valuations also support the notion of further gains for the group, the strategists said. Past stock bubbles typically ended with trailing price-to-earnings ratios of 58, with the benchmark of these stocks 29% above its 200-day moving average.
The seven — Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) — have a trailing P/E ratio of 39 and are still only 20% above their 200-day DMA. This renders them the “best bubble proxy today,” Hartnett and his team wrote.
Appetite among investors for US tech megacaps has driven stocks to all-time highs this year and shows no signs of abating. The Magnificent Seven group recovered swiftly from the shocks caused by the Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek and the turmoil around Trump Administration trade-tariff announcements.
The S&P 500 Info Tech Index has surged 56% from its low in April, with investors buying into every dip along the way.
A positive macro-economic backdrop, the sustained frenzy around AI, along with expectations of further Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts are acting as tailwinds for the sector. In fact, the BofA fund manager survey released this week showed that “Long Magnificent Seven” was regarded as the most crowded trade for the second month running by 42% of respondents.
Hartnett and his team noted that bubbles tend to be short and very concentrated. Back in 2000, as internet-related stocks rallied to extreme levels, the tech sector rose 61% in six months to its peak, while every other S&P 500 sector was down that year.
Meanwhile, investors should also “barbell” their exposure to the Big Tech bubble with some holdings in “distressed value,” as these spurts of hyper-valuation boost economic growth as they unfold. Hartnett said current potential examples of such plays included Brazil, the UK and global energy stocks."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-19T10:25:00,The Rise of Amazon Ads: Who the Winners and Losers Are,Amazon's growing ad business and its partnership with Netflix could reshape connected TV advertising.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3bc505b6a646206e55e44a59fe985ed35f9029e94864c42771760d71d8c8c38d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,fool.com,200,,"Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) has quietly built a digital advertising business that's now too big to ignore. In 2024, Amazon Ads generated more than $50 billion in revenue, making it one of the fastest-growing segments of the company.
The company's recent partnership with Netflix only underlines Amazon's growing role in the space. By selling Netflix's advertising inventory through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), Amazon has solidified its position as a must-use platform for marketers. For investors, the question is no longer whether Amazon Ads is a real contender, but which players will win and which ones will lose as its influence expands.
Winners: Amazon, premium streamers, and advertisers
The most obvious winner here is Amazon itself. The company has a combination of advantages in the digital ad space that most of its rivals can only dream of: authenticated user data, purchase intent signals, and premium inventory across retail, video, and streaming. By combining these assets inside its demand-side platform, Amazon makes it easy for advertisers to reach high-value audiences with measurable outcomes.
The Netflix deal adds even more muscle. Streaming has become the new frontier of advertising, and Netflix is the crown jewel of connected TV inventory. By bringing Netflix ads into its DSP, Amazon gives marketers access to premium content and simplifies the buying process. For advertisers, that's efficient and measurable. For Amazon, it's a flywheel: more data, more inventory, and more ad dollars staying inside its ecosystem.
Advertisers also come out ahead -- at least in the short term. With Amazon, they get better targeting and closed-loop attribution, tying impressions directly to purchases. The flip side is concentration risk: The more marketing budgets shift into Amazon, the less leverage advertisers may have down the road, echoing what's already happened with Alphabet and Meta.
Premium streamers like Netflix (and Roku) also benefit. They gain access to Amazon's massive advertiser base and infrastructure, and they don't have to build their own sales machines from scratch. This ensures they can compete with traditional broadcasters and newer entrants alike.
Losers: Independent adtech companies, smaller publishers, and other ""walled gardens""
The rise of Amazon Ads is not good news for everyone. Independent demand-side platforms, especially The Trade Desk, could face more competitive pressure. For years, The Trade Desk positioned itself as the independent alternative to Google and Meta, offering neutrality, transparency, and cross-channel reach. However, if advertisers can purchase premium streaming inventory directly through Amazon's DSP, The Trade Desk's leverage could slowly diminish.
That said, neutrality still matters. Some advertisers may resist relying too heavily on Amazon, preferring to use independent platforms that can span connected TV, retail media, and the broader open web. The Trade Desk's relationships with Disney, Roku, and other publishers give it some weight, but it's too early to say whether such relationships will be enough to preserve the company's moat.
Smaller publishers also risk losing ground. If ad dollars consolidate into Amazon, Netflix, and other large platforms, independent websites could struggle to attract marketing spending. AI-driven search further complicates this picture, reducing traffic to traditional publishers and shrinking the open web ad supply.
Even Alphabet and Meta will feel the heat. While they still dominate digital advertising, Amazon is steadily taking more share in two critical areas: retail media and streaming video. Meta's performance ads look less differentiated when brands can advertise right at the point of purchase on Amazon. Alphabet faces pressure as product searches increasingly begin on Amazon rather than Google, while its YouTube unit must contend with Netflix and other streaming platforms selling ads through Amazon's DSP.
The bigger and longer-term picture
Amazon isn't just another player in digital advertising -- it's building a vertically integrated ecosystem. From retail data to Prime Video and now Netflix, Amazon controls both the data advertisers crave and a large slice of the available ad inventory. This integration makes it one of the most powerful ad businesses in the world.
For the industry, the trend is clear: Scale and data are driving consolidation. Advertisers increasingly want major partners that can deliver both reach and measurable results. Amazon checks both boxes, and that creates structural challenges not only for independents like The Trade Desk but also for giants like Alphabet and Meta.
What does it mean for investors?
Amazon Ads is a clear long-term winner. The Netflix deal strengthens Amazon's position in connected TV, expands its already rich inventory pool, and makes its DSP more indispensable to advertisers.
For rivals like The Trade Desk, the challenge is differentiation. Its neutrality, transparency, and ability to bridge multiple channels remain valuable, but the fight for premium streaming inventory is heating up.
In other words, Amazon isn't just competing in advertising anymore. It's setting the rules of the game. It's a great time to be bullish about Amazon stock (and to an extent, major publishers like Netflix or Roku), but less so on independent platforms like The Trade Desk."

- The service, which offers delivery in two-hour windows, includes Winn-Dixie stores in the greater metro areas of Jacksonville and Orlando, Florida, and allows consumers to shop from the regional grocer’s product assortment as well as Amazon’s grocery and household essentials selection.
- This announcement underscores how the company is looking to its e-commerce network to strengthen its grocery business.
Dive Insight:
Amazon is adding to its growing list of regional grocer partnerships, which already includes Bristol Farms, Cardenas Markets, Weis Markets, Metropolitan Market and FoodMaxx. The Winn-Dixie tie-up marks Amazon’s first local grocer partnership in the Jacksonville and Orlando markets, according to the press release.
Consumers can shop from either Amazon.com or Amazon’s shopping app and access more than 16,000 items across multiple categories, per the announcement.
To kick off the new offering, Amazon is allowing customers free two-hour delivery on all Winn-Dixie orders over $25, regardless of whether they are Prime members. The announcement added that Winn-Dixie members can link their rewards account with their Amazon account to earn one point for every $2 spent on Winn-Dixie orders via Amazon.
Last month, Amazon announced that it added perishable groceries to its same-day delivery service in more than 1,000 cities and towns across the U.S. The company plans to make the offering available in over 2,300 municipalities by the year’s close.
Internally, Amazon’s grocery executive makeup is also changing. Since announcing in January that Jason Buechel would helm the company’s entire grocery business, Amazon has restructured its Worldwide Grocery leadership team and further integrated Whole Foods Market under its corporate umbrella."

That momentum is likely to continue in the years ahead. AI spending across software and internet companies will grow more than 600% by 2028, according to Morgan Stanley.
While Nvidia and Palantir have been investor favorites where the AI trade is concerned, Amazon (AMZN -0.49%) and HubSpot (HUBS -2.27%) are also well positioned to benefit, and most Wall Street analysts think the stocks are undervalued today.
- Among 71 analysts, Amazon has a median target price of $264 per share. That implies 14% upside from its current share price of $231.
- Among 36 analysts, HubSpot has a median target price of $679 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $517.
Here's what investors should know about these AI stocks.
1. Amazon
Amazon has evolved from an online bookstore into a titan across three major industries: e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. The company has developed artificial intelligence products and features across all three business segments, but innovations in retail and cloud services are particularly noteworthy.
Retail
Amazon has built 1,000 generative AI applications to make its retail business more efficient, including tools that optimize inventory placement, demand forecasting, and last-mile delivery. It has also built an AI model that helps robots navigate warehouses faster, and it's building an AI model that lets workers engage robots conversationally. Amazon is also testing humanoid robots for package delivery.
Cloud
Amazon Web Services (AWS) has engineered custom chips for AI training and inference that management says offer better price performance than current GPUs. It has also introduced a generative AI development platform called Bedrock, and recently added tools that assist customers in building and scaling AI agents. Further, AWS is the primary cloud provider for Anthropic, one of the fastest-growing AI start-ups.
Amazon reported second-quarter financial results that crushed estimates on the top and bottom lines. Sales increased 13% to $168 billion on particularly strong sales growth in the advertising segment, coupled with solid momentum in the retail and cloud segments. Operating margin expanded more than a percentage point, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings rose 34% to $1.68 per diluted share.
Wall Street says Amazon's earnings will grow at 10% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look expensive. But I think analysts are underestimating. Amazon beat the consensus estimate by an average of 22% over the last six quarters, and spending across its three major markets is forecast to increase between 11% annually and 20% annually through 2030. Investors should feel comfortable buying this stock today.
2. HubSpot
HubSpot introduced its marketing automation software in 2006, and the company remains a leader in that space, but its product portfolio has evolved into a full customer relationship management (CRM) platform. It features productivity tools for sales, customer service, and marketing, as well as tools for commerce, data management, and content management.
Last year, HubSpot introduced Breeze, a suite of artificial intelligence features that simplify work across its CRM platform. Breeze includes a general copilot that handles simple tasks like summarizing business data, as well as customizable AI agents built for specific tasks like creating marketing content, engaging sales leads, and answering customer questions.
HubSpot reported solid second-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Its customer count increased 18%, and the average subscription revenue per existing customer increased 1%. Revenue rose 19% to $761 million, and non-GAAP earnings rose 13% to $2.19 per diluted share. CEO Yamini Rangan said strong adoption of AI features across the CRM platform was a key contributor.
Wall Street estimates HubSpot's adjusted earnings will grow at 22% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 61 times earnings look relatively expensive. However, HubSpot consistently beat the consensus earnings estimate in the last six quarters, and I think that trend will continue as the company pursues what management sees as a $128 billion opportunity by 2029. Investors should consider buying a small position."

- FedEx expects to fully onboard its large-package delivery deal with Amazon by the carrier's third quarter, which runs from December to February, EVP and Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said on an earnings call Thursday.
- The arrangement announced in May had minimal impact on FedEx's first quarter, according to Carere. But once onboarding is complete, the Amazon volume ""will support continued U.S. domestic revenue growth in the quarters ahead,"" she added.
- FedEx will deliver the volume — consisting of heavier-weight parcels — as part of its Ground portfolio, Carere said at a May investor conference. She emphasized that the deal isn't on the scale of Amazon's UPS arrangement, which is shrinking as UPS prioritizes more profitable shipments.
Dive Insight:
FedEx executives touted Amazon and several other customer wins in the earnings call as the carrier looks to maintain momentum in a volatile trade environment.
For example, Carere pointed out Best Buy's recent decision to name FedEx as the retailer's primary national parcel carrier. Best Buy will tap into an ""advanced visibility tool"" from the delivery giant to provide real-time tracking and customer order communication, she said.
""By providing customers with more timely and accurate updates, the company also expects to reduce support calls, cancellations and reship costs,"" Carere said.
Beyond large-scale shippers, FedEx grew revenue tied to U.S. small- and medium-sized businesses by more than 10% YoY in Q1. Small shippers are a lucrative target for both FedEx and UPS, and FedEx is leaning on direct sales, its loyalty program and other tactics to gain an edge.
""This was fueled by focused and targeted sales execution and a close alignment between our sales and our operations teams,"" Carere said of the revenue jump. ""This collaboration is accelerating onboarding, shortening deal cycles and driving meaningful new acquisition.""
FedEx is overhauling its U.S. operations in the midst of these customer additions. The company's Network 2.0 plan aims to merge its historically separate Express and Ground networks to boost its bottom line and improve its competitive positioning.
Through that effort, FedEx is shuttering dozens of facilities to minimize operational overlap. The company has closed about 140 facilities and converted 360 stations to handle the combined volume so far, President and CEO Raj Subramaniam said on the call. As progress continues, FedEx exited Q1 with 18% of its U.S. average daily volume flowing through the new Network 2.0 model."

As of mid-September, the stock is up only about the mid-single digits year to date, while the S&P 500 is up roughly in the low teens. That gap has opened even as the retailer and cloud leader posted strong financial results and guided to solid growth.
Amazon, of course, is the e-commerce and cloud-infrastructure giant behind online retail, Prime, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). With the market's attention rotating across themes this year, Amazon's quieter performance masks improving fundamentals. That mismatch sets up a straightforward case: The business is strengthening while the growth stock is merely getting by, creating an opportunity for investors who want to get off the sidelines and own shares of a great company for the long haul.
Momentum is building where it matters
Amazon's latest quarter underscored durable growth and expanding profitability. In Q2, the company's net sales rose 13% to $167.7 billion and operating income climbed 31% to $19.2 billion, lifting the operating margin to 11.4%, up substantially from 9.9% in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share were $1.68, up 33% year over year. Management also pointed to a healthy outlook: Third-quarter net sales are expected to grow 10% to 13%, with operating income between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion.
Beneath the headline numbers, the three engines investors care most about are moving in the right direction. First, AWS revenue increased 17% to $30.9 billion. Operating margin in the segment was 32.9%. While that margin is lower than the prior quarter as Amazon invests in capacity and power to meet artificial intelligence (AI) demand, trailing-12-month AWS operating margin remains a robust 36.8%. Second, advertising services revenue rose 23% to $15.7 billion, showing the company's growing clout with merchants and brands. Third, the core retail network continues to scale efficiently: operating income in its important North America retail segment increased 48% to $7.5 billion, with the segment margin improving to 7.5%. Its international retail segment saw operating income jump from $0.3 billion to $1.5 billion as sales rose 16% year over year.
In his comments in the company's second-quarter earnings release, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy drew attention to AI.
""Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I'm excited for what lies ahead,"" Jassy said.
Put simply, Amazon is converting more of its enormous revenue base into profit as logistics and data center assets scale.
The investment case today
The near-term bear case boils down to two points: massive capital expenditures and competition. Capital spending remains heavy as Amazon expands data centers, networking, and power to support AI workloads; reflecting the build-out, trailing-12-month free cash flow (the cash left over after both regular operations and capital expenditures are taken care of) was $18.2 -- down from $53 billion in the year-ago period. And in cloud, Microsoft and Alphabet are formidable, well-capitalized competitors that are similarly investing aggressively in AI.
Those are real considerations, but they sit alongside strengthening unit economics in retail, a rapidly expanding ads business, and a cloud platform that is growing rapidly as Amazon pivots to AI-centric demand. Additionally, Amazon's significant investment in AI can also be seen as a reason to be upbeat. After all, the company wouldn't be spending so aggressively if it didn't believe there would be a payoff.
With shares trading in the low-$230s as of this writing, Amazon trades for roughly 35 times earnings. That is not cheap, but context matters: Operating margin for the company has marched from single digits to more than 11%, and the company could see additional operating leverage as revenue rises and as AWS becomes a larger share of overall revenue. Additionally, if AWS's already lucrative margins stabilize as new capacity comes online, and retail continues to generate mid- to high-single-digit margins at scale, earnings power may climb faster than revenue over the next few years. In that scenario, today's multiple may not look demanding.
On the other hand, a slower economy could weigh on discretionary spending, and cloud optimization could resurface. Further, power constraints or supply chain delays tied to data center buildouts could also pressure AWS's margins in the near term. Investors, therefore, should keep an eye on capex and AWS profitability as leading indicators.
But the bigger picture is constructive. Amazon is firing on several cylinders: retail margins are improving as the logistics network densifies, advertising is growing at meaningful rates, and AWS remains the backbone for thousands of enterprises. Not to mention that Amazon is layering in AI services across its business, creating new long-term growth opportunities. These dynamics -- broad-based growth, rising profitability, and aggressive investment in AI -- make a compelling case to use 2025's relative underperformance as an opportunity to buy into the stock's weakness. For investors looking to beef up a portfolio with a high-quality compounder, buying Amazon while sentiment is only lukewarm could prove to be lucrative over the long term."

But probably not this time.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c1446191a5f0ef1cd75cd1bb048419e4260edc2564ba00049c5bf329249d154e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia (NVDA 0.03%) enjoys great relationships with some of the biggest tech companies on the planet. Its customer base includes the three largest cloud service providers: Amazon (AMZN -0.49%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.01%), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 1.95%) (GOOGL 1.78%).
However, Nvidia's reach isn't limited to the biggest of the big. It also works closely with many rising stars. CoreWeave (CRWV 3.47%) is arguably the most prominent example, especially considering that Nvidia has a multibillion-dollar stake in the AI-focused hyperscaler.
It stands to reason that Nvidia wants all these partners to succeed. But did the GPU giant just help Amazon, Microsoft, and Google at CoreWeave's expense?
Nvidia's retreat
Nvidia launched DGX Cloud in 2023. The company billed the new platform as a way for enterprises to get immediate access to Nvidia's AI supercomputers so they could train generative AI and other advanced AI models.
But Nvidia appears to be retreating from this market. The Information, a website that focuses on technology industry news, recently reported that Nvidia is primarily using DGX Cloud for internal use now instead of marketing the platform to customers.
Is there other evidence that supports the view that Nvidia is shifting its strategy? Maybe. In the past, Nvidia highlighted its DGX Cloud services when discussing cloud spending commitments in its quarterly 10-Q filings. In the company's update for the second quarter of 2025, though, DGX Cloud wasn't mentioned in this context.
Instead of marketing the DGX Cloud platform to customers, Nvidia appears to be focusing now on its Lepton GPU rental marketplace. CEO Jensen Huang explained in the May 2025 announcement of Lepton that the new service ""connects our network of global GPU cloud providers with AI developers.""
Helping the ""big three,"" hurting CoreWeave?
Some industry observers saw DGX Cloud as a move for Nvidia to compete against the major cloud service providers. But Nvidia rented GPUs from CoreWeave to use with DGX Cloud. Could the company's reported move to back away from marketing DGX Cloud help Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud while hurting CoreWeave? The short answer is ""no.""
For one thing, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud host DGX Cloud. Although AWS didn't, there's no solid proof that Nvidia's cloud platform hurt its business.
A retreat from DGX Cloud wouldn't hurt CoreWeave, either. CoreWeave recently disclosed that Nvidia will purchase $6.3 billion of its unused cloud computing capacity through April 13, 2032.
Perhaps most importantly, though, Nvidia might not be retreating from DGX Cloud as reported by The Information after all. According to Data Center Dynamics, Alexis Bjorlin, who is Nvidia's vice president and general manager for DGX Cloud, said, ""DGX Cloud is fully utilized and oversubscribed, and we are expanding its scale.""
Winners all around
Whatever Nvidia's strategy with DGX Cloud is, I don't think CoreWeave has anything to worry about. My view is that all of these stocks -- Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and CoreWeave -- are poised to be big winners over the long run.
The AI boom doesn't appear to be slowing down. That's great news for Nvidia because more of its GPUs will be needed. It's great news for Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and CoreWeave because their cloud platforms will continue to enjoy tremendous demand.
It's possible that the momentum could even accelerate. I think Nvidia's technological advances will play a key role, if so. For example, the company plans to launch Rubin CPX, a new class of GPUs built for massive-context inference, in late 2026. This new technology could pave the way for an explosion in the use of AI in software development and long-form video creation.
As the smallest of the group, CoreWeave might have the most room to run. However, I expect all five of these top AI stocks will deliver tremendous gains over the next 10 years and beyond."

According to Mordor Intelligence, the global retail market is forecast to expand to $27.3 trillion this year, with an annualized growth rate topping 6% through 2030.
Despite the razor-thin margins often associated with retail sales, the rewards can be lucrative for the businesses that stand out, such as Amazon, Walmart, and Costco Wholesale (COST 0.82%).
But what makes these three retail leaders successful is their dynamic operating approach. They're constantly innovating in their own unique ways and finding new pathways to boost sales and keep customers loyal to their ecosystem of products and services. This is especially true for warehouse club Costco, which has made three sizable changes over the last year, including a brand-new perk that's dividing many of its 79.6 million paying members.
1. The first annual membership fee increases in seven years
No change has been more pronounced over the last year than Costco's decision to increase its annual membership fees.
Beginning on Sept. 1, 2024, Gold Star and Business members saw their annual membership fee rise from $60 to $65, while Executive cardholders had their yearly fee jump from $120 to $130. It's also worth noting that Executive cardholders receive 2% back on most qualifying purchases, and the annual amount back they're eligible to receive increased from $1,000 to $1,250 on Sept. 1, 2024.
This was a seemingly long overdue fee increase, with the last occurring in 2017.
While this is a relatively small price to pay for consumers to gain access to Costco's warehouses, it's a big deal for the company and Costco stock shareholders. It purposely purchases products in bulk to lower its per-unit cost and undercut mom-and-pop shops and national grocery chains on price. To ensure that it can keep its prices well below the competition on the basic need goods that draw consumers into its stores, it leans on membership fees to do the heavy lifting.
Costco's membership fees flow almost directly to its bottom line. They provide a healthy margin buffer that allows the company to offer amazing grocery deals and to buy unique items that you'll only find in its warehouses (gold bars and one-off, high-end jewelry and timepieces).
2. Required members to scan their card or QR code at store entrance
The second meaningful adjustment made to Costco's rules and policies over the last year was clamping down on non-members entering its stores.
In August 2024, Costco Wholesale announced plans to begin using scanning devices at the entrance of all of its locations, which would be implemented in the ""coming months."" Members would be required to scan their membership card or a digital QR code upon entry, and may have to show valid identification if their membership card doesn't have a photo on it.
This change was made to ensure that its aforementioned 79.6 million paying members, as of the end of the fiscal third quarter (May 11, 2025), are the one's receiving all the perks. Removing non-members from the equation helps Costco maintain its razor-thin margins on popular items, and also plays a critical role in keeping food court prices down.
In addition to having members scan their membership card upon entry, Costco removed the ability for non-members to purchase food court items, which includes the famous $1.50 hot dog combo.
3. Offered a new shopping perk to its highest tier of cardholders
But the change that's left its domestic membership base divided went into effect earlier this month.
Initially announced in June but not fully implemented until Sept. 2, Executive cardholders have exclusive early morning shopping access to Costco's U.S. warehouses seven days a week. During weekdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., only Executive members are allowed to shop in its stores. On Saturdays, this exclusive shopping window is narrowed to 30 minutes, 9 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
As you can imagine, this probably doesn't sit well with U.S. Gold Star and Business cardholders -- but it serves a purpose.
According to the company, 37.6 million (47%) of its 79.6 million paying members are Executive tier. However, these 47% accounted for 73.1% of net sales during the fiscal third quarter. Pleasing this group of cardholders and ensuring their annual renewal rate is above 90% is paramount to Costco's long-term success. For what it's worth, the cumulative renewal rate for members across all tiers was a solid 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada during the fiscal third quarter.
Furthermore, dangling the proverbial carrot of exclusive shopping hours, following a $250 increase to annual Executive membership rewards last year, provides a catalyst for Gold Star and Business members to upgrade. The more cardholders are spending on their annual membership, the more likely they are to make Costco their first shopping choice. After all, they're going to want to get as much out of their membership fee as possible.
While this may not be the last we hear about exclusive shopping hours for Costco's highest tier of cardholders, it's an undeniably a smart move from a proven growth stock in the retail space."

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-18T18:19:42,"Amazon Earmarks More Than $1B for Increased Employee Wages, Benefits",Amazon said the average employee's compensation will increase to $23 an hour.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2f36809a212e4463584e47fa6e1729210b7433c721791205e9174b7c56a87202,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/amazon-labor-employees-pay-increase-benefits-ecommerce-holiday-1234780261/,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/amazon-labor-employees-pay-increase-benefits-ecommerce-holiday-1234780261/,https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/labor/amazon-labor-employees-pay-increase-benefits-ecommerce-holiday-1234780261/,sourcingjournal.com,200,,"Amazon announced Wednesday it has invested $1 billion toward higher wages and better benefits for its employees.
The company said the average hourly pay for its fulfillment and transportation employees will increase to more than $23, excluding benefits; if an employee worked 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they would earn just less than $48,000 if their wage was $23 an hour. Inclusive of benefits, the company estimates that the average employee earns more than $30 an hour.
Amazon said it has also changed its step plan—which sees employees’ pay increasing for each additional year they spend with Amazon—so that the company can issue larger pay increases between years than it previously had. It did not specify the exact changes it made to that plan.
In September 2024, the company said it had increased compensation to average out at $22 an hour excluding benefits and $29 an hour including benefits, so its latest announcement represents a $1 per hour change year over year. In 2024, the company said it had allocated $2.2 billion to those wage increases. In 2023, Amazon said its $1.3 billion investment in pay increases brought the average hourly pay to $20.50 per hour.
The federal minimum wage stands at $7.25, though 34 U.S. states, territories and districts have put minimum wages higher than the federal level into effect, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In addition to its straight-up wage increase promises, Amazon has further invested in providing lower-cost benefits to its employees, it said. For its entry-level healthcare package, Amazon employees will see $5 per week deducted from their pay; the company also said that, for standard visits, employees will pay a $5 copay. Those changes will take effect in 2026, and the e-tail giant said the new plan will see a 34 percent reduction in employees’ weekly contributions to health plans and an 87 percent reduction in the copays they dole out for primary care, mental health and non-specialist visits.
Udit Madan, senior vice president, Amazon Worldwide Operations, said the company’s attention to benefits helps it stand out as an employer in the e-commerce realm.
“We know that things like health care, education and retirement contributions play a critical role in employees’ and their families’ long-term wellbeing,” Madan wrote in the blog announcing the updates. “Benefits like that are still too rare in our industry, but we strongly believe that investing in them is the right thing to do for our teammates. And we’ve continued to invest through the years to make them even better.”
The e-tail giant’s announcement comes ahead of the holidays, which it said remain “a time when we’re reminded just how much the work that our teams do matters.”
Madan said the company’s yearly practice of upgrading employee pay is an example of its commitment to “constantly listening and working to keep getting better, every day, together.”
“These investments are part of our ongoing commitment to making Amazon a place where people can thrive, and I look forward to delivering the future together,” he wrote."

The offer builds on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) multi-channel fulfillment service for merchants on other sales channels, including eBay, Etsy, Temu and TikTok Shop. Leveraging one shared inventory pool with Fulfillment by Amazon allows businesses to simplify order processing and quickly set up sales channels on new online stores, eliminating the time and cost associated with establishing separate fulfillment operations, Amazon said in a news release.
“By working with Shein, Shopify, and Walmart, we’re making it easier for sellers — especially the small and medium-sized businesses that drive our economy — to use our network to grow faster and more efficiently across their sales channels,” said Peter Larsen, vice president of Amazon Multichannel Commerce & Fulfillment.
Sellers can outsource the fulfillment of their orders from off-Amazon channels, including their own brand websites, to Amazon through Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment. The service is available in 11 countries, with deliveries made seven days per week. Fulfillment by Amazon is the service through which sellers can outsource fulfillment of their Amazon.com orders to Amazon.
The e-tailer is providing digital tools for merchants to set up fulfillment for products sold on other marketplaces, according to the news release.
Shopify merchants can select Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment within the Shopify administrative system. After linking their Amazon Seller Central account to their Shopify account, merchants can configure their Shopify orders to automatically be routed to Amazon for fulfillment. Businesses benefit from automatic inventory synchronization, real-time order tracking and delivery estimates, and performance metrics.
Walmart sellers can either create order requests manually through Amazon Seller Central or select from dozens of integration partners like WebBee, Pipe17, Rithum, Goflow, and Lingxing. Merchants using an integration partner with Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment will automatically have their Walmart orders routed to Amazon for fulfillment. In addition to similar features enjoyed through Shopify, Walmart merchants can expect delivery in unbranded packaging and the option to choose from a variety of shipping carriers.
A dedicated Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment app for Shein will be available by year-end in Amazon Seller Central and the Supply Chain Portal, as well as Shein’s Seller Hub. After linking their Amazon Seller Central account to their Shopify account, merchants can configure their Shopify orders to automatically be routed to Amazon MCF for fulfillment."

Fable Expands AI Ambitions Beyond Movie Recreation
Fable positions itself as the “Netflix of AI” and has built a platform allowing users to create cartoons through AI prompts. The company has already generated unauthorized “South Park” episodes, raising questions about intellectual property boundaries in the AI era.
Filmmaker Brian Rose, who has spent five years working to digitally reconstruct Welles’ original vision, plans to use Fable’s new AI model over the next two years to remake the lost footage. Rose mourned the destruction of “a four-minute-long, unbroken moving camera shot whose loss is a tragedy,” with only 50 seconds remaining in the recut film, TechCrunch reported.
The planned approach combines AI with traditional filmmaking techniques. Some scenes will be reshot with contemporary actors whose faces will be digitally swapped for recreations of the original cast, including Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead.

Estate Calls Project “Purely Mechanical Exercise” Without Creative Vision
A Welles estate spokesperson's criticism extends beyond legal concerns to artistic integrity, describing the project as “a purely mechanical exercise without any of the uniquely innovative thinking of a creative force like Welles.”
The estate representative seemed less upset about attempting to recreate “Ambersons” and more frustrated that the estate was not “even given the courtesy of a heads up.” They told Variety that “the estate has embraced AI technology to create a voice model intended to be used for voiceover work with brands.”"

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN, Financials) violated a federal consumer protection law by gathering billing information from Prime customers before fully disclosing the service's terms, a U.S. judge ruled Wednesday.
The decision by District Judge John Chun gives the Federal Trade Commission an early advantage as it pursues claims that Amazon misled consumers into signing up for Prime and made cancellations deliberately difficult. The FTC says tens of millions of people were enrolled without consent and that similar numbers faced obstacles trying to leave the program.
The case centers on the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act, which requires clear disclosure of subscription terms before billing. Judge Chun also ruled that two Amazon executives can be held personally liable if the FTC proves its claims, while rejecting Amazon's argument that the law does not apply to Prime signups.
An Amazon spokesperson said the company disagrees with the ruling, adding that neither the firm nor its executives acted improperly. We always put customers first, the spokesperson said.
The trial will determine whether Amazon must provide restitution and change its subscription practices. For investors, the outcome could shape how subscription models across the tech sector are regulated going forward."

The company has been actively exploring options to reduce carbon emissions from its sprawling delivery operations. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) began rolling out electric vans in 2022 and aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions across operations by 2040.
In an email statement to Bloomberg last week, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) confirmed it was testing the BrightDrops:
“We’re committed to having 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030, and we regularly test various vehicle options — including a small number of Chevrolet BrightDrops in our fleet.”
According to reports, about a dozen vans are currently being tested, placing the BrightDrops among a fleet that also includes vehicles built by Ford, Mercedes, Stellantis, and Rivian.
Company spokesperson Steve Kelly has said that the pilot would not affect the e-commerce firm’s work with Rivian. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) holds a 16% stake in Rivian and has over 25,000 of its vehicles in its fleet.
While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-18T16:09:00,Will Live Sports Be the Next Revenue Driver for TTD's CTV Business?,"Live sports streaming is becoming integral to The Trade Desk's CTV push, offering advertisers precision targeting during peak moments.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=dd795cf020c395c1ecec84389c0d123b38e4b6330997e7bde2982612e8ed0b2f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live-sports-next-revenue-driver-150900133.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live-sports-next-revenue-driver-150900133.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live-sports-next-revenue-driver-150900133.html,yahoo.com,200,,"The Trade Desk TTD is focused on boosting its Connected TV (“CTV”) business by capitalizing on the shift from linear to programmatic CTV. TTD had earlier referred to CTV as the “kingpin of the open internet.” On the recent earnings call, management highlighted that programmatic CTV continues to deliver the “most effective and highest return on ad spend,” strengthening TTD’s position in the market.
Live sports streaming is emerging as a pivotal part of the company’s CTV strategy. Once considered the last bastion of linear TV, live sports, including NBA and football matches, are now widely available on streaming platforms.
The Trade Desk sees this shift as a major growth opportunity and is focused on gaining share in the lucrative live sports streaming area. TTD is looking to offer advertisers the full value of live sports by allowing them to bid on key moments in live games, such as NBA overtime or soccer penalty shootouts, when engagement peaks. This type of precision targeting highlights the advantages of programmatic CTV, expanding opportunities for advertisers to connect with audiences in real time. The partnerships with Disney, Sky TV and Omnicom, and new tools in Kokai will aid TTD in providing such bids to advertisers.
Live sports strengthen TTD’s competitive moat in the CTV space, which is already its “fastest-growing” channel, contributing to 19% revenue growth year over year in the second quarter of 2025.
Nonetheless, intense competition from walled gardens like Google and Amazon AMZN will remain a challenge. AMZN’s expanding DSP business is giving tough competition to TTD, especially in the CTV space. Beyond big tech, independent ad-tech companies, such as Magnite MGNI, are expanding their presence in CTV and retail media and competing for ad dollars.
Taking a Look at CTV Efforts for AMZN & MGNI
With annual ad services revenues of $56.2 billion in 2024, Amazon is quickly gaining market share in the digital ad space. Currently, it is one of the leading DSP players. AMZN is ramping up investment in the DSP and CTV businesses, putting it in direct competition with TTD. Amazon DSP platform allows advertisers to plan, activate and measure full funnel campaigns. The DSP platform leverages trillions of proprietary browsing, shopping and streaming signals. When paired with AMZN’s wide-ranging supply-side relationships and secure clean rooms, these help advertisers achieve optimization and higher ROI.
Collaborations with Roku (access to 80 million authenticated U.S. CTV households) and Disney (access to Disney+, ESPN and Hulu) significantly expand Amazon DSP’s reach. In the United States, advertisers can now reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 300 million across its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch, Fire TV, Live sports (NFL, NASCAR, NBA), as well as third-party websites and apps."

In January 2021, Parler was wiped out overnight accused of “inciting violence” and tied to January 6th. The punishment was catastrophic: more than 20 million voices silenced, with Amazon Web Services pointing to a mere 98 flagged posts as justification.
Fast forward to 2025: Bluesky, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Meta, and Discord are flooded with thousands of posts celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk and inciting violence against conservatives. Yet none of these platforms face bans, removals, or even warnings. “This is the very definition of a diabolical double standard,” said Elise Pierotti, Co-Founder and Sr. VP of Business Development at Parler.
Even industry leaders are calling out hypocrisy. On September 14, 2025, Elon Musk endorsed an X post stating that Parler was removed from Apple’s App Store for “0.1% of the extremist vitriol now rampant on Bluesky and Reddit,” replying simply: “True.” U.S. Senator Mike Lee has also demanded answers: “What does Apple’s targeting of Parler—but not Bluesky or Reddit—reveal about its political bias and monopolistic control over app store markets?”
Parler asks the question Big Tech refuses to answer:
“Why was Parler obliterated without due process over 98 posts, while platforms hosting thousands of violent threats remain untouched?”
Our Stance on Speech
Parler has always stood unapologetically for free expression. We reject the censorship of so-called “hate speech,” a subjective label that is selectively enforced. At the same time, we recognize clear constitutional boundaries: direct calls for violence and unlawful threats are not protected speech—and Parler enforces against them. Our standard is simple: open discourse, yes. Incitement to violence, no.
The Hidden Hand of Government Influence
Recent reports revealed that USAID funded Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, which produced reports later weaponized to justify Parler’s deplatforming. This raises serious questions: Why are taxpayer dollars being used to silence lawful speech in America?
Parler Returns Stronger
Despite every effort to erase us, Parler has returned bigger, stronger, and untouchable. Today, Parler operates on decentralized hosting, a rewards system, and integrations with more than 20 platforms —ensuring no single gatekeeper will ever silence us again. “Against every attempt to destroy us, we are still here,” Pierotti said. “Our ecosystem is unshakable, and our voice is louder than ever.”"

While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-18T15:37:00,"Should You Invest $1,000 in Media Giant Paramount Right Now?",Influxes of cash and technology make this an appealing investment.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=31b1b5b5041010c72dbb264c01f649f2f7eca12ec4ad1ce16cb7d2e61bfe69e0,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/should-you-invest-1000-in-media-giant-paramount-ri/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/should-you-invest-1000-in-media-giant-paramount-ri/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/should-you-invest-1000-in-media-giant-paramount-ri/,fool.com,200,,"Hollywood is a cutthroat business.
Over the past couple of decades, the old studio system has fallen apart and the carcasses of those legendary film giants picked clean or outcompeted by well-funded, high-tech interlopers like Amazon.com (AMZN -0.49%) and Netflix (NFLX -0.61%).
Right now, what a Hollywood studio needs to survive -- and perhaps even thrive -- is oodles of cash and access to new technologies.
That's why an investment today of just $1,000 in Paramount Skydance (PSKY 0.14%) might pay off handsomely down the road.
A wealthy new owner
You may have heard that Larry Ellison, the CEO and co-founder of software giant Oracle (ORCL 1.24%), briefly became the wealthiest human on the planet earlier this month. The price of his company's stock surged on great earnings news and sent him ahead of Tesla (TSLA 1.26%) CEO Elon Musk for a while.
Skydance Media, a movie production and media company owned by the Ellison family, acquired Paramount last month for $8 billion, creating a new media conglomerate called Paramount Skydance. That deal suddenly gives the aging movie and television production firm a new lease on life -- and a massive injection of cash it can use to compete better.
Paramount is a Hollywood legend. It was one of the original ""Big Five"" studios in Los Angeles. It produced legendary films such as The Godfather, Chinatown, Titanic, and the Mission: Impossible, Indiana Jones, and Star Trek franchises, among many, many other recognizable films and television shows.
Paramount's current portfolio includes:
- Paramount Pictures and Television
- CBS and CBS News
- Nickelodeon, MTV, and BET
- Comedy Central
- Showtime
- Paramount+ streaming
Investors burned
Despite those assets, Paramount stock languished for years before the recent merger. The company struggled to compete in a fast-evolving media industry that needed to adapt to new technologies and changing viewer behaviors.
The stock burned none other than the Oracle of Omaha (different Oracle). Beginning in 2022, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.22%) (BRK.B -0.35%) accumulated 63 million shares of Paramount, but the stock fell 44% in 2022 and another 12% in 2023. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett sold the entire Paramount stake in 2024 for a loss.
But with the recent merger, Paramount now has an influx of essentially endless money from one of the world's richest families. It also has a close connection to a major tech firm (Oracle). That's likely to come in handy as new technologies -- from streaming to virtual reality and 3D pictures to artificial intelligence and machine learning -- continue to transform the entertainment industry.
Bold moves
David Ellison, Larry's son and CEO of the new conglomerate, is already using his father's fortune to make bold moves. Those include a recent $7.7 billion deal for rights to Ultimate Fighting Championship content and the acquisition of the rights to South Park.
Ellison is also working on an acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. movie and television studio.
In an Aug. 7 letter to shareholders and employees, Ellison promised to use cutting-edge technologies ""to transform Paramount into a tech-forward company that blends the creative heart of Hollywood with the innovative spirit of Silicon Valley.""
Trading at just under 13 times future earnings, Paramount Skydance is a bargain at the moment. The company has a market cap of just under $20 million, about 77% of which is owned by the Ellison family.
If you think technology and money can move an aging movie studio into the future (as I do), and that good things are in store for Paramount Skydance and its shareholders, you should consider an investment today before the shares become expensive."

By using Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment for sales channels beyond Amazon, merchants have reported an average 19% increase in sales, as well as reduced out of stock rates and improved inventory turnover from one shared pool of inventory
Amazon continues to help businesses accelerate growth by offering quick and reliable delivery for orders from Amazon.com, their own websites, other online retailers, and social media channels
SEATTLE, September 18, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today at Amazon’s Accelerate seller conference, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced the expansion of its third-party logistics (3PL) product, Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF), to support merchants on SHEIN, Shopify, and Walmart. This growth builds on Amazon MCF’s proven success in enabling fulfillment for merchants on other sales channels including eBay, Etsy, Temu, and TikTok Shop. By leveraging one shared inventory pool with Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), Amazon MCF empowers businesses to simplify their fulfillment, increase sales through existing channels, and quickly launch in new online stores. This eliminates the time and cost investment associated with establishing separate fulfillment operations, giving merchants large and small a powerful advantage to grow their businesses. Amazon MCF’s expansion to SHEIN, Shopify, and Walmart is part of Amazon’s focus on helping merchants build and scale their business on Amazon.com, their own websites, other online retailers, and social media channels.
""Amazon’s world-class fulfillment network delights customers with fast, reliable delivery—fueling the success of independent sellers in the U.S. and around the world,"" said Peter Larsen, Vice President of Amazon Multichannel Commerce & Fulfillment. ""By working with SHEIN, Shopify, and Walmart, we're making it easier for sellers— especially the small and medium-sized businesses that drive our economy—to use our network to grow faster and more efficiently across their sales channels.""
Simplifying Order Fulfillment Across Sales Channels
Merchants can seamlessly integrate Amazon MCF to help manage their inventory and streamline fulfillment for their SHEIN, Shopify, and Walmart orders in the following ways:
-
SHEIN U.S. Marketplace: By year-end, Amazon will make it easier for SHEIN merchants to choose Amazon MCF to fulfill their SHEIN Marketplace orders through the Amazon MCF for SHEIN app. The free app will be found in Amazon Seller Central, Amazon’s Supply Chain Portal, and the SHEIN Seller Hub. By using the Amazon MCF for SHEIN app, merchants will be able to delight their SHEIN Marketplace customers with fast, reliable delivery from Amazon MCF."

These factors, among others, have led CBRE Chief Strategy Officer of Building Operations & Experience Annie Dean to say that companies need to rethink the office experience.
""People and companies know that offices are changing and that offices need to start feeling maybe a little bit more like hotels, with great service, seamless technology, inspiring design, and workplaces that create a true sense of place,” she told Business Insider.
“When offices are positioned and built to draw people in, then community develops,"" she continued. ""And that’s really important for business — among other things.”
Dean is serious about office redesign. In her role at CBRE, she will oversee a new project called the CBRE x Industrious Building Experience Lab.

When everything is virtual, the real world matters more than ever. And as a result, the world is ready for a different kind of workplace experience.

We'll now examine how JetBlue's expanded Fort Lauderdale operations and improved cost outlook may influence its investment narrative.
AI is about to change healthcare. These 31 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.
JetBlue Airways Investment Narrative Recap
To be a JetBlue shareholder today, you need conviction in the airline’s ability to capture growing leisure travel demand while steadily managing cost pressures, especially given volatile revenue and earnings streams. The expansion in Fort Lauderdale and better cost outlook may strengthen near-term results if demand holds up, but persistent labor pressures remain the most significant risk to sustainable margin improvement. The latest announcements are positive but do not fundamentally alter the near-term demand and margin catalysts central to JetBlue’s investment case.
The recent Fort Lauderdale route expansion, with nine new destinations and enhanced services, underscores JetBlue’s ongoing push to optimize its network and reinforce its leadership in core leisure markets. This move is especially relevant in the context of rising customer demand and network realignment, both current drivers for revenue improvement and near-term financial performance. However, sustained cost discipline will likely remain essential for longer-term profitability.
In contrast, investors should also be aware that ongoing pressure on labor costs could quickly...

JetBlue Airways’ outlook anticipates $10.6 billion in revenue and $728.0 million in earnings by 2028. Achieving this would require annual revenue growth of 5.1% and an earnings increase of $1,114 million from current earnings of -$386.0 million.
Uncover how JetBlue Airways' forecasts yield a $4.42 fair value, a 13% downside to its current price.
Exploring Other Perspectives
Seven private investors in the Simply Wall St Community estimate JetBlue’s fair value between US$3 and US$340.49 per share. While views differ widely, many still see rising labor costs as a potential headwind for any turnaround in profitability, suggesting the importance of weighing different perspectives on the company’s future."

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-18T10:30:00,Prediction: This Is What Amazon's Stock Will Be Worth by 2030,Amazon has the potential to be a top growth stock in the market.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=fa89722127f31f60f0fba608516f39a44888c060e868726776c6769bcc1997ef,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/prediction-amazon-stock-price-worth-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/prediction-amazon-stock-price-worth-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/prediction-amazon-stock-price-worth-2030/,fool.com,200,,"Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) is one of the world's most recognizable companies. Its e-commerce platform is responsible for delivering billions of dollars worth of goods every year in over 100 countries around the globe, and has led the e-commerce revolution. However, the e-commerce shift has largely played out, and with artificial intelligence (AI) investing dominating the market, it may seem like Amazon stock is out of favor.
But that's not the case. Amazon is also heavily involved in the AI arms race and has another exciting division that's driving impressive growth. The combination of a strong base business alongside a couple that are growing rapidly can lead to long-term outperformance, making Amazon an intriguing stock to buy now.
But what kind of growth can Amazon investors expect by 2030? Let's find out.
Two divisions are driving Amazon's outsize profit growth
Amazon's commerce divisions are well known, but there is a fact that's not as widely known: This business isn't as profitable as one might think. In Q2, Amazon's North American commerce divisions generated $7.5 billion in operating profit on sales of $100 billion. However, most of that profit likely comes from one unlikely source: digital advertisements.
Amazon's advertising services divisions have been rapidly growing behind the scenes, and are a large reason why Amazon's operating profits have improved over the past few years. In Q2, ad services revenue rose 23% year over year, making it the fastest-growing division within Amazon. While Amazon doesn't break out the individual operating margins per segment, this division likely has impressive margins. Another advertising-focused business, Meta Platforms, has consistently delivered operating profits between 30% and 45% over the last five years. That's quite a bit higher than Amazon's divisionwide operating margin of 7.5%, so it's likely that the faster advertising service growth rate will continue to improve Amazon's operating profits.
One division where Amazon breaks out the operating margin outside of commerce is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division. AWS is the world's largest cloud provider, having experienced several years of impressive growth. It's also benefiting from the AI arms race, as several clients lack the resources to build their own data centers for training and running AI models, so they rent them from AWS.
AWS' operating margins are significantly better than those of its commerce siblings, as it reported an impressive 33% operating margin. That's down from Q1's 39% margin, but it makes sense considering how much money AWS is spending to build out increased computing capacity due to massive demand.
Cloud computing is expected to be a massive growth trend over the next few years, with Grand View Research estimating that the global cloud computing market will expand from $752 billion in 2024 to $2.39 trillion by 2030. That's massive growth, and shows that AWS will continue to be a strong profit driver for Amazon over the next five years.
With two strong growth trends propelling Amazon's profits higher, what will Amazon's stock price be five years from now?
Amazon could be a $500 stock by 2030
In Q2, Amazon's operating profits increased by 31%. This is a significantly slower rate of growth than it was previously, but with the outsize growth of highly profitable divisions like AWS and its ad services, I believe this is a sustainable growth rate through 2030. To account for some conservatism, we will use a 20% growth rate.
If Amazon can continue growing its operating profits by 20% through 2030, that indicates $210 billion in operating profits by the end of 2030. That's a 172% increase from today's levels.
As long as Amazon's valuation today is reasonable (it's somewhat pricey at 32 times operating profits), its growth would be similar to its stock price growth. If we project Amazon to trade at 25 times operating profits, that would give the company a $5.3 trillion market cap, or a stock price of $492.
So, even with a lot of conservatism baked in (a lower growth rate than I think is possible and a decreased valuation), Amazon has the potential to be nearly a $500 stock by 2030. That's more than a double in under six years, making it a great stock to buy now and hold over the next few years."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-18T10:15:46,Jensen & Co. caught in U.S.-China trade war crossfire—again,Jensen Huang has 4 trillion reasons to smile.

Jason here.
In my decade-plus of reporting on Amazon, I’ve interviewed hundreds of small and midsized business owners who make a living selling through the e-commerce giant’s storefronts. Even the most level-headed among them can have a love-hate relationship with the tech giant. Many grumble about the (increasing) size of the revenue cut Amazon takes; others frequently cite Amazon’s sometimes faulty automated software systems, which can disrupt, or even disable, a merchant’s storefront, basically overnight.
So Amazon’s move this week to roll out even more automated systems, in a bid to bring the wonders of AI and agentic AI to its army of merchants, is going to be worth paying close attention to.
If successful, Amazon could widen the already substantial gap between itself and other online marketplaces as the go-to selling destination online. But if things go awry, it would be interesting to watch whether it creates an opening for competitors to recruit some more Amazon-focused sellers. Of course, where most consumers shop, sellers often follow.
More on this, as well as the latest on Nvidia’s trade war headache, below.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-17T21:07:36,Lyft stock surges 13% on Waymo robotaxi deal in Nashville,Lyft and Waymo said they plan to roll out an autonomous ride-hailing service in Nashville next year.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0141ef9a1f3710daef350fb90e0a5170708cf0407dca69c4746a29645d482d75,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-stock-surges-13-on-waymo-robotaxi-deal-in-nashville-200736917.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-stock-surges-13-on-waymo-robotaxi-deal-in-nashville-200736917.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-stock-surges-13-on-waymo-robotaxi-deal-in-nashville-200736917.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Lyft (LYFT) stock surged 13% Wednesday after the company announced a partnership with Alphabet’s (GOOG) self-driving Waymo service to roll out an autonomous ride-hailing service in Nashville next year.
Riders can initially hail driverless cars through the Waymo app, with plans to integrate the fleet into Lyft’s platform later in 2026.
The collaboration is significant given that Waymo also has deals in place with Lyft's rival Uber (UBER) for its robotaxis in Atlanta and Austin. Uber shares were down about 5% following the announcement on Wednesday morning.
The robotaxi race has accelerated this year. Tesla (TSLA) began testing its service in Austin this summer, with plans to eventually expand to Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. Zoox, backed by Amazon (AMZN), also has limited testing in San Francisco and Las Vegas. Waymo has been leading the race, providing paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin.
Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a press release that the deal was part of a gradual rollout as the company continues to scale Waymo's ride-hailing service ""to more people and more places.""
At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently. It could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.
For Lyft, the Waymo partnership could help the company better compete with Uber and Tesla as it sidesteps building the autonomous technology in-house — a costly and risky prospect, particularly if AV expansion stalls.
Still, Lyft faces other challenges. In a note to clients, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated an In Line rating after Lyft's mixed second quarter results, calling the key question ""the company’s ability to sustain top-line growth while ramping profitability.""
""We see LYFT’s valuation as very reasonable,"" Mahaney said. Even so, the firm ""would like to see positive fundamental trends sustained over time to become constructive on the shares.""
Lyft stock is up 70% year to date versus Uber's 48% rise during the same period. Uber's market cap, however, is $195 billion, dwarfing Lyft's $9 billion valuation.

This article has been updated following commentary and feedback from Amazon.
Fraud takes root and multiplies in a system that rewards speed and low cost above all else. Contract freight is built on predictability, and dedicated lanes are built on partnerships. But the spot market runs on competition, and when every load is a fight to win, every bid can become a gamble to come in lower while still maintaining a profit. Fraudsters didn’t invent those rules, but they learned how to exploit them.
The Race Against the Clock
The most obvious example of the speed pressure in the spot market lies in the fifteen-minute booking standard. Once a carrier submits a bid on a load, brokers are encouraged to confirm within about fifteen minutes, or risk losing the truck. The reason is structural and emerges from a market imbalance. When there are too many trucks chasing too little freight, carriers bid aggressively and do not want to sit idle and risk missing income; they want to lock in a load quickly or move on and bid the next available load. Carriers are bidding aggressively and quickly because there are not enough shipments to cover all the available capacity in the market.
The opposite can be true as well. When there is too much freight and too few trucks, or the market rates are volatile, brokers feel the pressure instead. They may reach out for a rate, or post a load on a bid board, to verify capacity before they even quote their customer, trying to grab what is available before a competitor gets it. That volatility creates its own countdown clock. Either way, the result is the same: an industry culture that creates a small window for booking trucks and verifying information.
It may feel like efficiency, but it is also a crack for fraudsters to slip through. If an operator is already stressed with a heavy workload, he or she may not feel there is enough time to confirm identity, validate insurance, or cross-check safety requirements. The very pressure that drives competition, whether scarcity in a down market or urgency in a hot one, become the conditions that allow fraud to flourish.
Speed as Vulnerability
The fifteen-minute rule is only one example of how speed becomes a vulnerability. Across the supply chain, the demand to move fast weakens every layer of defense. At the dock, the gate staff are told to load quickly, because man hours effects P&L. A driver shows up with a bill of lading and a rate confirmation that looks correct, and the shipment is released. Too few facilities pause to cross-check the driver’s identity with the broker, and this is how fictitious pickups have surged. CargoNet reported a sixty percent increase in these incidents in 2023, with average losses exceeding $200,000 per case (CargoNet 2024)."

As of 11:22 a.m. ET, Lyft stock was up 12.2% on the news.
Lyft scores a win
The stakes are getting higher in the autonomous ride-sharing race, as Tesla has started an autonomous vehicle service in Austin and is looking to expand it to other cities. Amazon, meanwhile, launched its Zoox autonomous shuttle in Las Vegas. However, Waymo remains the clear leader in the category.
On Wednesday, Lyft announced a new partnership to bring Waymo's full autonomous ride-sharing service to Nashville in 2026. The new collaboration will take advantage of Lyft's integrated fleet management services through its Flexdrive subsidiary, which handles fleet management services, such as vehicle maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations.
According to the terms of the deal, Waymo's vehicles will first be available on the Waymo app and then added to the Lyft app later in the year.
CEO David Risher said in a press release: ""Waymo has proven that its autonomous technology works at scale. When combined with Lyft's customer obsession and world-class fleet management capabilities, it's two great tastes that go great together.""
What it means for Lyft
It's unclear where this partnership goes from here, and it likely depends on how the Nashville rollout goes. However, it's clearly a win to form a partnership with the leading autonomous vehicle company, and the market response was strong enough that Uber, which has also teamed up with Waymo, fell several points on the news.
It's the latest evidence that Lyft is a much stronger business than it was a year or two ago."

The company announced at its annual seller conference, Amazon Accelerate, that it has upgraded its Seller Assistant with agentic capabilities. The assistant tool was previously powered by generative AI and could answer sellers’ questions about their inventory, Amazon’s policies and more. That project, codenamed Project Amelia, launched during Accelerate last year.
The latest update goes beyond mere question-and-answer discussion and instead sees the assistant able to “reason, plan and help take action with a seller’s permission.”
The promise of agentic AI is that it can draw on information and data sources to act autonomously, rooting out mundane tasks for the user that would otherwise manually handle those same duties.
Mary Beth Westmoreland, vice president, worldwide selling partner experience at Amazon, said in a blog post announcing Seller Assistant’s changes that agentic AI has the power to significantly influence the way sellers handle their businesses.
“Our agentic AI capabilities are designed to work seamlessly throughout the entire selling experience, which means sellers can go from handling every task themselves to collaborating with an intelligent assistant that works proactively on their behalf around the clock, while always keeping sellers in control,” Westmoreland wrote in the blog.
The agentic functions behind Seller Assistant will be powered by Amazon Bedrock, which gives users the ability to access foundation models from Amazon itself and from other large AI players, like Anthropic, OpenAI and Perplexity AI.
Amazon said it currently plans to make the agentic capabilities of Seller Assistant freely available to sellers. Many of those sellers already shell out funds to Amazon to leverage the company’s fulfillment arm, Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA). The agentic upgrades have already launched in the U.S., and the company plans to roll them out to other regions in the months to follow.
Seller Assistant will soon be able to analyze inventory data to alert sellers to slow-moving SKUs, suggest courses of action related to projected demand and recommend discount rates in line with major sales events or holidays. The agent will use sellers’ own data, paired with a repository of Amazon’s own insights, to help third-party players determine the best future course for specific items in their catalog.
The tool can also analyze the type of products a seller’s customers have interest in, then recommend that the seller expand or change their product line to meet demand. Westmoreland said the agent can “proactively develop comprehensive growth plans for sellers to review and take action for sellers when they want it to.”
Seller Assistant’s expertise will extend beyond routine business functions, as well. Amazon said the tool will aid sellers in ensuring their compliance mechanisms are up to date for each market they sell in. That’s inclusive of safety considerations and certifications needed to sell in certain geographies. If Seller Assistant flags an inconsistency or compliance issue, it will alert the seller to the problem and recommend the necessary additions or changes to a listing.
Amazon has already launched a variety of other seller-facing tools, like Enhance My Listing, which leverages generative AI to provide content suggestions for sellers’ product pages, and its A+ Content offering, which helps to add supplementary imagery and text to a product page to entice consumers based on their interests. The newly announced agentic capabilities also include an upgrade to Amazon’s seller ad studio; Seller Assistant can recommend ad concepts to sellers, targeted for their audience or for specific shopping occasions, like Father’s Day.
Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, said at Accelerate that the synergy created by tools like these could help propel sellers forward. Jassy has long been bullish about the potential for AI to significantly impact the e-commerce industry and the workforce behind it.
“I think what we’re doing together is very unusual,” Jassy told sellers at the conference. “I think the transformation that we’re seeing with AI is going to make it even easier and more compelling for you all to be able to sell and for us to collectively be successful together, and I’m really appreciative that we’re on this adventure together. I still think it’s very early days.”
To that end, Westmoreland said that Amazon is far from finished iterating on the ways agentic AI can impact the seller experience. She noted that the enhancements Amazon announced Wednesday build on previous innovation from the company.
“This evolution will help sellers spend more time focusing on product innovation and customer relationships while Seller Assistant handles complex and time-consuming operational tasks, making selling in Amazon’s store more efficient, strategic, and successful. And Seller Assistant will get even more capable over time, as we learn more about what sellers want and how we can help them,” she wrote."

“This is the biggest meme stock we’ve ever seen. Even at its peak, Amazon was nowhere near this level. The PE on this, well above 200, is just crazy. When you’ve got stocks like Nvidia, the price-earnings ratio is around 25 or 30, and Apple is maybe 35 or 36, Microsoft around the same. I mean, this is way out of line to be at a 220 PE. It’s crazy, and they’ve, I think, put a little too much emphasis on the magic wand of Musk.”

Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Tesla’s global sales in the second quarter fell 14% year over year. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wants his company to be the “world’s largest startup,” and he’s turning to employees to help slash the red tape that’s holding it back.
Speaking at Amazon’s conference for third-party sellers this week, Jassy noted the e-commerce giant set up a “no bureaucracy email alias” for employees to report slow processes and needless rules. In the past year, the de facto tip-line received more than 1,500 reports, Jassy said, according to remarks at Amazon’s annual conference for third-party sellers in Seattle reported by CNBC, and he said the company has changed about 455 processes thanks to the effort.
Near the end of the Jeff Bezos era, Amazon expanded its operations in increasingly varied product categories such as healthcare and physical retail, with an increasingly giant workforce, absorbing a great deal of bureaucracy along the way. But soon after Jassy took the helm, Amazon’s stock plummeted, reaching a low of about $84 per share near the end of 2022, compared to $230 per share today. After admitting the company have been prone to “overbuilding” during the pandemic, Jassy changed gears.
Since then, in part as a response to Wall Street concerns, the Amazon CEO has installed flatter leadership structures and a higher number of workers per manager. While Bezos’s later years as CEO were defined by the breadth of Amazon’s offerings, Jassy is now aligning the company with an earlier Bezos legacy, the “Day 1” mentality, which encourages customer centric thinking and bold innovation, as if each day was the first in Amazon history.
Jassy’s latest tipline project and his return to a “Day 1” mentality are meant to tackle what he calls hidden bureaucracy.
“I would say bureaucracy is really anathema to startups and to entrepreneurial organizations,” Jassy said. “As you get larger, it’s really easy to accumulate bureaucracy—a lot of bureaucracy that you may not see.”
A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.
Jassy took the helm at Amazon from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, and under his leadership, Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 corporate employees. He’s also cut into some Bezos-era projects, such as its foray into retail with Amazon Books, its effort to put Alexa devices into offices, and its online file storage product Amazon Drive.
The CEO has also raised his expectations for remaining employees. In January, Amazon instituted a five-day, in-office policy, a change from previous years where managers had the final say on remote work. In June, the Amazon boss published a memo predicting that progress in AI will lead to “efficiency gains” and an even smaller corporate workforce."

The Seattle-based company said Wednesday the average pay is increasing to more than $23 per hour. Some of its most tenured employees will see an increase between $1.10 and $1.90 per hour. Full-time employees, on average, will see their pay increase by $1,600 per year.
Amazon also said it will lower the cost of its entry health care plan to $5 per week and $5 for co-pays, starting next year. Amazon said that will reduce weekly contributions by 34% and co-pays by 87% for primary care, mental health and most non-specialist visits for employees using the basic plan.
Amazon has a global workforce of 1.5 million workers.
Last December, some workers at seven Amazon facilities went on strike, an effort by the Teamsters union to pressure the e-commerce company for a labor agreement during a key shopping period.
That same month, Amazon reached a settlement with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that requires the online behemoth to adopt corporatewide ergonomic measures at facilities across the country. The agency claimed hazardous working conditions led to serious lower back and other musculoskeletal disorders at Amazon facilities.
In January 2024, Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, said that average wages for hourly workers would exceed $18, up from $17.50. The increase was due to Walmart introducing some higher-paying hourly roles in its Auto Care Centers last year, among other changes, the company said.
Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, had announced in January 2023 that U.S. workers would get pay raises the following month, increasing starting wages to between $14 and $19 an hour. Starting wages had previously ranged between $12 and $18 an hour, depending on location.
At Minneapolis-based Target, the starting hourly wage ranges from $15 to $24 for workers employed at stores and distribution centers, depending on the location, company spokesman Brian Harper-Tibaldo said.
The average hourly wage for a Target store worker is more than $18, he said."

Riders can initially hail driverless cars through the Waymo app, with plans to integrate the fleet into Lyft’s platform later in 2026.
The collaboration is significant given that Waymo also has deals in place with Lyft's rival Uber (UBER) for its robotaxis in Atlanta and Austin. Uber shares were down about 5% following the announcement on Wednesday morning.
The robotaxi race has accelerated this year. Tesla (TSLA) began testing its service in Austin this summer, with plans to eventually expand to Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. Zoox, backed by Amazon (AMZN), also has limited testing in San Francisco and Las Vegas. Waymo has been leading the race, providing paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin.
Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a press release that the deal was part of a gradual rollout as the company continues to scale Waymo's ride-hailing service ""to more people and more places.""
At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently. It could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.
For Lyft, the Waymo partnership could help the company better compete with Uber and Tesla as it sidesteps building the autonomous technology in-house — a costly and risky prospect, particularly if AV expansion stalls.
Still, Lyft faces other challenges. In a note to clients, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated an In Line rating after Lyft's mixed second quarter results, calling the key question ""the company’s ability to sustain top-line growth while ramping profitability.""
""We see LYFT’s valuation as very reasonable,"" Mahaney said. Even so, the firm ""would like to see positive fundamental trends sustained over time to become constructive on the shares.""
Lyft stock is up 70% year to date versus Uber's 48% rise during the same period. Uber's market cap, however, is $195 billion, dwarfing Lyft's $9 billion valuation.

The company is updating Seller Assistant, its AI tool for third-party sellers, to help handle tasks on the seller’s behalf.
“Our agentic AI capabilities are designed to work seamlessly throughout the entire selling experience, which means sellers can go from handling every task themselves to collaborating with an intelligent assistant that works proactively on their behalf around the clock, while always keeping sellers in control,” Amazon wrote in a press release. “Seller Assistant will be able to handle everything from routine operations to complex business strategy, so sellers can focus on innovation and growth.”
Seller Assistant can now not only monitor account health and inventory, but also help develop strategies and take action when authorized, Amazon says.
For example, when a seller is reviewing their inventory, Seller Assistant will flag slow-moving products before they incur long-term storage fees and recommend whether it would make sense to leave the item as it is, lower the price, or remove it altogether. Seller Assistant will also be able to analyze demand patterns and prepare shipment recommendations.
Seller Assistant continuously monitors a seller’s account and flag potential issues and actions, such as inventory listings that might violate new product safety regulations. Additionally, it can automatically ensure that all of a seller’s products meet compliance requirements in every country they’re selling in.
Agent-driven commerce is an area of intense interest for tech companies, which imagine a future in which agents can initiate deals or make purchases on behalf of their clients. On Tuesday, Google released a new payments protocol for agentic transactions, although Amazon was not named as a partner.
Amazon also announced that it’s bringing agentic AI to advertising, allowing sellers to develop ads through conversational prompts.
Today’s announcement marks the latest AI tools that Amazon has rolled out for third-party sellers on its platform. Other tools include a video generator for ads and a generative AI tool that helps merchants improve their product listings."

Their big takeaway: the work was often more cargo logistics than cutting-edge science.
“We’re Amazon warehouse workers with PhDs,” one astronaut said. If an experiment takes two hours on station, the person continued, the first ninety minutes are spent just moving around cargo and preparing tools.
It’s a dismal waste of top talent. “These astronauts that are trained for two years, that come from some of the craziest military backgrounds and some of the smartest, most trained people on Earth, spend 14 days unpacking, repacking those back, just moving them around,” Barajas said.
The logistical burden is tied to cargo resupply. Every 60 days or so, roughly three-and-a-half tons of cargo arrive at the International Space Station, and all of it must be unpacked and stowed.
Barajas and Palmer, who met at the Entrepreneurs First organization, knew there had to be a better way. Their pitch: use intelligent, dexterous robots to take over these time-sucking chores. But they’re not starting with humanoid robots. Instead, Icarus is taking an iterative approach and starting with a simpler, fan-propelled robot with two robot arms outfitted with jaw grippers.
Icarus just raised a $6.1 million seed round led by Soma Capital and Xtal, with participation from Nebular and Massive Tech Ventures to get there.
The look of the first robot is a function of the tasks it will do: unpacking and stowing cargo. Palmer, who brings brings the robotics expertise to the enterprise, said that when you move to bimanual manipulation, or the coordinated use of two robotic arms at once, you can get around 80% of the needed dexterity with simple jaw grippers as with a complex anthropomorphic hand.
A lot of the science experiments astronauts perform on the ISS are also fairly simple in practice, like swapping out cartridges, which is another area a robotic labor force could come in handy.
The team recently performed a terrestrial long-distance teleoperation demo with a bimanual jaw gripper system, unzipping a real ISS cargo bag, unpacking it, and zipping it back up again. “We were able to demonstrate that you don’t need to go the whole way to hands to get meaningful dexterity at a long distance,” Palmer said.
Next up is flight testing. Icarus plans to conduct a parabolic-flight campaign in the new year, followed by a one-year demonstration on the ISS via Voyager Space, operator of the commercial Bishop airlock. The plan is to spend a year de-risking the full suite of cargo bag operations, then step into finer-grained tasks related to station maintenance, like filter and seal inspections."

Last year, Amazon workers at seven U.S. facilities had walked off the job during the holiday shopping rush, after union officials said the retailer had failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. Employees were protesting what they said was Amazon's unfair treatment of its workers.
In December, Amazon also agreed to implement safety measures at all of its U.S. facilities to settle a federal agency's claims that it failed to prevent workers from developing back problems and other ergonomic injuries.

China’s internet regulator has ordered companies to stop buying Nvidia (NVDA) chips in order to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, according to a report in The Financial Times. The Cyberspace Administration of China told companies including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba to terminate their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia’s latest chip designed for the Chinese market, the report said. The new ban is stronger than prior restrictions from regulators that focused on the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip. The ban comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in recent premarket trading.
4. Meta Event to Focus on AI Glasses
Meta Platforms (META) is expected to show off its AI-powered smart glasses and other new technology at its developer conference that begins today. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at 8 p.m. ET, is expected to showcase the company's ""Hypernova"" glasses. The launch of new Meta AI glasses comes as competitors Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions of AI glasses. Meta shares were down slightly in premarket trading. Meta’s Connect conference will extend into Thursday.
5. Ticket Reseller StubHub Raises $800M in IPO, Stock Set to Debut on NYSE
StubHub has raised $800 million from its initial public offering after pricing the deal at the midpoint of a marketed range, as the online ticketing reseller succeeds in its third attempt at going public. StubHub sold 34 million shares for $23.50 each, which values the online ticket reseller at around $8.8 billion. The stock is expected to begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “STUB”. The IPO comes after StubHub delayed its own listing plans earlier this year amid market turmoil following President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. StubHub’s listing follows similar public offerings in recent weeks, including buy now, pay later firm Klarna’s IPO last week."

The San Jose, California-based payments technology pioneer, which also owns the peer-to-peer business Venmo, had no such business before last year, but spotted an opportunity to use its transaction data to pitch clients on placing ads across its own portals, and those of other companies.
To get started, the company hired Mark Grether as a senior vice president and general manager of its new PayPal ads division in May 2024, bringing on board an executive who previously developed ad businesses at retail giant Amazon and ride-share titan Uber Technologies.
“I'm the guy who basically comes in and builds advertising businesses from the ground up in the context of a larger organization,” Grether said in an interview last week.
Now, he’s leading long-time PayPal customers, as well as new clients, to place their advertising on PayPal and Venmo screens. In addition, his unit is assisting those customers in posting the same targeted ads on other publishing properties.
PayPal has expanded the new business from the U.S. to the U.K. and Germany. And on Wednesday, the company said in a press release that it extended the off-site display and video ad options to those European countries as well.
Car-maker Mercedes-Benz, Uber, delivery firm DoorDash and retailer Walmart are among the company’s ad clients.
One innovation that Grether touts is the ability for advertisers to place a button on the ad that lets consumers almost instantly have the option to purchase a product if they’re a PayPal user.
PayPal is luring corporate clients as well as new customers to the ad proposition by highlighting the data the payments technology company has collected from handling consumer transactions, Grether said. PayPal’s trove of data is larger than that of retail behemoths Walmart or Amazon, he contended.
“We have access to transaction data from 30 million merchants, 400 million consumers globally,” he said, explaining how that information helps the company win over chief financial officers attracted to the notion of placing ad dollars behind more tailored campaigns.
For product makers, such as Nike, the chief financial officer wants to understand how products are being sold across retail outlets, whether that’s Dick’s Sporting Goods or Zappos, to understand what amount of ad dollars might increase the market share, Grether explained.
“We can answer this question because we’re sitting across all the merchants where Nike products get sold,” Grether said.
As far as PayPal’s revenue goals for the new ad business, Grether declined to comment, but he pointed to his past experience building billion-dollar ad businesses for Amazon and Uber. Those companies were similarly able to persuade retailers and other merchants of the power of placing ads on their uniquely placed display screens.
Grether contends that the profit margin for the new PayPal business is high, mainly carrying only the expense of a sales force. He declined to say how many employees are on his team now, but said it’s expanding with the business."

Amazon Ads and Netflix recently announced a partnership that will make Netflix's ad-supported inventory available programmatically through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP) in more than a dozen major markets, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, and Brazil. For advertisers, this means one of the most premium sources of connected TV (CTV) inventory is now tied directly into Amazon's advertising ecosystem.
For The Trade Desk (TTD -0.39%), the independent DSP that has long positioned itself as the alternative to walled gardens like Google and Meta Platforms, the move raises both risks and opportunities.
Why Netflix Chose Amazon
Netflix has quickly grown its ad-supported tier, reaching more than 90 million global monthly active users across all ad-tier households. To fully monetize that audience, Netflix needs scale, targeting, and attribution tools that resonate with global advertisers.
Amazon brings exactly that strength. Its DSP is one of the largest in the world, fueled by first-party shopping and streaming data from Amazon.com, Prime Video, and Fire TV. For brands, that means they can target Netflix viewers with the same precision they already use across Amazon's ecosystem, while tying exposure directly to purchase behavior.
Operationally, Amazon gives Netflix plug-and-play infrastructure. It also leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to help advertisers run impactful digital ads campaigns with minimal effort, thanks to the automation of campaign planning, buying, and measurement. So, advertisers already allocating billions through Amazon Ads can now extend those campaigns onto Netflix inventory with minimal friction.
In short, partnering with Amazon should help Netflix quickly scale its advertising business.
What it means for The Trade Desk
Here's where the tension lies. The Trade Desk has also promoted partnerships with Netflix, Walt Disney, and Roku on curated supply access. Its pitch to advertisers is neutrality: unlike Amazon, it doesn't own content or compete in streaming, which helps ensure cross-platform transparency and measurement.
But Amazon's new Netflix deal strengthens its hand. With Netflix, Roku, and Disney inventory increasingly accessible through Amazon's DSP, The Trade Desk risks losing some of the premium authenticated CTV supply that has been central to its growth story.
Besides, Amazon has a closed-loop ecosystem that includes e-commerce, CTV hardware, and Prime Video, providing it with unmatched data for precise audience targeting. Combined with the consumer data from Netflix, it could deliver excellent return on advertising capital, rivaling (if not surpassing) that of The Trade Desk's platform.
The silver lining is that advertisers wary of Amazon's dominance may lean harder on The Trade Desk as a balancing force. Many global brands prefer to diversify demand across independent platforms rather than concentrate entirely inside one ecosystem. That gives the tech company a continued role, even if Amazon is now the more dominant gatekeeper for premium inventory.
The bigger picture
This partnership isn't just about Netflix. Amazon has been steadily expanding its CTV footprint:
- Roku: Earlier this year, Amazon Ads struck a deal to make Roku's authenticated inventory available on its DSP, covering more than 80 million U.S. households.
- Disney: Amazon has also partnered with Walt Disney's DRAX exchange, giving buyers access to premium Disney streaming content.
Together, these moves show Amazon's ambition to consolidate premium CTV supply into its advertising stack. For advertisers, this provides an additional option beyond existing DSPs for capital allocation. For publishers, it offers additional demand for their advertising industry. But for independent players like The Trade Desk, it raises the bar for them to remain competitive over the long term.
What does it mean for investors?
For investors, the Amazon-Netflix tie-up highlights a clear industry trend: Premium streaming inventory is becoming increasingly tied to large ecosystems with first-party data advantages. The Trade Desk still has unique strengths in neutrality, transparency, and cross-channel reach, but the competitive bar just moved higher.
If advertisers increasingly default to Amazon for CTV, The Trade Desk could face headwinds in maintaining its share of wallet. On the other hand, if buyers push back against platform dependency, The Trade Desk's neutrality could prove more valuable than ever.
Either way, the stakes in CTV just got higher. For investors in The Trade Desk, this isn't a reason to panic -- but it is a reason to keep a closer eye on how the competitive dynamics evolve."

Chicago, IL – September 17, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, IonQ, Inc. IONQ, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Is IonQ the NVIDIA of Tomorrow, and Should You Buy the Stock?
The way NVIDIA Corp. benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom to become a $4 trillion behemoth, a smaller company, IonQ, Inc., is aiming to do the same by taking advantage of the next major tech wave – quantum computing. Can IonQ do it, and is the stock a buy now? Let’s find out –
Why Quantum Computing is Growing and Why IonQ Stands Out
Unlike traditional computing, quantum computing can inherently solve complex problems much faster, making it highly sought after for training AI models and revolutionizing drug discovery, to name a few. As a result, the global quantum computing market is projected to reach around $20.20 billion by 2030 from $3.52 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 41.8%, according to marketsandmarkets.
However, quantum computing has its own problems as well. Qubits can’t provide an exact 0 or 1 as an answer, and this leads to errors in calculation. But here is where IonQ steps in. It’s easily interconnected qubits boost computational accuracy. IonQ’s use of trapped ions is less error-prone than the man-made qubits that many of its competitors are utilizing. This trapped-ion method for quantum computing operates at room temperature, unlike other methods that require absolute zero, which curtails costs.
More Reasons to Be Bullish About IonQ
IonQ’s quantum-as-a-service (QaaS) model helps seamlessly integrate its systems into main cloud infrastructures, including Amazon.com, Inc.’s AWS, Microsoft Corp.’s Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s GCP. The company has also enhanced its presence in the quantum space by acquiring several companies, including Oxford Ionics, Lightsynq, Capella and partnering with Sweden’s Einride.
The Oxford Ionics acquisition was the recent one, as it got approved by the UK Investment Security Unit (“ISU”). This acquisition will help IonQ aim for 10,000 physical qubits with 99.99999% accuracy by 2027 and scale to 2 million qubits by 2030, citing investors.ionq.com. This means that the chances of errors in the future will be minuscule, which is vital for building comprehensive quantum computers."

Meta Platforms is looking to AI-powered glasses to drive growth, which some Wall Street analysts said could help position the tech giant as an early leader in a new category of devices.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg is widely expected to showcase Meta's (META) latest AI glasses, called ""Hypernova,"" at its ""Connect"" developer conference Wednesday and Thursday. (The keynote address is set to start at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, Register for the livestream here.) Meta's existing glasses have shown some signs of success, with sales of its Ray-Ban AI glasses more than tripling in the first half of the year from a year ago.
The Hypernova glasses, developed with Ray-Ban and Oakley owner EssilorLuxottica, are viewed as a shift in Meta's AI product strategy away from virtual reality headsets. They come with more smart glasses expected from competitors: Apple (AAPL), South Korea’s Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions next year and beyond, HSBC analysts wrote Tuesday.
Will Smart Glasses Be a Pathway to 'Superintelligence'?
Zuckerberg during a conference call in July said he sees the AI glasses becoming a major opportunity for the company and the ""main way that we integrate superintelligence into our day-to-day lives,"" according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.
“Smart glasses are a nascent market with a potential to become, if not 'the,' then at least 'one' computing platform of reference for the coming decades,” bullish HSBC analysts led by Nicolas Cote-Colisson wrote.
More technological progress may be required before the glasses can compete with functionalities currently offered by smartphones, HSBC wrote. Bank of America analysts, meanwhile, have raised concerns that Hypernova's projected $800 price tag might be too high for mass adoption, though they said it could help bridge a gap ""between early adopters and mainstream consumers.""
Wall Street is broadly bullish on Meta's stock, with a majority of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha calling the stock a ""buy."" Their mean target, $874, would suggest 15% upside from Tuesday's close at $779. The stock has added a third of its value in 2025."

3 Top AI Energy Stocks to Buy & Hold Forever
Oracle bolstered the case for the artificial intelligence spending boom last week. The cloud computing giant’s backlog soared 359% to $455 billion, driven by spending from AI hyperscalers like Amazon, a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, and more.
But there won’t be an AI age without massive energy growth.
Today’s Full Court Finance at Zacks explores three top energy stocks to buy now to ride the AI-driven boom: Talen Energy Corporation, MasTec, Inc., and Constellation Energy.
AI marks a paradigm shift for energy demand. Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT use 10x the energy of an average Google search. Large data centers consume as much electricity as a midsize city. Electricity demand is set to grow by ~25% by 2030 and ~75% by 2050 from 2023 levels.
The U.S. government is aiming to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and restart the domestic uranium industry to help support soaring energy demand.
Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet are using their collective trillion-dollar balance sheets to secure more power across nuclear, natural gas, solar, and beyond. The AI hyperscalers are also supporting R&D and more for small modular nuclear reactors and other cutting-edge energy technologies.
Wall Street, big tech, and the U.S. government know we won’t reach the abundant, AI-driven future that they are all betting on without massive energy industry expansion. This is why next-gen energy stocks such as Vistra, GE Vernova, and others have soared over the last several years, outpacing the likes of Nvidia and other pure-play AI stocks along the way.
Buy Amazon Energy Partner Talen Stock for Huge AI Upside
Talen is a leading independent power producer and infrastructure firm, with a portfolio that includes nuclear, natural gas, and more.
Talen has secured deals with Amazon to supply nuclear power to its AI data centers.
The stock soared to new all-time highs after it announced a big deal to buy natural gas plants in July. The planned acquisition is projected to expand its annual generation capacity by 50% and boost free cash flow per share by over 40% in 2026 and 50% through 2029. The deal highlights the soaring demand for power from Amazon and other AI companies.
Wall Street loves Talen, with 12 of the 13 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at “Strong Buys.” The company’s earnings outlook has soared since its Q2 release to land TLN a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its earnings per share (EPS) are projected to soar 300% in 2026 on 75% stronger sales."

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-17T01:30:00,"Prediction: Oracle Will Surpass Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to Become the Top Cloud for Artificial Intelligence (AI) By 2031","Oracle is an AI-first cloud, making it structurally different than the ""big three"" cloud providers.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b612a13d3f3b51e39dce4836a60af44836ff227446bc8ce810ac0f1aeccfbe1e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/prediction-oracle-will-surpass-amazon-microsoft-an/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/prediction-oracle-will-surpass-amazon-microsoft-an/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/prediction-oracle-will-surpass-amazon-microsoft-an/,fool.com,200,,"On Sept. 10, Oracle (ORCL 1.24%) stock popped 36% in response to a massive increase in customer orders for Oracle's cloud services.
Oracle forecasts that revenue from its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment could grow from around $10 billion in its last fiscal year (fiscal 2025), to $18 billion in its current fiscal year (fiscal 2026), $32 billion in fiscal 2027, $73 billion in fiscal 2028, $114 billion in fiscal 2029, and $144 billion in fiscal 2030 -- corresponding with calendar year 2031.
For context, Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated over $60 billion in net sales in the first half of 2025 -- so a $120 billion annual run rate. Microsoft, which just wrapped up its fiscal 2025 year, reported $106 billion in Intelligent Cloud revenue. And Alphabet's Google Cloud generated $26 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025. This means that OCI is forecast to exceed the current size of Google Cloud within three years, the current size of Microsoft Azure within four years, and the current size of AWS within five years.
Here's why Oracle is winning cloud contracts from leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies like OpenAI, and why the company could become the top cloud for AI within the next five years.
The future of cloud computing
Oracle's push into cloud infrastructure is arguably its boldest bet in the company's history. Oracle isn't cutting corners, either; it is bringing on dozens of data centers online in just a few years. It has built 34 multicloud data centers and should have another 37 online in less than a year.
These multicloud data centers are unique because they allow an organization to use services or workloads from two or more cloud providers, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and OCI. All of these clouds can work with the Oracle database. The idea is to allow customers to select the best cloud service for each task.
AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud all have multicloud strategies too, but the big difference is that Oracle is embedding native versions of its infrastructure (Oracle Autonomous Database and Exadata Database Service) inside the big three clouds to boost performance and decrease latency. Examples include Oracle Database@AWS, Oracle Database@Azure, and Oracle Database@Google Cloud. The ""big three"" are more about managing workloads rather than integrating them natively.
The buildout of OCI as a formidable alternative to the big three, paired with Oracle's ultra-modern data centers, put Oracle on the cutting edge of data center workflow. According to Oracle, OCI can achieve 50% better price-to-performance and 3.5 times time savings for high-performance cloud computing workflows compared to the previous generation of computing.
Race to the clouds
Oracle is purpose-building its cloud from scratch specifically for AI, whereas the majority of AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud handle non-AI tasks, like basic compute and storage, database and analytics, networking, etc. So while Oracle will likely become the biggest cloud for AI if it hits its fiscal 2030 OCI revenue target of $144 billion, it still may be a smaller cloud by total revenue compared to the more established giants.
Still, Oracle is achieving milestones that are impossible to ignore -- laying the foundation for Oracle to be the go-to cloud for AI. It exited the recent quarter with a 359% increase in its contract backlog, bringing the total to $455 billion. Reports indicate that Oracle landed a multiyear $300 billion contract with OpenAI. To afford that deal, OpenAI will need to start generating more cash flow.
On Sept. 11 -- two days after Oracle reported earnings -- OpenAI and Microsoft released a joint statement to transition OpenAI from a pure-play nonprofit to a nonprofit owning a majority stake in a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). A PBC is like a corporation with mission-backed guardrails. The aim is to generate a profit, but only if it fulfills a mission. Still, OpenAI's transition could allow it to raise billions more in funding, which would presumably help fund its deal with OCI even if OpenAI isn't generating positive free cash flow.
OpenAI, as the cornerstone of Oracle's backlog, has its pros and cons. On the one hand, it demonstrates that one of the most cutting-edge AI companies recognizes the value in what Oracle is building. But it also adds concentration risk to Oracle's projections. And if OpenAI's targets don't go as planned, Oracle's forecast could fall apart.
A high-risk, high-potential-reward AI play
Oracle is attracting massive deals from the big three cloud players with its multicloud offering. It has also built an attractive pricing model for customers specifically looking for high-performance computing to train AI models.
With customers lining up at the door, including a jewel in OpenAI, all Oracle has to do now is scale its infrastructure. It's become the best restaurant in town with reservations booked years in advance. The demand is undeniable, especially given these are multibillion-dollar, multiyear contracts.
Given Oracle's extremely pricey valuation, investors should only consider the stock if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term time horizon, and believe that Oracle's multicloud offering will be the premier option for AI customers. If that thesis plays out, Oracle will likely be worth considerably more in the future than it is today, even after the stock has nearly doubled over the last year and more than quadrupled over the last three years."

Impulse Space is pitching a similar concept for satellites bound for geostationary orbit about 22,000 miles above Earth, compressing what is typically a months-long transit into a matter of hours.
In the span of a week, the in-space propulsion startup announced a trio of deals aiming to unlock geostationary orbit (GEO) for commercial and defense users. That includes a demonstration mission with defense contractor Anduril planned for 2026; a transportation deal with GEO communications startup Astranis in 2027; and a multi-launch agreement to carry Infinite Orbits’ servicing satellites to GEO starting the same year.
Tom Mueller founded Impulse in 2021 after nearly two decades leading propulsion at SpaceX, where he led development of the Merlin and Raptor engines. He left SpaceX in 2020 and started Impulse to build out in-space transport services focused on last-mile delivery in low Earth orbit (LEO) — which is typically 100 to 1,200 miles above Earth — and ultra-fast satellite transport to GEO.
The common denominator across these missions is Helios, Impulse’s methane-oxygen kick stage. A kick stage is essentially a small rocket engine system that rides on a larger rocket and then fires its own engine – in this case, a powerful engine called Deneb – to propel spacecraft to their final destination.
Helios is meant to be the “same day” courier from LEO to higher altitude orbits. If it performs as advertised, commercial operators could reach higher orbits much faster, and the Department of Defense could maneuver more quickly in an increasingly contested region of space.
GEO isn’t just far away. Getting there and operating satellites from there presents special challenges. Spacecraft must transit the high-radiation Van Allen belts — zones of charged particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field — deal with latency in long-distance communication, and maintain their precise position.
The partnership between Anduril and Impulse could prove especially lucrative. The pair will jointly build a demo satellite for rendezvous and proximity operations — a capability that allows spacecraft to approach and inspect other objects in orbit — which the Space Force has identified as critical for space domain awareness and deterrence.
Impulse is supplying the spacecraft – called Mira, which flew for the first time last year – while Anduril will provide a mission data processor, long-wave infrared imager, and other software-defined payloads aimed at tracking and high-precision navigation."

The cloud computing giant’s backlog soared 359% to $455 billion, driven by spending from AI hyperscalers like Amazon, a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, and more.
But there won’t be an AI age without massive energy growth.
Today’s Full Court Finance at Zacks explores three top energy stocks to buy now to ride the AI-driven boom: Talen Energy Corporation, MasTec, Inc., and Constellation Energy.
AI marks a paradigm shift for energy demand. Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT use 10x the energy of an average Google search. Large data centers consume as much electricity as a midsize city. Electricity demand is set to grow by ~25% by 2030 and ~75% by 2050 from 2023 levels.
The U.S. government is aiming to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and restart the domestic uranium industry to help support soaring energy demand.
Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet are using their collective trillion-dollar balance sheets to secure more power across nuclear, natural gas, solar, and beyond. The AI hyperscalers are also supporting R&D and more for small modular nuclear reactors and other cutting-edge energy technologies.
Wall Street, big tech, and the U.S. government know we won’t reach the abundant, AI-driven future that they are all betting on without massive energy industry expansion. This is why next-gen energy stocks such as Vistra, GE Vernova, and others have soared over the last several years, outpacing the likes of Nvidia and other pure-play AI stocks along the way.
Buy Amazon Energy Partner Talen Stock for Huge AI Upside
Talen TLN is a leading independent power producer and infrastructure firm, with a portfolio that includes nuclear, natural gas, and more.
Talen has secured deals with Amazon AMZN to supply nuclear power to its AI data centers.

The stock soared to new all-time highs after it announced a big deal to buy natural gas plants in July. The planned acquisition is projected to expand its annual generation capacity by 50% and boost free cash flow per share by over 40% in 2026 and 50% through 2029. The deal highlights the soaring demand for power from Amazon and other AI companies.
Wall Street loves Talen, with 12 of the 13 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at “Strong Buys.” The company’s earnings outlook has soared since its Q2 release to land TLN a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its earnings per share (EPS) are projected to soar 300% in 2026 on 75% stronger sales.

The California-based startup announced Monday that it has secured $120 million in Series A funding.
Robostrategy, CRB and First Round Capital led the round, with further participation from Salesforce Ventures, the Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, Samsung Next, LG Technology Ventures and NVentures, which is Nvidia’s venture capital arm.
Dyna creates robotic foundation models, which it inputs into general-purpose robots. Foundation models are typically trained on mass amounts of data and information, but lack the training for a specific use case; that in mind, Dyna’s robots use the knowledge the foundation model has been trained on to adapt to real-world scenarios.
Jason Ma, co-founder of Dyna and former DeepMind research scientist, said that flexibility gives Dyna the opportunity to enter many industries without having to train robots to handle each and every task a customer wishes to deploy them for.
“Our first principle is to design robot foundation models that attain both generalization and performance,” Ma said in a statement. “Scalable real-world robot learning systems need to master and generalize many manipulation skills. To achieve the best performance on complex tasks, Dyna’s foundation models are developed to enable general world understanding while learning from the models’ own experience for rapid online learning.”
The company plans to use its Series A capital to add heads to its research and engineering teams and to fasttrack the further refinement of its foundation model as it adds commercial clients to its roster.
Lindon Gao, co-founder and CEO of Dyna, said that kind of improvement will be key to proving that autonomous robots are a high-fidelity use case for industries that have previously struggled to find the promised value associated with autonomous solutions.
“A strong foundation model is key to scalable distribution,” Gao said in a statement. “Our models continuously improve with each customer deployment, generating high-quality data. We are observing true generalization as our robot enters new environments; it simply works out of the box, with no additional data.”
About a month after securing a $23.5 million seed round in the spring, Dyna announced that it had launched Dynamism v1 (DYNA-1), which is the foundation model that currently powers its stationary robotic arms. Because the robots leverage DYNA-1, they’re considered general-purpose robots and can learn new skills as they go.
In early tests with customers, Dyna’s robots have focused on high-dexterity tasks, like folding napkins. The company said in April that DYNA-1 has a 99.4 percent success rate without human intervention when operating at 60 percent of a typical human’s throughput for the same task.
For Dyna, which said its robots can operate for more than 24 hours at a time, that means the machines can operate autonomously while humans are off the clock. So, while the robots may take more time to handle a task than their human counterparts, they can operate while humans are away from a facility.
York Yang, co-founder of Dyna, said that capability bodes well in industries seeing labor shortages.
“Right now, three forces are colliding at once: AI breakthroughs are maturing, hardware is accelerating and the demand for labor has never been higher. That convergence has created a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” said co-founder York Yang. “Dyna has made rapid progress over 12 months and we believe our ultimate goal, achieving physical AGI [artificial general intelligence], is not far off.”
According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization (QSPC), 20.4 percent of industry-agnostic U.S. manufacturers attributed the gap between actual operations and full production capacity to insufficient supply of labor. And, according to Manpower’s annual U.S. Talent Shortage Report, 74 percent of U.S. transportation and logistics employers said they struggle to find skilled talent; that figure has increased by 6 percentage points since 2024’s survey, and the sector’s rate comes in 3 percentage points higher than the industry-agnostic U.S. average.
Experts have attributed some supply chain players’ increasing interest in robotics to their labor shortage problems. Deloitte research shows that autonomous robots can decrease labor costs while growing productivity rates, primarily because they can work constantly without needing breaks in the way humans do. Investors seem to agree; Andrew Kang, CEO of RoboStrategy, said Dyna’s vision for changing multiple industries propelled its continued investment in the startup.
“Dyna’s team and mission bridges research excellence and real world commercial applications. The demand for robotic automation spans almost every industry, and we believe Dyna will be at the forefront in meeting it with their state of the art general-purpose robot foundation model,” Kang said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to co-lead this Series A and support the team’s ambitious roadmap of driving mass adoption of general-purpose robots.”"

TLN’s trailing and forward P/E were 100.37 and 19.08 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
Talen, Inc. ($TLN) has seen a series of recent catalysts that have significantly strengthened its investment case. The upcoming analyst day on September 9th, combined with the record PJM capacity auction for 2026/27 clearing at $329/MW-day—well above prior expectations—underscores strong demand for power relative to supply. The acquisition of Moxie Freedom and Guernsey natural gas assets for $3.5 billion EV (6.7x FY26 EBITDA) adds 3GW of baseload generation, enhancing the company’s scale and earnings potential.
Additionally, an expanded Amazon PPA now allows TLN to power multiple data center sites across Pennsylvania at fixed prices, reducing regulatory uncertainty and shifting Susquehanna’s revenue mix from merchant electricity and PJM capacity toward higher-quality contracted revenue. Management targets 50% of 2032 gross margin from long-term PPA contracts, up from ~10% today, with remaining revenue supported by fleet capacity, PTC protections, and merchant generation.
Street consensus for FY26 EBITDA may be understated; Jefferies’ updated model suggests higher EBITDA of $2.14 billion, reflecting new assets, capacity prices, and spot power forward curves, implying attractive valuation multiples of 9–10.8x FY26 EBITDA. Upside catalysts include further PJM price tightening, full ramp-up of the Amazon PPA, additional baseload CCGT PPAs at premium pricing, potential de-leveraging to reinvest in high-quality generation, share buybacks, and co-located SMR development at Susquehanna. Risks remain in merchant power exposure, expiration of nuclear PTCs by 2032, PPA execution, and development of non-gas/RMR assets.
Overall, TLN presents a compelling opportunity with a potential ~30% upside from $378 per share based on an FY26 EBITDA of ~$2.1 billion at 12x, supported by record capacity prices, strategic asset acquisitions, and a shift toward contracted revenue that enhances earnings quality while reducing downside risk.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Vistra Corp. (VST) by desperate-pleasures in March 2025, which highlighted the company’s positioning in AI-driven energy demand, diversified generation mix, strong cash flow, and share buybacks. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 52.73% since our coverage, as the thesis played out. The thesis still stands as VST remains well-positioned. qualitybargain shares a similar perspective but emphasizes Talen Energy’s catalysts, including PJM capacity prices, Amazon PPAs, baseload acquisitions, and a shift toward contracted revenue, highlighting upside from enhanced earnings quality."

Founders hold a unique ability to shape and grow a company from inception, much like a parent nurturing a child. They have a clear vision and relentlessly back their ventures. Unlike traditional managers, founders often take greater risks, pursue unconventional ideas and drive innovation with bold choices. Their businesses frequently mirror their core values, ideals, and long-term aspirations, making them enduring reflections of their dedication and ambition.
Founder-run companies represent less than 5% of the S&P 500 index. But that does not make their contribution any less. Everyone is aware of the success stories of visionary founder-owners like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who have redefined industries, creating trillion-dollar companies that continue to thrive. Some of today’s prominent founder-run companies are NVIDIA, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet and Netflix. Founder-led companies represent nearly 15% of the total index’s market capitalization, with technology companies taking the lead.
These companies, often sparked by unique ideas, are typically rooted in technological innovation. Built from scratch, they are designed to withstand challenges and remain sustainable over the long run. In the early stages, others may struggle to see the founder’s vision, making fundraising difficult. As a result, founders frequently invest their personal savings to bootstrap operations. If the venture succeeds, it may later attract angel investors or external funding, yet the founder-owner consistently bears the greatest stake and risk.
Moreover, founder-owners often struggle to delegate responsibilities, driven by skepticism about whether others can truly match their level of commitment or understanding. Thus, they tend to assume multiple senior roles and frequently struggle to identify a capable successor. Yet, excelling across all areas is rarely feasible. This hesitation to delegate can restrict the infusion of professional expertise, potentially impeding the company’s ability to scale effectively or respond swiftly to changing market dynamics.
Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that founder-led companies tend to perform better over time. Per a Harvard Business Review Study, founder-led companies had a market-adjusted return of 12% over three years against a return of negative 26% for companies that hired a professional CEO. Our Founder-Run Companies Screen further makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks. Currently, stocks like AppLovin Corporation APP, Palantir Technologies PLTR, Blackstone Inc. BX and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD look appealing.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the segment delivered $29.9 billion in revenues, up 26% year over year, while Azure and other cloud services rallied 39%, well ahead of estimates. This growth was driven by strong enterprise demand and the rapid adoption of AI workloads across Microsoft’s cloud ecosystem.
Recent innovations further strengthen this trajectory. The rollout of GPT-5 across Azure AI Foundry and Copilot, the opening of a new datacenter region in Austria, and enhancements to Microsoft Fabric for AI readiness all reinforce Microsoft’s ability to capture rising AI demand.
AI continues to be the primary growth engine. Azure continues to see strong demand for AI infrastructure, while GitHub Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption highlight how AI and cloud are converging into sticky, revenue-generating productivity tools. These developments deepen customer engagement and reinforce Microsoft’s competitive moat, giving investors strong confidence in continued upside.
Looking ahead, management guided Intelligent Cloud revenues of $30.1-$30.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, signaling continued strength. According to the Zacks model, Intelligent Cloud revenues are projected to rise 20.7% in fiscal 2026 and 21.2% in fiscal 2027, supporting a durable long-term outlook.
Microsoft’s confidence is also evident in its record $24.2 billion in capital expenditures, with plans to raise this to $30 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 to expand AI infrastructure and data centers. With deep AI investments, strategic partnerships and strong enterprise adoption, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud is well-positioned to deliver consistent upside and cement leadership in the AI-powered cloud era.
Microsoft Faces Rising Cloud Competition
Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the cloud market with 30-32% share, unmatched scale, 200-plus services and a massive $100 billion in annual infrastructure spend. Still, Amazon trails Microsoft Azure in enterprise and hybrid adoption. Although Amazon’s breadth and legacy remain powerful strengths, surging innovation from Microsoft and Google is eroding AWS’ edge, raising questions about its ability to defend long-term leadership in the fast-shifting cloud and AI race.
Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform is rapidly gaining ground, posting 32% annual growth and $13.6 billion in quarterly revenues in the second quarter of 2025. Fueled by AI infrastructure demand, Google Cloud leverages TPUs, Vertex AI and Gemini to strengthen its competitive edge. Partnerships with leaders like NVIDIA and PayPal are accelerating enterprise adoption. With expanding global data centers and robust security, Google Cloud is positioning itself as a serious rival to Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS in the evolving cloud market."

Much of the momentum stems from its recent AI infrastructure deal with Microsoft Corporation MSFT, with the stock surging 42% since the announcement on Sept 8.
But with such steep near-term gains, the natural question arises: Should investors stay invested or take profits off the table and exit?
Let’s unpack the company’s fundamentals and challenges to ascertain the best course of action.
MSFT Deal & Other Tailwinds
Based in Amsterdam, Nebius is a specialized AI infrastructure neo cloud company. The demand for AI infrastructure has exploded in 2025, fueled by the increasing usage of generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing applications. In the last reported quarter, NBIS revenues surged 625% year over year to $105.1 million. AI cloud infrastructure revenues grew more than nine times year over year, driven by demand for copper GPUs and near-peak GPU utilization.
As companies build GPU-intensive data centers, Nebius emerges as one of the key beneficiaries. The recent deal with MSFT involves NBIS providing dedicated GPU capacity to Microsoft from its new data center in Vineland, NJ, beginning later this year. The GPU services will roll out in several tranches during 2025 and 2026, with the agreement valued at approximately $17.4 billion through 2031. Microsoft could also purchase extra services or capacity as per the terms of the deal, which would raise the total value to around $19.4 billion.
While this represents NBIS’ first major long-term contract with a big tech firm, the company has indicated that more multi-faceted deals will likely follow, further solidifying its capacity and reach in the booming AI cloud space.
NBIS’ partnership with NVDA (also an investor in the company) is another plus. With the new Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and its data center capacity expanding significantly in parallel, the company expects a substantial increase in sales by year-end.

Nebius plans to secure 220 megawatts (“MW”) of connected power (active or ready for GPU deployment), including 100 MW of active power by 2025. This also includes new data centers in the U.K., Israel and capacity expansion in Finland. The 1 GW capacity target by 2026 positions Nebius to capture incremental upside from accelerating demand for AI compute. On the last earnings call, NBIS highlighted that it is scaling up capacity and is also “able to sell it quickly”."

Google crossing that 3 trillion dollar market cap uh figure. Does that does that excite you and when a company hits these big round numbers, what what's the message there?
I mean, I I think it's fun, right? It's a nice headline. Congratulations to all the Google investors who hopefully are doing very well. I think the headline there is that the AI enthusiasm led rally continues, right? We we got a very favorable court ruling for Google and Apple last week, which helped continue this momentum, but it really was the the few weeks before that too. Oracle posted very strong backlog as we know, before that, Broadcom posted really good guidance. So the whole AI story still has legs and I don't think there's any reason that an investor should exclude Google from their AI tech basket. Yes, it's not so much on the infrastructure side like a semiconductor company, but with Gemini and with the the advancements they've been able to make in optimizing search and advertising, I think Google belongs and I think this just tells us more broadly, tech is still the market leader until it isn't.
Tom, you think Amazon's next?
I do. I think that that the CAPEX boom we are seeing and this is really for investors, the key with AI is watching capital expenditures, which is the really fancy term for companies spending lots of money on investment in infrastructure and other things. The CAPEX boom is spreading throughout the economy. I think Amazon is in a great place with all their cloud infrastructure through AWS. I think they continue to be a winner.
Uh, is there another company, Tom, that could uh join Nvidia over a $4 trillion dollar market cap? Or at this point, I mean this is Nvidia's territory, they should be isolated on on an island by themselves.
I think I think that's fair enough. You know, certainly I would look to some of the other large cap tech companies like a Microsoft. Uh Apple is sort of an interesting candidate because they've been so late to the party but have recently rebounded. If all of a sudden people begin to believe there's an AI story with Apple who has been very restrained in the AI race or restrained or unsuccessful depending on your opinion, then they can play catchup as well. But I think stick with these these mega cap tech stocks, the momentum is still in their favor and so are the facts."

The real question isn't whether AI is worth investing in -- it's which companies navigating this fast-paced landscape are durable enough to hold for the long haul.
Below, I'll highlight three of my top AI stocks to buy and hold forever and explain why they deserve a permanent spot in your portfolio today.
1. The semiconductor king: Nvidia
Throughout the AI revolution, Nvidia (NVDA -0.20%) has emerged as arguably the most influential player. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone for training and deploying generative AI models. Layered on top of that hardware is CUDA, Nvidia's software architecture that enables programmers to develop applications on top of its chips.
This combination of hardware and software has created a powerful technological moat for Nvidia -- one that competitors have struggled to replicate despite their best efforts.
As AI models become more complex and expand into use cases across robotics, quantum computing, and autonomous systems, the demand for greater inference power will accelerate. Nvidia's long track record of innovation positions it well to address these challenges and scale up alongside its big tech counterparts as they introduce more sophisticated AI applications down the road.
With hyperscalers showing no signs of slowing their infrastructure investment, there's good reason to remain confident that Nvidia's best days are still ahead.
2. The underrated ecosystem: Alphabet
Back in 2015, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai outlined his vision to transform Google and its many businesses into an AI-first platform. Nearly a decade later, investors can clearly see how those early ambitions have materialized.
Alphabet has embedded AI across virtually every layer of its ecosystem, in advertising, search tools, cloud services, consumer applications, and cybersecurity. Two of the most underrated assets within this ecosystem are DeepMind, Google's AI research lab, and its custom tensor processing units (TPUs).
These chips are the computational backbone for training and running large language models (LLMs), giving Alphabet a unique structural advantage as it tests and scales up its own AI capabilities across Gemini and physical infrastructure.
Some on Wall Street even suggest that Google's TPU division could be worth $900 billion -- underscoring just how significant this hardware could be in unlocking future value for Alphabet as well as providing a path to compete more directly with Nvidia.
3. The bridge connecting software and physical infrastructure: Amazon
Amazon's AI story is unique because it bridges the gap between digital and physical infrastructure. On the software side, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has forged a strategic partnership with OpenAI rival Anthropic, a leading AI start-up now valued at $183 billion.
Anthropic is deeply integrated into AWS -- developing its models on Amazon's custom Trainium and Inferentia chips while also expanding the capabilities of Amazon Bedrock. Through this alliance, AWS customers gain access to Claude, Anthropic's highly capable alternative to ChatGPT.
On the e-commerce side, Amazon has been vocal about its ambitions to outfit warehouses with AI-powered robotics. While the up-front cost will be high, the long-term payoff could be transformative -- potentially expanding operating profits by billions of dollars thanks to unprecedented labor efficiencies.
The common thread stitching these monster AI stocks together
Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon each demonstrate how deliberate capital allocation can create a compounding effect that extends far beyond the initial investment. These tech titans aren't just building proprietary systems, they are developing platforms through which technological breakthroughs reinforce and integrate with one another more deeply.
The result is accelerated revenue growth across various end markets paired with widening profit margins and durable, resilient cash flow generation.
In a fiercely competitive and evolving AI landscape, this ability to turn investments into lucrative feedback loops is precisely what sets these businesses apart and why I view them as compelling long-term buys."

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
The move makes Fay the first nutrition care provider on Amazon's Health Benefits Connector, which helps enrolled customers match with digital health companies for health conditions such as diabetes and musculoskeletal issues, as well as mental health support.
Fay uses artificial intelligence to match users with registered dietitians based on their goals and health history.
The startup did not disclose financial terms of the partnership.
CONTEXT
Amazon has been expanding into the healthcare industry for years, starting with the acquisition of PillPack for $750 million in 2018 and the launch of Amazon Pharmacy in 2020.
The company said it built its Health Benefits Connector, as nearly one in four U.S. adults remain unaware of the benefits available to them, even when provided by their employer or insurers.
Fay recently raised $50 million in a Series B round led by Goldman Sachs valuing it at $500 million, and operates a network of over 3,600 dietitians across all 50 U.S. states.
KEY QUOTES
""Nutrition is the single most underutilized lever in preventing chronic disease — and we believe it should be as easy to access as ordering from Amazon,"" Sammy Faycurry, CEO of Fay, said.

WILMINGTON, Del., September 16, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Second Front Systems (2F), a public-benefit software company powering software for the free world, today announced it has achieved a Defense Information Systems Agency Provisional Authorization (DISA PA). This places Second Front among just 57 organizations to hold this designation—alongside companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Oracle.
The DISA PA certifies that Second Front’s Game Warden platform meets Impact Level (IL) 5, the Department of Defense’s security standard for Control Unclassified Information (CUI). By leveraging Game Warden’s enhanced compliance posture, technology companies can reduce duplicate compliance efforts and accelerate technology delivery across DoD environments. This milestone marks a significant step forward in Second Front’s mission to eliminate the friction that slows innovation and give the U.S. and its allies a lasting advantage.
""Achieving DISA PA is more than a certification—it’s a signal of trust and a force multiplier for our customers,"" said Matt Conner, Chief Information Security Officer at Second Front. ""It reflects our team’s deep expertise in regulated environments and unwavering commitment to mission impact.""
Second Front’s DISA PA enables repeatable and scalable application deployments across DoD agencies by allowing customers to inherit Game Warden’s validated security controls. This increases trust and credibility among agencies and sponsors, reduces costs, accelerates deployment timelines, and broadens reach. As a result, agencies gain faster access to innovative, impactful technology—without compromising DoD compliance.
""This is a big moment—not just for our customers, but for the broader defense tech ecosystem,"" said Tyler Sweatt, CEO of Second Front. ""Our DISA PA enables the next wave of innovators to deliver critical technologies with speed, trust, and scale—helping ensure the best solutions reach those who defend our way of life.""
The DISA PA adds to Second Front’s rapidly expanding authorization momentum. Earlier this year, the company achieved FedRAMP® High authorization, making it one of the few companies to hold DoD, FedRAMP, and GovRAMP accreditations. Together, these designations cement Game Warden as the most comprehensive path to market for technology providers seeking to serve the U.S. Government.

“I can still remember explaining over and over that deposits are only insured up to $250,000. For most people, that seems like more than enough, but for someone with real wealth it’s just the beginning. That’s when you realize protecting money is not as simple as putting it in a bank,” she said.

So how do billionaires manage to protect their wealth? GOBankingRates examined three structures Jeff Bezos has put in place to do exactly that.
Also here are five facts about Bezos’ wealth.
Diversification
It might be tempting to put all your money back into your own company. But if Bezos put all his hard-earned money back into Amazon, he’d be taking on serious risk. Should the company suddenly fail, his fortune would disappear. This is why billionaires — just like average earners — mitigate risk by diversifying.
“The scale is different, but the fundamentals aren’t,” stated Celotto.
Bezos’ Single-Family Office (SFO), Bezos Expeditions, spreads his wealth across various industries like space, healthcare, tech and real estate. Real estate, in particular, can be a savvy investment because it is a tangible asset. Markets may go up or down, but real estate grows in value over time and remains protected against inflation.
Without heavily relying on any one source, Bezos’ wealth becomes more stable. Notable investments in his portfolio include Airbnb, Uber and Zocdoc.

Utilizes Trusts
Trusts — both revocable and irrevocable — are some of the most reliable ways billionaires protect wealth.
“They reduce estate taxes, shield assets from lawsuits and control how wealth is distributed across generations,” said Laura Cowan, estate planning attorney, entrepreneur and author at 2-Hour Lifestyle Lawyer. Trusts also help surviving relatives avoid the costly probate process.
According to Celotto, Bezos’ D.C. mansion is currently owned by the Cherry Revocable Trust. He also owns three additional properties in Indian Creek Florida through three separate trusts: The Sunshine Trust, The Palm Trust and The Cape Trust.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.47%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.94%.
Heading into today, shares of the online retailer had lost 1.25% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 3.05% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.32%.
The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Amazon in its upcoming release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.57, up 9.79% from the prior-year quarter. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $177.86 billion, indicating a 11.95% upward movement from the same quarter last year.
For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.75 per share and a revenue of $707.21 billion, representing changes of +22.06% and +10.85%, respectively, from the prior year.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the business operations and its ability to generate profits.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.73% higher within the past month. Amazon is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
From a valuation perspective, Amazon is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 33.79. This represents a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 19.7.
Also, we should mention that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.53. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.53 based on yesterday's closing prices.
The Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 86, positioning it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries."

Amazon aims to build out a fleet of more than 3,200 satellites, which will offer connectivity to individual customers, businesses and governments.
Freeman, speaking at a World Space Business Week event in Paris on Monday, said Kuiper would later deploy satellites covering more southern latitudes, covering as many as 26 countries by the end of 2026, and reaching the equator in 2027.
Amazon plans to offer “full global coverage including the poles in approximately 88 to 100 countries” by 2028, he said. At that point, he added, the company would be launching additional satellites beyond its initially planned deployment.
“We are very pleased with where we are right now,” Freeman said.
An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment beyond Freeman’s remarks.
Amazon’s Kuiper team, which aims to compete with Elon Musk’s Starlink, has experienced delays from rocket builders and earlier this year was struggling to ramp up satellite production. Amazon has since launched four batches of satellites, with another scheduled for later this month.
JetBlue Airways Corp. on Sept. 4 revealed an agreement to use Project Kuiper satellites to power onboard Wi-Fi, making the airline the first to announce such a deal. JetBlue said it will begin providing passengers with internet access using Amazon’s satellites in 2027.

OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor is leaning into the idea that we're in an AI bubble and he's fine with it. In a chat with The Verge, Taylor said it's possible for two things to be true at once: the hype will burn some investors, but AI will still change the world.
I think it is both true that AI will transform the economy and I think we're also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money, he said. Both are absolutely true at the same time.
Taylor compared today's frenzy to the dot-com boom. Yes, there were big busts like Pets.com, but over time the internet created giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). He sees AI on the same path some noise now, but enormous value ahead once the dust settles.

All but one of the companies come from the tech sector, with many offering products and services that consumers use every day. Several of them also made it onto Bankrate’s list of top-performing stocks.
The top spot has gone back and forth between Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia in recent months, behind a business boom driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4 trillion market value in July 2025, just over two years after it crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time. In September 2025, Google-parent Alphabet crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time.
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway joined the trillion-dollar ranks in August 2024 and is the only non-tech company on the list. Tesla rejoined the list in the second half of 2025 after a sell-off to start the year brought it below the $1 trillion mark.

COFECE said, in particular, the platforms don’t offer up sufficient information about how featured offers are selected and noted that both companies give preferential treatment to sellers who use their respective logistics services. COFECE said these business practices limit sellers’ ability to compete and deflates the possibility of them moving between platforms to sell goods.
For the moment, COFECE has not issued any disciplinary mandates to either company, despite the fact that participants acknowledged the existence of seller barriers. The commission could have issue corrective measures on the issues it identified, but it said it lacked consensus to do so for the moment.
Fernanda Ramo, associate general counsel and head of legal for Amazon Mexico, said the fact that COFECE chose not to hand down corrective measures bodes well for the company.
“We are pleased with COFECE’s decision not to impose remedies, which underscores the competitiveness of Mexico’s retail landscape and absence of barriers to competition. We remain committed to serving customers and supporting Mexican businesses of all sizes,” Ramo said in an emailed statement.
COFECE said it hopes to encourage a more dynamic e-commerce market so that buyers and sellers alike can benefit from it.
In February, COFECE put out a preliminary report about e-commerce competition, which found that Amazon and Mercado Libre are dominant in the space, in part because of the practices it mentioned in its updated report. That report suggested that both companies be required to increase transparency around their featured offers or Buy Box functions; that they separate the services they offered through their respective loyalty programs, Prime and Meli+ and that they allow sellers to solicit third-party logistics players for delivery without unfair penalty or favoritism toward sellers that use the companies’ own logistics services.
The report was then opened for public comment, which drew a mix of opinions on how—and whether—the companies should face sanctions for their conduct. The Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), at that time, said the watchdog should not impose sanctions on just two companies because their focus wasn’t broad enough and didn’t take traditional retail into account.
Krisztian Katona, vice president of global competition and regulatory policy for the trade group, said Friday that COFECE’s lack of formal sanctions is the right way forward.
“COFECE’s final report on Mexico’s e-commerce retail market rightly keeps the focus on protecting consumers from anticompetitive practices rather than imposing misguided remedies,” Katona said in a statement. “The previously proposed corrective measures risked harming consumers and shielding large traditional retailers, while ignoring the fierce competition between e-commerce platforms and brick-and-mortar stores in an omnichannel landscape that has delivered innovation, lower prices, and greater choice for Mexican consumers.”
Mercado Libre did not respond to Sourcing Journal’s requests for comment."

Once seen as a distant dream, the robotaxi industry is now becoming a reality in the United States.
Amazon’s AMZN Zoox, Tesla TSLA, and Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo are emerging as the biggest names to watch. Each company has a different strategy, but they all share the same ambition— to shape the future of urban mobility and bring driverless rides into the mainstream.
Amazon’s Zoox Enters the Spotlight
Amazon’s Zoox made headlines last week as it officially began offering rides in Las Vegas. For now, the rides are free, limited to a few locations. These are expected to be expanded soon across the city. Eventually, passengers will pay for the service once regulators give the green light. This marks a significant milestone for Amazon, which bought Zoox in 2020 for $1.3 billion and has been quietly building toward this moment for five years.
What sets Zoox apart is its quirky vehicle design. While most players retrofit existing cars, Zoox built its robotaxi from the ground up. The boxy shape has even earned it the nickname “toaster on wheels.” The vehicle has no steering wheel and features a cabin where passengers sit face-to-face. It can drive forward and backward without turning around.
Following the launch in Las Vegas, the company plans to bring its service to San Francisco later this year and has Austin and Miami on its roadmap. Testing is already underway in Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Seattle. With its fresh approach to design and strong backing from Amazon, Zoox is positioning itself as a challenger to companies like Waymo and Tesla.
Tesla’s Bold Push into Robotaxis
Tesla, long associated with autonomous driving ambitions, finally brought its robotaxi project to life this year. It launched its first robotaxi rides in Austin, TX, back in June. Initially, the service was small, restricted to a limited group of riders. But Tesla quickly expanded its fleet, routes, and rider base. The company has since added rides in the Bay Area and received approval in Nevada to start testing.
Having said that, Tesla’s robotaxi service is not fully driverless yet. Human supervisors, called “Safety Monitors,” still sit inside the cars. In Austin, they ride in the passenger seat for city drives and move to the driver’s seat for highway routes. This cautious approach reflects Tesla’s strategy to roll out its service step by step, while still showcasing progress to customers and regulators."

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Cramer frequently discusses Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in his morning show. Most of his comments for the firm surrounding its cloud computing and eCommerce businesses. The past few months have been interesting when it comes to the CNBC TV host’s thoughts about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). They have been interested because after the firm’s second-quarter earnings, Cramer opined that its cloud business was underperforming due to a reliance on in-house chips. Then, he changed his mind and discussed a Morgan Stanley piece about the chips. This time, he discussed the bank again and commented on a media report:
“Did you see that Amazon was added to the vintage list of Morgan Stanley? Vintage. What’s that like the Caymus Fournier?

Jim Cramer’s comments about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) on August 29th are quite important for the debate surrounding its AI chips:
“Take a look at the Morgan Stanley piece today. The most significant piece of research I’ve read in a long time. By Brian Nowak. Who was the skeptic, on the conference call.

Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) remains a solid investment, as the integration of AI across its business is driving tangible outcomes in the form of higher profits and growth in cloud computing.
How Amazon is benefiting from AI
Net income at Amazon increased from $13.5 billion in the second quarter of 2024 to $18.2 billion in Q2 2025. This comes as it focuses on delivering more speed of innovation in AI and operational efficiencies in its e-commerce business.
Amazon is one of the largest users of robotics. It has deployed more than 1 million in its warehouses, leading to faster order processing. Robots are playing a key role in expanding its same-day delivery services across the U.S. and helping the company to lower costs.
The tech giant also remains the leader in cloud computing, where it continues to sign major agreements with large enterprises. Its custom Trainium2 chip is powering Anthropic's Claude AI models, in addition to its own AI tools like Amazon Bedrock for cloud customers.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) grew 17% year over year in Q2. While this growth is lower than competitors', it's still solid. In fact, Morgan Stanley expects AWS revenue growth to accelerate to over 20% in 2026, which is a catalyst for the stock. AWS drives most of the company's operating profit.
Overall, the cost savings and margin expansion Amazon has gained from AI in e-commerce, and the growth in cloud will likely send the stock higher in 2026. Investors could realize excellent returns over the next several years, as analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 17%."

That's why you should start by looking at stocks that are set to beat the market over the next 12 months, a strategy that's been proven to generate strong returns.
Now, let's break down why adding this one exceptional stock, highlighted below, to your portfolio could be a recipe for success.
Why You Should Pay Attention to Walmart (WMT)
Walmart Inc. has evolved from just being a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer into an omnichannel player. In this regard, acquisitions; partnerships; delivery programs like Walmart + and Express Delivery; and investment in online e-commerce platform Flipkart are noteworthy. These position the company to keep pace with the changing retail ecosystem and stay firm in the presence of rivals like Amazon and Target. Markedly, Walmart’s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.
WMT was added to the Zacks Focus List on May 30, 2017 at $26.04 per share. Since then, shares have increased 297.43% to $103.49.
Three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2026. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $2.6. WMT boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.8%.
Additionally, Walmart's earnings are expected to grow 3.6% for the current fiscal year.
Because stock prices react to revisions, buying stocks with rising earnings estimates can be very profitable. Focus List stocks like WMT offer investors a great opportunity to get into a company whose future earnings estimates will be raised, potentially leading to price momentum.

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-15T14:16:00,3 Top Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul,Warren Buffett's investing philosophy is to hold for the long term -- and it has paid off handsomely.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=016cb7e07c7ef2180f01bd4811d21d1b7a73b36fd133e4c1ad1d482aef166d15,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/3-top-buffett-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-long/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/3-top-buffett-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-long/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/3-top-buffett-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-long/,fool.com,200,,"Warren Buffett's investing career is one of legend. The Oracle of Omaha took over what was a struggling textile company 60 years ago and turned it into a mammoth conglomerate with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion -- making it one of less than a dozen companies that have reached that milestone.
While Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.22%) (BRK.B -0.35%) is heavily involved in insurance, railroads, utilities, and energy, the company derives a significant fraction of its value from its investment portfolio, which is today worth more than $300 billion. Right now, it includes positions in more than 40 companies.
Buffett's investment strategy is fairly simple. He favors companies with strong management teams, dependable earnings, secure positions in their industries, and ideally, strong dividends. Once he finds such companies, he prefers to hold his investments in them for long periods.
That strategy has worked marvelously -- from 1965 to 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's share price grew at a 19.9% compound annual rate, compared to a 10.4% compound annual rate for the S&P 500 (when factoring in dividend reinvestment). Over the years, that outperformance has added up monumentally. An investment made in the S&P 500 in 1965 would have grown in value by 390 times. The same investment in Berkshire Hathaway would have grown by more than 55,000 times.
Though Buffett's retirement as CEO looms at the end of this year, Berkshire's portfolio still reflects his timeless principles. And these three holdings -- Amazon (AMZN -0.70%), Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.99%), and Bank of America (BAC 4.38%) -- stand out as stocks that are likely to be long-term winners from here.
Amazon
Buffett has famously acknowledged his regret that Berkshire didn't invest in Amazon sooner. But Berkshire rectified that error in 2019 by taking a $900 million stake in the e-commerce giant. Today, its position is worth close to $2.3 billion.
Amazon, of course, has changed a lot over the years. It got its start as an online bookseller and evolved into an e-commerce titan that ships and sells nearly all types of goods all over the world. Amazon had $391.4 billion in retail sales in 2024, second only to Walmart, and its rise forced brick-and-mortar companies around the world to create their own e-commerce divisions just to compete.
However, the secret sauce to Amazon stock is its powerful cloud computing division. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the biggest cloud computing service on the planet, with a 30% share of the global market (almost as much as No. 2 Microsoft and No. 3 Alphabet combined). AWS generated $10.16 billion in profits in the second quarter -- more than all of the profits brought in by the much-larger e-commerce division. In fact, AWS accounted for 55% of Amazon's net income despite bringing in just 18% of the company's revenue.
As more companies turn to cloud computing for their IT infrastructure, AWS will continue to drive Amazon's profits.
Occidental Petroleum
While it's true that Buffett generally favors companies that have market superiority, Occidental is an outlier. The integrated oil and natural gas company is much smaller than rivals ExxonMobil and Chevron, but Berkshire Hathaway has over time built up a 26.9% stake in Occidental.
That's in part because it ticks another box on Buffett's checklist -- he loves how its management team runs it. Buffett has said he was sold on Occidental after reading the company's earnings call transcript in 2022. ""I read every word, and said this is exactly what I would be doing,"" he said.
By that point, Buffett already had a vested interest in Occidental: Berkshire bought $10 billion worth of its preferred stock to help it finance its 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum. That was a classic Berkshire move because the terms of the preferred stock deal required Occidental to pay Berkshire Hathaway an 8% dividend -- and Buffett loves dividends.
But Berkshire's additional purchases since 2022 show that Buffett still believes in Occidental's future. That should signal to retail investors that it's an ideal buy-and-hold energy stock.
Bank of America
If Occidental is Buffett's favorite energy stock, then it's safe to say that Bank of America is his favorite bank stock. Berkshire Hathaway owns 605 million shares of Bank of America stock -- a stake worth more than $30 billion. That's roughly 10% of Berkshire's entire stock portfolio.
The Charlotte-based financial giant is the second-largest bank in the country by assets, with 69 million consumer and small-business clients, 3,700 locations, 15,000 ATMs, and a digital presence that serves roughly 59 million people.
Its diverse revenue streams come from consumer banking, corporate lending, wealth management, mortgages, and auto loans. Its revenue rose 4% year over year in the second quarter to $26.5 billion. Net income of $7.1 billion was up from $6.9 billion a year ago.
Bank of America also pays a dividend that yields 2.2% at the current share price, and those shares are fairly valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14.8. Its value, dividend, and consistent earnings make it a classic Buffett stock to buy and hold."

Led by Bessemer Venture Partners, the 40-person bootstrapped cybersecurity company is scaling globally with a proactive remediation platform trusted by Amazon, Kraft Heinz, Ascension Health, and more
TEL AVIV, IL / ACCESS Newswire / September 15, 2025 / After six years of profitability, as a bootstrapped company, and continuous growth, Remedio today announced it has raised $65 million in its first-ever funding round, led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from TLV Partners and Picture Capital. Remedio's platform gives enterprises complete visibility into configuration risks and autonomously fixes them, ensuring every device is secure, compliant, and resilient to breaches, without manual effort.
Despite a lean team of just 40 employees across Israel, the U.S., and Europe, Remedio is already trusted by hundreds of leading global enterprises and Fortune 500s, including Amazon, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, Eaton, and Colgate-Palmolive.
Remedio has demonstrated a level of capital efficiency rarely seen in the cybersecurity space and is profitable from the first day of its operation. The platform's ease of adoption drives strong customer retention, as organizations continue using the platform to cut costs, minimize downtime, and strengthen device security, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.
Remedio delivers continuous, real-time device posture management, identifying and eliminating configuration risks across every device and OS. Powered by AI, it goes beyond legacy tools that stop at alerts, proactively remediating issues instantly with built-in rollback to ensure zero-disruption security. Remedio supports both SaaS and on-premise (air-gap) deployments, meeting the needs of highly regulated industries such as defense and healthcare.
Founded by Tal Kollender, a former teenage hacker and Israeli cyber unit veteran, Remedio was built to address a blind spot in enterprise security: misconfigurations that quietly leave systems vulnerable. She started the company after years spent on both offense and defense in the cyber world, and now serves as CEO. ""We built a profitable business on our own and watched it grow rapidly as we built trust with our customers, without raising a dollar,"" said Kollender. ""But now, with momentum from global enterprise customers and a product that's proven its value, it's time to scale.""
""Remedio has won over some of the top enterprises in the world through their ability to uncover and remediate critical endpoint vulnerabilities missed by EDR and CSPM platforms,"" said Adam Fisher, Partner at Bessemer. ""It's unusual to hear such effusive praise from customers, who are inundated with new security solutions every week."""

TEL AVIV, Israel, September 15, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--While ecommerce websites are fighting for every increment of traffic, app-based ecommerce is experiencing strong growth, according to The Global State of Ecommerce 2025 report published today by Similarweb (NYSE: SMWB). The report also finds web marketplaces such as Amazon and Temu growing faster than specialized stores. Meanwhile, the trickle of traffic from AI chatbots is proving important because those visitors are primed to buy.
The report compares estimated online activity for the period July 2024 to June 2025 with the previous year, July 2023 to June 2024, revealing which marketplaces, merchants, websites, apps, categories, and countries are seeing the greatest growth.
Key findings:
-
Web versus apps: Overall visits to ecommerce and shopping websites dropped 1% over the past year, but ecommerce app sessions were up 13%.
-
AI refers high-intent buyers: Ecommerce websites are attracting a small but fast growing and important share of traffic from AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Similarweb estimates the conversion rate for visits referred by ChatGPT is 11.4%, compared with 5.3% for organic search.
-
Marketplaces versus stores: On the web, ecommerce activity is increasingly concentrated in marketplaces like Amazon and Temu, as opposed to stand-alone stores. But even in aggregate, the marketplaces only grew traffic 1%.
-
Beauty and luxury stores outperform: Stores focused on beauty and luxury goods are seeing modest growth, while home and garden, fashion and apparel, and consumer electronics are weathering a downturn in web traffic.
""There’s a lot of panic in the market over AI-driven changes in search, but that should not obscure the upside,"" said Laurie Naspe, Director of Market Insights at Similarweb. ""We believe brands and sellers who successfully optimize for AI visibility are likely to capture a new traffic channel that delivers high-intent visitors – people who are primed to buy because they’ve already done their research in ChatGPT or Gemini. Meanwhile, getting consumers to download your app and making the app a truly engaging experience is a powerful way to make shopping your store a habit.
""In other words, whatever is happening in the broader market, there are always businesses who outperform by getting ahead of the trends – you just need to make sure you’re one of them,"" Naspe said. ""A good example is beauty brand Il Makiage, which according to Similarweb estimates has seen global visits more than double in the past year thanks largely to effective social media marketing, which is particularly important in their niche."""

Should investors follow his move?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e06d110c636f1f5b47ea08d137ad98e8a887f9e393beebf1968ba8aa68e51ce8,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/ackmans-billion-dollar-bet-on-amazon-isnt-largest/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/ackmans-billion-dollar-bet-on-amazon-isnt-largest/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/15/ackmans-billion-dollar-bet-on-amazon-isnt-largest/,fool.com,200,,"When billionaire investor Bill Ackman makes a move, Wall Street pays attention. The founder of Pershing Square has built his reputation on high-conviction, concentrated bets -- often holding fewer than a dozen stocks in his portfolio. That approach has produced outsized returns over time.
Lately, Ackman surprised many by revealing a massive billion-dollar stake in Amazon. For a longtime critic of big tech valuations, the move raised eyebrows. But what's more interesting is that Amazon isn't even Ackman's biggest position today. That honor goes to Uber Technologies (UBER -0.20%).
So, what does this say about how Ackman invests? And what lessons can individual investors take away? Let's break it down.
Ackman's portfolio: Amazon is significant -- but not the largest
Pershing Square bought 5.82 million Amazon shares, worth about $1.3 billion as of this writing, making Amazon roughly 9% of its U.S. equity portfolio -- a significant stake, but not the largest. Uber makes up about 21% of his fund at $2.8 billion, making it his top holding.
Ackman didn't abandon high-conviction positions, but added Amazon to a portfolio that already featured Uber, Brookfield Corporation, and Restaurant Brands. That's a calculated addition, not a replacement.
Uber: Ackman's deepest bet -- and why it matters.
So why does Ackman like Uber that much? In his own words:
We believe that Uber is one of the best-managed and highest-quality businesses in the world. Remarkably, it can still be purchased at a massive discount to its intrinsic value. This favorable combination of attributes is extremely rare, particularly for a large-cap company.
In short, Ackman viewed Uber as an opportunity to invest in a high-quality, well-managed business at a cheap valuation. And that says a lot about Uber. Led by Dara Khosrowshahi (previously the CEO of Expedia), Uber has transitioned from a cash-burning disruptor into a disciplined operator with a wide moat in mobility and delivery. Uber now serves 180 million users per quarter across mobility and delivery.
The strength of Uber's model lies in its network effects -- riders attract drivers, drivers attract riders, and the same flywheel holds for merchants and consumers in food delivery. That scale makes it increasingly difficult for competitors to chip away at its position.
And the company's growth runway is far from tapped out. Beyond mobility and delivery, Uber is building new verticals in advertising and autonomous rides, both of which could become meaningful profit centers over time.
Uber may not have Amazon's scale, but it has something Ackman values deeply: the potential for asymmetric upside as the market continues to underestimate its long-term cash generation power.
What does this say about Ackman's investing strategy?
Ackman continues to run a concentrated portfolio built around conviction, not headlines. His approach layers durable core holdings like Uber with opportunistic new stakes such as Amazon. He times his entries with discipline -- stepping into Amazon when tariff-driven weakness dragged the stock down, and doubling down on Uber after its 2024 stumble.
Just as important, he sizes his bets according to conviction. Uber holds a top position, significantly larger than Amazon, indicating where Ackman sees the greatest multi-year upside. This isn't fast-money trading. It's deliberate positioning around businesses Ackman believes can compound value for years, backed by fundamentals rather than market noise.
So what does it mean for investors?
Ackman might have captured the spotlight with his holdings in Uber and Amazon. But investors shouldn't just mirror his trades. Instead, the lesson lies in how he invests:
- Buy high-quality companies facing temporary challenges.
- Scale positions to your conviction and risk tolerance.
- Think in decades, not quarters -- long runways take years to play out.
In short, Ackman's moves remind us that elephants can still dance. Uber and Amazon are both massive companies, yet size hasn't stopped them from compounding value. For long-term investors, the real opportunity lies in spotting those durable businesses, tracking them closely, and acting when the price -- and conviction -- line up."

Trade Desk Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder of The Trade Desk, you generally need to believe in the secular shift of global advertising budgets toward data-driven, measurable outcomes, particularly in connected TV (CTV), where the company has traditionally excelled as a leading independent player. The recent Netflix-Amazon DSP partnership, however, directly strikes at this narrative by reducing The Trade Desk's CTV inventory exclusivity and bringing a powerful rival directly into competition. This move intensifies concerns that the biggest risk currently facing the company is the rising dominance of walled gardens, potentially impacting short-term growth and market share.
Among recent company developments, the departure of long-time CFO Laura Schenkein and the appointment of Alex Kayyal as her replacement are especially relevant in this context. Leadership transitions at the executive level add uncertainty at a time when The Trade Desk must respond quickly to competitive threats and execute on key strategic initiatives, particularly those tied to maintaining its share of premium CTV ad spend and evolving its AI-powered platform.
On the other hand, the new level of direct competition for marquee streaming inventory raises issues investors should watch closely, such as...

What Wall Street Has Been Saying
Analyst research on Amazon.com has reflected a broad spectrum of views, with commentary continuing to focus on the company’s execution in retail and cloud, cost control, and the evolving competitive landscape. The following takeaways summarize the key perspectives driving buy- and sell-side assessments over the recent months.
🐂 Bullish Takeaways
-
Bulls highlight Amazon’s accelerated push into grocery, especially fresh and perishable delivery with minimum $25 baskets. This is seen as a structural driver for durable growth, margin expansion, and elevated Prime ecosystem engagement in a market estimated at over one trillion dollars.
-
Improved visibility around AWS demand, tied to chip supply stabilization, proactive AI and cloud initiatives, new high-profile partnerships, and expanded automation, is consistently cited as a core strength that underpins potential for operating leverage and enhanced profitability.
-
Impactful execution in logistics, particularly innovations that shorten delivery windows and unlock new purchase categories, is recognized for driving higher Prime renewal intent and greater pricing power during major events like Prime Day.
-
Barclays and Needham, among other firms, have recently reiterated bullish outlooks. Needham lifted its price target to $295 following strong cloud segment updates, while also acknowledging that near-term valuation already embeds some optimism and vigilance is warranted.
🐻 Bearish Takeaways
-
Bears express concern over the operational complexity and income dilution risks introduced by Amazon’s rapid grocery expansion, particularly if execution misses or costs escalate during aggressive share gains.
-
Some firms contend that, despite recent momentum, AWS still trails Azure and GCP on certain key growth and margin benchmarks. This raises questions about Amazon’s long-term competitive positioning in AI infrastructure.
-
Citi and BNP Paribas recently voiced neutral to cautious stances. Citi reduced its price target to $245, citing slower-than-expected margin improvement in cloud and lingering integration risks across new business lines.
-
Valuation skepticism persists among the more cautious analysts, with several arguing that much of the upside is already reflected in the current share price and that near-term volatility is possible if execution stumbles."

With a rate cut now all but certain, the market’s bull run seems unstoppable.
But it may look a little different.
Last week, Apple was slapped with two critical downgrades, suggesting that the Cupertino, California-based iPhone-maker is proving there may be a limit to just how high a megacap tech company can climb. But is the rest of the Magnificent Seven bumping up against a similar ceiling?
Defense Is the Worst Offense
Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event last Tuesday included the debut of its Air model of iPhones, an attempt to broaden the market for its marquee product and compete more aggressively with ascendant Samsung’s rival models. The anticipated foldable iPhone was a no-show, adding fuel to the criticism that Apple has been too slow to innovate across both hardware and, particularly, AI software. By the end of the week, awe gave way to meh. DA Davidson downgraded Apple’s stock from “buy” to “neutral,” while Phillip Securities downgraded it to “reduce” from “neutral.”
The gloomy reaction left Apple on the sidelines of another stellar week on the stock market; its share price fell roughly 2.2% over the course of last week, counter to a five-day streak of closing highs and a 1.5% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq and a 1.3% increase for the broader S&P 500, which closed at a record on Thursday. Among the Mag 7, only Amazon joined Apple in the losers’ club, with investors focused on its growing competition in the AI space, particularly from Oracle.
Last week’s big winner? Tesla, this year’s biggest Mag 7 loser, which will benefit from rate cuts more than the other six:
- Tesla stock climbed nearly 12% last week, which means it has clawed back all its losses for the year after plummeting more than 40% through April (it’s tough being a global auto company amid a global trade war — especially when you’re on a friends-to-enemies arc with the US president).
- So what explains the rise? Auto companies tend to do well, naturally, in times of lower interest rates, given that most consumers still finance their car purchases. Stellantis also rose about 3.4% last week, while GM rose about 0.5% (Ford, down 0.6% last week, is stuck dealing with a nasty spate of recalls; it’s responsible for roughly 60% of all major US auto recalls this year, Barron’s recently found).
Print the Legend: Not everyone is feeling the Fed cut hike. In a note last week, JPMorgan’s Andrew Tyler wrote that the bank is maintaining its “lower conviction Tactical Bullish” market outlook. That’s a fancy — or at least very masculine — way of saying “yes, rate cuts could be good for the market, but they’re still happening for a reason.” Tyler flagged resurgent inflation, a weak labor market, and ongoing trade risks as headwinds moving forward, saying the rate cut could turn into a “Sell the News” event."

you heard uh Inez talk a little bit how the Mag 7 reacted after uh prior rate cuts. Uh, what, you know, what is your thinking on this key space? You know, we get that one rate cut, get a couple more. Historically, these stocks have done pretty darn well uh after rate cuts.
Yeah, I I I think that they've not only done well over rate cuts, they also have done well over the last couple of years and they've really been the only source of positive earnings revisions, you know, ever since the Fed started to hike in 2022. But if you're looking at a change in potential leadership, I would look outside of the Mag 7 uh because, you know, the a lower interest rate environment should allow kind of more cyclical parts of the economy, things like housing that we talked about or manufacturing to start to grow again, to start to demonstrate some positive earnings revision. That's a catalyst in my mind that's been absent in markets last couple of years. And if you're looking just at at a valuation differential between those areas of the market and the Mag 7, that is is quite wide. Uh and so there's a potential there I think for a catch-up trade outside of just continued strength from the Mag 7 potentially, but also uh maybe uh maybe some other opportunities that investors really haven't favored the last couple of years.
You mentioned small cast. Small cast have been rallying. What's the what's the case for for that? You know, I would just counter, we've seen a weakening labor market, inflation is still high, a lot of these smaller businesses in the US, in some respects are really struggling.
They are and and it really has been a, um, a result of, you know, the Fed hiking rates in 2022 aggressively, but now we're on the other side of that. And what we've seen, especially if you, if you look at kind of prior periods of history when we start to see an easing in policy, um, you know, the smaller companies tend to borrow at at at a prime rate or a variable rate, and when the cost of financing comes down, they are in a unique position to benefit because they were the ones that have been hurt by it. Um, the Mac 7 hasn't been hurt by this. And so, you know, while they're not going to have any difference in terms of their operating environment, the small businesses are. Uh and so we would just look to that as more of a unique callyst for that specific part of the market even though it struggled the last couple of years."

Chicago, IL – September 15, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Vertiv VRT and Nvidia NVDA.
Buy Top AI Stock Vertive Before It Soars After Oracle's Report
Oracle bolstered the case for the artificial intelligence spending boom when it reported its quarterly results on September 9. The cloud computing giant’s backlog soared 359% to $455 billion, driven by spending from AI hyperscalers like Amazon, a blockbuster deal with OpenAI, and more.
Vertiv, which works with Nvidia, is a behind-the-scenes firm that benefits directly from the AI data center boom. The Ohio-based firm’s growing portfolio helps make sure the high-density computing power needed to fuel the AI age runs as smoothly as possible 24/7.
Vertiv earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, driven by its improving earnings outlook. The picks-and-shovels AI stock is also gaining more attention from Wall Street analysts, and could be on the verge of a technical breakout while trading 12% below its average Zacks price target.
It’s time for investors to consider buying Vertiv, which already blew away all of the AI hyperscalers over the last three years.
Buy AI Stock Vertiv Now and Hold Forever
Vertiv’s hardware, software, analytics, and ongoing services portfolio is focused on power, cooling, and IT infrastructure. Its product categories include critical power, thermal management, racks & enclosures, monitoring & management, and beyond.
In other words, Vertiv operates in the background of big tech and AI, supporting the constant expansion and the day-to-day operations of AI data centers and the broader technology-driven economy.
The digital infrastructure company has never been more critical and in demand. The enormous expansion of data centers requires massive amounts of high-performance computing power that operates at peak performance 24/7. Vertiv has partnered with the current titan of AI, Nvidia, to help solve future data center efficiency and cooling challenges.
VRT posted another beat-and-raise quarter at the end of July that pushed its 2026 earnings estimate 11% higher. Vertiv’s recent wave of upward revisions earned it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and restarted its impressive upward revision trend that began in 2023.
The firm also completed its acquisition of Great Lakes Data Racks & Cabinets on August 20, furthering Vertiv’s “capabilities to customize at scale and configure at speed for AI and high-density computing environments.”
The company is projected to grow its revenue by 25% in 2025 and 16% next year to $11.55 billion—double its 2021 total. Vertiv is expected to expand its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 34% this year and 27% next year."

As part of a major agreement, Sir Keir Starmer will sign a “nuclear partnership” with Mr Trump this week that opens the door for a new generation of projects in Britain.
The move is seen as crucial to avoiding a wave of blackouts as Ed Miliband, the Energy Secretary, pushes unpredictable sources such as solar and wind.
As part of the agreement, a landmark nuclear deal between British Gas owner Centrica and X-Energy, an American start-up backed by Jeff Bezos’s Amazon, is on the cards that could supply 14 million homes.
They are planning a first site in Hartlepool that could start generating electricity within a decade using mini-nukes known as “advanced modular reactors” (AMR).
Ministers are hoping that a new wave of these small reactors, which vastly improve on 20th century designs, can help achieve Labour’s net zero ambitions.
Electricity demand is expected to rise in the coming years, as sales of electric cars rise in response to a petrol car ban, and gas boilers are phased out in favour of heat pumps.
Mr Miliband has already pledged billions of pounds for conventional nuclear power stations, hoping they can provide “baseload power” when the weather does not allow for wind and solar.
The Prime Minister said that the deal will mean electricity bills coming down “in the long run”, and lead to thousands of jobs.
Under the US-UK agreement, known as the “Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy”, the two countries have committed to fast-tracking information sharing so that reactors can be built more quickly.
The time to secure a licence for a new project could be cut from four years to two under the plans.
Under the deal, both countries will fast-track reactor design checks, meaning if a reactor has already passed rigorous safety checks in one country, the results can be used by the other.
The deal also sees Britain committing to removing dependence on Russia for any nuclear material by 2028 – two years earlier than previously announced.
The Telegraph revealed earlier this month that JD Vance, the US Vice President, had pushed US nuclear companies to announce a string of British deals to coincide with Mr Trump’s trip.
Centrica said its deal with X-Energy would see Britain’s first AMRs – a new form of ultra-safe electricity sources – being built next to the Hartlepool nuclear plant which was constructed in the 1980s and is due to shut down in 2028."

The Scottish actor will front a new advertising campaign to raise awareness of the Multibank, which provides goods such as toiletries at six sites across the country.
The new campaign highlights the “stark choice” some people have in choosing which basic essential item they can afford to buy, posing the question; ‘Toilet roll or a toothbrush? No one should have to choose’.”
Child poverty is described by Gordon Brown as “the tragedy of the 2020s”.
More than 100 businesses now partner the Multibank alongside Amazon, which provides its excess stock or lends logistical and technical support.
Goods provides by the charity include coats, bedding, duvets, school uniforms, sports kit, crockery, personal and household hygiene products, shoes, towels and shampoo.
Tennant said: “I think the Multibank is a brilliant, clever and very pure idea, the companies and businesses have products they can’t use or can’t sell and the Multibank takes them, repurposes them and gives them to people who can’t afford them, who are suffering and makes they lives better.
“Everyone wins.
“It’s one of those perfect ideas.
“I can’t believe it hasn’t already existed and I’m thrilled to be supporting it.
Mr Brown said: “The tragedy of the 2020s is that nearly 4.5 million children are facing abject, dire and never ending poverty that will shape their whole lives unless we act.

The company operates a massive online marketplace and logistics network, a fast-growing advertising platform embedded across its properties, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest cloud infrastructure business.
Recent results and guidance point to a company leaning further into its most profitable areas. That mix shift, combined with disciplined cost control, sets up a reasonable path for earnings to compound at healthy rates. If the price-to-earnings multiple stays where it is today, shares could hit $300 within two years.
Strong growth in higher-margin lines
Amazon's second-quarter results were strong where it matters most. Net sales rose 13% year over year to $167.7 billion, while operating income climbed 31% to $19.2 billion. AWS grew 17.5% to $30.9 billion, and advertising services increased 23% to $15.7 billion -- both outpacing consolidated growth and, importantly, carrying richer margins than first-party retail.
The mix is slowly shifting toward these higher-margin engines. In the quarter, AWS represented about 18% of revenue, and advertising services exceeded 9% of total sales. Together, they're becoming a larger slice of the pie as they compound faster than online stores. The bottom-line effect is visible in earnings power: Trailing-twelve-month earnings per share improved to $6.55 through the end of Q2, up from $4.18 in the trailing-12-month period ending a year earlier.
While management doesn't specifically call out the margins of its advertising services segment, it did say in its second-quarter earnings call that ""Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North American International segments."" Regarding AWS, its operating margin is about 37% on a trailing-12-month basis, compared to an operating margin of about 11% for the overall company.
Guidance adds another layer of confidence. For the quarter ending in September, Amazon expects revenue to be between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, up 10% to 13% year over year, and operating income of $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion. While that operating-income range allows for macro and spending variability, it still implies a business that is running far more efficiently than it was two years ago.
A clear path to $300, with caveats
For investors, the question is whether these dynamics can carry the stock from roughly the high-$220s today to $300. A simple way to frame it is to hold the valuation roughly constant and let earnings do the work. At recent prices, the shares trade at around 35 times trailing earnings.
If trailing-twelve-month earnings per share of $6.55 grow at about a 15% compound annual rate for two years, earnings would climb to roughly $8.70. Multiply that by the same 35 price-to-earnings multiple, and the stock price comes out to just over $300. In other words, without assuming a richer valuation, earnings growth could drive the stock materially higher in a relatively short timeframe.
Of course, there are some critical risks to keep an eye on. AWS' quarterly operating margin ticked down to 32.9% from 39.5% in the prior quarter as Amazon accelerated investments in artificial intelligence (AI) capacity and infrastructure. Further, competitive intensity in cloud computing remains high, and heavy capital spending tied to AI models and data centers could pressure near-term profitability. Additionally, trade and tariff policies remain a headwind that the company explicitly calls out in its guidance commentary, and retail demand can soften if consumers pull back.
Still, the core investment case is strong. Advertising continues to grow faster than the company overall, AWS remains a large and expanding business even as Amazon invests aggressively in AI, and cost discipline is showing up in operating income gains. These dynamics -- steady growth, a richer revenue mix, and a more efficient retail business -- should support mid-teens earnings growth and help the company command a similar price-to-earnings ratio in the years ahead.
Ultimately, the stock price going from the high-$220s to about $300 within two years looks not just possible but reasonable. With this said, investors shouldn't buy the stock with a two-year time horizon in mind. A longer-term view is less risky and allows more wiggle room for sentiment shifts. But this exercise helps show how Amazon can continue to reward shareholders."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-14T18:01:00,Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company Will Reshape Cloud Infrastructure by 2030,The company's focus on cloud and AI has unlocked unprecedented growth.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1a6e0b05222b6a8f3ae9ceee7037634bebe082883b09b66d94009ccc718c1fe8,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-company/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-company/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-company/,fool.com,200,,"The advent of modern cloud computing is largely attributed to Amazon, which pioneered cloud infrastructure services with the introduction of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002. The industry has evolved over time, but the basics remain the same: Providers offer on-demand, scalable computing, software, data storage, and networking capabilities to any business with an internet connection.
After a period of slower growth, the cloud infrastructure space got a jump start thanks to recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the large language models that underpin the technology require a great deal of computational horsepower, which typically isn't available outside a data center. As a result, the demand for cloud infrastructure services has skyrocketed in recent years, and it's expected only to grow from here.
Recent developments suggest there could be a big shakeup coming to the cloud infrastructure space, led by technology stalwart Oracle (ORCL 1.24%).
Skyrocketing demand for Oracle Cloud
While the company is primarily known for its flagship Oracle Database, it offers customers a growing suite of enterprise software, integrated cloud applications, and cloud infrastructure services.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has long trailed the Big Three cloud providers. To close out the calendar second quarter, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud controlled 30%, 20%, and 13% of the market, respectively, according to data compiled by Statista. Oracle ran a distant fifth with 3% of the market.
Yet, recent developments suggest a paradigm shift in the status quo. When Oracle released the results of its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), the headline numbers were largely business as usual. Total revenue grew 11% year over year to $14.9 billion, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 grew 6%.
However, investors were taken aback by the magnitude of Oracle's backlog, as its remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contractual obligations not yet included in revenue -- surged 359% year over year to $455 billion. Perhaps more impressive is the $317 billion in contracts signed during the first quarter alone.
Oracle's position as a trusted partner to enterprise made it ""the go-to place for AI workloads,"" according to CEO Safra Catz. If that wasn't enough, she went on to say, ""We expect to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers and RPO is likely to exceed half-a-trillion dollars.""
Breaking down that backlog shows that Oracle will be reaping the benefit of those deals for years to come:
- Fiscal 2026 cloud revenue of $18 billion, up 77%
- Fiscal 2027 cloud revenue of $32 billion, up 78%
- Fiscal 2028 cloud revenue of $73 billion, up 128%
- Fiscal 2029 cloud revenue of $114 billion, up 56%
- Fiscal 2030 cloud revenue of $144 billion, up 26%
The company notes that the majority of the revenue in this outlook is already booked in RPO, so there are contracts backing these forecasts. If Oracle is able to reach these lofty benchmarks, and that's still a big if, OCI will join the big leagues of cloud infrastructure and could potentially unseat one or more of the Big Three.
A changing of the guard?
As previously stated, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google top the list of cloud infrastructure providers, so it helps to see where they stand. During the first six months of 2025, AWS generated revenue of $60.1 billion, up 17%, suggesting a run rate of $120 billion. During the same period, Google Cloud's revenue came in at $25.9 billion, up 30%, suggesting a run rate of about $51.8 billion. Microsoft doesn't generally break out Azure's revenue, but it recently revealed that for fiscal 2025 (ended June 30), Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue, up 34%.
Given the limitations, this is obviously not an apples-to-apples comparison, but it provides us with a starting point. Taking these extrapolated figures and applying their most recent growth rates over the coming four years, here's where the Big Three would stand by the end of calendar 2029 compared to Oracle:
- AWS: $225 billion
- Azure: $241 billion
- Google Cloud: $157 billion
- Oracle: $144 billion
Using our imperfect information and assuming Oracle can turn its RPO into cloud revenue, this exercise shows a path for OCI to mount a challenge to the Big Three over the next five years.
To be clear, this is fun with numbers, and life doesn't occur in a vacuum. All of our cloud infrastructure providers will likely grow more quickly or more slowly than our examples suggest. One of the upstart neocloud providers could capture an outsize portion of the market. There are plenty of other examples of what could go very right or very wrong, but you get the idea.
To buy or not to buy?
The recent surge in Oracle's stock price has had a commensurate impact on its valuation, which appears lofty at first glance. The stock is selling for 38 times next year's earnings, which is certainly a premium. However, using the more appropriate forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which accounts for the company's growth trajectory, the multiple comes in at 0.8, when any number less than 1 is the standard for an undervalued stock."

With a net worth over $200 billion, Bezos is one of the five richest people in the world. Much of Bezos’ wealth is actually in the shares of stock he owns in the company he founded, Amazon.

But what if Bezos split his shares up with every American?
We’ll break down how many shares of Amazon Bezos still has, about how much those shares are worth and how rich you’d get if Bezos gave all his shares away evenly to every American.
How Many Shares of Amazon Does Jeff Bezos Have?
According to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) filings, Bezos still holds around 884,000,000 shares of Amazon stock. This is after cashing out over $5 billion worth of stock in June and July of 2025.
At current Amazon stock prices, this means Bezos’ shares are still worth a staggering $205 billion! This makes up a majority of his over $240 billion net worth, and it’s fair to say — when Amazon does well, Bezos get richer and richer.

How Many Shares of Amazon Stock Would Each American Get?
But what if Bezos decided he wanted to spread his wealth, and directly give each and every American an equal portion of all the Amazon shares he owns?
First, that would be amazing. But second, I want to know exactly how many shares I’d get, and what that would be worth in today’s dollars?
According to the Population Clock at the U.S. Census Bureau, there are currently 342,441,111 Americans alive today (give or take a few thousand by the day).
This means if we split Bezos’ 884 million shares of Amazon stock evenly, every American alive today would get 2.58 shares of Amazon stock. While this doesn’t sound like a lot — it’s more than nothing!
But wait, what if minors were not eligible, and only adults could receive shares?
Since about 10.75% of the population are under age 18, that means only 305,628,691 would receive shares. These bumps share ownership up to 2.89 per person.
At current prices (around $232 per share), this means every American would receive around $670.48 worth of value in their Amazon shares.
What If You Held Onto Those Shares of Amazon for 10 Years?
Ok, while $670 is not life-changing money, it’s better than nothing. But what if you decided to hang on to those Amazon shares for the next 10 years instead of cashing it out?
Over the last 10 years, Amazon stock has averaged a 25% return per year. This far outpaces the S&P 500 and many other funds."

Only Walmart and Amazon are above it on the leaderboard. Costco is clearly a dominant force in the industry, and investors have been rewarded. Shares have generated a total return of 733% in the past decade (as of Sept. 10).
Should you buy this blue chip stock right now?
Scale creates an advantage
There is minimal risk that Costco will be disrupted anytime soon. Its massive scale is one important reason why. The previously mentioned revenue figure of $62 billion comes from an average of 4,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) sold in the company's warehouses. This is much less than the 30,000 that a typical supermarket sells. Therefore, Costco sells a large volume of a limited number of goods.
This creates a powerful cost advantage. The company has negotiating leverage with its suppliers. This results in low costs that are always passed on to shoppers. These customers are happy, with memberships up 6.8% year over year in Q3 and a worldwide renewal rate of 90.2%.
Price check on Costco stock
Costco is a safe and reliable company that investors should always keep in mind. Even better, it continues to open new warehouses, pushing growth. Its ability to keep thriving despite the rise of e-commerce points to its strong competitive standing.
However, now is not a good time to buy shares. They currently trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 54.2. Put this stock on the watch list for now."

Investors have dealt with a worldwide pandemic, political tensions, trade wars, actual wars, economic troubles, market crashes, and more.
Throughout it all, broader equities performed well; the S&P 500 has grown 98% over the past five years. There's a good chance that the stock market will once again generate solid returns over the next five years.
Let's consider three excellent stocks to buy to ride this wave: Amazon (AMZN -0.70%), Shopify (SHOP 2.19%), and Eli Lilly (LLY 1.74%).
1. Amazon
Amazon has been the biggest player in the e-commerce market in North America for years, but this dominance has come at a cost. The company invested a substantial amount in building its fulfillment network, which enables it to offer fast delivery on thousands of items, a key factor in its success.
Its e-commerce business carries low margins, but this could change based on recent technological advancements. The tech leader is betting on artificial intelligence (AI) and an army of robots to boost the efficiency of its shipping and delivery services. So although Amazon has been riding the e-commerce wave for two decades, increased productivity and the under-penetration of the market mean that it can still make significant progress on this front over the next five years.
Amazon's margins and bottom line should improve over time because of these changes. So should the company's highly profitable cloud business. Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the leader in cloud computing, with faster-growing sales than the rest of the company.
The various AI services it offers are also improving results for AWS. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy believes the company is still in the early innings of the cloud and AI revolutions, while analysts' projections support the idea that e-commerce also has a long runway for growth. As these markets expand, Amazon should profit in the next five years and beyond.
2. Shopify
Shopify should be another beneficiary of the rapidly growing e-commerce industry. The company helps merchants create online stores, a task that can otherwise be expensive and time-consuming. But Shopify alleviates the headache by providing basic, highly customizable templates -- along with a range of services, from marketing to payments -- that allow business owners to focus on other aspects of their operations.
The company has found tremendous success. Its gross merchandise volume (it holds a 12% share of the U.S. e-commerce market by this metric) and revenue have historically grown rapidly, while free cash flow has improved significantly in recent years.
Since Shopify decided to abandon plans to build a fulfillment network that rivals Amazon's, its margins have also received a boost. Although it isn't yet consistently profitable, Shopify looks closer than ever to achieving that goal. It should reach it within the next five years, as revenue continues to maintain strong upward momentum. The stock has crushed the market this year; it can do the same through 2030.
3. Eli Lilly
Eli Lilly is currently the largest pharmaceutical stock by market cap. By 2030, it should also occupy the top spot by another metric: annual revenue. That's due to the company's diabetes and obesity medicines, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which share the same active ingredient, tirzepatide. Combined, they should generate more than $27 billion in sales this year. The list of drugs that have topped that total in a year is tiny, and most did so after more than a decade on the market, not just three years like tirzepatide.
Lilly is performing exceptionally well because of its work in weight management, and is expected to continue profiting from this area through the next five years. According to some projections, the weight loss market will be worth $150 billion by the early 2030s; it was valued at only about $14 billion in 2023. There's clearly strong demand for these medicines, and no company has a better portfolio -- or pipeline -- than Eli Lilly.
Next-gen GLP-1 candidates should help Lilly maintain its edge, at least for the foreseeable future. These include orforglipron, an oral medicine that performed pretty well in phase 3 studies, and retatrutide, which mimics the action of three different gut hormones (compared to two for Zepbound).
The drugmaker's revenue growth in recent quarters has more closely resembled a high-growth tech company's than a pharmaceutical giant's. Provided it maintains this trend, Eli Lilly is likely to generate strong returns over the next five years."

Over the last five years, Broadcom is up over 925% and Oracle is up over 475% -- outperforming every ""Magnificent Seven"" stock (Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla) except one -- Nvidia.
The ""Ten Titans"" provide an update to the Magnificent Seven by adding Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix to the list. Combined, these three companies have nearly the same market cap as Apple, and are gaining increasing influence in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.30%). In fact, the Ten Titans now make up 39.1% of the index compared to 33.7% for the Magnificent Seven.
Beyond the market cap influence of these names, Broadcom and Oracle embody groundbreaking advancements in cloud computing, infrastructure software, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Here's why Broadcom and Oracle have become such dominant companies, and whether either growth stock is a buy now.
Broadcom is a balanced way to invest in AI
Broadcom and Oracle's surging stock prices illustrate how AI is redefining previously stagnant investment theses. Just a few years ago, both companies were often viewed as dividend-paying stalwarts.
Broadcom was known for its established semiconductor business, providing the nuts and bolts behind networking, broadband, wireless, cybersecurity, and more. But the company is completely different today due to its acquisition of VMware in late 2023 and the development and adoption of its AI chips.
Cloud computing giants are lining up to buy Broadcom's AI chips, known as XPUs. XPUs are highly advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are tailored to a specialized function and are especially good at handling increasing AI workloads. Broadcom doesn't just design the chips, it also makes associated networking products, like Tomahawk switches that link chips within a server rack, and Jericho Ethernet fabric routers, which enable the connection of over 1 million XPU clusters across multiple data centers.
Broadcom is unique because it is far bigger than just an AI play. Rather, it is a highly diversified company that benefits from the buildout of AI infrastructure, AI software, and the growth of high-speed connectivity.
Oracle is heavily disrupting incumbent cloud giants
Oracle's latest quarter perfectly represents why Broadcom has become a behemoth that is closing in on $1 trillion in market cap. On Sept. 9, Oracle said that its cloud infrastructure segment is expected to grow 77% in fiscal 2026, 78% in fiscal 2027, 128% in fiscal 2028, and 97% in fiscal 2029 to become a $144 billion business. If Oracle comes remotely close to these estimates, its cloud business will become far larger than its legacy database services segment.
Like Broadcom, Oracle was once an entrenched business-to-business giant in tech, known for its stodgy growth and reliable dividend. But Oracle is now a completely different company. Its strength comes from its competitive pricing model, which makes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) a great add-on for customers that use its database services.
Oracle is an enterprise-facing company. Whereas investors in the ""big three"" cloud players, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are getting a lot of moving parts that have nothing to do with cloud computing. In this vein, Oracle has become one of the best ways to invest in high-octane cloud growth, somewhat similar to how investors are drawn to Nvidia. Nvidia has become a pure-play AI stock because its data center business is now magnitudes larger than its gaming and professional visualization markets.
Broadcom and Oracle's stock prices are running up far faster than they are growing earnings because investors are buying these stocks for where they could be years from now rather than where they are today. Forward earnings estimates will probably increase as analysts adjust their targets based on recent results and guidance. But for now, Broadcom's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a staggering 54.8 compared to 48.2 for Oracle. For context, Nvidia's forward P/E is 39.5 -- meaning investors are even more excited about Broadcom and Oracle's growth.
Broadcom and Oracle are moving markets
The breakneck growth rates and size of Broadcom and Oracle prove why it's time to forget the Magnificent Seven and use the Ten Titans as a better descriptor for market-moving growth stocks. Even folks who don't own the Ten Titans outright may be indirectly impacted through their holdings in index funds and exchange-traded funds.
In addition to their foundational role in the major indexes, the Ten Titans will likely make or break broader market sentiment. If the S&P 500 keeps making new highs, it's probably because of the Ten Titans. If it undergoes a major sell-off, it's probably because a few key Titans fell. You may have even seen headlines about how the S&P 500 is expensive relative to its historical valuation. That's because many of the Ten Titans are valued more for their future earnings than their current profits. So investors should only approach these stocks if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term time horizon, and believe these companies can deliver on highly optimistic expectations.
It's also worth noting the correlation that these companies can have. For example, Oracle's blowout quarter sent Broadcom and Nvidia soaring on Sept. 10 because Oracle is a major customer of these chip makers. Increased AI spending to build out OCI benefits Broadcom and Nvidia. Although Oracle may account for less than 2% of the S&P 500, its results had a significantly larger impact on the S&P 500 than the movement in its stock price alone."

The enhancement is designed to prevent misleading price-inflation tactics and ensure consumers receive true savings.
What's new:
-
The upgraded system performs automated retrieval of historical lowest prices for items listed on DealHurryUp, comparing current discounted offers against verified past price data.
-
By identifying merchants who artificially raise list prices before applying discounts - a practice that can leave consumers paying as much or more than the original price - the algorithm helps surface only authentic bargains.
-
According to DealHurryUp leadership, the algorithm's accuracy, when combined with targeted human review, can approach near-100% reliability.
""Our mission has always been simple: make smart shopping effortless and honest,"" said a DealHurryUp spokesperson. ""With this upgrade, customers can trust that the deals they see are real discounts - not marketing tricks. The new algorithm, supported by human oversight, dramatically reduces the chance of false savings and restores confidence in online deal hunting.""
Why this matters: Consumers frequently encounter ""discounts"" that are misleading because of prior price inflation. DealHurryUp's verification process protects shoppers by ensuring discounts are measured against genuine historical low prices rather than manipulated list prices. This transparency benefits buyers seeking real value and helps maintain fair competition among sellers.
How it works (brief):
-
Automated retrieval: The system scans and records historical price points for products advertised as discounted.
-
Comparative analysis: Current sale prices are compared against the historical low to verify whether the advertised discount represents a genuine reduction.
-
Human validation: Suspect listings are reviewed by DealHurryUp staff to ensure accuracy and to address edge cases (e.g., temporary promotional pricing or marketplace-specific variations).
User impact: Shoppers using DealHurryUp can expect fewer misleading listings and more verified savings. The update reinforces the platform's position as a reliable source for curated Amazon deals and reduces the time and effort required to research product price histories.
About DealHurryUp: DealHurryUp is a discount aggregation website under FireGooses. We specialize in curating high-quality deals from e-commerce platforms like Amazon, employing a dual verification system of AI-powered vetting and manual review to ensure the authenticity and reliability of discounts. Our mission is to help consumers easily discover genuine discounts, avoid paying full price, and enjoy a transparent and trustworthy money-saving experience."

Paramount Skydance Corp. (NASDAQ:PSKY) is the new name of the former firm Paramount Global, which traded under the ticker ‘PARA.’ It created quite a bit of hype yesterday after the shares shot up in response to a Wall Street Journal report that indicated it could acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. While all Cramer wanted to do was to discuss Apple during the show, co-host David Faber successfully managed to bring his attention to the crucial news. Here is what Cramer said:

“Okay so David I’m looking at WarnerMedia Holdings, I’m looking at all these different pieces of debt, they’re all horrendous. If I had Amazon, I would say, well you know what, we could really do a killing, or Apple. We’ve got the best balance sheet in the world, we just pay off that debt, we immediately become the number one entertainment company. We don’t know how to do entertainment, we’re using TimeWarner for a lot of the things anyway. David, can’t these companies pay much, much more and just decide you know what, we want this and we love Ellison, he’s a terrific guy, but he can’t be in our league.
While we acknowledge the potential of PSKY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Discovery's (WBD) stock has spiked close to 50% in just two trading days after a Wall Street Journal report said Paramount Skydance (PSKY) is preparing a majority-cash bid for the media conglomerate — a potential move that could set off a Hollywood bidding war and reshape the global streaming landscape.
The David Ellison-backed company, which just closed on its takeover of Paramount last month, is reportedly eyeing all of Warner Bros. Discovery’s assets, which include recognizable and high-profile properties from HBO and CNN to the Warner Bros. studio lot.
Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance’s request for comment. Warner Bros. Discovery declined to comment.
While no formal offer has been submitted and talks could still collapse, analysts say the combination would instantly elevate Paramount Skydance’s scale in streaming and advertising, while forcing rivals from Disney (DIS) to Amazon (AMZN) to reassess their competitive playbooks.
“This makes tons of both strategic and economic sense,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst Geetha Ranganathan told Yahoo Finance on Friday. “Both Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery are relatively sub-scale players in streaming. Put them together and you’re talking about 200 million subscribers, a top five global player.”
Netflix (NFLX) has more than 300 million global subscribers, while Disney+ and Hulu together reported 183 million at the end of their latest quarter, which ended June 28, 2025. Paramount+ has roughly 75 million subscribers, and HBO Max has about 125 million. Put together, that gives Ellison’s venture around 200 million subscribers — enough to rank among the top global streaming players.
Beyond scale, the combined company would also generate roughly $20 billion in TV advertising revenue, with analysts estimating $3 billion to $5 billion in annual merger synergies.
But Paramount may not be the only bidder. Comcast (CMCSA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Netflix, and Sony (SONY) have all been floated as potential suitors, though analysts caution that most may be reluctant to absorb WBD’s shrinking cable portfolio. Still, the rare chance to secure Warner Bros. Discovery's crown-jewel franchises could prove too tempting to pass up.
“This absolutely raises the stakes for everybody,” Ranganathan said. “With Warner Bros., you get top-tier brands like DC Comics, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. On the TV side, they have one of the best production houses and some of the most premium properties on HBO Max.
""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Paramount or any other bidder,"" she added. ""It makes a very formidable competitor — and it weakens everyone else’s hand. That kind of leads us to think we could potentially have a bidding war on our hands."""

I did. I tried my best yesterday and I came up with Gamaton, which uh, you know, sort of sort of gets uh gets the Mag 7 plus. It actually was meant to include Broadcom, truthfully. I forgot the B and and actually Broadcom you could either do an A or a B. so I may have to make it gamma with an extra A, but um basically that would be my that would be my next thought here is uh because you know, I think
we're we're definitely broadening out our focus and I and I think from hearing the the uh the you know, the speakers you heard, they were all tech heavy people. So I do want to hear a little bit more from end users, uh because, you know, the the the crowd strike user was very the crowd strike person was was was very clear about how AI could be used, but it's still not clear that it's all filtering down, let's say to, you know, ordinary companies. And and it took the internet a long time for that to happen.
Um, but so in the meantime, I think Oracle has to be at least included among the big boys. And again, I I I regret that I did not find a place for Broadcom because I've actually been advocating it for uh a great eight or a Mag 7 plus for some time."

When business is surging, companies often expand their workforces to handle demand. That's not what's happening lately at some of America's biggest tech companies.
Oracle's (ORCL) booming AI-driven backlog sent its stock to a record high this week—just weeks after reports the computing giant laid off hundreds of workers as part of an effort curb costs. Several other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have shed jobs recently even as their revenues rose. (Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs in time for publication.)
The tech sector has been one of the heaviest hit by layoffs so far this year, second only to government jobs, according to a report from Challenger, Gray, and Christmas. And many of the industry's biggest companies are cutting from a large base: Data from online job board Indeed shows that listings for tech jobs peaked in 2022, outpacing the growth of available jobs in the economy at large, but that trend has reversed.
Leading tech firms are trimming their ranks as demand for their services grows. Their swelling spending on AI data centers and hardware from chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) is one contributing factor, according to Wall Street analysts.
AI expenditures are pushing tech leaders to cut costs elsewhere, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria has previously told Investopedia, driving many to cut staff or slow hiring to relieve pressure on profit margins. Some, he said, also expect to need fewer workers because of the technology.
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June that he expects AI will likely lead Amazon to eventually operate with a smaller total headcount. He encouraged them to become more familiar with AI tools, suggesting that those who do could be better-positioned ""to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.""
Economists at Goldman Sachs have estimated that about 6% to 7% of U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI. However, they're still optimistic about its effects on the job market, suggesting that losses could be ""fleeting"" and observing that job displacement due to labor-saving technological advances in the past have tended to fade after about two years.
""We remain skeptical that AI will lead to large employment reductions over the next decade,"" they wrote. ""Predictions that technology will reduce the need for human labor have a long history but a poor track record."""

You are not alone. Investors have watched its price move between headlines, tech rallies, and sentiment shifts, all the while trying to gauge whether there is still room for growth. Over the last 12 months, Amazon.com gained an impressive 22.3%, bouncing back from the lows of recent years and showing that optimism about the future of e-commerce and cloud technology is alive and well. Yet, in the last week, there was a slight dip of -1.8%, a reminder that even giants are not immune to the market’s daily anxieties.
Looking back even further, the numbers are compelling: the stock is up 84.7% over the past three years and 54.4% for the last five. Meanwhile, year-to-date, Amazon.com has notched a steady gain of 3.6%. Some of this resilience and growth can be traced to broader developments in the technology sector and a shift in risk perception, as investors grow more confident in the dominant roles played by global platforms like Amazon.com. However, with a recent 30-day return of just 1.6%, the question remains whether the stock still offers good value, or if expectations have run too far ahead of fundamentals.
That brings us to valuation. Based on six recognized valuation checks, Amazon.com earns a value score of 3, indicating it appears undervalued in half of the areas we assess. In the next section, we will break down what those valuation approaches reveal about Amazon.com today. Later on, we will discuss a more holistic way to weigh the evidence before making your next move.
Why Amazon.com is lagging behind its peers
Approach 1: Amazon.com Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model works by projecting a company’s future cash flows and discounting them back to today’s value. This process provides an estimate of what the entire business could be worth at present. For Amazon.com, the analysis uses a ""2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity"" approach.
Currently, Amazon.com generates around $37.6 billion in free cash flow. Analyst estimates extend over the next five years, with projections showing steady growth. Beyond that, estimates are extrapolated to capture cash flow potential up to 2035. For example, by 2029, Amazon’s free cash flow is expected to reach approximately $138.5 billion, according to the model.
Based on these cash flow projections and discounting them at appropriate rates, the model calculates Amazon’s intrinsic value at $274.57 per share. This suggests the stock is currently trading at a 16.9% discount to its fair value, indicating that the market may be undervaluing Amazon.com’s growth prospects and cash-generating potential."

Over the past month, Rivian’s share price has jumped 9.6%, only to slip by 5.3% in the last week. Even on a bigger timescale, there is a tale of two charts here: a modest 1.6% gain year-to-date contrasts sharply with a staggering 65.7% drop over the past three years. These swings are not just numbers; they reflect how investors are continuously recalibrating their bets on electric vehicle (EV) players like Rivian.
One recent catalyst for the stock’s volatility is news that Amazon, previously a key customer and backer of Rivian, is now seen testing out General Motors’ BrightDrop vans alongside Rivian’s offerings. That kind of headline is bound to make investors reconsider both the risk and growth prospects for Rivian’s delivery vehicle dominance, especially as Amazon looks to meet ambitious climate goals by 2030. Meanwhile, ongoing cost-cutting efforts, like the company’s decision to lay off less than 1.5% of its workforce ahead of a new, more affordable SUV launch, highlight Rivian’s battle to prove its long-term staying power.
If you are curious about Rivian’s valuation, and let’s be real, who isn’t at this point, most traditional metrics are flashing red. Based on our scoring system, the company is considered undervalued in zero out of six standard checks, giving Rivian a value score of 0. But does that really tell the whole story? Up next, we will walk through each valuation approach in detail, and at the end, I will share what I believe is an even better way to think about Rivian’s real value.
Rivian Automotive scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: Rivian Automotive Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's true worth by forecasting its future free cash flows and then discounting those projections back to today. The goal is to determine their total present value. For Rivian Automotive, the DCF uses a two-stage method to model the company's free cash flow (FCF) growth over time.
Currently, Rivian's last-twelve-months free cash flow is negative $1.2 billion, reflecting the steep early investments common in fast-growing electric vehicle manufacturers. According to analysts, free cash flow is expected to remain negative over the next few years, but a turnaround is projected. By 2029, annual FCF is estimated to reach $961 million. Further out, Simply Wall St extrapolates that the company could generate over $3.6 billion in FCF by 2035."

United Parcel Service Investment Narrative Recap
Owning United Parcel Service stock is about believing in its ability to boost profitability by shifting focus from lower-margin enterprise customers like Amazon to more lucrative small and medium-sized businesses. The new American Express shipping partnership is a step in this direction and may help support near-term volume and pricing ahead of the holidays, but the largest risk remains tariff changes and softer global demand, which could offset these gains if conditions worsen.
Of the recent announcements, UPS’s decision to reduce Amazon package volume by over 50% by mid-2026 stands out, given its impact on both risk and catalyst narratives. This move directly connects to efforts to build healthier margins through SMB partnerships such as the latest Amex deal, which provides a meaningful test of UPS’s ability to replace lost large-client business with higher-margin alternatives.
However, with tariffs and shifting global supply chains still in flux, investors should be aware that...

This massive wave of investment is creating long-term opportunities for businesses that can scale with these digital shifts. Companies with robust competitive advantages and proven business models are positioned to benefit most from this trend.
As this trend accelerates, here's why these two growth stocks can prove to be exceptional buy-and-hold picks for the next decade.
Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.04%) remains a leading player in the social media and digital advertising landscape, and it's now accelerating its investment in AI infrastructure to drive the next phase of growth.
Meta's core business is a cash-generating machine that can fund future growth opportunities. In the second quarter of 2025 (ending June 30), revenues rose 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, with an operating margin of 43% and free cash flow of $8.5 billion.
It is indisputable that digital advertising remains the primary driver of growth. Meta is leveraging advanced AI technologies to enhance ad targeting and recommendations as well as user engagement across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, strengthening its digital advertising business.
The company serves over 3.4 billion daily active users and uses AI models, including Andromeda, GEM, and Lattice, to enhance ad conversions and pricing across its applications, resulting in stronger monetization.
Its push beyond its core apps into newer platforms may also begin to generate fresh advertising growth. Threads has already surpassed 350 million users, and ads are starting to appear across its feed. Advertisements are also being introduced in the status and channels features of WhatsApp. Business messaging is scaling, with U.S. click-to-message revenue up more than 40% year over year in the second quarter.
Meta is also rolling out subscriptions for WhatsApp channels -- a feature that can help businesses connect with over 1.5 billion daily active users who visit the channels. Meta AI, a consumer-facing AI-powered assistant integrated into its app ecosystem, has already built a user base of over 1 billion monthly active users. Besides improving user engagement through personalized recommendations and enhanced content discovery, it can also become a new monetization avenue in the coming quarters.
The tech giant is aggressively investing to expand its AI infrastructure. Meta expects capital expenditures of $66 billion to $72 billion in 2025, with even higher figures in 2026 as it builds AI data centers to support advanced AI models. While this may affect margins and cash flows in the near term, the long-term payoff of leveraging in-house AI capabilities to strengthen the core business may be exceptionally impressive.
Meta's shares trade at a rich valuation of nearly 28.5 times forward earnings. While the company's growth to date has been awe-inspiring, this may be just the beginning of an AI-powered multiyear growth story. Hence, considering Meta's scale, cash generation potential, and AI investments, the stock remains an attractive choice for the next decade.
Amazon
E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) is also doubling down on cloud computing, advertising, and AI to fuel its next chapter of growth.
The company's core business is strong, and it clearly has enough financial flexibility to fund future growth opportunities: Amazon's revenue increased 13.3% year over year to $167.7 billion while operating income soared 31% year over year to $19.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending June 30). The company also reported trailing-12-month free cash flow of $18.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing business, accounted for 30% of the global cloud infrastructure services market in the second quarter of 2025, up from 29% in the prior quarter. With 85% to 90% of global IT spend focused on the on-premises environment and enterprises increasingly shifting workloads to the cloud, there is huge scope for AWS to grow in the coming years.
AWS revenue grew 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion in the second quarter. The business has now reached an annualized run rate of $123 billion.
AWS had a backlog worth $195 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting strong demand for Amazon's infrastructure and AI services. AWS is giving customers the use of Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics processing units as well as its own custom chip, Trainium2, to ensure better performance and lower costs to clients running AI workloads.
Additionally, Amazon Bedrock (a fully managed service enabling clients to build and scale generative AI applications on AWS) is adding several leading large language models like Anthropic's Claude and the company's own model, Nova.
Amazon's e-commerce business is also speeding up, especially as the company leverages automation and robotics to improve cost efficiencies, which could boost margins. Faster delivery is becoming a significant competitive advantage in the e-commerce market. In the second quarter, the company delivered 30% more items on the same day or the next day in the U.S. than it had in the same period last year. The company is planning to expand this same-day and next-day delivery to over 4,000 smaller U.S. towns by the end of 2025.
Finally, advertising is fast becoming a major growth catalyst. Amazon's advertising revenues grew 22% in the second quarter of 2025 to $15.7 billion. With proprietary shopping, browsing, and streaming data secured from its platforms, advertisers can optimize their efforts, leading to improved outcomes. Advertising is proving ever more effective on platforms such as its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Fire TV, Twitch, and live sports.
Despite the many tailwinds, Amazon's shares trade at 34.6 times forward earnings, which is not cheap. But considering AWS's growth, fueled by rising AI adoption and improving e-commerce and advertising businesses, the stock may be attractive to investors seeking long-term growth opportunities."

It's no wonder the stock keeps climbing despite its premium valuation.
Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) is a different kind of retail beast altogether, and it's so much more than retail. Despite higher growth than Costco, its valuation has declined and it looks like a bargain today.
Which of these retail giants is the better buy today?
The case for Costco: Steady and solid
Costco has a famed membership model that breeds loyalty and generates high sales as well as creates a recurring revenue stream that goes straight to the bottom line. It has built up its business over several decades and now counts 79.6 million people as members.
Costco's model stands out from the retail superstars of the world. Although there are competitors, including Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club, Costco is the largest warehouse retailer. Because it makes money from its membership fees, which were recently raised to $65 for a basic membership and $130 for a premium membership, it can keep the prices of its merchandise extremely low. It's famous for its $1.50 hot dog and $4.99 rotisserie chicken, for example, but it generally sells products in bulk for low prices, and it can negotiate with suppliers to get better deals since it buys so much.
The low prices make it worthwhile for its millions of members to shop there and make the most of their annual memberships. Costco sports a very high renewal rate, which was 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada in the 2025 fiscal third quarter (ended May 11) and 90.2% internationally.
Although the retail model has remained the same for decades, Costco has found ways to innovate. It's become a serious player in e-commerce, Amazon's territory, doing it in a way that works for its large warehouses by focusing on in-store pickup for bulky items. E-commerce sales increased 14.8% in the third quarter, driving total revenue growth of 8.2%.
Costco has also been extremely successful in getting more people to sign up for the premium membership. These members account for 47% of the total as of the end of the third quarter, but 73% of sales. They get added perks like 2% cash back, and more recently, an exclusive shopping hour on the weekends. This is a model that thrives under all kinds of conditions and lends itself to further growth, which is why Costco has been such a spectacular stock to own for decades. It also pays a dividend, which has a low yield, but it has also periodically paid a special dividend, which was $15 in its most recent payment nearly two years ago.
The case for Amazon: Much more than retail
Amazon is also a retailer, but it's so much more. It has a completely different model that's all e-commerce, and its low prices, large assortment, and fast delivery times have helped it corner the market; it may have as much as 40% of the U.S. e-commerce market or even more, which makes it impossible for any competition to catch up in the short term, even if companies like Costco are leveraging their distinct features to make the most of e-commerce.
Still, Amazon isn't leaving things alone. It constantly upgrades its marketplace with new merchandise, new brands, new technology, and faster fulfillment to stay on top.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) is fairly new as a buzzword, and with Amazon, it usually refers to its cloud business, I would suggest that AI has played no small part in making Amazon what it is today. It has used AI since its inception to provide recommendations for its customers, and it has improved its capabilities to offer side-by-side comparisons of products and help customers make informed decisions and to press the button.
But yes, the AI business it has today is the generative kind, which it offers through Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud services division. AWS clients can use Amazon's platform to create all kinds of AI apps using an array of large language models with varying levels of customization. Amazon isn't just the largest e-commerce company in the U.S., it's also the largest cloud computing company in the world, with about 30% of the market.
It's still growing quickly, with a 17% increase in sales over last year in the second quarter. Amazon as a whole reported a 13% increase in sales, which is an impressive feat considering it's the second-largest company in the world by sales, with $670 billion in trailing-12-month sales.
CEO Andy Jassy thinks this is just the beginning for the AI business, but it's already a multibillion-dollar business growing at triple digits. Amazon also has several other large, competitive businesses, including advertising and streaming, which make it such a compelling company to own as a stock.
Valuation will make the call
There are reasons to buy each one of these fabulous stocks. They are both industry leaders for a reason, and there's a lot to expect from both of them going forward. Let's get back to the valuation piece.
Costco is trading well above its five-year average P/E ratio, while Amazon is trading at less than half its five-year average. However, that includes a short period where it had an unusual loss pertaining to an investment in electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive. Costco is much cheaper on a price-to-sales basis.
While I recommend both of these stocks, Amazon still looks like the better buy today because it has so many different opportunities, especially in its two top segments, and it's trading at a rare discount."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-13T12:00:00,"This Vanguard ETF Makes It Easy to Invest in the ""Magnificent Seven""","The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have done incredibly well over the past five years, with six of them more than doubling in value during that time frame.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ef1052261d5b94e266be573e4e7ef3a4eb89496fab0faf1202dbe2f97a879dbc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/this-vanguard-etf-makes-it-easy-to-invest-in-the/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/this-vanguard-etf-makes-it-easy-to-invest-in-the/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/this-vanguard-etf-makes-it-easy-to-invest-in-the/,fool.com,200,,"Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla are the leading tech companies in the world, often referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven."" They've generally been excellent investments to hang on to recently. Over the past five years, they're all up by at least 50%, and only one (Amazon) has underperformed the S&P 500 during that stretch.
You could invest in each of those stocks individually. But a simpler and more diversified option can be to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has a big position in these and other stocks. That can reduce your overall risk to the Magnificent Seven, while still benefiting from their growth.
An ETF that can be helpful for this purpose is the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (MGK 0.53%).
The ETF has a total of 69 stocks in its portfolio
The big advantage in owning the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund instead of investing into the Magnificent Seven individually is that you'll get exposure to many more stocks. Broadcom, Eli Lilly, and Visa are just some examples of the top stocks that are also among the ETF's largest holdings.
However, the Magnificent Seven account for around 60% of its total portfolio, so you'll definitely want to feel comfortable with these stocks as they will have a big impact on the ETF's overall performance. Its three largest holdings are Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. Together, they account for just under 40% of the entire portfolio.
There is some diversification with the ETF but by no means is it overdiversified or will it shield you from the volatility that can sometimes come with investing in tech stocks.
The fund has outperformed the market this year
Since the start of the year, the S&P 500 has risen by over 10%. Meanwhile, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is up by more than 13%, and it has even outperformed three of the Magnificent Seven stocks -- Amazon (8%), Apple (-5%), and Tesla (-14%). And therein lies a big advantage of buying the ETF, as you don't have to worry about picking individual stocks and trying to predict which ones will do well.
While you could invest in all of the Magnificent Seven, it can be a lot easier to allocate one investment to all those similar stocks as opposed to having seven different positions and tracking and managing them individually. ETFs can help simplify your investing strategy and can make sense if you don't have the time or you just don't want to overcomplicate your portfolio with too many different holdings.
In the past, the benefit of doing it yourself was to avoid fees. However, the Vanguard ETF charges a minimal expense ratio of 0.07%. At such a low rate, there's less of an incentive to manage all of the holdings yourself as the fees won't be significant. On a $10,000 investment, that translates into an annual cost of just $7.
Is the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund a good option for your portfolio?
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund can be ideal for you if you just want a bit more diversification than investing in the Magnificent Seven stocks directly, or if you perhaps don't want to invest into each stock individually. In that case, the ETF can make a lot of sense.
But if you're not comfortable with so much exposure to tech and high-valued stocks, then you may want to consider investing in S&P 500 ETFs, which give you a broader mix of stocks. The downside will be that if tech stocks are soaring, your returns may be much more modest in comparison. That's the trade-off that comes with diversification, however. In exchange for the safety, you have to sacrifice some potential upside."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-13T11:43:00,"Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Just Delivered Half a Trillion Dollars Worth of Great News for Nvidia Investors",Big tech is expected to spend nearly $500 billion on artificial intelligence infrastructure next year.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f2666ffb57dd65b87aa7a63a2789df6c0e97524aefcc9f863f86865bf6c75c9f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/amazon-microsoft-alphabet-and-meta-just-delivered/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/amazon-microsoft-alphabet-and-meta-just-delivered/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/amazon-microsoft-alphabet-and-meta-just-delivered/,fool.com,200,,"Over the past few years, many corporate budgets have been reoriented toward artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Nowhere is this shift more evident than among the cloud hyperscalers -- Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon -- as well as other tech titans like Meta Platforms and Oracle.
In just this year alone, Meta committed $14.3 billion to Scale AI and launched a new research hub, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). It also signed a six-year, $10 billion agreement with Google Cloud. Meanwhile, Microsoft just struck a $17.4 billion deal with Nebius, a rising neocloud specialist.
At the center of this unprecedented wave of AI infrastructure spending stands one clear beneficiary: Nvidia (NVDA -0.20%). Whether directly or indirectly, the graphics processing unit (GPU) powerhouse is capturing a significant chunk of the money being spent on AI infrastructure.
Let's explore how big tech is reshaping the AI landscape -- and why these secular tailwinds point to further significant upside for Nvidia.
AI infrastructure spending has accelerated since the launch of ChatGPT
The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 ignited an unprecedented AI arms race among the world's largest companies. What's important to recognize is that their capital expenditures in this battle are not plateauing -- they're accelerating.
Data from Goldman Sachs underscores just how dramatic these dynamics have become. In 2021, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft collectively had capex of about $100 billion. By next year, Wall Street expects that figure to approach nearly $500 billion.
What does this mean for Nvidia?
Training and deploying large language models (LLMs) and building generative AI applications demands extraordinary amounts of computing power. GPUs are parallel processors, which makes them some of the best chips available to provide the type of computing power AI workloads require. Today, Nvidia commands a more than 90% share of the GPU market, giving it a dominant position within the AI supply chain.
A significant portion of the AI capex surge is flowing directly into GPUs and the supporting data center equipment necessary to maximize their performance.
This dynamic places Nvidia in a uniquely enviable position as the backbone of modern AI development -- and it's poised to capture incremental budget allocations as hyperscalers and other data center operators race to secure its next-generation chips the moment they become available.
Is Nvidia stock a buy?
The magnitude of hyperscaler infrastructure investment reflects more than the world's apparently insatiable appetite for AI computing power. It underscores a deeper reality: AI is becoming the central growth engine for these companies, and securing access to the most advanced chips has shifted from being a matter of technological advantage to being a matter of competitive survival.
The accelerating pace of this spending suggests that corporations are still in the early stages of implementing their AI playbooks. Far from being a speculative bubble, this wave of infrastructure investment is the result of deliberate, long-term strategic planning by some of the world's most influential companies as they pivot away from their traditional priorities and take on sophisticated projects in robotics, autonomous systems, cybersecurity, and more.
For Nvidia, this dynamic should translate into sustained pricing power for its wares, durable recurring demand, and a multiyear runway for rapid growth. Its GPUs and CUDA software platform have become the gold standard for enterprise AI tech stacks.
Taken together, these tailwinds suggest that Nvidia could experience meaningful valuation expansion from here. As the infrastructure chapter of the AI narrative continues to unfold, Nvidia appears well positioned to remain as a core enabler of big tech's transformation.
For these reasons, I see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer investment, and view it as one of the most compelling buy-and-hold opportunities in the market."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-13T10:45:00,Billionaire Bill Ackman Bought Amazon Stock -- Should You?,Billionaire Bill Ackman just took a billion-dollar bet on Amazon. But investors shouldn't just follow blindly.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ce55de994526e6346910856cb84e475191f755fe702bc05c7fdcb7ef0e16ce11,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/billionaire-bill-ackman-bought-amazon-stock-should/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/billionaire-bill-ackman-bought-amazon-stock-should/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/billionaire-bill-ackman-bought-amazon-stock-should/,fool.com,200,,"When Bill Ackman, one of the investing world's most closely watched hedge fund managers, bought a significant position in Amazon.com (AMZN -0.70%), investors took notice. This article explores what it means -- and what you should do with that information.
First, a note on visibility: Ackman's position is visible only via a delayed Q2 13F filing. These filings show positions as of quarter-end and exclude shorts, options, or trades after June 30.
In other words, observers are peering in the rearview mirror. Still, it remains one of the best lenses into how professional long-term investors deploy significant capital.
The nature of the trade
Through his Pershing Square fund, Ackman purchased 5.82 million Amazon shares, worth roughly $1.35 billion. That made it one of his top four holdings, about 9% of his U.S. equity portfolio.
It's not known when Ackman purchased the stock, but it likely occurred in April, when markets sold off after tariff announcements. Amazon's shares briefly dipped to $161 -- well below recent levels around $230 -- suggesting that Ackman stepped in when sentiment was weak and prices were favorable.
What might have caught Ackman's attention?
Observers cannot know exactly what's in Ackman's mind. Still, judging from his history, he likely saw Amazon as a chance to own a proven franchise at an attractive valuation.
Let's start with the obvious. Amazon is the de facto leader in U.S. online retail. Its massive logistics network, vast third-party marketplace, and more than 200 million Prime members worldwide create a flywheel that competitors cannot replicate. This entrenched position provides consistent revenue growth, even if the pace has slowed as the business has scaled.
While e-commerce growth has moderated in recent years, Amazon Web Services(AWS), the cloud computing division, remains a solid growth engine. This segment grew revenue by 19% in 2024 to $108 billion and generated $39.8 billion in operating profit -- more than half of Amazon's group-wide operating profit of $68.6 billion. Ackman likely views AWS as the steady cash generator that funds innovation and cushions retail cyclicality.
Talking about innovation, one of the most significant tailwinds that's driving Amazon is artificial intelligence (AI), which runs throughout the organization. In AWS, Amazon trains and deploys large models for enterprise clients. In retail, AI optimizes logistics, fulfillment, and personalized shopping. With a solid foundation, Amazon is well positioned to invest heavily in AI to evolve its business model while growing new products and services.
And let's not forget the quietly growing advertising business, the third largest segment after e-commerce and cloud computing. This business grew even faster than AWS -- 22% in Q2 2025 -- with an annualized revenue rate of close to $50 billion. By monetizing its core assets, such as retail search and Prime Video, Amazon converts its massive user base into high-margin advertising revenue.
What investors should do (if they are interested in Amazon's stock)
It makes sense to note the trades of great investors, but not to copy them mindlessly. Instead, investors should use them as prompts to reassess. Here are four practical steps:
Clarify your own thesis: Do you believe Amazon's moat, AWS growth, and advertising optionality still offer compounding value? If yes, you share the same thread, even if you don't copy the trade.
Check valuation versus your comfort zone: Ackman entered at a favorable time in April. If Amazon trades above your fair value band currently, wait for a better price.
Size with conviction and risk awareness: Ackman allocated nearly 10% of his equity bucket. For you, decide what conviction warrants -- and don't breach your own thresholds.
Monitor key indicators: Watch AWS margins and growth, advertising revenue trends, Prime engagement, and regulatory signals. Let fundamentals, not momentum, drive conviction.
What does it all mean for investors?
Bill Ackman likely bought Amazon not on hype, but on its resilient e-commerce base, growth in cloud computing and AI, and the expanding advertising business.
The real takeaway for investors? Don't copy trades. Instead, learn to recognize when the market underrates enduring businesses and be ready to act with clarity and a plan when conviction is high."

He sold 76,900 shares of Meta Platforms (META 1.04%), a popular artificial intelligence stock that has beat the S&P 500 by 16 percentage points this year. He also added 998,900 shares of The Trade Desk (TTD -0.39%), the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 year to date.
Does Laffont know something Wall Street doesn't?
Meta Platforms: The stock Philippe Laffont sold in the second quarter
Meta Platforms owns three of the four most popular social media networks in the world as measured by monthly active users: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In total, those web properties draw 3.4 billion people daily, which makes Meta an indispensable advertising partner for countless brands. Indeed, it is the second largest ad tech company in the world.
Meta is successfully using artificial intelligence (AI) to deepen user engagement across its social media sites. ""Advancements in our recommendation systems have improve[d] quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on the Q2 conference call.
Meta Platforms reported strong Q2 financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 22% to $47.5 billion, an acceleration from 16% growth in the prior quarter. Operating margin expanded 5 points, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings jumped 38% to $7.14 per diluted share. Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continue.
Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan earlier this year wrote, ""Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share."" His conviction not only reflects success with AI but also that Meta recently introduced advertising on WhatsApp and Threads, creating incremental sources of revenue.
Looking ahead, Grand View Research estimates ad tech spending will grow at 14% annually through 2030. And Wall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually during the next three years. That consensus makes the current valuation of 27 times earnings look very reasonable
So, why did Laffont sell Meta stock in Q2? Odds are he was rebalancing his portfolio because shares jumped 26% during the first half of the year. I doubt his decision reflects a lack of conviction. Meta is still the second-largest holding in his hedge fund. So, patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position today.
The Trade Desk: The stock Philippe Laffont bought in the second quarter
The Trade Desk is the largest demand-side platform (DSP) for the open internet. A DSP is a type of ad tech software that helps brands run campaigns across digital channels, and the open internet refers to the network of websites and applications not controlled by tech giants like Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google.
The Trade Desk dominates connected TV (CTV) advertising, the fastest-growing category of the broader digital advertising market. But investors are worried about competitive pressure from Amazon, which recently struck deals to bring ad inventory from Roku and Netflix to its DSP. Amazon also added AI tools to its DSP that could help it take share in other areas of the open internet.
The Trade Desk reported somewhat disappointing financial results in Q2 despite exceeding estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 19% to $694 million, down from 25% growth in the prior quarter, and non-GAAP earnings jumped 5% to $0.41 per diluted share. The stock sold off sharply following the report, partly because sales slowed while rivals Meta and Amazon saw sales accelerate.
So, why did Laffont buy The Trade Desk in Q2? Odds are he simply wanted to start a position after the stock dropped more than 50% in Q1. However, the position is very small, less than 0.5% of his portfolio, so investors should not interpret his purchase as a sign of high conviction.
Wall Street estimates The Trade Desk's earnings will increase at 20% annually during the next three years. The current valuation of 55 times earnings is still somewhat expensive, but it's also the cheapest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple in five years. Patient investors interested in owning the stock should start with a small position."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-12T22:27:12,Why The Trade Desk Stock Wilted This Week,Intensifying competition and several downbeat analyst takes pushed the stock down during the period.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7cf39963d2749f607847d5d732368a1d1a04a705409b4ab6029dd83545a36bb9,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-the-trade-desk-stock-wilted-this-week/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-the-trade-desk-stock-wilted-this-week/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-the-trade-desk-stock-wilted-this-week/,fool.com,200,,"At times over the past five business days, there was lively trading in digital adtech specialist The Trade Desk (TTD -0.39%). Unfortunately for the company and its investors, much of that trading consisted of sales.
On the back of a new partnership agreement signed by a well-capitalized rival, plus several analyst moves, the stock fell by more than 13% over the week, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
It's a jungle out there
News of that deal hit the headlines Wednesday morning, and it wasn't good for The Trade Desk. Ubiquitous tech company/retailer Amazon and video streaming giant Netflix have partnered to offer advertisers utilizing the former's demand-side platform (DSP) to gain access to the ad inventory of the latter. The arrangement is to start in the fourth calendar quarter of this year.
Amazon's gain is The Trade Desk's loss, so it wasn't surprising when investors sold out of the pure-play adtech company. Compounding that, several analysts weighed in with updates on the stock, and they only supported the sell case.
Meanwhile, white-shoe investment bank Morgan Stanley went as far as to downgrade its recommendation to equal weight (read: hold) from its previous overweight (buy), slicing its price target to $50 per share from the previous $80.
Better to trade other stocks
Jefferies also published an update. Although this wasn't as bearish as the new Morgan Stanley take, it didn't exactly sing The Trade Desk's praises.
Analyst James Heaney pointed out, according to reports, that the Amazon/Netflix tie-up is one of a series of recent combinations Amazon has forged with top names in modern media. The pundit also expressed understandable concern about The Trade Desk's lack of ad inventory exclusivity.
Heaney maintained his hold recommendation on The Trade Desk stock, and a price target of $50 per share."

Pindoor has become one of Wall Street's most talked about stocks. Shares soared nearly 80% in a single day after naming a former Shopify executive as CEO. Stock is now up more than 400% this year and our next guest has confidence that this isn't just another meme stock. It's a real turnaround story. Join me now, got Eric Jackson, founder and president of EMJ Capital. Eric, it is great to see you on set. So, let's talk all things open door, Eric. Um
got a new CEO, uh, co-founders coming back to the board, some big names there. Walk me through what this means. I'm curious just how you think about what the business strategy is going to be here and and how open door in your opinion succeeds with just the the brand, the tech, the platform they have now.
Well, Keith Boy has been the most outspoken guy on Twitter like up to this point out of any of them in terms of sharing his thought. He he he never holds back. Like he he you know, he's no filter. Just like what he thinks he says, you know, he's very he was very critical of Carrie, the former CEO, who said she was like like a Skully, you know, and needed to be gone as ASAP. He was right, by the way. like uh and so I I tend to think I my personal belief is like he's the smartest guy in tech in in Bar Nut, okay? I I agree with Keith. He's not always 100% right. None of us is, but you know, he tends to be very, very right and and very on the money and knows how to create value. So he's already hinted like, there needs to be major job cuts here. There needs to be like a focus on AI. He need there there needs to be an explosion of the number of sellers and buyers like on open door transacting. And this can be the Amazon of housing if they get this right. Now,
uh, now it's been kind of validated that view because obviously he's back on the board now. He had a major hand in in hiring Kaz, the new CEO. Keith thinks that he's Kaz is going to be like a Travis Kalanick like in terms of how he goes goes about this. Uh, there's apparently been a big like work from home ethos at Open Door. That's gone, you know, everybody's going to be in the office now. Keith said like Keith said like this company could survive with like 10% of the current workforce, uh, and the rest done through AI. Like that was
And how big is that workforce right now?
1407 people currently, according to Bloomberg. Uh so you he's talking about going down to like 100 person, 150 person workforce. Um, probably, you know, so it would be a major difference. So the bearish case against Open Door before Keith and announce this 80% up day yesterday and Keith and and Kaz coming back was like, I banks never worked, therefore it will never work. And this company has failed before. Um, like no, you know, it's a little dinky company, $3 billion dollar market cap or whatever, like why, you know, it won't be successful. So mind you like that argument would have said that uh when Steve Jobs came back to Apple, just shut it down then, you know, like there's no there's no point in continuing because it hasn't been successful to this point.
Which some did say by the way.
Michael Dell did say that. So, anyway, I I like but then you say like, why would the number two guy at Shopify, you know, who who probably if he played his cards right would be the CEO relatively soon, widely respected in the world of tech, you know, everyone loves him. Why would he leave Shopify and take the job as CEO of a, you know, three, I don't know, before they before the 80% update was probably a two billion dollar, you know, market cap company. Like, obviously, like he sees the same vision that Keith does and he thinks that this can be the Amazon of housing first in the US, but then like the Uber playbook is you you blow that out worldwide international. So like obviously he sees this as a big opportunity and I agree with him. And so, you know, the bears really don't have a leg to stand on."

As of 2:40 p.m. ET, Rivian stock is down 3.1%.
Amazon's grand plan
In 2019, Amazon made headlines when it asked Rivian to supply it with 100,000 electric delivery vans through 2030. Five years later, half these vans were already on the road. But as Rivian's financial problems mount, Amazon may be seeking an off ramp.
In comments to Bloomberg today, Amazon restated its 100,000-electric van objective -- with a twist: ""We're committed to having 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030, and we regularly test various vehicle options -- including a small number of Chevrolet BrightDrops in our fleet.""
Notice the change: ""100,000 electric delivery vehicles"" period -- not ""100,000 Rivians.""
Bloomberg notes Amazon only has about a dozen GM vans in its fleet at present, but these are running alongside alternative electronic models from Ford (F 0.69%), Stellantis (STLA 2.07%), and Mercedes -- in addition to Rivian.
Is it time to sell Rivian stock?
Amazon wants 100,000 electric vans on the road by 2030, and if Rivian can't build them all (or Amazon decides it doesn't want just Rivians) then other manufacturers will happily thank Amazon for its business. Granted, all's not lost. Rivian might end up delivering 100,000 e-vans to Amazon -- and Amazon might supplement those with even more e-vans from other manufacturers.
What's more important to me as an investor is the fact that even with Amazon's business, Rivian lost $4.7 billion last year. And even with Amazon's business, Rivian's expected to keep losing money all the way into 2031.
That sounds more like a sell than a buy to me."

Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said the company regularly tests various vehicle options. The BrightDrop testing does not change its work with Rivian.
Amazon is Rivian's largest investor with a 16% stake and has more than 25,000 of its vehicles in its fleet.
The e-commerce company began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and aims to reach net-zero carbon across its global operations by 2040.
GM has halted the production of the Chevrolet BrightDrop electric vans, launched in 2021, at its assembly plant in Ontario until October due to slow sales.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An investigation into Mexico's e-commerce market found that sellers on Amazon and MercadoLibre faced barriers to competition, the nation's antitrust watchdog Cofece said on Friday.
However, the Cofece commission was unable to reach a consensus to order corrective measures against the firms, it added in a statement.
According to Cofece, Amazon and MercadoLibre do not provide sufficient information to sellers on how featured products are determined, while they also grant greater visibility to the products of sellers who contract logistics services with the platforms.
They could have faced sanctions from the watchdog, though Cofece said no measures were ordered given a lack of certainty regarding benefits entailed for consumers and small businesses.
After a preliminary ruling from Cofece in February, MercadoLibre said it would cooperate with the investigation, while Amazon said its practices did not hinder competition.
""We are pleased with Cofece's decision not to impose corrective measures, which underscores the competitiveness of the retail sector in Mexico and the absence of barriers to competition,"" Fernanda Ramo, deputy general counsel and director of legal affairs at Amazon Mexico told Reuters.
MercadoLibre did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The local units of Seattle-based Amazon and MercadoLibre, the dominant e-commerce player throughout Latin America, account for more than 85% of online sales in Mexico.
More Mexican consumers have turned to online platforms for goods and services since the pandemic, and small and medium-sized businesses have used e-commerce to reach more shoppers.

Management noted this level of spending is likely to persist through the year, implying more than $100 billion in annual capital expenditure.
The strategy is clear: build the scale needed for AWS to power larger language models and advanced AI services, while securing higher-value enterprise contracts.
The buildout of AI-driven data centers and custom silicon like Trainium positions AWS for durable leadership. These efforts are already showing results; AWS revenues increased 17.5% year over year, with Zacks models projecting nearly 18% growth for both 2025 and 2026.
Expanded AI capacity can unlock higher-margin generative AI services, win new enterprise contracts and deepen customer stickiness. Beyond the cloud, investments in robotics, same-day delivery facilities and automation are designed to lower costs, speed fulfillment and support retail growth over the long term.
Still, the risks are significant. Such heavy capital outlays translate into rising depreciation expenses, pressuring AWS’s profitability. Management has guided AWS’s operating margin down to 35% in 2025 from 39.5%, acknowledging near-term margin fluctuations.
Amazon's bet relies on capturing a share of a fast-growing market. Per the UNCTAD report, the global AI industry is projected to reach $4.8 trillion by 2033, and the company's bold spending may ultimately prove to be worth the investment. Moreover, its third-quarter 2025 revenue estimate of $174-$179.5 billion underscores confidence in this high-level strategy.
Amazon’s AI Rivals Step Up With Massive Investments
Microsoft MSFT is spending aggressively on AI, with the fiscal 2025 capital expenditure surpassing $64 billion and more than $30 billion set for the first-quarter fiscal 2026 alone. Microsoft is expanding AI data centers, custom chip clusters and training capacity, while integrating OpenAI and Anthropic models. With Azure and productivity tools like Office, Teams and Windows infused with AI, Microsoft now leads AWS in GenAI projects, offering stronger enterprise traction and steadier growth than Amazon.
Alphabet Inc. GOOGL is also ramping up AI investment. It raised the 2025 capital expenditure guidance to $85 billion from the $75 billion mentioned earlier, with $22.5 billion spent in the second quarter alone. Alphabet is expanding data centers, accelerating server deliveries, and committing $9 billion to boost AI and cloud infrastructure in Oklahoma. Alphabet expects even higher capital expenditure in 2026, driven by soaring AI demand and cloud growth opportunities."

The collaboration with Rockbot and partnership with Xylem could bolster Amazon's market presence by enhancing its offering with digital signage solutions and expanding its influence in water management technology. These ventures may contribute to Amazon's narrative of growth through cloud and AI innovations, potentially driving revenue and enhancing operational efficiency. Such initiatives align with Amazon's aim for high-margin growth areas, supporting its long-term strategy.
Over a three-year span, Amazon's shares achieved a total return of 82.10%, reflecting significant shareholder value growth. However, over the past year, Amazon's performance lagged behind the US Multiline Retail industry, which saw returns of 29.7%. This discrepancy highlights the volatile nature of the stock, despite its strong long-term gains.
The partnership announcements could impact revenue forecasts by boosting AWS's appeal and accelerating cloud and AI service adoption. These developments might further influence earnings projections positively, as they align with expected high-margin growth sectors. With a current share price of US$229.95, close to consensus analyst price targets of US$263.18, there is still a reasonable margin for potential upside, contingent on realizing projected revenue and earnings targets.

Amazon Prime members will soon only be able to share shipping perks with people who live under the same roof as them.
Starting in October, those privileges can no longer be shared with anyone outside of a Prime member’s household. The Prime Invitee program, which had made this possible, is being replaced by Amazon Family [1].

The new program allows Prime members and one additional adult in the same household, along with up to four teens (if they were added before April 7) and up to four children, to share shipping and several digital benefits — including Prime Video with ads.
If you were previously sharing benefits with a Prime member but not a member of the household, Amazon is offering a new promotion.
New promotional offer
According to multiple news outlets [2], Amazon users impacted by the change are being offered a one-year Prime subscription for $14.99. That’s the same price, currently, as a typical monthly subscription, while a yearly subscription is $139 [3].
The offer lasts until Dec. 31.

If you choose not to subscribe to Prime, there’s still a way to access free shipping. If you spend at least $35 on products sold by Amazon itself, you can get them shipped at no charge [4]. Check the product details to see if the items will be processed by Amazon. Shipping times, however, may be longer than if purchased via Prime.
Cost of subscriptions
A survey commissioned by CNET in 2025 [5] found that Americans were spending an average of $90 per month — over $1,000 each year — on subscriptions. Furthermore, they’re wasting about $200 annually on subscriptions they don’t use.
If you’re an Amazon user who’s being squeezed by the announced changes and rely on Prime benefits, you may have to bite the bullet and purchase your own subscription. But you might be able to find room in your budget to fit in this new cost by evaluating your list of subscriptions and cutting out any you don’t need anymore.
Either way, it’s always a good idea to regularly check your monthly spending, especially if you use any services that accept automatic payments, to ensure you’re not wasting any money. Doing so can help optimize your savings to help you reach your financial goals."

She made several purchases for Ark's family of aggressive growth exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Some of the more notable buys for Wood on Thursday include Figma (FIG 5.03%), Amazon (AMZN -0.49%), and Toast (TOST -0.95%). She added to existing positions in all three stocks. Let's take a closer look.
1. Figma
Figma has been one of the market's hardest-hit stocks since the start of last month, but the summertime debutante is somehow not a broken IPO. The provider of cloud-based design tools for digital platforms hit the market in late July at $33 a share. Figma stock traded almost as high as $143 on its second day of trading, only to fall down the mid-$50s today. The shares have plummeted 61% from their peak through Thursday's close, but you're up 70% if you were fortunate enough to get in on the actual IPO. Most investors didn't, as the offering was 40 times oversubscribed.
This isn't the first time that the market has had a volatile reaction to Figma in the stock market. When Adobe (ADBE -1.55%) announced a $20 billion deal to acquire the online design specialist in 2022, shares of Adobe would go on to surrender $35 billion in market cap in the first three days following the news. The deal never closed, but not because of the market's chilly reception. Both companies would agree to terminate the deal 15 months later, as scrutiny overseas made it unlikely that it would clear regulatory approval. Adobe would go on to roll out its own vector-based website and mobile app design tool, Adobe XD. Figma would hit the market this summer, with underwriters pricing the offering at a valuation just shy of the original $20 billion price tag.
Figma has a lot of what attracts growth investors. It's an artificial intelligence (AI) play, as the tools lean on AI to generate user experience and user interface designs. It's also a speedster. Revenue rose a hearty 48% last year, and it has stayed above 40% top-line growth through the first two quarters of this year. It's profitable, at least on an adjusted basis. The market has simply reversed most -- but not all -- of its initial euphoric pop.
Wood got in on the July 31 IPO for Ark investors. Thursday was the fourth time that she had added to that position. The shares aren't cheap, trading at 30 times sales and 117 times trailing earnings. Analysts also see revenue decelerating markedly in the next couple of years. They are currently modeling a 23% increase on the top line next year, slowing to revenue gains in the high teens in each of the two following years. Wood obviously sees the recent pullback as a buying opportunity, but she didn't nail the bottom the three previous times that she added to her stake.
2. Amazon
Wood isn't trying to nail the bottom with Thursday's Amazon purchase. The world's leading online retailer is currently within 5% of hitting the all-time high it scored back in February.
Amazon isn't growing its business as quickly as Figma. Net sales rose 13% in its latest quarter. This may not seem like a lot, but it's actually ahead of the 9%-12% growth it has posted in each of past three years. The upticks get stronger at the other end of the income statement. Net income soared a better-than-expected 33%. Having its higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business outpace its e-commerce segment with 18% in revenue growth for the quarter helps.
The valuation multiples are understandably lower for ""Magnificent Seven"" workhorse Amazon than they are for Figma. They are at different points in their growth cycles. If you approach Amazon as a tech services provider instead of simply an online retailer, the multiples are even relatively reasonable despite the market bellwether trading near its peak.
3. Toast
Finally, we can make a toast to Toast. The provider of point-of-sale platforms for restaurant operators is familiar to those who frequent eateries. It's not just an order-taking and ultimately transaction-settling device. Toast helps restaurants manage third-party delivery app orders, customer loyalty programs, payroll, and countless back-of-the-house solutions.
If you checked in on restaurant stocks this past earnings season, you saw that it wasn't pretty. Many iconic chains posted negative comps, and the industry is vulnerable to any potential economic softening. However, Toast is making it up in volume. It now serves 148,000 different locations, a 24% increase over the past year. Gross payment volume rising 23% in its latest quarter suggests that the average restaurant is just trying to sell as much as it did a year ago, but the fact that Toast is stretching its wings now will make it that much better when the industry itself starts to grow again. In the meantime, Toast is cashing in on the scalability of its model with net income rising fivefold in its latest financial update."

""We're in the very early stages, but there is such enormous promise in the technology,"" Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.
Garman added that AWS is still in the early stages of ""building the building blocks that we think startups, enterprises, and government agencies are really going to want to use to build both AI applications as well as agentic workflows.""
Amazon stock has gained 4.5% in 2025, underperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 12% gain.
AWS remains the company's profit engine and a key driver of its valuation, but investors are debating whether it can keep pace with Microsoft (MSFT) Azure's growth, which surged last year on the back of its OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) partnership.
In Q2, AWS revenue jumped 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion, beating estimates of $30.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Azure's revenue soared 39% to $29.9 billion, above expectations of $28.92 billion. Meanwhile, Google (GOOG) Cloud grew 32% to $13.6 billion, surpassing estimates of $13.14 billion.
Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak sees reason for optimism. In a note to clients, he highlighted AWS's partnership with Anthropic (ANTH), including strong demand for generative AI and traditional workloads as potential growth drivers.
""Upcoming data center capacity growth could translate into 20%+ AWS revenue growth in ‘26,"" Nowak wrote, adding that new capacity could lift revenue growth beyond the mid-teens pace AWS has seen recently.
He added that ""in order for these workloads and revenue to flow, AWS still has to work through capacity constraints,"" including ""data center builds, delivery of chips, racks, cables, [and] power."" The firm's analysis suggests the company is successfully working through data center buildout bottlenecks.
Nowak raised his price target on Amazon to $300, with a bull case of $350.
Still, challenges remain for AWS, as expectations rise along with higher capital expenditures, which is set to jump sharply in 2025 and 2026. Garman framed growth as more than just money, saying, ""It's not just about the investment, which is very large, but it's also about that innovation that comes with it.""
Some analysts warn that AWS faces capacity constraints, rising costs, and growing competition from Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle (ORCL). Winning depends on how well providers combine specialized hardware, partnerships, and software. For AWS, it remains to be seen whether its investments can drive unique AI offerings that keep customers locked in."

The drone industry is witnessing rapid growth, with the global drone tech market expected to witness a CAGR of 14.3% from 2025 to 2030, according to a report from Grand View Research, whereas the commercial drone market is expected to witness a CAGR of 20.8% from 2025 to 2032, per the Fortune Business Insights report.
Defense applications are the mainstay for the adoption of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology. Governments worldwide are now increasingly deploying UAVs for surveillance and reconnaissance missions and combat operations. Drone swarm technology is another eye-catching development. Drone swarms are a synchronized operation of numerous autonomous drones working in tandem and using AI and real-time communication to achieve common objectives. In an asymmetric fight, a well-coordinated swarm attack could subdue enemy air defenses, giving the smaller armies an edge.
In addition to defense and military use, drones are now increasingly deployed across various industries. Drones have become integral to various sectors like mining, infrastructure monitoring, real estate, oil and gas exploration, logistics and even filmmaking. From aerial photography and agricultural mapping, drones are transforming how businesses collect data and operate across sectors
Retail behemoths like Walmart and Amazon AMZN are increasingly deploying drones in logistics. Amazon uses drone delivery to deliver one package (up to five pounds) in less than an hour during daylight hours. Meanwhile, public safety and disaster response sectors are using drones for surveillance and search-and-rescue missions. The usage of drone swarms is being extensively explored for tasks like large-area surveillance and search-and-rescue.
The drone technology is scaling new heights, driven by cutting-edge advancements in autonomous technology and AI-powered navigation. The embedding of AI has made modern drones faster and more versatile than ever. AI incorporation is driving the autonomous navigation functionality of drones, enabling them to autonomously plan their flight paths based on real-time data, such as environmental terrain. The integration of 5G and advanced Wi-Fi technology has further improved real-time data transmission, expanding commercial applications.
For investors, this provides an exciting long-term opportunity. With regulatory frameworks evolving and military and commercial adoption gaining pace, the drone sector has a long runway for growth. Drone tech companies with strong R&D pipelines, diversified end-market exposure, and strategic collaborations are well-positioned to flourish in this evolving landscape."

Don't sleep on cloud computing growth, as the world was reminded of in a blowout earnings report from Oracle this week. I got the opportunity to catch up with Amazon AWS CEO Matt Garman. We discussed the outlook for cloud computing and how Amazon is participating in AI, which includes its major investment in model builder Anthropic.
It's maybe the fastest moving technology that that I've ever seen um in the in the last 20 or 30 years and uh but it's also incredibly exciting. And so, look, we're we're in the very early stages, but um but there is such enormous promise in the technology. and I think that's why you see so much enthusiasm out there, why you see so much investment out there, why you see so many people um getting excited at what the potential is for um for small people, for individuals and and and for large uh organizations. So, um, you know, but it but it is very early. and I think as we think about it in AWS, um we're still just building the the building blocks that we think um startups and enterprises and and government agencies are really going to want to use to go build both AI applications as well as agentic uh workflows um that they're going to need to really drive the value that that we all believe that they'll get out of this new technology. So, super exciting for sure, uh lots of excitement out there and and lots of investment as you mentioned.
Everyone talks about um, CAPEX investment in AI. and I just feel as though Matt, it has been boiled down to a chart on various slide decks. And and it's like it's up into the right. I talk to us about those building blocks and Amazon is building the nitty-gritty. What what are you putting in the ground in the US to support the future of AI?
Yeah. And and I think, you know, people mentioned CapEx because it's an easy number to get their head around, but it really is how are you enabling all parts of that and and delivering innovation to the end customers. because your end customers don't really care about how much capx is on the ground or what you've spent. And so when you think about what that what's involved in that though, it's it's involved in building data centers, it's involved in um adding power uh to the grid. Um there's, you know, and and and renewable and and carbon zero power is is equally important there. Um it's uh it's all about actually building that infrastructure and and in AWS, it's not a just rolling in kind of commodity racks and doing a commodity hosting job, which I think there are others out there that do that and and and they do that well. But for us, we want to deliver outsized value to customers. And so what that means is having a whole host of choices um that companies can use to go build technologies. And that means how do you have the very best in GPU technology, how do you have the very best in CPU technology, how do you have the very best in storage capabilities and database capabilities? How do you have custom networking that gives you the scale and the speed and the latency that you need that's differentiated across um all of the different um capabilities that you can use? And how do you have the very best in AI capabilities so that when you're actually a customer goes and builds an application, they can embed AI as a core part of the thing that they're building.
And we think that that combination of AI plus an enterprise data um is really what's going to give a lot of our customers the value that they're looking for. And so things like bedrock that we're building, um combined with things like S3 where many of our customers keep a lot of their enterprise data, really starts to then turn that flywheel. And then you layer applications on top of that that are powered by AI, take something like Kiro uh which is our AI powered um coding uh IDE. And that is when you really start to see companies just moving faster and faster because they can use AI to go build um technologies and capabilities that they can then deploy to AWS and scale globally around the world.
Can you put a number behind uh how much Amazon is investing in AI infrastructure? What what does that look like?
Well, uh I think this last quarter we invested something like uh I think it was 23, 28 billion uh in infrastructure and I think we're um on pace to to continue that investment. I think it's uh and and and really as we think about investment, it's not just what you do this quarter, but it also is what you're planning for two to three to five years out there in the future to ensure that we have enough data centers, to ensure that we have enough power, to ensure that we have innovative chip technology that can actually go drive uh the the workloads that that the future is going to require. So,
um, you know, I think the the the CapEx today is important, but the investment in innovation is equally important. And and when we talk to customers, that's part of why they choose AWS is because they are making a bet on the innovation um that we are delivering to them, um both from a capacity perspective but also a capability perspective. So it's it's not just about pure CapEx spend, it's also about if we're building the right differentiable technologies that can actually help people go build. I'll use a simple example is that, um, you know, with customers need um AI infrastructure in order to scale agentic workflows.
But we recently launched something called Agent Core that lets customers actually more easily build those things and not have to worry about actually cobbling together how you actually make this work, but just focus on the innovative application that they're actually going and building. And customers need both of those. So it's not just about the investment, which is very large, but it's also about that innovation that comes with it.
I'm uh, Amazon AWS has partnered with with Oracle. Uh Oracle's guidance, I mean their backlog total this week, I it shocked investors uh really all over the world. Having having worked with them, were you shocked by what they had to say in terms of backlog and does Amazon's backlog, does AWS backlog look like that?
Uh well, I mean I think uh and and congrats to to Larry and the team. I think it's a it's a great announcement for them. Um it's largely one customer. So they they signed a very large deal with uh with Open AI and and the Stargate um kind of conglomerate. And so it's a great deal for them, but I I think most of that backlog is is all one customer. Um I I would say for us, uh we we're also very interested in and we think about diversification, which is a super important part of what we go and build. And so um we have tens of thousands, if not millions of customers that that are all investing and building on AWS and we think that's important for our long-term growth as well. Um and so we have customers that also sign multiple billion dollar deals, but we have customers that you know, that are just spending $10 today. And for us, those small startups are just as important as the the really large deals that we have out there. And so yes, we have some of the large deals like Orac announced, but we also have that wide breath of customers which I think is is also equally important.
So, I mean really you you see news like that and then you know, a lot of folks on the street looking for AWS sales to accelerate in the back half of the year. You know, zoom out. I mean, do you get the sense that maybe we're just in the first inning of all things AI, even though it's, you know, we're a couple years into this?
Uh, I do and and and I said this a little bit earlier. I I do think that we're very early in this technology. I think this is a a technology much like as you think about the internet or cloud computing where um, you know, they there was innovations all throughout that history for 10, 20, 30 years. and and I think AI um is going to be similar. and you you see the the rapid iteration, you see the the new technologies coming out, the new applications of the technology coming out. And uh and and when you have any technology that's moving at such a rapid race rate and has such impact on such a broad range of workflows, um that's when you know that that you're very early and what what's going to be very big. And so I think a lot of this early buildout is with the view on what's going to be needed and possible two, three, four, five years down the road. Um and so a lot of this build out is there um computing uh power that's going to be needed for that. And uh and yeah, I think it's quite early and and we're yet to see I think some of the the real capabilities and the applications of that. I think today, much of the focus has been on these very large models, the the Anthropics of the world and the Open AIs of the world, which are great and incredible technologies. And um, you know, I think increasingly going forward, um there's going to be more and more focus on how do you actually integrate that into a business, into an application, into a use case."

NFLX up 40% YTD as ad tier drives 55% of signups, supporting 2025's revenue doubling targets.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e1af1c2f47badf1b7da6b1638bde669a0bbf03af3255b6f2772b1d14c09431cd,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-partnership-help-netflix-double-135900941.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-partnership-help-netflix-double-135900941.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-partnership-help-netflix-double-135900941.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Netflix's NFLX strategic partnership with Amazon AMZN Ads marks a pivotal expansion of the streaming giant's advertising capabilities. The deal provides advertisers direct access to Netflix's premium inventory through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP) starting fourth-quarter 2025, covering 11 major markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Brazil.
This integration represents a significant evolution from Netflix's initial Microsoft partnership, positioning the company alongside existing programmatic partnerships with Google DV360, The Trade Desk, and Yahoo. Amazon DSP's sophisticated targeting capabilities and first-party insights will enable more precise audience reach across Netflix's 94 million global ad-supported users, a base that has grown dramatically since the tier's November 2022 launch.
The timing aligns with Netflix's accelerating advertising momentum. The company doubled its ad revenues in 2024 and projects another doubling in 2025, with the ad-supported tier now accounting for 55% of new sign-ups in available markets. At $7.99 monthly versus $17.99 for ad-free viewing, the tier has proven compelling for cost-conscious consumers.
Netflix's second-quarter 2025 results validated this strategy, with revenues reaching $11.08 billion, up 16% year over year, prompting management to raise full-year guidance to $44.8-$45.2 billion. The Amazon partnership enhances Netflix's ability to capture connected TV advertising spend, estimated at $25 billion annually. Investors view the Amazon collaboration as accelerating Netflix's transformation from a subscription-dependent model to a diversified revenue powerhouse in the competitive streaming marketplace.
Rivals Scramble for Programmatic Partnerships
Netflix's Amazon partnership intensifies pressure on Disney DIS and Warner Bros Discovery WBD to enhance their programmatic capabilities. Disney, with 157 million monthly active users across ad-supported Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, relies on its own Disney Advertising platform but lacks Netflix's breadth of DSP partnerships. Warner Bros Discovery's Max, reaching 117 million total subscribers, employs AI-driven ""shoppable"" ads and contextual targeting but hasn't announced comparable third-party integrations. While Paramount+ leverages programmatic through various DSPs for its 77.5 million subscribers, it lacks the scale of Netflix's Amazon alliance. Disney's established advertising infrastructure and Warner Bros Discovery's innovative ad formats demonstrate different approaches, yet Netflix's combination of Amazon's reach, existing DSP relationships, and 94 million ad-tier users positions it advantageously. The Amazon-Netflix partnership may force Disney and Warner Bros Discovery to pursue similar arrangements to remain competitive in the programmatic advertising space."

SOUN posted a record second-quarter 2025 with revenue up 217% year over year to $42.7 million. Beyond the financials, the company’s technology stack—anchored by its proprietary Polaris foundation model—is emerging as the core of its competitive moat in the generative AI race.
Polaris, trained on two decades of data, has consistently outperformed peers, with accuracy exceeding rivals by 35% and latency improvements of 4X. By replacing third-party dependencies, Polaris not only reduces costs but also accelerates customer adoption. This differentiation has driven higher renewal rates, expansions, and faster deal closures across verticals from automotive to restaurants.
SoundHound is also pushing into Vision AI, bringing real-time visual understanding into conversational systems. The integration of voice and vision AI marks a significant shift, enabling multimodal interactions for enterprise, automotive, and retail customers. Coupled with its agentic AI platform Amelia 7, SoundHound is positioning itself at the forefront of practical GenAI deployment.
The strategic upside is clear: as Voice Commerce pilots gain traction, the company is building an ecosystem where QSRs, automakers, and merchants converge on one platform. With Polaris scaling and Vision AI broadening applications, SoundHound is steadily crafting a defensible moat in GenAI—one that could secure long-term leadership if execution matches ambition.
Tech Giants Threatening the Moat
While SoundHound is advancing Polaris and Vision AI, it must contend with Amazon AMZN and Alphabet’s Google GOOGL, both of which are formidable rivals in conversational and generative AI.
Amazon continues to expand Alexa and AWS AI offerings, embedding voice and vision capabilities into consumer and enterprise ecosystems. For restaurants and QSR operators, Amazon’s established footprint in cloud services and retail integration creates a natural overlap with SoundHound’s ambitions. If Amazon deepens its push into voice commerce, it could directly challenge SoundHound’s ecosystem.
Google is equally significant with its Dialogflow and advanced natural language platforms. Google’s AI already powers millions of customer interactions globally, and the integration of multimodal vision with its generative AI tools aligns closely with SoundHound’s strategy. Google’s cloud dominance gives it a distribution edge, raising competitive stakes.
SOUN’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates
SoundHound shares have gained 60.2% in the past three months against the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry’s 7.8% decline."

Analysts said, “Early tests show Amazon & Walmart grocery delivery significantly undercutting pricing for 3P delivery platforms CART, DASH and UBER.”
The Wells Fargo study examined a 10-item basket across three markets. New Jersey, California, and Arizona, on two separate days.
“Our test of US grocery delivery platforms reveal Amazon and Walmart are by far the lowest cost providers; 3P delivery platforms / in-store pricing 57% / 20% higher on average,” the analysts wrote.
Even at a SKU level, the bank said third-party platforms were the most expensive options, with in-store prices averaging 20% above Amazon and Walmart.
Amazon is said to have emerged as the most aggressive on grocery pricing, while Walmart’s total pricing was “at 21% premium to Amazon or 7% premium ex-tip/fees.”
Wells Fargo noted the difference in tipping policies as a factor: “Notably, Amazon does not have a tipping option for same-day grocery delivery, while Walmart (similar to 3P delivery platforms) prompts consumers before checkout. We assume a $5 tip (~10% total price), accounting for 13-pts of pricing difference btw Amazon & Walmart.”
Within third-party providers, CART consistently had the highest total prices, 8% above DASH, which offered the lowest total 3P price.
“On a SKU-level (before tip/fees), UBER had the lowest prices, with CART / DASH at an 8% / 1% premium. However, UBER had higher service and other fees relative to DASH,” said Wells Fargo.
The bank highlighted the risk to third-party delivery growth, noting, “See Amazon Prime entry, and the continued aggressive competitive stance of Walmart, as risks to areas of strong growth for the 3P delivery services providers,” and warned that “retailers may have tougher decisions to make and margin risk over time.”

finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-12T14:00:00,We are entering a golden age of robotics startups — and not just because of AI,The robotics startup market has matured over the last decade and the cost to produce robots has gone down significantly.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=71f9cabe09d7b06d0ff3d15220568e482b15bb0f984c7f796f008df7af0c39c2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/entering-golden-age-robotics-startups-130000913.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/entering-golden-age-robotics-startups-130000913.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/entering-golden-age-robotics-startups-130000913.html,yahoo.com,200,,"When Seth Winterroth left his job at GE Ventures to help launch Eclipse in 2015, robotics was on his mind. Or more specifically, the number of early-stage robotics startups that were struggling to launch due to lack of interest.
“These are teams that had just finished their postdocs at Waterloo, or CMU, or MIT and were starting robotics companies, and the refrain that I continually heard from the startups was, ‘Hey, we’re having a really hard time raising institutional venture capital,'” Winterroth told TechCrunch. “At the time in Silicon Valley, most venture capital was going into the very mature application layer or the application layer of some very mature computing platforms.”
A lot has changed since then.
Now, after investing in robotics startups for 10 years, Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said the time to invest in robotics has never been better. The robotics startup market has matured and the hardware and software powering these bots has gotten significantly better — and cheaper.
Venture investing in the category is gaining momentum as well. Investors poured $6 billion into robotics startups in the first seven months of 2025 according to Crunchbase data. The data company predicts that this year’s funding totals will eclipse 2024, making it one of the only non-AI categories to experience a boost in funding.
While one could argue that robotics is seeing a surge in investor interest because of AI — and it’s not wrong to acknowledge AI’s role in the advancement of robotic tech — investors who have focused on the category longer than the last few years said the industry didn’t get to this point just because of advancements in AI over the past few years.
Reaching maturation
The real catalyst for the industry to start gaining momentum actually happened back in 2012, Winterroth said, when Kiva Systems, a small startup based out of Massachusetts, got acquired by Amazon.
“I like to say Kiva Systems’ acquisition was the acquisition that launched 1,000 robotic startups,” Winterroth said. “Between 2011 and 2015, 2016, that really was the case. You just saw a number of different new companies get started. Some like 6 River Systems, or Clearpath Robotics, were successful, but most were not. But that talent learns and that learning compounds, and it’s brought into the next set of ventures.”
This first wave helped attract engineers to the sector and helped companies figure out product-market-fit, he said.
Kira Noodleman, a partner at Bee Partners, echoed this. Noodleman told TechCrunch the last decade of trial and error helped startups figure out what the market is actually looking for when it comes to robotics and automation."

Sep 12 - Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) shares surged about 29% Thursday and 10% on early Friday trading after reports that Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ:PSKY) is preparing a majority-cash offer for the media company, according to a Thursday report.
The proposed bid would target WBD's entire business, the film studio, streaming services and cable networks, and would be backed by the Ellison family, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal.
Paramount Skydance, which recently completed its merger with Paramount, climbed in early trading. Netflix (NFLX) fell about 4% and other streaming peers eased as traders weighed the prospect of a bigger consolidation wave that could draw interest from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
No formal offer has been filed and plans could still falter, Reuters and other outlets added. Analysts warned the scale of a deal would create complex financing needs and invite antitrust scrutiny, while WBD's planned split of streaming and linear operations could shape any approach.
The moves pushed options volume sharply higher and marked one of WBD's strongest trading days in years. Deal details and timelines remain unclear."

PLANO, Texas, September 12, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--For its third season of its highly successful ""Really Big Deals"" program, JCPenney returns with a first-of-its kind campaign to deliver each week’s unbeatable offers, introduced first during Amazon’s football coverage.
Following the brand’s unique integration with ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" to unveil the program’s deals this past spring, this fall’s ""Really Big Deals"" program taps a range of breakout comedians performing their original riffs on each week’s featured product, from an actual JCPenney store-turned-comedy club. The host? None other than Shaquille O’Neal, who introduces each with his signature energy (and legendary laugh).
""As we return to reveal our Really Big Deals to millions of fans, we knew we had to up our own game with a fresh, unexpected way to connect with fans, and reinforce JCPenney’s commitment to delivering savings in smart, engaging ways."" said Michelle Wlazlo, JCPenney brand Chief Executive Officer.
Added Marisa Thalberg, Catalyst Brands’ EVP, Chief Customer and Marketing Officer, ""We knew we wanted each of our 13 weeks of deals to have an original story, and we became taken with the idea of sharing our platform with rising performers who could collaborate with us on observational, very relatable humor about each product.""
Real Savings, Real Laughs, Real Big Deals
Each Thursday night through Christmas, a new ""Really Big Deal"" will be revealed during Amazon’s football coverage. JCPenney will showcase the deal again in the postgame broadcast. The deals will immediately go live online and extend to stores from Friday through Sunday.
The campaign kicked off last night with a first can’t-miss offer: Buy one, get two free Towels. And while the comedy might take center stage, the numbers speak volumes. Last fall alone, JCPenney sold nearly one million bath towels in a single weekend. That’s 3.2 towels every second. (We’re not kidding.)
Humor With Purpose
Created in-house by JCPenney, the campaign showcases 13 original comedy spots starring stand-up comedians—from Katherine Blanford to Von Daniel, actually a former JCPenney associate-turned-comedian—sharing their wry takes on real-world shopping truths.
More Than a Punchline
Let’s be honest – why we shop can be just as funny as what we buy. JCPenney gets it, and we’re here to make those moments even better. Our ""Really Big Deals"" program has become one of JCPenney’s highest-traffic events, resonating with customers who crave bold style, undeniable value, and just the right amount of surprise. It’s another move by the brand that reinforces why more and more Americans are saying ""Yes, JCPenney!"""

There’s no shortage of banks offering high-yield savings accounts, but most are online banks. Each bank has different rules regarding specific account features — i.e., account minimums and fees — so conduct research before opening an account.

Rent Your Tools Out
You don’t have to invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs) or rental properties to make money off of stuff you own. If you have a shed full of tools, rent them out to earn extra cash. You can list them, as well as other types of gear or even heavy equipment, on sites like Rent My Equipment, and start cashing in.
Just create a listing, set your price — considering fuel for any gas-powered tools and equipment — and wait for people in your local area to rent them. Rental sites generally charge a commission fee for rentals, but you’ll get the rest.
Rent Your Car Out
Now that you’re retired, your household might not need more than one vehicle. However, if you still have at least two, consider putting any extra cars to work on platforms like Turo or Getaround. As opposed to other types of investments, this is passive income you can earn off of something you already have.
You can rent your car out on a schedule that meets your needs. Both Turo and Getaround provide hosts with insurance and 24/7 customer support, so you can feel both protected and supported.
If you are looking to earn money in retirement, this can allow you to bring in a serious amount of cash. The average annual income with one car is $10,868, according to Turo."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-12T10:00:00,5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Like No-Brainer Buys Right Now,Truckloads of money are being spent on AI computing equipment currently.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e8690bb693f677fa69fe2eb564965855c3c0bbb3fc983e4901039c0dc721b8f9,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/5-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-that-look-like/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/5-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-that-look-like/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/5-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-that-look-like/,fool.com,200,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) investing is what's keeping the market propped up right now. A significant amount of money is being spent on building AI computing infrastructure, and numerous businesses are benefiting from this spending trend.
By picking up shares of companies that are benefiting from the spending now, investors can ensure they're not buying into hype.
I've got five stocks that meet this criteria, and each looks like a great investment now.
Chip companies are making a ton of money from the AI buildout
Since the beginning of the AI arms race, a handful of companies have been assumed winners based on their products. The market turned out to be right about this, as Nvidia (NVDA -0.20%), Broadcom (AVGO 1.93%), and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.01%) have all delivered spectacular returns. However, they're not finished yet.
Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have powered nearly all of the AI workloads that investors know today. Demand for GPUs outpaces supply, so many of Nvidia's largest clients are working closely with the company to inform it of their future demand years in advance. So, when Nvidia's management speaks about industry growth, investors should listen.
Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's monstrous growth from today's amount (Nvidia estimates the big four hyperscalers will spend around $600 billion in 2025), and shows that the AI computing infrastructure buildout is far from over.
This clearly makes Nvidia a buy, but it also bodes well for Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor.
Broadcom manufactures connectivity switches for these computing data centers, enabling users to stitch together information being computed across multiple computing units. However, another area where Broadcom is experiencing significant growth is its custom AI accelerators, which it designs in collaboration with end users. This is a direct challenge to Nvidia's GPU superiority, although both products will continue to be used in the future. With many companies looking to cut Nvidia out to reduce the costs of building a data center, Broadcom is one to watch over the next few years.
Lastly, neither company can produce the actual chip that goes into these products. So, they outsource the work to the world's leading chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor. TSMC doesn't care which company has the most computing units in data centers around the globe; it just cares that the chips they use are sourced from its factories, making it a neutral player in the AI arms race. While Taiwan Semiconductor may not have the upside of Nvidia or Broadcom, it also doesn't have the downside. This makes it a safe bet to capitalize on all the AI spending, and it's one of my top picks for stocks to buy now.
Demand for cloud computing is rising
Two of the largest purchasers of computing equipment are Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.73%) (GOOGL 1.85%). While some of this is being used for internal workloads, most of it is being rented back to customers through cloud computing. At its core, cloud computing involves renting excess computing power from one provider and utilizing it themselves. Buying computing equipment from Broadcom or Nvidia isn't cheap, so this is often the most cost-effective way to access vast computing resources.
Additionally, traditional on-premises computing workloads are migrating to the cloud as existing equipment reaches the end of its life, providing cloud computing providers, such as Alphabet and Amazon, with growth tailwinds to capitalize on. Grand View Research estimates that the global cloud computing market opportunity was about $750 billion in 2024. However, that figure is expected to rise to $2.39 trillion by 2030, making this an excellent industry to invest in.
Alphabet and Amazon are two of the largest cloud computing providers, and I believe each stock is worth owning due to the massive potential in the cloud computing businesses of these two tech giants."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-12T09:46:00,"The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 In Right Now",These stocks have what it takes to succeed over the long run.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7eb23a8972813ac8b71f89e5119402b51378f4e1585cb9e614efc4b6857f2922,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/the-best-stocks-to-invest-50000-in-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/the-best-stocks-to-invest-50000-in-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/the-best-stocks-to-invest-50000-in-right-now/,fool.com,200,,"You probably exercise significantly more caution before investing a lot of money than you do when investing a small amount. The more money at risk, the more risk-averse most of us become.
Investing $50,000, for example, could be at least somewhat nerve-wracking for some. The key to lowering your anxiety with a large investment is to select stocks that give you a high degree of confidence. With this in mind, here are my picks for three of the best stocks to invest $50,000 in right now.
1. AbbVie
The fact that AbbVie (ABBV -0.30%) is a Dividend King could help reassure many investors. When a company increases its dividend for 53 consecutive years, like AbbVie has, you can feel good about its ability to survive and thrive.
AbbVie has proven its resilience in another way, too. For years, its fortunes depended largely on one drug, Humira. However, Humira lost U.S. patent exclusivity in 2023. With biosimilars rapidly taking away its market share, sales of AbbVie's former top-selling drug plunged. But the company was prepared thanks to its investments in developing new products and making strategic acquisitions.
Today, AbbVie is growing despite Humira's continued decline. It has several rising stars in its lineup, notably including blockbuster drugs Rinvoq and Skyrizi. AbbVie's pipeline features around 90 programs, with 13 candidates either awaiting regulatory approval or in late-stage clinical development.
What about the potential risk from President Trump's threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports? AbbVie's management doesn't think the drugmaker is at significantly greater risk than its peers. I agree with that assessment and think AbbVie should deliver solid, reliable returns through the rest of the decade and beyond.
2. Amazon
Few stocks offer as strong a competitive position as Amazon (AMZN -0.70%). The company dominates the e-commerce market. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit is the top player among cloud service providers. Amazon's brand, scale of operations, and cost advantages make it difficult for rivals to knock the company off its perch in these markets.
Even better, the markets that Amazon leads have significant growth potential. E-commerce accounted for only 16.3% of total U.S. retail sales in the second quarter of 2025. Rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, continues to fuel strong demand for cloud services.
AI is also helping Amazon improve its profitability. For example, the company's AI-powered DeepFleet system coordinates robots' movements to improve travel efficiency by 10%. With Amazon's massive operations, this makes a difference in its bottom line.
Amazon has newer growth opportunities as well. Advertising was the company's fastest-growing business in Q2. Amazon has moved into healthcare. Its Zoox unit could be a contender in the promising robotaxi market. The company plans to soon launch its Project Kuiper satellite internet service.
3. Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -0.20%) is another stock poised to continue benefiting tremendously from the AI boom. It has certainly been a big winner so far: The chipmaker's shares have skyrocketed roughly 1,300% over the last five years.
The main reason for Nvidia's recent success is that its GPUs are the gold standard for powering AI models. I fully expect Nvidia to retain its market leadership over the next few years, thanks to its significant investments in research and development and its fast-paced innovation cadence.
While AI data centers will continue to be Nvidia's biggest market, the company has other major growth opportunities. Robotics and robotaxis are two of the biggest emerging markets that are ideal targets for Nvidia.
The stock's valuation could be worrisome to some investors. However, I think Nvidia's growth prospects justify the premium pricing. Investing $50,000 in this AI leader should pay off nicely over the long term."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-12T09:02:00,Is The Trade Desk Stock a Buy After Its 60% Decline This Year? Wall Street Has a Clear Answer for Investors.,"The Trade Desk is struggling with increased competition from Amazon, but most Wall Street analysts think the stock is undervalued.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=af51232641a79122d2caa6ec34d955b177da57a3cf47611f2fe6a6c4f95fdcb3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/the-trade-desk-stock-buy-60-decline-wall-street/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/the-trade-desk-stock-buy-60-decline-wall-street/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/the-trade-desk-stock-buy-60-decline-wall-street/,fool.com,200,,"The Trade Desk (TTD -0.39%) is having a dismal year. Shares dropped more than 30% on Feb. 13 after fiscal fourth-quarter results missed revenue estimates. Then shares dropped nearly 40% on Aug. 8 after second-quarter results failed to impress investors. In total, the stock has tumbled 60% year to date, which makes it the worst performer in the S&P 500.
However, most Wall Street analysts see that as a buying opportunity. The Trade Desk has a median 12-month target price of $75 per share, implying 63% upside from its current share price of $46. But prospective investors should understand the headwinds the company faces before buying the stock.
Here are the important details.
The Trade Desk is the largest ad-buying platform for the open internet
The Trade Desk operates the leading independent a demand-side platform (DSP), adtech software that helps media buyers plan, measure, and optimize campaigns across digital channels. Independence means it does not own media content or ad inventory that could bias spending on its platform. Instead, its DSP connects media buyers with inventory across the open internet.
The Trade Desk competes with giants like Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), but has still secured a leadership position in connected TV (CTV) and offsite retail advertising due to cutting-edge capabilities. Consultancy Frost & Sullivan earlier this year recognized The Trade Desk as the best DSP on the market as measured by growth and innovation, listing artificial intelligence (AI) features as a key strength.
Grand View Research expects adtech spending to increase at 14% annually through 2030. The Trade Desk, as the leading DSP for the open internet, is theoretically well positioned to profit. But intensifying competition with Amazon and a possible decline in ad spending across the open web are headwinds that investors should not overlook.
Amazon is encroaching on areas traditionally dominated by The Trade Desk
Amazon is the third-largest adtech company worldwide and the largest retail advertiser, and its rivalry with The Trade Desk has become increasingly worrisome in recent months. Amazon not only has exclusive CTV inventory (Prime Video) and troves of commerce data, but its online marketplace also supports closed-loop attribution.
Brands often struggle to measure campaigns due to the disconnect between marketing and business results. In other words, it can be difficult to know whether ads are driving sales. The Trade Desk works with numerous retailers to bring measurement data to its platform, but Amazon has an advantage because it owns an e-commerce platform that generates attribution data. That means the company can easily determine whether ads on the marketplace are driving sales.
Additionally, Amazon recently enhanced its DSP with Performance+ and Brand+, campaign optimization tools powered by machine learning models trained on trillions of data points collected from consumer shopping, browsing, and streaming habits. Those tools may help Amazon take share in open web and CTV advertising, markets that have traditionally been led by The Trade Desk.
Morgan Stanley expects ad spending across the open web to decline
The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green has long argued brands would eventually move away from walled gardens like Google and Meta Platforms. While the open internet is a network of websites and applications across which marketers can run campaigns with the adtech tools of their choosing, a walled garden is an ecosystem where one company owns most of the advertising supply chain.
For example, Google and Meta own ad inventory and consumer data on web properties like Google Search and Facebook. They also own the adtech tools used to run campaigns on those platforms. When one company controls so much of the supply chain, it naturally raises questions about transparency and conflicts of interest. Additionally, insights cannot be carried from one walled garden to another because user identities are not interchangeable.
However, Green may be overestimating the shift away from walled gardens. Despite disadvantages, platforms like Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram are extremely relevant to consumers, which makes them indispensable to advertisers. To that end, Morgan Stanley analysts expect ad spending on the open web (excluding CTV) to fall by double-digit percentages in each of the next four years as Google and Meta take share.
The Trade Desk stock is not cheap, but the price is reasonable
The Trade Desk stock has traditionally commanded a premium valuation due to its leadership in open internet advertising. Disappointing financial results and concerns about competition have stripped away much of that premium, but the stock is not yet cheap. That said, the current valuation of 55 times earnings is reasonable for a company whose earnings are forecast to increase at 20% annually over the next three years.
I think investors should consider purchasing a small position today. While concerns about competition are valid, the market tends to overreact to good and bad news. Odds are The Trade Desk stock dropping 60% year to date is an overreaction to some degree. Having said that, shareholders should pay close attention to the company's financial results in the coming quarters, looking for signs of weakness."
finnhub,AMZN,2025-09-12T08:15:00,Why The Trade Desk Stock's Recent Slide Was Justified,The stock's premium valuation is becoming increasingly difficult to justify.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=637a61f2229fed9ca53a3c18cef5ebfe811c3e271217530690171f0525e9214a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-the-trade-desk-stocks-recent-slide-was-justifi/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-the-trade-desk-stocks-recent-slide-was-justifi/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/why-the-trade-desk-stocks-recent-slide-was-justifi/,fool.com,200,,"The Trade Desk (TTD -0.39%) shares were slammed on Wednesday after Netflix (NFLX -0.78%) said advertisers will be able to buy Netflix ads programmatically through Amazon's (AMZN -0.70%) demand-side platform (DSP) later this year -- just on time for the holidays. For the independent ad-tech leader, whose software helps brands and agencies buy digital ads across the open internet, this is not immaterial. It puts a deep-pocketed platform directly alongside The Trade Desk on a marquee streaming service.
Ultimately, The Trade Desk's premium valuation is becoming increasingly difficult to defend. In fact, I'd argue that the stock's drop on Wednesday's news was justified -- despite shares already tanking this year leading up to this report.
Recent results were strong (but slowing)
The Trade Desk's business remains healthy. In the second quarter of 2025, revenue rose 19% year over year to $694 million, and management generated about $271 million of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), roughly a 39% margin. Video, led by connected TV, was nearly half of spend.
""CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel with no signs of slowing down,"" The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green said in the company's second-quarter earnings call.
That said, growth is decelerating. First-quarter revenue increased 25% to $616 million, and for full-year 2024, revenue grew 26%. For the third quarter, management guided to at least $717 million of revenue, implying 14% year-over-year growth (approximately 18% excluding last year's U.S. political spend). This is still solid -- but it is slower than the first half and last year.
Profitability and cash generation remain strengths, and the company ended the June quarter with about $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments. But investors are weighing those positives against mounting competitive risks in The Trade Desk's most important growth area.
Amazon's entry on Netflix raises pricing and market share risks
Netflix's announcement matters because it broadens an already expanding programmatic roster. Following partnerships with Microsoft, The Trade Desk, and Alphabet's Google DV360, Netflix has since added Yahoo's DSP and now Amazon Ads -- with availability in 12 countries beginning in the fourth quarter of 2025. This makes it easier for large buyers already using Amazon's tools to route Netflix budgets without touching The Trade Desk.
The strategic risk is pricing power and market share losses. As Green put it during the company's second-quarter earnings call, big tech ""walled garden"" platforms can make their buying tools ""seem really cheap ... because they make up that cost ... on the other side of the transaction, because they own the media.""
If Amazon chooses to subsidize its DSP fees to win Netflix budgets -- and then monetize on Prime Video or elsewhere -- that could pressure The Trade Desk's take rate and share of wallet over time.
None of this breaks the long-term story (but it does hurt it). The Trade Desk remains the leading independent DSP on the open internet, with customer retention above 95% for years and a product roadmap -- Kokai, OpenPath, and identity solutions -- aimed squarely at improving outcomes and transparency for advertisers across publishers. But the risk-reward at today's price looks less favorable. The stock trades around at a price-to-earnings multiple in the high 50s -- a premium that assumes sustained share gains and robust CTV growth without meaningful margin or pricing pressure from larger platforms. With growth cooling from 25% in the first quarter to 19% in the second -- and guidance pointing to the mid-teens next -- investors are right to ask for a wider margin of safety.
If management can prove that Netflix budgets continue to flow efficiently through its platform, hold pricing as rivals crowd the channel, and reaccelerate growth in 2026 as suggested on recent calls, sentiment could improve. Until then, a price-to-earnings ratio in the 30s would better reflect the real competitive and execution risks around connected TV. The business is excellent; the stock needs to better fit the risk."

Let me ask you, in that great cloud computing fight, we talk about Amazon and Microsoft and Google. Where now is Oracle in that fight, now and looking ahead?
Uh we'll see over time. Uh you know, there's different market studies out there. They're certainly playing catchup to the likes of Amazon Web Services, um and and uh Microsoft Azure and and Google Cloud Services. But uh they're clearly a contender here in this business. And what they're doing that's so much different is they really are building out data centers uh in in in an aggressive style and with a a kind of a modular approach. This is something, you know, Larry Allison as he's backed away from kind of larger management of the company and taken this role of founder of the company as chief technical officer, has really talked a lot in the conference calls about the modular nature of their data centers in two ways. One is that regardless of the size, small or big in the data center they're constructing, they are all running the same kinds of stuff so that a customer can go from a small data center to a big data center and find what they need in Oracle's offerings or or Oracle can build it for them. Then then secondarily, they're reducing the size of all of the Oracle offerings so that they can be really uh all held on a singular rack or a singular uh set of components that um will allow customers to get the same plug- and- play experience in any Oracle data center including all of the Oracle data products to allow Oracle to sell everything they have on a software uh standpoint to anyone using any Oracle data center and on any service, whether it's at an Amazon data center or at a Google Cloud data center. Uh they've really um homogenized across all of these offerings."

Maybe that's so. But the LLMs will have a helluva lot of customer data, as well.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9e19a2109e3b4b3c4faa5d151acb03706f08a839b5a95f54b9917f409b3c5130,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/booking-holdings-bets-agentic-ai-202919906.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/booking-holdings-bets-agentic-ai-202919906.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/booking-holdings-bets-agentic-ai-202919906.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Booking Holdings is betting that agentic artificial intelligence will give it an edge in travel, Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen said Thursday at a Goldman Sachs financial conference.
Booking is working on agentic AI that it believes would be more personalized than agentic models that large language models like ChatGPT are developing. Instead of just answering questions, agentic AI is designed to take actions, such as booking a flight or changing a reservation.
Booking already partners with AI heavyweights including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Salesforce. But Steenbergen said the company’s goal is to build a more personalized version of the agentic experience than they do, and one that keeps customers coming directly to its platform.
“And if you can get an experience that is as good as some of the LLMs, but maybe more personalized, and from a provider that you know [and] trust and if something goes wrong, you know where to go to,” he said. “We think that is a very attractive alternative that we should provide to our traveler customers, as well.”
Working with the ChatGPTs and Google Geminis is a given because they are important laboratories for learning about what’s next, and they surely will be in Booking’s performance marketing mix. But Steenbergen thinks Booking can provide more value to its travel customers.
However, it’s important to be mindful of the stakes. “I think, by the way, any company that would today say there is no risk or threat of being disrupted by GenAI in some form or way? I think they’re probably sleeping,” Steenbergen said.
The ‘Real Connected Trip’
Booking has been focused on the connected trip — getting travelers to book an apartment and car together, or a hotel and attraction. In the second quarter, customers who booked two or more verticals for one trip grew 30%, and amounted to a low, double-digit percentage of overall bookings.
In the future, Steenbergen said, GenAI will deliver “the real connected trip,” one that provides your entire, personalized itinerary.
“We know you travel with a young child,” Steenbergen said. “So the child seat is being added to the rental car. So we only propose accommodations that have a parking place with it. Your flights get delayed, everything gets automatically updated. So it will be the peace of mind … connecting all the dots.”
AI Bubble? Nope
Is there an AI bubble? Are companies spending too much with little return?
Not so at Booking, according to Steenbergen. “In customer service, what is happening is the average cost per booking is coming down very rapidly and the customer satisfaction scores are going up at the same time,” he said."

Sep 11 - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained support from Morgan Stanley after the bank highlighted the company's expansion into the U.S. fresh grocery market as a driver of future growth, according to a note from the firm.
Analyst Brian Nowak reaffirmed an ""Overweight"" rating and set a $300 price target on the stock, representing an upside of about 30% from recent levels. He projected that the push into perishable goods could significantly expand Amazon's gross merchandise value, or GMV, in the coming years.
Morgan Stanley estimated that U.S. consumer spending on off-premise food and beverages could reach $1.6 trillion in 2026, with roughly $600 billion tied to fresh and perishable categories. Nowak said that capturing even 1% of that market, or $6 billion, could add around 120 basis points to Amazon's 2026 GMV growth.
The analyst added that Amazon's existing logistics infrastructure, minimum basket size requirements and margin structure could support profitability in this segment. He also noted that broader grocery penetration would provide more consumer data, potentially strengthening the company's long-term digital commerce strategy."

Markets are repositioningand fast. Treasury yields plunged Thursday after a cooler-than-expected core CPI print and the biggest spike in jobless claims since 2021. The 10-year yield briefly dipped below 4%, while nearly 450 S&P 500 names rallied to push the index to fresh all-time highs. Traders now price in three Fed rate cuts by mid-2025, with the first possibly coming as early as next week. That would mark a major pivot in tone from just a month ago, when Chair Jerome Powell cautiously cracked open the door at Jackson Hole. Since then, the macro backdrop has shiftedhard.
Behind the optimism is something far more fragile: a labor market starting to wobble. Weekly jobless claims just hit a four-year high, and non-farm payrolls were revised downward. Core inflation, though still elevated at 0.3% month-over-month and 3.1% year-over-year, has taken a backseat in the Fed's reaction function. The weaker the labor market gets, the less inflation matters, said David Russell at TradeStation. Morgan Stanley's Ellen Zentner agrees: today's CPI may not have been soft enough to trigger action alone, but combined with decelerating jobs data, it may have tipped the scales toward a cut.
The Street is already moving past if and onto how many. Some desks now expect five 25bps cuts by this time next year. And with yields tumbling, equity bulls are sniffing out opportunity in rate-sensitive names. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Klarna, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were among the notable movers. But risks still lingercore inflation remains sticky, and Powell has shown he won't blink unless the full dashboard flashes red. As Seema Shah of Principal put it: the rate-cutting horse hasn't quite left the barnbut the lock just fell off the gate."

Shares of water technology company Xylem (NYSE:XYL) jumped 3.2% in the afternoon session after the company announced a partnership with Amazon.com Inc. to deploy smart water technology in Mexico City and Monterrey, aiming to save more than 1.3 billion liters of water annually.
The initiative will implement Xylem Vue, a software platform using data analytics to detect leaks, manage pressure in real-time, and reduce water losses. The project is expected to save approximately 800 million liters per year in Mexico City, where the municipal system currently loses up to 40% of its water through pipe leaks. In Monterrey, the collaboration will expand an existing deployment to save an additional 560 million liters annually. This partnership is part of Amazon's broader water stewardship program. Separately, Xylem also highlighted its commitment to cybersecurity, becoming the first water technology company to sign the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) 'Secure by Design' pledge.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $141.49, up 2.7% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Xylem’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 6 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about 1 month ago when the stock gained 9.5% on the news that the company reported strong second-quarter results, beating analyst expectations and raising its full-year guidance. The water technology firm posted quarterly revenue of $2.3 billion, surpassing analyst estimates. On an adjusted basis, Xylem earned $1.26 per share, also beating Wall Street forecasts. The company noted that robust organic revenue growth across all segments drove the positive results. Following the strong performance, Xylem increased its full-year 2025 sales forecast to a range of $8.9 billion to $9.0 billion. It also lifted its adjusted earnings per share projection to between $4.70 and $4.85, signaling confidence for the remainder of the year.
Xylem is up 22% since the beginning of the year, and at $141.49 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $144.62 from August 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Xylem’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,673.

Discovery stock surged more than 20% on Thursday following reports that Paramount Skydance Corp (NASDAQ:PSKY) is preparing a bid for the entertainment giant.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Paramount Skydance is working on an offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, with the majority of the planned bid expected to be in cash. The potential acquisition would be backed by David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder of Oracle.
In June, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies to maximize value. The new S&S company will unite Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO, and HBO Max, along with their iconic film and TV libraries. Global Networks will bring together leading entertainment, sports, and news brands worldwide, including CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., Discovery, top free-to-air channels across Europe, and digital platforms such as the profitable Discovery+ service and Bleacher Report.
Earlier today, analysts at Wells Fargo speculated the company’s Streaming & Studios (S&S) unit could be sold to one of several interesting potential buyers, including Amazon, Apple, Comcast, Paramount Skydance, Netflix, or Sony. They added that Netflix stands out as the most compelling buyer.

(Reuters) -Wall Street's ""AI trade"" has propelled the market to record highs this year, and Oracle's stunning share-price gains are giving investors another reason to back the trade.
Oracle shares jumped 36% on Wednesday after the company pointed to a demand surge from AI firms for its cloud services. The surge lifted its market value to $922 billion, leapfrogging the values of Eli Lilly LLY.N, JPMorgan Chase JPM.N and Walmart WMT.N.
Gains this year for Oracle, Broadcom, Palantir and other tech companies illustrate how AI has dominated markets, despite occasional pullbacks related to concerns about the rally becoming overheated.
Meanwhile, the ""Magnificent Seven"" megacap trade that led stocks higher for much of this bull market has stumbled somewhat this year as shares of Apple and Tesla have skidded.
""When people were beginning to get a little bit concerned about the AI and its related infrastructure growth slowing down a bit, Oracle comes out with a number that just surprises everybody and fuels the fire of that whole subgroup,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""This is a sign of the overall AI trade once again getting in the driver's seat as far as equity markets are concerned.""
Oracle is now one of Wall Street's 10 most valuable companies. Nearly all of these are viewed as leaders in AI, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
AI chip heavyweight Nvidia this year became the world's most valuable company in history, displacing Microsoft and iPhone seller Apple, which many investors view as straggling in the race to dominate emerging AI technology.
Nvidia's stock price has dipped about 2% since it gave an uninspiring sales forecast on August 27, but its stock market value remained at $4.3 trillion as of Wednesday's close.
Meanwhile tech shares have steadied after wobbling last month when investors pointed to signs of emerging caution related to the AI trade. The technology sector is up more than 16% so far in 2025.
Oracle's $922 billion stock market value following Wednesday's surge was just behind Berkshire Hathaway's, $1.06 trillion, which trails Tesla's $1.12 trillion.
Oracle unveiled four multi-billion-dollar contracts on Tuesday, taking advantage of an industry-wide shift led by companies such as OpenAI and xAI, to aggressively spend to secure the massive computing capacity needed in the AI race.
The U.S. stock market's eight most valuable AI-related companies, including Oracle and chipmaker Broadcom, now make up almost 30% of the S&P 500."

Despite the prevailing challenges like labor issues and patent lawsuits, robust quarterly earnings and expanding business service offerings supported Amazon's performance. The broader market trend, with major indexes reaching record highs, further bolstered investor sentiment towards Amazon.
We've spotted 1 possible red flag for Amazon.com you should be aware of.
Amazon's recent collaborations, including the Amazon Signage Stick launch and partnership with Xylem, could significantly enhance its market positioning and revenue potential. These initiatives may strengthen Amazon's appeal in retail media and sustainability, potentially supporting long-term revenue growth. Over the past three years, Amazon shares delivered a total return of 79.18%, demonstrating substantial growth, although over the past year, its earnings growth of 59% outpaced the US Multiline Retail industry, which faced a slight decline of 2.7%.
The launch of new services and expansion into AI and cloud technologies may bolster both the company's revenue and earnings forecasts. The projected shift in global IT spend towards cloud solutions underlines Amazon Web Services' importance to Amazon's high-margin revenue growth. With a current share price of US$230.33 and a consensus price target of US$263.18, Amazon trades at a discount, indicating market confidence in further appreciation, yet reflecting potential risks including regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures.

""It's tempting to switch that narrative,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. ""But I'm still going to stick with whoever brought me to the dance, and that's Nvidia.""
""Bottom line is they are the ones still pumping out the chips that everybody needs and everybody wants,"" he explained, adding that some of Nvidia's ""biggest customers are still the biggest drivers."" Those include Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Meta (META).
Still, the talk around the Street has been: Is Oracle emerging as a serious AI contender?
The company has posted some serious moves. Its stock surged 36% on Wednesday after reporting whopping cloud demand numbers.
Shares were trading slightly lower on Thursday, but year to date, the stock is up 91%.
For its latest quarter, Oracle reported an eye-popping $332 billion in bookings, the largest number Morgan Stanley's team says it has ever seen. Analyst Keith Weiss called it a ""tectonic shift in the business model towards Data Center Operator.""
Still, Oracle's quarterly performance missed on the top and bottom lines. The company reported $14.93 billion in Q1 revenue, missing consensus estimates of $15.04 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Earnings per share were $1.47, just below the $1.48 estimate.
""While the reported metrics in the quarter itself were not impressive ... none of that matters,"" Weiss wrote, adding that Oracle is taking ""a commanding lead in that market with these contract additions.""
Oracle CEO Safra Catz said in a statement that the company had signed ""four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers,"" which resulted in $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% year over year. Catz added the company expects to sign additional multibillion-dollar deals with other clients.
Management now expects Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure revenue to ramp from $18 billion in FY26 to $114 billion in FY29.
Bank of America's Brad Sills, who upgraded Oracle to Buy and raised his price target to $368, pointed to those figures as proof that Oracle is becoming a ""key AI compute platform.""
""Oracle is clearly leveraging a number of advantages in its cloud software/hardware businesses to attract the largest of the AI enterprises, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD,"" Sills noted."

Dublin, Sept. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Affiliate Marketing Solutions Market - Global Forecast 2025-2030"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
Affiliate marketing has become a vital channel for brands aiming to expand their reach and foster significant consumer interactions. As the digital landscape evolves, these strategies facilitate brands in achieving performance-based outcomes, establishing genuine partnerships, and quickly adapting to market dynamics. This detailed market research report explores the transformative shifts in affiliate marketing, offering invaluable insights into strategic planning, market segmentation, and competitive intelligence.
Transformative Shifts in Affiliate Marketing
The affiliate marketing ecosystem is rapidly evolving, primarily driven by technological advancements and changing consumer behaviors. The introduction of sophisticated attribution models and data-driven personalization marks a departure from basic referral links and banner ads. This shift is notable for integrating affiliate channels into broader marketing strategies, thereby enhancing their effectiveness.
Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning are revolutionizing budget allocation, partner selection, and outcome measurement. At the same time, increased privacy regulations have necessitated investments in encrypted tracking and consent management. These technological and regulatory changes are pushing the boundaries of affiliate marketing, making it a crucial element of any comprehensive marketing strategy.
Implications of United States Tariffs on Affiliate Marketing
The introduction of new tariffs in 2025 by the United States has significantly impacted global supply chains, leading affiliate marketers to reevaluate their product sourcing and pricing strategies. While digital products remain largely unaffected, physical-product affiliate programs face increased logistical challenges and cost pressures. This situation highlights the need for geographic diversification in affiliate portfolios, encouraging marketers to form partnerships with local sellers to maintain price stability.
The strategic emphasis has shifted to promoting digital subscriptions and virtual services insulated from border taxes. This adjustment not only avoids tariff exposure but also strengthens alliances between advertisers and affiliates, ensuring robust market entry strategies and risk mitigation."

Advanced water technology helps Mexico City and Monterrey reduce leaks and improve supply for thousands of residents
MEXICO CITY, September 11, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Residents in Mexico City and Monterrey will soon enjoy more reliable water supply as the two cities launch groundbreaking infrastructure upgrades to save over 1.3 billion liters of water a year – easing pressure from the rapid urbanization and persistent drought conditions that have strained local water systems.
The two cities are working in partnership with global water technology company Xylem (NYSE: XYL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to deploy Xylem Vue, an advanced software platform that applies data and analytics to detect leaks, cut water losses and improve residents’ water supply. The projects are estimated to save upwards of 800 million liters of water a year in Mexico City and 560 million liters a year in Monterrey.
""In a water-stressed region, where every liter counts, recovering more than a billion liters of water each year is a game-changer,"" said Jaime Barba, General Manager, Xylem Vue. ""Working with Amazon and the local water utilities, we are using data to give these cities actionable insights that enable them to make their community’s water supply more resilient and secure.""
In Mexico City, where 9 million people rely on the municipal water system, up to 40% of water can be lost from leaky pipes before it ever reaches the tap. To address this issue, the new technology manages pressure in real time, reducing leakage and adapting to demand without stressing the pipes, and proactively locating leaks, making it easier to fix them faster.
By applying these solutions in partnership with Amazon and Xylem, Mexico City and Monterrey’s utilities are making infrastructure investments go further, helping secure more affordable and reliable water for their communities. A recent report from Xylem and Global Water Intelligence found that smart water systems can reduce the cost of urban drought resilience by as much as 20%.1
""This landmark investment from Amazon and advanced technology from Xylem address one of our city's most pressing challenges,"" said Ricardo Alberto Munguía Alfaro, Deputy Secretary of Hydraulic Infrastructure Operations and Efficiency, SEGIAGUA (Mexico City’s Secretariat of Comprehensive Water Management). ""This partnership demonstrates how public-private collaboration and innovation can create meaningful impact in urban water management. Together, we are building a more sustainable and water-resilient future for Mexico City."""

OAKLAND, Calif., Sept. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Rockbot, the leader in digital media solutions for brick-and-mortar businesses, announced today that they have collaborated with Amazon signage to make Rockbot's suite of services available on the easy-to-use, reliable and affordable Amazon Signage Stick. Rockbot's Digital Signage, Retail Media, and Streaming TV for Business solutions are now ready for use with the purchase of an Amazon Signage Stick.
While larger, national retail brands have increasingly benefitted from in-store and in-aisle digital advertising, which provides precisely-targeted product promotions to consumers as they shop, this kind of in-store advertising experience has not yet gone mainstream for smaller businesses. Although they are increasingly adopting digital solutions as a way to replace expensive, time-consuming print communications and signage, many smaller businesses have not been able to take the opportunity further and create an in-store digital advertising ecosystem.
However, with the collaboration between Amazon signage and Rockbot, this kind of in-store digital retail media strategy is now within reach.
""The world is in a transition from brick-and-mortar to brick-and-digital,"" said Garrett Dodge, CEO of Rockbot. ""We see businesses of all sizes embracing this shift and adopting in-location digital solutions in ways that now go beyond efficiency. With this new collaboration, Rockbot and Amazon signage open up the power of in-store media to retailers, SMB's and businesses of all sizes.""
For less than $100, Amazon Signage Stick joins Rockbot's ecosystem of hardware solutions and integrations with a commercial-grade media player solution at a small business price point. This collaboration continues to expand on Rockbot's mission to provide accessible, affordable solutions that power digital signage, advertising, retail media and streaming services to businesses of all sizes.
Designed to deliver a secure, plug and play experience, the Amazon Signage Stick enables quick device setup and auto-launch of content management software (separate Rockbot subscription required). Seamless integration with Rockbot makes it easy to connect to a screen and quickly showcase content to all connected displays in kiosk-mode.

- Jefferies sees more upside, lifting its stock price target to $360 on cloud and AI growth.
- Analysts point to Oracle's AI-fueled cloud expansion as a catalyst for more upside.
Oracle posted blockbuster gains on Wednesday, and the rally may not be over, according to equity analysts at Jefferies.
The surge in Oracle's stock price came after the software giant shocked Wall Street with a record $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, or RPO — a measure of contracted future revenue — in its fiscal first quarter.
That figure was up 359% year over year, surpassing cloud rivals Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, according to Jefferies' analysis.
Following the earnings release, Oracle's New York-listed stock closed 36% higher at $328.33 on Wednesday — its best one-day performance since 1992.
The phenomenal gains also briefly propelled CEO Larry Ellison to the position of the world's richest person, surpassing Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Those eye-popping gains could be a sign of more to come for the $922 billion company.
""We see room for the stock to grind even higher as optimism builds around the outlook,"" wrote Jefferies' analysts in a Wednesday note.
They lifted Oracle's price target from $270 to $360 — implying 10% further upside from Wednesday's close.
Jefferies projects Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to expand 77% year-over-year to $18 billion in fiscal 2026 before scaling to $144 billion by 2030. This would represent a compound annual growth rate of nearly 70% from 2025 and outpace consensus forecasts by more than $50 billion.
Meanwhile, Oracle's multicloud database revenue surged more than 1,500% year over year, which Jefferies said underscores the robust adoption of its multicloud strategy.
That growth looks poised to continue: Oracle plans to add 37 data centers over the next several years.
Still, not everything met consensus in Oracle's first quarter.
Revenue rose 12% year-over-year, shy of Wall Street's 13% forecast.
Software and infrastructure as a service growth also came in under consensus. Oracle raised its capital expenditure forecast to $35 billion for fiscal 2026 — a 65% jump that mirrored an acceleration in infrastructure investment.
""The increase illustrates persistent supply constraints amid surging demand, particularly from AI workloads,"" wrote the analysts at Jefferies.
They warned that the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out is likely to compress margins going forward.
Even so, Jefferies said those near-term pressures are outweighed by the company's huge backlog and accelerating demand for AI workloads.
Oracle shares are extending gains to trade 1.4% higher in after-hours trade on Thursday. The stock is up 97% year-to-date."

SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Following a vote by the California Senate to pass Assembly Bill 288 (AB 288), Teamsters California and the California Federation of Labor Unions are urging Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign the bill — the most significant labor legislation since the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935.
The legislation authored by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor (D-Inglewood) would enhance California's ability to enforce workers' rights to organize if the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is unable to do so, or if workers lose existing legal protections under the NLRA.
""The passage of AB 288 represents one of the most significant labor law reforms in history. Ninety years after the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, corporate lawbreaking and federal inaction have made it almost impossible for workers to exercise their constitutional right to form a union because corporations know there will be no consequences if they refuse to recognize or bargain with the union,"" said Lorena Gonzalez, President of the California Federation of Labor Unions. ""With AB 288, California lawmakers have demonstrated that our state will not stand by while the wealthiest corporations in the world violate labor laws with impunity. Under AB 288, when the NLRB is unable or unwilling to act, the state will step in to enforce the law and ensure that workers who want a union actually get a union. We owe it to every worker who courageously stands up to build a better life for themself and their family to make sure labor laws are vigorously enforced and the right to organize is fully respected.""
""AB 288 is a game-changer for workers in California, and it's incumbent on Gavin Newsom to sign it into law as quickly as possible,"" said Peter Finn, Co-Chair of Teamsters California. ""More than 70 percent of workers want to be in a union, but Big Tech corporatists like Jeff Bezos are flouting federal law and trampling workers' organizing rights. With the right to organize guaranteed under state law, we can show the nation that a strong economy is built through solidarity, not CEOs' arrogance.""
The push for AB288 comes amid an attempt by Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Howard Schultz, and other billionaires to undermine federal law by having the NLRB declared unconstitutional.
""Amazon respects neither its employees nor federal law and that's all the proof we need that it's more urgent than ever to pass AB 288,"" said Vanessa Valdez, an Amazon Teamster at DAX5 in the City of Industry, Calif. ""The only way this greedy company will negotiate a fair contract with workers like me is if it's forced to."""

The leading adtech company got dinged by news that Netflix had integrated with Amazon's DSP. A downgrade from Morgan Stanley was also weighing on the stock.
As of 3:09 p.m. ET, the stock was down 12.1% on the news.
The Trade Desk's troubles continue
The Trade Desk has been the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year as growth has slowed in the face of competition from Amazon and other platforms, so the news that Amazon and Netflix are teaming up only exacerbated existing concerns.
The partnership will allow advertisers using Amazon's DSP to get direct access to Netflix's ad inventory in several major markets around the world. The partnership will begin in the fourth quarter.
The deal has implications for The Trade Desk because it will make Amazon's DSP more attractive for advertisers, especially as Netflix's ad tier is rapidly growing. It also strengthens the so-called ""walled gardens"" that The Trade Desk is competing with, referring to complete ad ecosystems that big companies like Alphabet and Meta Platforms use. The alliance between Netflix and Amazon essentially represents two walled gardens teaming up.
Additionally, Morgan Stanley lowered its rating to equal weight from overweight and slashed its price target on the stock from $80 to $50. The investment bank said it was wrong about the durability of The Trade Desk's growth and noted ""mounting headwinds"" this year.
Can The Trade Desk recover?
For years, The Trade Desk could do little wrong, and the stock marched higher as the adtech company delivered outstanding results quarter over quarter. However, The Trade Desk stock has tumbled in two of its last three earnings reports now as its growth is slowing, and management's efforts to reassure investors have fallen flat.
Amazon may now be the company's biggest rival in connected TV as it signed a deal with Roku earlier this year, and its DSP now works with every major streaming service.
Whether that leads to advertisers dropping the service remains to be seen, but it does seem to limit its growth opportunity. The Trade Desk is already integrated with Netflix, but the deal is still likely to put pressure on it.
The Trade Desk's valuation has proven to be a vulnerability during the sell-off this year, and while the price is certainly more reasonable after this year's sell-off, the company will have to prove that its growth rate won't continue to compress."

The optimism was echoed by analysts. Piper Sandler’s Brent Bracelin maintained an Overweight rating and raised the price forecast from $270 to $330, highlighting Oracle’s transformation from a technology stalwart to a secular AI infrastructure leader.
Bracelin noted Recovery Point Objective (RPO) climbed to $455 billion in fiscal first-quarter 2026, a 359% year-over-year increase, while backlog rose $317 billion in a single quarter.
Four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three customers drove the record gain, with cloud RPO alone surging nearly 500% year-over-year.
Bracelin added that Oracle’s capital expenditure guidance jumped to $35 billion from over $25 billion, reflecting demand that continues to “dramatically outstrip” supply.
He projected that Oracle’s ability to secure multi-billion-dollar AI contracts and sustain more than 40% growth across IaaS and SaaS segments could lift the cloud mix to over 50% of revenue next year. Fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS is projected at $6.75, rising to $8.04 in fiscal 2027.
Citizens JMP analyst Patrick Walravens echoed the bullish outlook, reiterating a Market Outperform rating and raising the price forecast to $342 from $315.
He described Oracle’s results as “spectacular,” with RPO up 359% year-over-year versus 41% last quarter. Oracle’s stock jumped 28% in after-hours trading and is up roughly 45% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 and Russell 3000.
Walravens slightly lowered fiscal 2026 EPS to $7.00 from $7.13 and trimmed fiscal 2027 EPS to $8.68 from $8.75, but sharply raised fiscal 2028 EPS to $14.32 from $10.92, reflecting projected 53% revenue growth.
He cited OpenAI’s $30 billion annual deal, alongside wins with xAI, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), positioning Oracle as the “go-to place” for AI workloads."

Shares of streaming TV platform Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) fell 2.3% in the afternoon session after an analyst downgrade of a key competitor highlighted increasing competitive pressures in the digital advertising market.
The stock moved in response to Morgan Stanley's downgrade of ad-tech peer The Trade Desk. The investment firm cited ""mounting concerns"" over growth, pointing specifically to Amazon's faster-than-expected expansion of its advertising platform, which was bolstered by new deals with companies including Roku. While a partnership with Amazon's platform could bring benefits, the market appears focused on the broader implication: heightened competition in the connected TV (CTV) advertising space. This development suggests potential headwinds for the sector as a whole, which is weighing on investor sentiment for Roku.

The partnership makes popular events like the NFL Sunday Ticket more accessible on Roku devices, aiming to establish the platform as a central hub for live sports programming. This strategy is designed to capture higher-value audiences and drive engagement, which typically commands premium advertising rates. The focus on sports builds on recent success, as the category contributed meaningfully to the company’s second-quarter results, which saw platform revenues increase by 18% year-over-year. While the news is a positive step in Roku's growth strategy, some analysts remain cautious, with firms like Piper Sandler and Jefferies recently maintaining their Neutral and Hold ratings on the stock.
Roku is up 26.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $94.30 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $99.39 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Roku’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $591.45.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN, Financials) is getting closer scrutiny from Wall Street as analysts weigh the impact of its partnership with Anthropic. Barclays on Sept. 4 reaffirmed an Overweight rating and a $275 price target, pointing to early signs of AI-driven growth in Amazon Web Services.
Anthropic contributed about 100 basis points to AWS growth in the second quarter of 2025, Barclays estimated. That lift could reach 400 basis points per quarter once training for Anthropic's Claude 5 model and related inference revenues take hold later next year.
Still, the outlook carries risk. Cursor recently switched its default setting to OpenAI's GPT-5 API, raising questions about whether Anthropic can sustain momentum. Some industry voices have also flagged concerns over accessing Anthropic models through AWS Bedrock, suggesting possible strain in the tie-up.
For now, Amazon is benefiting from Anthropic's workloads, but analysts note that AI revenue across hyperscalers remains concentrated in just a few labs. Broader adoption has yet to spread, leaving 2025 as a key year to watch for AWS growth."

Elon Musk has been booted from his spot as the world's richest person, according to Bloomberg's latest ranking.
That title now belongs to Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, who moves into the spot after the company reported earnings Sept. 9 that beat Wall Street expectations and sent its stock skyrocketing by as much as 40% the following day.
Musk had been considered the world’s richest person for just over 300 days. He first claimed the spot in 2021 but lost the title to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, then Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods company, Bloomberg reported.
This is the first time Ellison has been the world’s richest person, according to Bloomberg, with a majority of the 81-year-old’s net worth tied to the data software company.
On Sept. 9, Oracle Corp. reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations after announcing it had secured several multibillion-dollar contracts for its cloud infrastructure with continuing demand.
As of 10 a.m. ET on Sept. 10, Ellison’s net worth was up by $101 billion. He’s now worth $393 billion, with Musk at $385 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. It’s the biggest one-day increase ever recorded by the index.
Oracle’s stock hit a record high of $345 on Sept. 10, marking the company’s largest one-day percentage jump since 1992. The stock was up roughly 100% year to date, from $166 at the beginning of the year.
In comparison, share prices of Musk's Tesla are down roughly 7% year to date. However, the company recently proposed a huge pay package for the CEO, which could see Musk become the world’s first trillionaire, meaning he could potentially surpass Ellison once again as the world's richest person.
The lucrative pay package would only take effect if Musk completes a series of goals in the coming years.
Ellison held second place prior to earnings release
Ellison’s rise comes a day after Forbes released its list of the world’s richest people.
The outlet reported that the 400 richest Americans are worth a combined $6.6 trillion and are getting richer. At one point this year, Musk was worth over $400 billion, the only person to ever hit that milestone.
Ellison was second in Forbes' real-time billionaires list on Sept. 10, with a wealth value of $391.1 billion, behind Musk's $440.5 billion.

On Tuesday, Jim Cramer said Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) decision to pay Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) -backed Anthropic for artificial intelligence features in Office apps marks a major change in strategy after years of relying heavily on OpenAI.
Microsoft will integrate some of Anthropic's Claude models into Office 365 applications such as Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint, reported Reuters (via The Information).
Developers testing the tools reportedly found Anthropic's latest technology outperformed OpenAI's models in certain cases, such as handling financial functions in Excel or generating more aesthetically polished PowerPoint slides.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
The shift means Microsoft will blend Anthropic and OpenAI models within its productivity software while it continues to develop its own in-house AI systems.
The report added that Microsoft will pay Amazon Web Services to access Anthropic's models, a notable move given AWS is both a direct cloud rival and one of Anthropic's largest shareholders.
Cramer took to X, formerly Twitter, and said, ""Microsoft paying Amazon's Anthropic for some product that it thinks is better than that of AI. That's big,"" he said, highlighting the implications of Microsoft expanding beyond its long-standing reliance on OpenAI.
See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in ChatGPT-parent and remains its largest financial backer. A company spokesperson told the publication, ""OpenAI will continue to be our partner on frontier models and we remain committed to our long-term partnership.""
Still, the companies have faced tensions. Earlier this year, reports surfaced of a dispute over a contractual clause that could limit Microsoft's access to OpenAI's artificial general intelligence once achieved.
Meanwhile, OpenAI is said to be exploring a secondary stock sale that could value it at $500 billion, up from $300 billion earlier this year.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
