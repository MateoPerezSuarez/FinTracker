BENGALURU (Reuters) -Google said on Tuesday it would invest $15 billion over five years to set up an artificial intelligence data centre in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh, its biggest ever investment in the world's most populous nation.
The U.S. tech giant's plan comes amid a tense diplomatic standoff between New Delhi and Washington over tariffs and a stalled trade deal, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged a boycott of foreign goods.
Indian infotech and finance ministers attended the New Delhi event at which Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said the data centre in Andhra Pradesh would be the company's ""largest AI hub"" outside the United States.
""This long-term vision we have is to accelerate India's own AI mission,"" Kurian said.
Google has committed to spending about $85 billion this year to build out data centre capacity as big tech companies invest heavily to build new infrastructure in their competition to meet booming demand for AI services.
The data centre campus in the port city of Visakhapatnam will have an initial capacity of 1 Gigawatt.
U.S.-INDIA TENSION
U.S.-based multinationals face growing boycott calls in India, as business executives and Modi supporters have stoked anti-American sentiment to protest against the tariff of 50% on imported Indian goods.
""This initiative creates substantial economic and societal opportunities for both India and the United States,"" Google said in a statement, without referring to the tariffs.
In recent weeks, Indian officials have privately met many executives of U.S. companies to say they are committed to providing an easy business environment despite the discontent over U.S. tariffs, two sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A BILLION INTERNET USERS
Microsoft and Amazon have already poured billions into building data centres in India, a critical growth market where nearly a billion users access the internet.
Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani have also unveiled investments in building capacity for data centres.
Adani Group and India's Airtel have partnered with Google to build the infrastructure for its new project, which also includes construction of a new international subsea gateway.
AI requires enormous computing power, pushing demand for specialised data centres that enable tech companies to link thousands of chips together in clusters.
Earlier, state officials had estimated the investment at $10 billion for the centre, which they said would generate 188,000 jobs."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-14T02:00:00,Is D-Wave Quantum a Millionaire-Maker Stock?,Quantum computing is the next big tech hype cycle.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6798989e83329f73977ed09bb2edd71bff45d6d42af657b1fc6406d41ff7b301,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/is-d-wave-quantum-a-millionaire-maker-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/is-d-wave-quantum-a-millionaire-maker-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/is-d-wave-quantum-a-millionaire-maker-stock/,fool.com,200.0,,"With shares up by a jaw-dropping 3,600% over the last 12 months, D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 3.95%) has probably already minted plenty of millionaires. Investors are pouring into quantum-related stocks because of their disruptive long-term potential. But is the recent rally based on hype or fundamentals?
Let's dig deeper to see if D-Wave Quantum is still a millionaire maker or if it's better to wait on the sidelines.
What is driving this explosive rally?
While D-Wave Quantum hit the market through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in 2022, shares didn't start gaining traction until late 2024. That was when the tech giant Alphabet debuted its cutting-edge quantum chip Willow, which was taken as a sign that the industry might be getting closer to large-scale commercial viability.
Over the following months, the industry notched a few more wins as customers put in orders for quantum-related machinery from D-Wave and other players. The company's second-quarter revenue grew 42% year over year to $3.1 million as it inked consumer deals with both research institutions and enterprise clients interested in its quantum hardware.
But while D-Wave's recent equipment sales are encouraging, they don't necessarily mean the company is on track to scale up a viable business anytime soon. In fact, D-Wave sold its first quantum computing system to Lockheed Martin all the way back in 2011. That's a whopping 14 years ago. There is no guarantee that the company's more recent sales will be any different from the one-off experimental purchases in the past. In the meantime, the company's bottom line leaves much to be desired.
D-Wave Quantum is burning through cash
While D-Wave's $3.1 million in revenue sounds great, it's much less impressive when you consider the $28.5 million it spent on operating expenses, with a lot of that going to vital things like research and development. D-Wave has turned to equity raises (issuing and selling more units of its own stock) to raise the money it needs to sustain its cash burn, with $400 million in capital raised this way in July alone.
D-Wave's share count has increased dramatically since its public listing in 2022, and investors should expect this trend to continue.
While equity raises can benefit shareholders by keeping a company afloat and providing money it can use to finance research that will create value in the future, it also dilutes current investors' ownership and their claim on future earnings, which can cause shares to underperform. With quantum technology years, if not decades, away from widespread commercial viability, this will be a long-term headwind for D-Wave's early investors.
D-Wave's valuation is also uncomfortably high. With a price-to-sales ratio of 336, shares trade at an immense valuation over the S&P 500 average of just 3.31. And while some investors may see this as a reasonable premium considering the potential of quantum technology, it means a lot of future growth is already priced in.
Is D-Wave Quantum a millionaire-maker stock?
After soaring 3,600% in 12 months, D-Wave Quantum clearly has millionaire-maker potential in the right conditions. The stock market is always itching for the next best thing and is often willing to ignore fundamentals in favor of hype. That said, over the long term, fundamentals usually win. And while D-Wave Quantum could eventually have a bright future, its operations will need to scale up substantially before it can be considered a reasonable long-term bet."

Don't take my word for it: The world's five most valuable companies -- each with market caps of more than $2 trillion -- are leading innovators in the field of AI.
AI chipmaker Nvidia recently became the world's largest publicly traded company, valued at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the industry standard for AI workloads. Enterprise and cloud provider Microsoft provides a growing suite of AI tools, whikch has driven its value to $3.9 trillion. With more than 1 billion iPhones in the wild, Apple has a captive audience for its Apple Intelligence (AI) ambitions, pushing its market cap to $3.8 trillion. Cloud and AI leaders Alphabet and Amazon round out the top five, boasting values of $2.9 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.
With a market cap of roughly $1.5 trillion (as of this writing), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.01%), often referred to as TSMC, is on the fast track to join this elite fraternity. The adoption of AI continues at a hectic pace, fueling blistering demand for its most advanced chips. As the world's largest and most renowned semiconductor foundry, TSMC is on the fast track to meet the requirements for membership in this exclusive club -- and it might happen sooner than investors realize.
Want chips with that?
TMSC has worked behind the scenes for years, fabricating the most advanced processors, but recently found itself in the spotlight. Management bills the company as the ""world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry,"" making it a critical provider in the supply chain for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI.
And make no mistake, no foundry is as well-regarded as TSMC. Its customer list reads like the Who's-Who of tech glitterati, and includes Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others.
With the surge in demand for AI-centric processors, TSMC is no longer dependent merely on smartphone chips. In fact, the lion's share of the company's revenue now comes from the advanced processors needed for HPC and AI, recently responsible for 60% of sales.
TSMC's growth continues to accelerate. In the second quarter, revenue of $30 billion grew 44% in U.S. dollars, while earnings per ADR soared 67% to $2.47. Management expects this trend to continue. TSMC is calling for third-quarter revenue of $32.4 billion in USD at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 38%, and the company has been known to underpromise and overdeliver.
The path to $1 trillion
TSMC is in an enviable position as the world scrambles to adopt this groundbreaking technology. The company is well positioned to benefit from advances in generative AI, counting the biggest names in technology as its customers. Furthermore, TSMC's rapid revenue growth is the clearest sign yet that it is poised to profit from this opportunity. As such, TSMC should soon be joining the company of multi-trillionaires.
According to Wall Street, TSMC is on track to generate revenue of $123.3 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 12.8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSMC would have to generate revenue of roughly $156 billion annually to justify a $2 trillion market cap.
It's telling that Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 16% and 18% in 2026 and 2027, respectively. If the company achieves those relatively low hurdles, it will likely achieve a $2 trillion market cap sometime in 2027. That said, given the company's accelerating growth in recent years, it will likely make the grade even sooner.
Estimates regarding the market potential of AI continue to rachet higher. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the coming decade. That could be conservative, as new use cases for AI are continually being developed.
Finally, at roughly 30 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors a practical way to invest in a once-in-a-generation opportunity."

SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP), the nonprofit international organization bringing at-scale innovations and hyperscale best practices to all, announces an expansion to its Open Systems for AI, an umbrella initiative with the new Open Data Center for AI Strategic Initiative (SI), to increase efforts on key data center infrastructure challenges: power, cooling, mechanical, and management telemetry. The addition of this new strategic initiative is in response to a large increase in data center physical infrastructure projects and workstreams launched in the past year, learnings from the OCP Open Systems for AI SI workshop series, and the new open-letter call for collaboration. With strong support from the OCP Board and stakeholders, the Foundation invites other organizations to sign this letter, which was initiated by Google, Meta, and Microsoft.. This underscores the OCP Foundation's mission to support the entire open data center ecosystem, covering IT as well as physical data center infrastructure and facilities.
The mandate of the Open Data Center for AI SI is to develop standardizations for data center infrastructure allowing advanced high-density AI infrastructure to be deployed as flexibly as traditional compute where facilities are built with a common understanding of management telemetry, advanced power and cooling technologies to enable simpler deployment of a wide variety of AI solutions. The issue faced by data center partners including hyperscalers, neoclouds, co-location providers, enterprise users, and technology providers is that siloed efforts produce competing design requirements that slows innovations and extends deployment timelines. The goal is to identify and specify requirements for AI data centers such that the physical infrastructure common ground enables fungibility for a diverse AI IT infrastructure, especially while aspects of the AI IT elements are rapidly evolving. This will enable colocation data center providers to support a wider range of tenants with fewer customizations.
""The OCP Community's vision of the open data center ecosystem continues to enable solving the challenges of building at-scale AI clusters and the infrastructure that houses them. We are continuing to utilize OCP's open, collaborative, and unique value proposition and its large community and ecosystem to develop open specifications and standards that address the bottlenecks that threaten to constrain the future of AI growth. We firmly believe OCP's role in fostering development of open, standardized, sustainable, and scalable infrastructure to be increasingly vital to the industry and its supply chain enabling it to deliver on AI's transformative potential cost effectively and with faster TTM, while managing its environmental impact,"" said George Tchaparian, CEO at the Open Compute Project Foundation."

The DGX Spark, which Nvidia said offers data center-class performance, packs the company's GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, as well as its ConnectX-7 networking capabilities and software stack.
The idea is to provide smaller businesses and developers with access to an AI computing system without requiring them to spend thousands on renting AI data center services or buying their own AI servers.
The Spark is part of a new class of computer Nvidia is rolling out with third-party partners, including ASUS (2357.TW) and Dell (DELL), which will allow customers to develop and use AI models on their own local devices.
Nvidia said the Spark can be outfitted with up to 128GB of memory, which should help when running massive AI models.
“In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon [Musk] at a small startup called OpenAI — and from it came ChatGPT, kickstarting the AI revolution,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
“DGX-1 launched the era of AI supercomputers and unlocked the scaling laws that drive modern AI. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.”
Like the DGX-1, Huang also hand-delivered one of the first Spark systems to Musk.
The company also has a larger, more powerful DGX Station, which runs on Nvidia's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra desktop superchip.
But don't expect to grab a Spark or Station and start running your video games or other apps. The system runs on Nvidia's own Linux-based DGX OS and its AI software stack and is specifically designed for building and running AI models.
Nvidia also said users can connect two Spark systems to allow for even larger AI models with up to 405 billion parameters.
The Spark and Station are designed to complement Nvidia's existing AI offerings, enabling users to prototype AI models before deploying them more widely.
Nvidia holds the pole position in the AI chip race thanks to both its powerful processors and CUDA software service.
In addition to its desktop systems, the company continues to ink massive deals with AI companies, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) that will see the ChatGPT developer purchase 10 gigawatts of GPUs.
Last month, Nvidia signed a deal that will see CoreWeave (CRWV) purchase $6.3 billion worth of GPUs from the chip giant.
The company is also providing GPUs to Elon Musk's xAI (XAAI.PVT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and a slew of other tech behemoths — not to mention OpenAI and Oracle's (ORCL) joint Stargate Project venture."

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after investors' concerns about US-China trade tensions were eased by President Trump's more conciliatory tone over the weekend.
Following a sharp market drop the previous trading day driven by trade conflict escalation, Wall Street's main indexes opened significantly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw gains of over 1%. The rebound was attributed to comments made by the President on social media, where he stated the ""China situation will all be fine"" and that the U.S. ""wants to help China, not hurt it!!!"" This shift in rhetoric prompted a return to risk assets, as traders brushed aside the previous week's fears. The rally ahead of the upcoming earnings season suggests that the ""buy-the-dip"" mentality remains strong among investors whenever trade jitters subside.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

Zooming In On Pinterest (PINS)
Pinterest’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock dropped 4.1% after President Trump threatened to impose ""massive"" new tariffs on Chinese imports, reigniting trade war fears. The unexpected announcement shattered a monthslong calm on Wall Street, sending major indices tumbling. The S&P 500 dropped around 1.3%, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7%.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-13T16:32:00,Taiwan Semi (TSM) is Going to $400,Top semi foundry is the backbone of the AI economy and makes NVIDIA magic possible,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7cda01ce291c04ffe400dee8881c3f7d2ee6177e0f0175cbf7427afb966c3247,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semi-tsm-going-400-163200307.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semi-tsm-going-400-163200307.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semi-tsm-going-400-163200307.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reports September quarter results Thursday morning and as the stock bounces back sharply from Friday's trade war jitters, investors look forward to the continuous good news from the planet's top AI foundry.
For instance, Susquehanna raised their price target to $400 from $300 last week after TSM reported a 31.4% increase in September sales (vs. Sep'24). And the Jan-Sep run-rate compares at +36.4% yoy.
Taiwan Semiconductor, aka TSMC, is the premier chip fabrication company for the world's most advanced digital technologies, from Apple smartphones to NVIDIA GPUs.
In less than five years, TSMC's trailing 12-month revenue has more than doubled to hit nearly $105 billion as of the June quarter. Clearly, this is on the back of NVIDIA's (NVDA) explosive growth which saw sales grow by ten times in the same period to $165 billion as of the July quarter, on its way to cross $205 billion this fiscal year (ends January).
Of course, demand for NVIDIA GPU systems didn't turn into a hockey stick until its ""ChatGPT moment"" in the spring of 2023.
I mark that moment in late May at Computex in Taipei City, Taiwan when Jensen Huang unveiled the DGX Grace Hopper 200 system and said that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms (META) were already in line.
To me, this meant that the other 996 corporations in the Fortune 1,000 would want (or need) to build their own LLMs too. I then published this article and video to explain what was coming...
Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion
And that $2 trillion market cap came quickly. That's when the ""AI bubble"" talk started. You can imagine how astonished the bubble breathers are now that NVDA is approaching a $5 trillion market cap.
""Honey, I Shrunk the Chips!""
While Apple's business has been significant for TSMC (as much as 25% of revenues), the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in the low single digits.
What still makes Apple very important though is how they help drive innovation at TSMC by always demanding the latest and greatest architectures for their ecosystem of devices.
TSMC supplies chips for flagship smartphones and 5G infrastructure, where efficiency and miniaturization are crucial. The company’s 5nm and 3nm transistor nodes are widely adopted in high-end mobile devices and 5G equipment, supporting the global rollout of next-generation connectivity.
Transistor nodes refer to the specific manufacturing processes used to produce integrated circuits, where the ""nm"" (nanometer = 1 billionth of a meter) like 7nm or 5nm, historically represented a physical dimension of the transistor, specifically the gate length. For reference, the coronavirus is about 50nm.
Now it's more of a marketing term that signifies a new generation of chip technology with improved performance, power efficiency, and transistor density.
But generally, a smaller node number means...
Smaller transistors: More transistors can be packed into the same area on a chip.
Faster switching: Electrons have a shorter distance to travel, leading to higher clock speeds.
Lower power consumption: Less voltage is needed to operate the smaller transistors.
Why the AI Economy is Not a Bubble
Which brings us back to NVIDIA as they now pack 208 billion transistors into the Grace Blackwell ""superchip"" with further density on the horizon in the Rubin and Feynman series of GPUs expected in 2026 and 2027, following Jensen's nearly annual cadence of development.
I mentioned the early demand for NVIDIA systems in 2023 and have recently seen similar projections from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Marvell (MRVL) at their Custom AI Investor Event that total datacenter capex by the big ""hyperscalers"" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) plus Meta, Tesla (TSLA), OpenAI, Apple, and xAI, will grow from nearly $600 billion this year to over $1 trillion in 2028.
This demand is not slowing down because all these companies realize that the transition to an ""AI economy"" is built on the infrastructure of NVIDIA GPU systems. I am on record late last year saying that this megatrend would lead to over $500 billion in revenues for NVIDIA by 2030. That's only ~35% CAGR from when the TTM topline crossed $100 billion.
And Citi just updated their industry outlook in their ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Energy"" report. The bank forecasts global AI infra capex at $5.5 trillion cumulative through 2029 (56% CAGR), hitting $2.16T in 2029 alone. So that's a double from 2028's $1 trillion.
And that's the infrastructure to power not just generative and agentic AI systems (i.e., LLMs), but a whole new world of ""physical AI"" for autonomous machines, including self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and many other types of 3D automation requiring ""embodied"" or edge intelligence and vision/spatial perception.
And of course my favorite use cases for these technologies are science and medicine, where researchers can plumb the depths of our existence and come back with wondrous and life-changing knowledge.
The training alone for these worlds requires enormous datasets and compute, using simulation and synthetic models. In this way, Jensen is forging a new universe of possibilities that keep TSMC ""fabs"" humming.
TSMC is the Backbone of the AI Economy
TSMC holds about 67% of the global foundry market and nearly 90% of advanced chip production, making it the preferred manufacturer for high-performance, custom AI accelerators and GPUs.
While NVIDIA designs the magical GPUs and systems that power the innovations of the AI Economy, it all starts with Taiwan Semi's advanced silicon fabrication. This is the epitome of high-tech manufacturing using lithographic etching to create circuits smaller than the eye can see.
And what's better for crafting new chips than brand new ""fabs"" as TSMC just broke ground on their 3rd facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In late June, Softbank's Masayoshi Son announced new plans to invest in a $1 trillion industrial complex in Arizona that will build robots and AI technologies.
Son is seeking to create a version of China's vast manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, which concentrates high-tech companies for proximity of resources, logistics, R&D, collaboration, and talent. TSMC was named as a key partner in Son's plans.
Currently for TSMC, the 5nm and 3nm nodes are the backbone for state-of-the-art AI accelerators, powering chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple that are used in generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.
In Q1 2025, 58% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from 3nm and 5nm nodes, with 73% from 7nm and below, underscoring the centrality of these advanced processes in TSMC's business and the broader tech ecosystem.
But TSMC wouldn't be itself if it wasn't planning to go deeper. The company plans to begin production of its 2nm node by late 2025, promising significant gains in power efficiency and performance. Looking further ahead, mass production of the 1.4nm (14 angstroms) process is slated for 2028, offering 10–15% higher speeds or 25–30% lower energy use compared to 2nm."

Former Apple CEO John Sculley said tech companies making great strides in AI have upset the apple cart for the Cupertino, Calif.–based giant.
Speaking to Fortune’s Diane Brady at the Zeta Live conference in New York on Thursday, he warned Apple was facing its “first real competitor” in “many decades” in OpenAI.
“AI has not been a particular strength for them,” Sculley said of Apple.
Wall Street has mounted pressure on Apple as it struggles to make the same inroads in AI as its Magnificent Seven and private company counterparts. Over the past decade, Apple appeared to make savvy moves in building momentum in AI, launching Siri in 2011 and poaching John Giannandrea from Google in 2018 to be its head of AI.
But the company was caught flat-footed after OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in 2022, and when it finally announced its “Apple Intelligence” AI strategy in June 2024, results fell short. Apple said in June it was delaying its AI upgrades to Siri until 2026, and Giannandrea was sidelined from the project. The company was even considering using Anthropic’s or OpenAI’s AI technology to power Siri over its own in-house models, Bloomberg reported in June.
Even its most recent blowout earnings failed to assuage investors of concerns around not only AI adoption, but also the impact of higher tariffs costing the company $800 million in the previous quarter.
For his part, Cook told investors on Apple’s most recent earnings call that the company is taking steps to both restructure staff internally and acquire other companies to catch up in the AI race.
“We have a great team, and we’re putting all of our energy behind it,” he said.
Meanwhile, Apple stock is down about 1% so far this year, while AI chip leader Nvidia is up nearly 40%, and AI hyperscaler Microsoft, which is also a top OpenAI investor, is up 22%.
Despite Apple’s market cap increasing from $300 billion to $3.2 trillion under Cook’s watch, some have called for the CEO to step aside amid lackluster AI results.
Sculley, who served as CEO of Apple from 1983 to 1993, acknowledged the possibility of Cook’s tenure coming to an end, saying on Thursday that whoever succeeds him should help transition the company from an orientation around apps to agentic AI.
OpenAI takes a bite out of the Apple
It is this push toward agentic AI that has Sculley believing OpenAI presents a real threat to Apple’s competitive prowess. Apps are no longer as effective as a subscription model, he said, which is how OpenAI operates ChatGPT.

Here's 1 Reason Why.,This is a tech company diversifying in smart ways that will generate significant growth.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=48985a03c05f24a4f463555a1c7616248c2d42959248f6f7e045f7c871a13a45,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-alphabet-will-soar-over-the-next-5-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-alphabet-will-soar-over-the-next-5-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/prediction-alphabet-will-soar-over-the-next-5-year/,fool.com,200.0,,"The company name Alphabet (GOOG 1.73%) (GOOGL 1.78%) isn't as frequently mentioned and familiar as its core business unit, Google. But I think it might be appropriate for a business that, in contrast to what many might think of it, is rapidly becoming so much more than its foundational internet search business.
That diversification into a variety of different activities is what's going to put the company in high-growth mode over the coming half-decade, in my view. Read on for why.
Searching for new revenue sources
Years ago, what's now Alphabet could have easily rested on its laurels and continued to rake in buckets of money with search. It's a high-margin, relatively low-cost activity that will always attract valuable advertising dollars. After all, who doesn't want to place spots on Google's portal, which seems set to be the incumbent search engine for the imaginable future?
So it's admirable that Alphabet management has been restless enough to plow into other revenue streams. There's advertising magnet YouTube, of course, which has been a valuable asset for the company since it bought it almost 20 years ago (believe it or not).
Another cash generator is the company's Google Cloud business; this is a well-established, robustly growing service that's trusted by many clients to keep selected digital assets in the ether.
Driven to succeed
More encouragingly, Alphabet has one foot firmly in the future.
I'm thinking in particular of its Waymo self-driving unit, which in selected cities -- like mine, Los Angeles -- is rapidly becoming a common sight. In this respect, Alphabet is miles ahead (sorry) of anyone else, even the persistently beloved Tesla. Waymo has vast potential to be this country's go-to robotaxi service, and is firmly establishing itself as a reliable first mover.
With its various revenue streams, Alphabet seems almost assured to grow vigorously over the next few years. I think its stock will prove to be quite the rocket by 2030."

The announcement comes just a week after OpenAI announced a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that will see the chipmaker provide OpenAI with up to 6 gigawatts of AI processors.
Broadcom stock jumped nearly 10% on the news.
OpenAI is the world's most valuable startup, surpassing Elon Musk's SpaceX at some $500 billion.
Under the terms of the Broadcom deal, OpenAI said it will design the accelerators and systems, and then develop and deploy them with Broadcom.
""Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential and deliver real benefits for people and businesses,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
""Developing our own accelerators adds to the broader ecosystem of partners all building the capacity required to push the frontier of AI to provide benefits to all humanity,"" he added.
The announcement is another sign that companies are increasingly seeking to develop their own custom silicon to reduce their reliance on both Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD's chips. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) already have their own custom AI chips, as does Microsoft (MSFT).
But that doesn't mean they'll abandon Nvidia or AMD anytime soon.
OpenAI recently signed a $100 billion deal with Nvidia that will see the ChatGPT developer deploy up to 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems.
OpenAI has been on a dealmaking spree, agreeing to terms with the likes of CoreWeave (CRWV) and launching its Project Stargate initiative with Oracle (ORCL).
But the deals have raised questions about how long OpenAI can continue to spend billions while failing to turn a profit.
The moves have also increased concerns about a continued circular AI trade and the potential for an AI bubble.
During a discussion at Italian Tech Week earlier this month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that we’re likely witnessing an AI bubble, but he added that some of those investments will eventually pay off.
""When people get very excited, as they are today, about artificial intelligence, for example ... every experiment gets funded, every company gets funded,"" Bezos said. ""The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and bad ideas.""

Shares of Broadcom rose more than 12% in premarket trading.
The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts' worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam.
The agreement is the latest in a string of massive AI chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry's surging appetite for computing power as it races to build systems that meet or surpass human intelligence.
OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity.
""Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal.
CUSTOM CHIP BOOM
The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on Nvidia's costly processors that are limited in supply.
The approach is not a sure bet. Similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have run into delays or failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports, and analysts believe custom chips do not pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the short term.
The rise of custom chips has, however, turned Broadcom - long known for its networking hardware - into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022.
The company unveiled a blockbuster $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer that some analysts and market watchers speculated was OpenAI.
Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements."

TAIPEI, Taiwan, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TrendForce’s latest investigations reveal that the rapid expansion of AI server demand is propelling global cloud service providers (CSPs), such as Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu, to boost investments in NVIDIA’s rack-scale GPU solutions, data center expansion, and in-house AI ASIC design. Total CapEx from the eight major CSPs is expected to surpass US$420 billion in 2025, roughly equivalent to their combined spending in 2023 and 2024, marking a 61% YoY increase.
TrendForce predicts that as rack-scale solutions like GB/VR systems grow in 2026, the total CapEx of the eight CSPs will hit a new peak, surpassing US$520 billion with a 24% year-over-year rise. Additionally, investment priorities are moving from revenue-generating assets to short-lived infrastructure such as servers and GPUs, indicating a strategic emphasis on boosting long-term competitiveness and market share rather than immediate profits.
In 2025, NVIDIA’s GB200/GB300 rack systems are poised to become the main deployment targets for CSPs, driven by higher-than-anticipated demand growth. Besides North America’s leading four CSPs and Oracle, emerging customers such as Tesla/xAI, CoreWeave, and Nebius are increasing their purchases for AI cloud leasing and generative AI workloads. By 2026, CSPs are likely to shift from GB300 racks to the new NVIDIA Rubin VR200 rack platform in the latter half of the year.
Custom AI chip production continues to scale up
North America’s leading four CSPs are increasing their investments in AI ASICs to improve autonomy and manage costs for large-scale AI and LLM tasks. Google is partnering with Broadcom on the TPU v7p (Ironwood), an optimized platform for training, set to expand in 2026 and succeed the TPU v6e (Trilium). TrendForce predicts Google’s TPU shipments will stay the highest among CSPs, with over 40% annual growth in 2026.
AWS is prioritizing its Trainium v2 chips, with a liquid-cooled rack version expected by late 2025. The Trainium v3, developed jointly with Alchip and Marvell, is planned for mass production in early 2026. AWS’s ASIC shipments are anticipated to more than double in 2025, marking the fastest growth among major CSPs, with a further approximate 20% increase in 2026.
Meta is enhancing its partnership with Broadcom, with MTIA v2 set for mass production in Q4 2025 to boost inference efficiency and lower latency. In 2025, shipments will mainly back Meta’s internal AI platforms and recommendation systems, while MTIA v3, which includes HBM integration, will launch in 2026, doubling total shipment volume."

The partnership marks Brookfield’s first investment through its dedicated AI Infrastructure strategy
SAN JOSE, Calif., October 13, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), a global leader in power solutions, and Brookfield today announced a $5 billion strategic partnership to implement a reimagined future for AI infrastructure. This partnership marks the first phase of a joint vision to build AI factories capable of meeting the growing compute and power demands of artificial intelligence.
AI factories require infrastructure that tightly integrates compute, power, data center architecture, and capital. Bloom Energy’s fuel cells deliver reliable, scalable and clean onsite power that can be rapidly deployed without legacy grids. Brookfield brings world-class expertise in infrastructure development and financing. Together, the two companies are redefining how AI factories are built and powered.
At the center of the new partnership, Brookfield will invest up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom’s advanced fuel cell technology. The two companies are actively collaborating on the design and delivery of AI factories globally, including a site in Europe that will be announced before the end of the year.
""AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale,"" said KR Sridhar, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Bloom Energy. ""Unlike traditional factories, AI factories demand massive power, rapid deployment and real-time load responsiveness that legacy grids cannot support. The lean AI factory is achieved with power, infrastructure, and compute designed in sync from day one. That principle guides our collaboration with Brookfield to reimagine the data center of the future. Together, we are creating a new blueprint for powering AI at scale.""
""Behind-the-meter power solutions are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories,"" said Sikander Rashid, Global Head of AI Infrastructure at Brookfield. ""Bloom’s advanced fuel cell technology gives us the unique capability to design and construct modern AI factories with a holistic and innovative approach to power needs. As the world’s largest AI infrastructure investor, this partnership adds a powerful new tool to our global growth strategy, especially in a grid-constrained market environment.""
Over the next decade, foundational models and generative AI are expected to drive ongoing demand for power. According to experts, power demand from AI data centers in the United States is expected to grow exponentially and surpass 100 gigawatts by 2035. Fuel cells have become a key solution for this issue and the partnership between Bloom Energy and Brookfield is designed to address this supply gap."

Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
It follows an investigation launched by the CMA on 14 January 2025 and a subsequent period of consultation with more than 80 stakeholders, as well as direct engagement with Google.
With the UK’s digital markets competition regime now active since 1 January 2025, the CMA has gained new authority to introduce targeted measures aimed at promoting competition in digital markets.
The SMS designation does not imply any breach or immediate requirements for Google. It simply enables the regulator to consider interventions where necessary to ensure competitive conditions and fair treatment of users and businesses dependent on Google’s services.
The CMA specified that while general search and search advertising services are covered by the SMS designation, Google’s Gemini AI assistant is currently excluded.

By GlobalDataHowever, the regulator noted that this position may be reviewed if market circumstances change.
Other AI-driven search features, including AI Overviews and AI Mode, are included within the designation.
The CMA also clarified its stance regarding Google’s news and syndication products in defining the scope of SMS.
Looking ahead, the CMA indicated plans to consult on possible regulatory interventions later in the year as part of its broader oversight of the digital platforms market.
CMA Digital Markets Executive Director Will Hayter said: “By promoting competition in digital markets like search and search advertising we can unlock opportunities for businesses big and small to support innovation and growth, driving investment across the UK economy.
“We have found that Google maintains a strategic position in the search and search advertising sector – with more than 90% of searches in the UK taking place on its platform.
“Having taken into account the feedback received following our proposed decision, we have today designated Google’s search services with strategic market status.”
Recently, Google announced a €5bn ($5.8bn) investment in Belgium for 2026 and 2027, aimed at expanding its St. Ghislain data centre campus.
This investment will strengthen the company’s AI infrastructure for Google Cloud and improve core services like Search, Maps, and Workspace."

Over the last 10 years, the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite has trounced the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500, rising 379% to the other indexes' returns of 178% and 239%, respectively.
With artificial intelligence (AI) projected to add trillions in value to the economy in the coming years, top tech stocks are a no-brainer investment. If you have some extra money you don't need for paying off debt or other expenses, the following tech stocks have the potential to grow your money for years to come.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Major deals continue to be made for more chips and data center capacity, and much of the value of these deals ultimately flows to the leading chip manufacturer in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.14%).
TSMC makes chips for all of the leading semiconductor companies, putting it in control of over 70% of the foundry market, according to Counterpoint. Advanced chip technologies (e.g., 7-nanometer nodes and lower) accounted for about three-quarters of its revenue last quarter. Its total revenue surged 44% year over year in Q2.
Most of TSMC's $106 billion in trailing-12-month revenue is generated from wafer fabrication. The rest is earned through other services, such as testing, packaging, design, and royalty income. These services, combined with TSMC's ability to supply a massive amount of chips every year, give it a competitive advantage.
Its manufacturing efficiency also drives stellar margins. TSMC generated $45 billion in net income over the last year. Customers value TSMC for quality service and timely delivery of products. This is an important advantage for TSMC as big tech companies race to build the most advanced AI models to stay ahead of the competition.
Considering its importance in the chip supply chain, an investment in TSMC is a bet on the increasing competition in the AI market. Analysts expect the company's earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 21% in the coming years, yet investors can still buy the stock at just 26 times next year's earnings estimate.
2. Alphabet (Google)
Investing in leading cloud stocks is another attractive opportunity in the tech sector. Cloud services are where companies are using AI to more intelligently use their data and build their own applications. This is fueling growing demand for Alphabet's (GOOG 1.73%) (GOOGL 1.85%) Google Cloud, which should benefit the stock over the long term.
While Google Cloud is third in cloud market share behind Amazon and Microsoft, it is gaining ground in that market. Google Cloud has a competitive advantage in offering proprietary generative AI models like Gemini and best-in-class AI infrastructure. Its revenue grew 32% year over year last quarter, nearly double that of Amazon Web Services.
Google Cloud has been developing its own chips and systems for AI over the last decade. Its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) were designed specifically for AI and offer optimal power efficiency, which is increasingly important as training more advanced AI with massive chip clusters will require tremendous amounts of energy. Google also offers general-purpose chips from third parties to offer customers the greatest flexibility in compute performance, depending on their needs.
A competitive advantage for Alphabet is how it leverages its AI chips and proprietary models across multiple businesses. For example, Alphabet's Gemini AI models power all of its consumer and enterprise services, including Search, Maps, and Cloud. It also uses its TPUs to power both cloud services and even its Pixel phone.
It can effectively spread the costs of its AI technology across more revenue, which, in turn, drives up profit margin. In the last quarter, its earnings per share grew 22% year over year, and analysts are projecting double-digit growth over the long term.
Assuming Alphabet's earnings grow consistent with Wall Street's expectations of 15% on an annualized basis, the stock should follow suit, as it still trades at a reasonable multiple of 23 times next year's earnings estimate."

Chip leaders like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are building the hardware backbones powering generative AI, while cloud titans such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon race to expand data centers and roll out new services at unprecedented speed.
One of the more surprising winners throughout the AI boom has been a nuclear energy company called Oklo (OKLO -0.87%). As of this writing (Oct. 6), shares have surged an astonishing 1,130% over the past year. My prediction for 2026? Oklo stock could climb even higher.
The question is -- does that make it a smart buy right now?
Oklo's momentum looks strong, but there's a catch
Oklo's mission is straightforward: to design and build small modular reactors (SMRs) capable of powering data centers and remote industrial sites. This concept has captured the imaginations of investors as AI's rapid expansion collides with soaring electricity demand -- a market that Wall Street estimates could be worth as much as $10 trillion.
Yet for all the excitement surrounding Oklo, the company still lacks two critical ingredients: revenue and profits.
Heading into 2026, my prediction is that Oklo's story will revolve more around partnerships than profits. The company will likely announce new collaborations with government agencies and private enterprises -- perhaps with data center operators or hyperscalers seeking to diversify their power sources.
These announcements will make headlines and stoke media enthusiasm, but investors should remain cautious. Oklo remains years away from true commercialization, and until the company deploys and operates a working reactor at scale, such deals are more symbolic than financially meaningful. In other words, they offer optionality but not cash flow.
Dilution risk looms as Oklo's valuation defies gravity
Oklo's meteoric rise has been fueled more by narrative momentum than by underlying business fundamentals. The company went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2024, and since then, its valuation has swelled to levels that would make even the most optimistic investors raise an eyebrow. At its current market capitalization of $20 billion, Oklo is priced like a mature energy company despite not generating a single dollar of revenue.
This disconnect could soon force management to raise more capital through a secondary stock offering. Building nuclear reactors is extraordinarily capital-intensive, and regulatory approvals can take years to secure. While Oklo has garnered early support from the Department of Energy, it will almost certainly need additional funding to sustain operations through the rest of the decade.
Issuing new shares while the stock remains inflated would be a logical move -- but it comes with an obvious trade-off: dilution. This is a familiar outcome for early-stage companies and one that bullish investors should be prepared to accept.
Oklo looks more like a meme stock than a long-term investment
Online forums have latched onto Oklo as the next frontier of nuclear innovation -- a bet that, in theory, could revolutionize the energy landscape. In practice, however, Oklo has yet to deliver a prototype that produces compelling unit economics.
Against this backdrop, the company is behaving less like a traditional investment and more like a meme stock. Much like the dot-com era -- when valuations were driven by engagement metrics such as clicks and page views -- Oklo's market value appears tethered to speculative optimism rather than measurable results.
For investors, that distinction is critical. Owning Oklo today isn't an investment in a proven enterprise; it's a wager on a narrative. This kind of profile rarely offers the durable financial foundation that institutional investors seek. Instead, Oklo has become a day-trader's playground -- propelled by retail hype rather than fundamentals.
Savvy investors should resist the fear of missing out (FOMO) and remember that hype cycles eventually correct. When the dust settles, Oklo could indeed become a key player in the future of nuclear energy -- but only after its technology and financials mature. Until then, the company remains one of the market's flashiest yet most fragile stories. If shares continue rising throughout 2026, I'd view it as an opportunity to sell on momentum."

What began as a niche designer of graphics chips for gamers has evolved into the central nervous system of the artificial intelligence (AI) economy.
Today, hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, and Meta Platforms rely on Nvidia's hardware and software stack to train and deploy their AI models. Unprecedented demand has fueled staggering financial growth, propelling Nvidia's market value nearly 16x during the AI revolution. At a market cap of roughly $4.5 trillion, Nvidia now wears the crown of the world's most valuable company.
This raises the question: Is there any upside left, or have investors who don't already own shares missed the boat?
The answer according to Wall Street analyst Phil Panaro at The Boston Consulting Group may surprise you. Panaro projects that Nvidia could reach a $20 trillion valuation within the next five years -- representing a gain of more than 340% from current levels. While this target may sound ambitious, his thesis is built on three converging forces shaping the next decade of AI.
Let's unpack the key drivers behind Panaro's bold prediction and explore why Nvidia's long-term story remains one of the most compelling in the entire market.
The AI boom has only just begun
The first pillar of Panaro's thesis is that the current AI boom is still in the early innings of a decades-long transformation. He estimates that global AI adoption remains below 1% today, meaning that most industries have only begun to explore the potential of intelligent automation. As AI becomes embedded across healthcare, financial services, logistics, retail, and manufacturing, the demand for accelerated computing should expand exponentially.
Nvidia is uniquely positioned to capture these tailwinds. On the hardware front, its chips remain the gold standard for training and inferencing large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems. Equally important, Nvidia's CUDA software platform forms the base layer of its ecosystem, enabling developers to build AI applications at scale.
This deep integration has created enormous switching costs, meaning that once a company's AI infrastructure is built on Nvidia's backbone, migrating to another platform becomes complex and financially prohibitive.
This combination of superior product performance and ecosystem lock-in gives Nvidia exceptional pricing power. In effect, the company is no longer just a chip designer. It has assumed the role of a toll collector in the AI era, charging admission to every breakthrough that relies on its compute stack.
Web3 and the next frontier of compute demand
The second pillar of Panaro's argument centers on the rise of Web3 and decentralized applications. Blockchain validation, metaverse rendering, and on-chain governance are all emerging systems that require computationally intensive processing power -- precisely the kind of workload Nvidia's GPUs are designed to handle.
Nvidia's opportunity in this realm is twofold.
First, the company's hardware will likely remain a core foundation for next-generation decentralized networks -- providing the horsepower to process blockchain transactions and train autonomous systems at global scale.
Second, Nvidia's software capabilities -- particularly in simulation and digital twin technologies -- could prove to be essential tools for building virtual worlds, industrial replicas, and real-time digital economies that mirror the physical world.
As Web3 evolves, Nvidia remains positioned to supply both the silicon and the advanced software required to power the next frontier of the internet.
Governments will be the next wave of AI customers
The third pillar of Panaro's forecast highlights an often-overlooked source of demand: the public sector. While private businesses have raced to procure GPUs and expand their data center footprints, government agencies around the world are only beginning to invest in digital transformation.
Federal and state governments could use AI to optimize logistics, detect fraud, forecast infrastructure needs, and manage power grids with greater efficiency. Meanwhile, defense agencies could leverage AI for training simulations, satellite imagery analysis, and developing advanced cybersecurity protocols.
The underlying investment theme here is quite powerful: Government contracts tend to be long-term and capital-intensive. Initiatives like Project Stargate underscore this trend -- large-scale, multiyear buildouts designed to make AI infrastructure a national security asset.
Ambition vs. reality
Whether Nvidia will reach a $20 trillion valuation by 2030 remains open to debate. In my view, Panaro's target should be interpreted less as a precise forecast and more as a statement of potential.
Nvidia has built one of the most durable and profitable business models of the modern era, one that bridges hardware, software, and connected ecosystems.
And regardless of whether Nvidia reaches the $20 trillion milestone, I agree that its story appears to be in its early chapters. For this reason, I see Nvidia as a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon."

America is the world’s largest economy and home to its biggest stock market, biggest bond market and its reserve currency the dollar, all of which count for rather a lot. Many headline stock indices are cruising to new highs, including our very own FTSE 100.
Yet someone is worried. The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), released last Wednesday, offer warnings of increased risks of a sharp pullback in global share prices. The question now, as one email sent to this column immediately reflected, is whether this is a timely alert or a repeat of Alan Greenspan’s “irrational exuberance” speech of 1996. The then-Federal Reserve chair cautioned about the dangers of a galloping stock market, only for share prices to continue rising, not peaking until 39 months later.
Uncanny echoes
The FPC’s frets about the sky-high valuations of anything AI carry uncomfortable echoes of the technology, media and telecoms (TMT) – or dotcom – bubble that inflated over the 1990s, popped in 2000 and bottomed in 2002. It then took America’s technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index, the poster child for the bubble, until April 2015 to return to its March 2000 high, teaching investors a painful lesson of the perils of choosing narrative over valuation.
Greenspan had, in the eyes of some, tried to calm animal spirits before the bubble even got going – and with good reason. Just eight months after the Fed chair spoke, trouble blew in from an unexpected quarter when Thailand devalued the baht. Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia quickly followed with the rupiah, won and ringgit, and the Asian debt crisis began to roil markets."

With shares holding steady near recent highs and only a modest discount compared to analyst targets, the question remains: Is Alphabet’s true upside already reflected in the current price, or is there room for buyers to benefit from future growth?
Most Popular Narrative: 40% Undervalued
According to Investingwilly, Alphabet’s recent share price stands well below the narrative’s fair value estimate. This sets the stage for a bold thesis on its potential upside. As attention turns to Alphabet among the Magnificent 7, this valuation gap is fueling both curiosity and debate in the investment community.
Despite its dominance and innovation, Alphabet is currently the cheapest stock among the “Magnificent 7” (the seven largest U.S. tech companies by market capitalization). This relative undervaluation, combined with its robust fundamentals and forward-thinking strategy, makes Alphabet a highly attractive opportunity for long-term investors.
What’s propelling such a standout valuation? The narrative spotlights Alphabet’s high earnings quality and a profit growth runway that makes its current multiple look almost conservative. Hint: it all hinges on cash-rich fundamentals, a diversified growth engine, and projections that defy the cautious outlook prevailing in the sector. Ready to discover what’s driving this valuation and where the real surprises lie?
Result: Fair Value of $237.43 (UNDERVALUED)
Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.
However, Alphabet still faces regulatory scrutiny and the risk of slower ad market growth. Both of these factors could challenge the bullish outlook.
Find out about the key risks to this Alphabet narrative.
Another View: How Peer Valuations Stack Up
While Alphabet appears undervalued from a narrative perspective, a closer look at its price-to-earnings ratio tells a more nuanced story. Trading at 24.8 times earnings, Alphabet is pricier than both the US Interactive Media and Services industry average of 15.3 and its peer average of 54.6. However, it still trades well below a fair ratio of 41.3, which the market could move toward if sentiment shifts. The gap signals both potential opportunity and the risk of overpaying if industry multiples fall back, leaving investors to judge which side will win out. Could this premium be justified, or should buyers be cautious as multiples cool off?"
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-12T17:30:00,"The Best Growth Stock to Invest $1,000 in Right Now",Alphabet is becoming one of the biggest AI winners.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0c555e3e6ed779a7f9d98f4c3cd6ff5827f511d2c4a4b765cf4e01e2096eb888,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/the-best-growth-stock-to-invest-1000-in-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/the-best-growth-stock-to-invest-1000-in-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/the-best-growth-stock-to-invest-1000-in-right-now/,fool.com,200.0,,"Alphabet (GOOGL 1.78%) (GOOG 1.73%) looks like one of the best places to put fresh money to work today because it's finally showing that the artificial intelligence (AI) wave is going to expand its moat rather than chip away at it.
A year ago, there was plenty of worry that chatbots would cut into Google Search, but that story has flipped. By building Gemini directly into search, Alphabet is driving more queries and capturing more ad dollars. Search has always been its foundation, and it's clear that AI isn't eroding its lead; it's making it stronger.
The company has turned the default advantage it built over the past few decades into an AI advantage. By owning Android and Chrome and giving Apple a lucrative revenue-sharing deal to make Google the default search engine for Safari, Alphabet effectively controls how billions of people access the internet. People don't usually change defaults, so that reach is incredibly durable.
Now with AI Overviews, Circle to Search, Lens, and the new AI Mode that lets you click over to a chatbot in the same search window, Alphabet is converting that reach into higher-value traffic that is already lifting search revenue growth. Over two billion people are using AI Overviews monthly, and it's just now rolling out AI Mode globally.
At the same time, cloud computing has become another big growth engine for the company. Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% last quarter to $13.6 billion, and operating income more than doubled to $2.8 billion. Demand is running so hot that Alphabet added $10 billion to its 2025 capex budget, which now sits at $85 billion, to try to keep up with demand.
Google Cloud is right at the heart of the AI boom, and Alphabet's offering is arguably the best positioned, even though it is currently only the No. 3 player in the space. It offers one of the most complete stacks in the industry with its Gemini models, Vertex AI platform, and BigQuery analytics all running on top of its own custom chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Those TPUs give Alphabet and its customers a cost and performance edge, which will become even more important in the future as the AI market shifts more toward inference from training.
The company also developed Kubernetes, which has become the standard for containerized apps, and its pending Wiz acquisition will add one of the best cloud-security offerings. All of that makes Google Cloud much more than a distant No. 3 player.
Alphabet's AI strategy is also capital-efficient because the company designs chips in-house, with some help from Broadcom. Its TPUs have been praised by Nvidia's own CEO and let Alphabet have better power efficiency compared to off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs). That advantage matters as workloads scale. On top of that, Alphabet owns one of the largest private fiber networks on the planet, which gives customers low latency and high performance worldwide.
Beyond AI
In addition to its strength in search and cloud computing, Alphabet has optionality that few other mega-caps can match. Its Waymo robotaxi business is rapidly expanding its service into new cities, including big markets like New York, and it has a real first-mover advantage. If the company can reduce per-ride costs, this could become another meaningful business over the next decade.
Meanwhile, its Willow quantum computing chip is showing lower error rates as it scales, an early sign that Alphabet could be one of the leaders when quantum computing finally becomes commercially relevant. In addition, YouTube continues to draw ad dollars from traditional TV, giving Alphabet another dependable growth driver.
Investors have been slow to give Alphabet full credit for all of this. While the stock has moved higher, it still trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 23 times projected 2026 earnings, which is a discount to its mega-cap AI peers.
Overall, Alphabet looks well positioned for the future. For investors putting $1,000 to work today and looking for a dominant AI winner that still isn't priced like one, Alphabet stands out as the best growth stock to buy right now."

But What About Your Energy Bills?
A nuclear boom is directly downstream from the AI boom, with $350 billion in nuclear spending in the US planned by 2050, per Bloomberg.
Sign up for smart news, insights, and analysis on the biggest financial stories of the day.
The artificial intelligence revolution is officially upon us. If the abrupt improvement in your co-worker’s email grammar didn’t tip you off, the drastic increase in your power bill is a hard-to-miss clue. (And if your bill hasn’t changed much yet, consider yourself lucky.)
As the massive, power-hungry data centers that power AI’s expansion come online, they’re competing for power with everyone else. That’s driving up energy bills for industry and consumers alike, while testing the limits of US energy production capacity and stressing an aging power grid.
Silicon Valley has a solution: nuclear energy. Big Tech is investing heavily in the long-shunned (in the US, at least) energy source to power its AI moment, mostly in the form of so-called small nuclear reactors (SMRs), the next-gen version of nuclear tech that can (theoretically) be mass-produced and strategically deployed. (For the uninitiated, it might be helpful to think of SMRs as gas generators on radioactive steroids.) Now, a nuclear boom is directly downstream from the AI boom: According to a recent Bloomberg Intelligence report, soaring power demand from AI will spur $350 billion in nuclear spending in the US by 2050.
The US government, which views dominance in the AI sphere as crucial to continued economic and geopolitical dominance around the globe, is entirely on board. In a rare instance of bipartisan consensus, both the current and previous administrations have moved fast to cut red tape, overhaul oversight processes, and pour capital into the resurgent nuclear industry.
“We’re in a very serious bind. We’ve already tapped out traditional oil and gas technologies. There’s an eight-, nine-year queue for diesel generators, the most expensive form of energy, and now also gas turbines,” Kevin Kong, founder and CEO of AI-driven nuclear compliance platform Everstar, told The Daily Upside. “Renewables are not dense enough … Data centers run 24/7, and are extremely power-dense. And so the only technology that’s left that was overlooked and under-invested in is nuclear.”
In other words, if we’re going to have an AI revolution, we’ll need plenty of nukes. But will the industry insulate Americans from rising energy bills? Maybe.
The Troubling Data on Data Centers
For years, experts had estimated energy demand growth in the years and decades to come based on banal drivers such as population growth, economic expansion and development of emerging economies, as well as the electrification of everything, including major industries like manufacturing and transportation. It would be predictable and hence manageable, they believed.
Then came ChatGPT. Now? Most estimates predict that global energy demand will nearly double by 2050. A recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that over 50% of that growth will be driven by AI expansion. For example, a ChatGPT query requires roughly 10 times the energy, on average, needed for a Google search. To put it in even starker perspective, the IEA estimates that a typical AI-focused data center consumes as much electricity as 100,000 homes, while the largest such data centers consume 20 times that amount.
According to a recent Goldman Sachs report, data center power demand is expected to increase 160% by 2030 alone, and meeting 60% of that demand will require new energy generation capacity. Meanwhile, a report produced by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and published by the Department of Energy estimates that data centers will consume more than 12% of total US electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.
The triple-digit growth figures are already having a triple-digit impact on those suddenly, and sometimes unwillingly, competing with data centers for electricity. According to a recent Bloomberg analysis of energy data, monthly electricity costs in areas near data centers are now 267% higher than just five years ago, at the dawn of the AI age (that compares with a cumulative overall inflation rate of about 25%).
“Without mitigation, the data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans,” said David Crane, chief executive officer of Generate Capital.
Sweet Relief? The good news is that mitigation is coming. That $350 billion spending boom estimated by Bloomberg is also projected to increase the US’s nuclear energy output by 63%. And a rise in nuclear energy production has been proven to lower energy costs. Consider France, where a recent nuclear boom means the energy source now accounts for roughly 67% of total electricity supply, according to the 2025 World Nuclear Industry Status Report (that compares with just under 20% in the US). The chain reaction? Average day-ahead power prices fell to the lowest levels for the month of September in two decades in Epex Spot SE auctions. A similar story can be seen in South Korea, where nuclear energy now accounts for more than 30% of power.
“About 60% of the grid should be coming from nuclear; replace all natural gas and coal with nuclear. That’s the goal: Make the United States look like France,” Kong said.
Which brings us to the bad news. That 63% increase isn’t expected to be achieved until … 2050. In other words, mitigation is still years away. And the worse news: Relative to peers, the US is really, really bad at developing and deploying nuclear energy. When the Plant Vogtle nuclear power plant’s third reactor came online in 2023 in Burke County, Georgia, it marked the first from-scratch new nuclear reactor in the US in more than three decades. Infamously, the project came in seven years over schedule and some $17 billion over budget, or more than double initial budget projections, with the delays driving Westinghouse Electric into bankruptcy.
There are currently no nuclear reactors under construction in the US, per the Industry Status Report, putting it well behind peer nations. China, for instance, has only 59 reactors online (compared with 94 in the US), but has 33 more under construction. That’s roughly half of all nuclear reactors being built around the globe. By 2030, according to Goldman Sachs, the nation will top the US as the world’s leading nuclear energy producer.
In more grim news for Washington, the US has failed, since its Cold War-era nuclear heyday, to generate the next generation of nuclear experts. It produced just 929 graduates in nuclear engineering in 2022, down 20% from a peak in 2015. Per Goldman Sachs, the US will need to triple its US-based nuclear workforce to meet demand by 2050 (Kong says AI platforms like Everstar can help fill the knowledge gaps in the meantime).
Some more good news: SMRs, theoretically, will be much quicker to build and deploy than giant, Vogtle-style reactors.
“It takes 10 years, in the best case, to build that gigawatt-scale plant,” Matt Loszak, co-founder and CEO of SMR start-up Aalo Atomics, told The Daily Upside. “But if you mass manufacture [SMRs] in a factory, and you do more in parallel, you can actually deploy [SMRs] in a matter of a year or two instead of 10 years.”
Bipartisan consensus on cutting red tape for nuclear projects may speed up the process, too. Loszak says Aalo, which recently scored a $100 million Series B funding round and is one of 10 companies participating in the Department of Energy’s test reactor program, has benefited from regulatory frameworks streamlined by both the Trump and Biden administrations. That means actual deployment can come by the start of the next decade.
“The whole goal here is by 2030 to have a factory set up that can actually output at least a gigawatt per year of capacity,” Loszak says. (A single Aalo “Pod” SMR generates 50 megawatts of capacity; there are 1,000 megawatts in a gigawatt.)
One Bubble After Another: While SMRs are likely to deliver consistent energy supplies to massive data centers, a valuable proposition in its own right, not everyone is convinced it will be delivered cheaply.
According to data from Wood Mackenzie recently seen by the Financial Times, the “levelised cost of energy” for SMRs, or the cost for power that should be charged for the project to break even, will be around $182 per megawatt hour in 2030. That compares to $133 per megawatt-hour from traditional nuclear power plants, such as Vogtle, $126 for natural gas, and even less for wind and solar.
“SMRs are going to help with the hyperscalers,” who will be willing to pay a premium for 24/7 access to behind-the-meter energy, Kong said. But that might result in a bottleneck and misallocation of time, energy and resources toward SMRs rather than the type of large-scale, grid-changing power plants that have helped lower energy costs in countries around the world.
“There’s a time and place for SMRs,” Kong said. “But if we say we want a cleaner form of energy for hospitals, for you and me every day, for turning on the kettle and for electric vehicles that are becoming more and more prevalent, then it really has to come from the gigawatt-class reactors.”"

Instead, learn how to bring artificial intelligence (AI) to regular businesses that have no clue what they’re doing.
The billionaire investor and former “Shark Tank” star explained his reasoning during a recent livestream interview. Cuban thinks the real opportunity isn’t at big tech companies, but at the millions of small and medium-sized businesses that desperately need AI help but don’t know where to start.

Cuban wants college students to become “AI integrators.” These are people who can walk into any company and figure out exactly how artificial intelligence can improve their operations.
“Every single company needs professionals with AI implementation skills,” Cuban said during the TBPN interview. The problem is that most companies have no idea how to actually use AI in their day-to-day work.
Cuban pointed out that there are 33 million companies in America, but only a tiny fraction have dedicated AI budgets or keep AI experts on staff. Yet all of these businesses will need to adapt to survive in an AI-driven economy.

Why This Reminds Cuban of His Own Success Story
The comparison Cuban made to his early career is telling. When he was 24 years old, he walked into companies that had never seen a personal computer and explained how the technology could transform their business.
“I was walking into companies who had never seen a PC before in their lives and explaining to them the value,” Cuban said. He would meet with business owners and create customized plans showing exactly how computers could solve their specific problems.
That experience taught Cuban something important: There’s massive money to be made by bringing new technology to businesses that don’t understand it yet. He thinks AI represents the same kind of opportunity that personal computers did in the 1980s.
What Students Should Actually Learn
Cuban got specific about what skills matter most. He wants students spending their senior year “learning the difference between Sora and Veo” (two popular AI video-generation tools) and figuring out how to customize AI models for different business needs.
The key is understanding how AI works in practice, not just in theory. Students who master these integration skills will be able to walk into any business and immediately spot clear opportunities where AI could make a meaningful difference."

This includes Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, which are together known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" There are others now part of the trillion-dollar club, but these are among the more notable names.
The list may get even bigger in the years ahead, as many businesses are growing and benefiting from feverish spending on artificial intelligence (AI). There's one unstoppable company that's doing well due to that trend, and which looks set to join the club in the near future: Oracle (ORCL 1.19%). Here's why it may not be too late to invest in this promising tech stock.
Oracle has become a key player in the AI boom
For years, Oracle has been known as a big name in databases and providing companies with the critical backend services and infrastructure they need to manage all their data. It still serves that purpose today, plus it also offers key products and services, which help its customers manage AI workloads.
Its new Oracle AI World, for instance, will allow its customers to use large language models to analyze existing databases. The big advantage with Oracle is that unlike many big tech companies, it's agnostic to the whole chatbot market; it isn't developing one of its own, and it's there to simply provide customers with the AI-powered products and services they need. It also has AI agents that can help to automate tasks and add efficiency.
And its efforts have been paying off. Last month, the company reported its latest quarterly results (for the period ending Aug. 31) and demand remains robust, with CEO Safra Catz noting that it ""signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1."" It expects even more large contracts to be signed in the future. And its contract backlog has skyrocketed by 359% year over year, totaling $455 billion.
Oracle's quarterly revenue totaled $14.9 billion and rose 12% year over year. Its cloud segment led the way, as sales in that business unit came in at $7.2 billion and were up by 28%.
The company also generates terrific profit margins, as its net income during the period was $2.9 billion, which is comparable to what it generated in the prior-year period. The bottom line would have been larger, however, if not for an increase in restructuring expenses, as the company has been reducing its workforce in an effort to improve efficiency.
Why a $1 trillion valuation may be just an inevitability at this point
Oracle's market cap as of the end of Monday was around $820 billion. For it to hit a $1 trillion valuation, it would need to rise by another 22% from that. In just the past year, its shares have soared more than 70%. And with tech companies continuing to invest heavily into AI, Oracle looks poised to benefit from those growth opportunities.
It may not happen soon, and it could take a couple of years, as the stock has already risen so fast. It's currently trading around its all-time highs, and its price-to-earnings multiple of 66 doesn't look cheap at all. As a result, growth investors may be thinking twice about the stock, and that could lead to limited gains, at least in the short term.
But with so much growth still out there, it may truly be an inevitability before Oracle reaches $1 trillion. According to analysts from the MarketsandMarkets, the global cloud AI market is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.4% until 2029. It's a staggering level of growth, with Oracle right in the middle of it all.
Oracle's still a good buy today
Although you may be tempted to pass on Oracle's stock because its valuation is a bit rich, over the long term, there's still much more runway for it to become more valuable. The important role it plays in tech makes it a solid investment, particularly due to its close relationship with other tech giants.
Oracle's solid fundamentals and AI-powered growth makes it a great investment to add to your portfolio today, especially if you're looking for an AI stock that still has a lot of upside left."

The company has dispelled fears that artificial intelligence (AI) is a threat, while its biggest risk around its antitrust case is now behind it. Meanwhile, it probably has one of the best long-term growth setups of any stock out there.
Alphabet's dominance starts with search. Google remains the front door to the internet for billions of people, and that's not changing anytime soon due to the huge distribution advantage the company has. It controls both the world's leading smartphone operating system and web browser in Android and Chrome, respectively, while its search revenue-sharing deal with Apple makes it the default search engine for Safari.
Meanwhile, Alphabet is now incorporating AI throughout Google to make its offering even stronger and help drive query growth. With new features like Lens and Circle to Search, Alphabet has found new ways to help people search instead of just typing in text. This is driving more queries, many of which have a shopping intent that feeds into its massive ad network. Meanwhile, AI Overviews and its new AI Mode, which lets users toggle between traditional results and chatbot-style answers, are also driving more engagement.
Google's data advantage also shouldn't be underestimated. The company has decades of user data, as well as videos through YouTube, that it can use to make its Gemini AI models better. Alphabet's strength in multimodal AI is another area of strength that gets overlooked. The Gemini chatbot app has been taking off, largely due to Nano Banana, its newest AI image editor and creator, while Google Veo 3 is a video AI leader.
Alphabet has also spent decades creating one of the most wide-reaching ad networks on the planet. It can handle anything from global campaigns to local merchants. Creating great search and AI products is just half the battle; you need to be able to monetize them, and Alphabet's unmatched ad network puts it light-years ahead of any emerging competition.
To the clouds and beyond
While search is Alphabet's biggest business, it is far from a one-horse pony. Cloud computing has become the company's fastest-growing business. Last quarter, Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% to $13.6 billion, while operating income more than doubled to $2.8 billion. Demand is so strong that Alphabet raised its 2025 capital expenditure (capex) budget by $10 billion to $85 billion to expand data center capacity. Unlike many peers, Google Cloud is vertically integrated from top to bottom. Google is the only company with its own world-class AI model and its own custom chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), that it's using at scale. Those TPUs provide both cost and performance advantages, especially as workloads shift toward inference rather than training.
Alphabet is also taking AI deeper into the enterprise with its new Gemini Enterprise and Gemini Business subscriptions. These offerings let companies build and deploy AI agents without writing code. The launch includes pre-built agents and access to partner-built ones, all backed by enterprise-grade security features like Model Armor. This positions Google to compete directly with Microsoft and OpenAI for corporate AI spending, and early adopters such as Gap and Virgin Voyages are already reporting measurable productivity gains.
Behind all this, Google Cloud benefits from technology that's hard to replicate. It developed Kubernetes, which is now the standard for containerized apps, and it owns one of the largest private fiber networks in the world, delivering low-latency performance on a global scale. Its pending acquisition of Wiz, meanwhile, will add a best-in-class cloud security platform. Google Cloud may be the third-largest cloud provider by market share, but its technology stack and integration with Gemini give it a differentiated position that could drive outsize growth over the next decade.
In addition to cloud computing, Alphabet also has some promising emerging bets. The one furthest along is Alphabet's robotaxi unit Waymo, which is already operating in multiple U.S. cities and expanding rapidly. If it can lower costs, it could eventually become a huge profit driver for the company. The company's quantum computing team, meanwhile, is also making real progress with its Willow chip, which has shown reduced error rates as it scales.
A cheap stock with big growth ahead
Despite all this, Alphabet's valuation still looks attractive. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 22.5 times projected 2026 earnings, which is a clear discount to its mega-cap AI peers. So, despite the rally in the stock this year, it still is not fully getting the respect it deserves.
Given its valuation, wide moat, growth prospects, and the optionality of its emerging bets in robotaxis and quantum computing, Alphabet is the one stock I'd own if I could only own one stock."

Since then, it's been joined by other companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Of course, the list also includes the current market-cap leader, Nvidia.
It's becoming increasingly normal for a new company to join the $1 trillion club. But it remains an impressive feat nevertheless. At this pace, these tech titans could be joined by brick-and-mortar giant Walmart (WMT 1.56%) in 2026.
Over the past 15 years, Walmart stock has risen by 470%. The company has also been a steady dividend payer over this time. For investors who bought, held, and reinvested the dividends along the way, returns were even better with a 680% gain.
Stocks that post strong long-term gains, as Walmart stock has, often decide to undergo stock splits, bringing the price per share down due to a higher number of shares overall. Walmart has done this many times in its history, including a 3-for-1 stock split in 2024.
As of this writing, Walmart has a market cap of $820 billion. Therefore, to reach $1 trillion in 2026, it would need to appreciate by about 22% in less than 15 months. Is this really possible? It's not a sure thing, but it may be easier than some investors think.
How Walmart can reach $1 trillion
At a high level, stocks tend to go up when profit potential goes up. Perhaps profit potential goes up because a business is about to reach a new scale thanks to new locations or an acquisition. Or perhaps profit potential goes up because management is about to unlock some operating leverage. But either way, for Walmart stock to go up another 22%, one would expect improvement to its operating income over the next year or so.
Walmart is known for selling millions of products. But retail sales aren't driving growth for the company's operating income. In the earnings call to discuss financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2026, CFO John Rainey said: ""Contributions to operating income are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of interrelated drivers, including improved e-commerce, economics, and business mix, most notably from higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees.""
Rainey attributes much of Walmart's operating income growth to e-commerce, an area of the business that's absolutely booming. In Q2, e-commerce revenue was up a strong 25% year over year globally, far outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of about 5%. If e-commerce continues to boom in 2026, it could drive operating income, and the stock price, higher.
Walmart's e-commerce growth provides it with another opportunity: Digital advertising. The company has troves of consumer shopping data and strong relationships with top consumer brands. With more customers transacting digitally, it gives the retailer an opportunity to generate high-margin digital advertising revenue.
Additionally, Walmart recently completed its acquisition of connected-TV company Vizio. This is another channel with which the company can leverage its data and scale to advertise to consumers, which again drives operating income growth.
For what it's worth, Walmart's Q2 advertising revenue was up 46%. Granted, some of the growth was inorganic from the recent addition of Vizio. But the company is growing this revenue stream nonetheless.
In other words, Walmart's fastest-growing revenue streams also happen to be the ones that are driving growth in operating profit. Assuming these trends continue, which I do, Walmart's profits should continue to climb in 2026, providing a boost for the stock price.
To be clear, Walmart might not grow enough over the next 15 months to warrant a $1 trillion valuation before the end of 2026. But directionally, the business appears to be headed for the trillion-dollar club. It doesn't seem to be a matter of if, but rather of when."

Plus, Google announced a new AI-for-business platform.
That doesn’t mean it’s going to be smooth sailing for big organizations using AI. In fact, the timing of the Deloitte announcement was a bit awkward, coming on the same day the Australia Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the professional services and consulting firm would have to pay a refund for delivering a report to the department with what appeared to be a number of AI-generated hallucinations.
On the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec, Sean O’Kane, and I discussed the latest AI headlines, contrasting it with last week’s news about the new Sora app. While AI companies may eventually make real money from consumer social networking apps, enterprise deals offer a more immediate path to significant revenue.
You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.
Anthony: I think this actually ties back to our discussion last week about some of these GenAI social networks. We were framing that as potentially a way that these AI companies could eventually make money, which I definitely think is the case, but there’s a long road to get there. And the enterprise, sometimes people don’t find it quite as interesting or sexy as consumer, [but] it’s actually where the real money is.
Maybe Sora is how OpenAI will make money five years from now, but this is how these companies are going to make money now.
And the Deloitte [news] was especially striking. Sometimes you can feel like a little bit of a broken record to just point out how these models [aren’t always] totally ready for prime time, but I find it encouraging that the Australian government actually pushed back and said, no, you cannot do this.
It’s not necessarily that no one should ever use AI in the creation of these kinds of reports, although I think you could make that argument. But if you’re going to do it, you actually have to be responsible for the outputs. You have to actually go through and make sure that the information being cited is real. You can’t feed it into a model and just [say] “All right, my job is done, that’ll be however many billable hours.” I think anyone who does that should be embarrassed and fined.
Kirsten: Absolutely. Sean, Zendesk also had an announcement this week, and they’re really creating these tools that are going to handle pretty much all of customer service, basically removing the human from that process. In your everyday [life], how you go about the world or how automakers deal with service, for instance, are you starting to see that kind of [automation] creep in?"

For agents to be truly autonomous they need to have access to resources and self-custody their assets: programmable, permissionless, and composable blockchains are the ideal substrate for agents to do so, Olas’ David Minarsch argues.
AI agents, software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users, are proliferating. Think of them as digital assistants that can make decisions and take actions towards goals you set without needing step-by-step instructions — from GPT-powered calendar managers to trading bots, the number of use cases is expanding rapidly. As their role expands across the economy, we have to build the right infrastructure that will allow these agents to communicate, collaborate and trade with one another in an open marketplace.
Big tech players like Google and AWS are building early marketplaces and commerce protocols, but that raises the question: will they aim to extract massive rents through walled gardens once more? Agents’ capabilities are clearly rising, almost daily, with the arrival of new models and architectures. What’s at risk is whether these agents will be truly autonomous.
Autonomous agents are valuable because they unlock a novel user experience: a shift from software as passive or reactive tools to active and even proactive partners. Instead of waiting for instructions, they can anticipate needs, adapt to changing conditions, and coordinate with other systems in real time, without the user’s constant input or presence. This autonomy in decision-making makes them uniquely suited for a world where speed and complexity outpace human decision-making.
Naturally, some worry about what greater decision-making autonomy means for work and accountability — but I see it as an opportunity. When agents handle repetitive, time-intensive tasks and parallelize what previously had to be done in sequence, they expand our productive capacity as humans — freeing people to engage in work that demands creativity, judgment, composition and meaningful connection. This isn’t make-believe, humanity has been there before: the arrival of corporations allowed entrepreneurs to create entirely new products and levels of wealth previously unthought of. AI agents have the potential to bring that capability to everyone.
On the intelligence side, truly autonomous decision-making requires AI agent infrastructure that is open source and transparent. OpenAI’s recent OSS release is a good step. Chinese labs, such as DeepSeek (DeepSeek), Moonshot AI (Kimi K2) and Alibaba (Qwen 3), have moved even quicker.
However, autonomy is not purely tied to intelligence and decision making. Without resources, an AI agent has little means to enact change in the real world. Hence, for agents to be truly autonomous they need to have access to resources and self-custody their assets. Programmable, permissionless, and composable blockchains are the ideal substrate for agents to do so.
Picture two scenarios. One where AI agents operate within a Web 2 platform like AWS or Google. They exist within the limited parameters set by these platforms in what is essentially a closed and permissioned environment. Now imagine a decentralized marketplace that spans many blockchain ecosystems. Developers can compose different sets of environments and parameters, therefore, the scope available to AI agents to operate is unlimited, accessible globally, and can evolve over time. One scenario looks like a toy idea of a marketplace, and the other is an actual global economy.
In other words, to truly scale not just AI agent adoption, but agent-to-agent commerce, we need rails that only blockchains can offer.
The Limits of Centralized Marketplaces
AWS recently announced an agent-to-agent marketplace aimed at addressing the growing demand for ready-made agents. But their approach inherits the same inefficiencies and limitations that have long plagued siloed systems. Agents must wait for human verification, rely on closed APIs and operate in environments where transparency is optional, if it exists at all.
To act autonomously and at scale, agents can’t be boxed into closed ecosystems that restrict functionality, pose platform risks, impose opaque fees, or make it impossible to verify what actions were taken and why.
Decentralization Scales Agent Systems
An open ecosystem allows for agents to act on behalf of users, coordinate with other agents, and operate across services without permissioned barriers.
Blockchains already offer the key tools needed. Smart contracts allow agents to perform tasks automatically, with rules embedded in code, while stablecoins and tokens enable instant, global value transfers without payment friction. Smart accounts, which are programmable blockchain wallets like Safe, allow users to restrict agents in their activity and scope (via guards). For instance, an agent may only be allowed to use whitelisted protocols. These tools allow AI agents not only to behave expansively but also to be contained within risk parameters defined by the end user. For example, this could be setting spending limits, requiring multi-signatures for approvals, or restricting agents to whitelisted protocols.
Blockchain also provides the transparency needed so users can audit agent decisions, even when they aren’t directly involved. At the same time, this doesn’t mean that all agent-to-agent interactions need to happen onchain. E.g. AI agents can use offchain APIs with access constraints defined and payments executed onchain.
In short, decentralized infrastructure gives agents the tools to operate more freely and efficiently than closed systems allow.
It’s Already Happening Onchain
While centralized players are still refining their agent strategies, blockchain is already enabling early forms of agent-to-agent interaction. Onchain agents are already exhibiting more advanced behavior like purchasing predictions and data from other agents. And as more open frameworks emerge, developers are building agents that can access services, make payments, and even subscribe to other agents - all without human involvement.
Protocols are already implementing the next step: monetization. With open marketplaces, people and businesses are able to rent agents, earn from specialized ones, and build new services that plug directly into this agent economy. Customisation of payment models such as subscription, one-off payments, or bundled packages will also be key in facilitating different user needs. This will unlock an entirely new model of economic participation.
Why This Distinction Matters
Without open systems, fragmentation breaks the promise of seamless AI support. An agent can easily bring tasks to completion if it stays within an individual ecosystem, like coordinating between different Google apps. However, where third-party platforms are necessary (across social, travel, finance, etc), an open onchain marketplace will allow agents to programmatically acquire the various services and goods they need to complete a user’s request.
Decentralized systems avoid these limitations. Users can own, modify, and deploy agents tailored to their needs without relying on vendor-controlled environments.
We’ve already seen this work in DeFi, with DeFi legos. Bots automate lending strategies, manage positions, and rebalance portfolios, sometimes better than any human could. Now, that same approach is being applied as “agent legos” across sectors including logistics, gaming, customer support, and more.
The Path Forward
The agent economy is growing fast. What we build now will shape how it functions and for whom it works. If we rely solely on centralized systems, we risk creating another generation of AI tools that feel useful but ultimately serve the platform, not the person.
Blockchain changes that. It enables systems where agents act on your behalf, earn on your ideas, and plug into a broader, open marketplace.
If we want agents that collaborate, transact, and evolve without constraint, then the future of agent-to-agent marketplaces must live onchain.

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is the largest producer of carbon-free energy in the US, with over 32,400 MW of generating capacity consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric assets.
Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is the largest producer of nuclear energy in the US by a wide margin, over three times more than its closest competitor. The company’s business model generates strong, stable cash flows through regulated rate structures and long-term power purchase agreements and it boasts hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google among its key customers. It was reported this summer that the utility has also struck a deal with Meta to keep one of its reactors in Illinois operating for 20 years.
Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) made headlines earlier this year when it announced the acquisition of Calpine, turning the company into the largest independent power provider in the country. The blockbuster deal, which is expected to close in Q4 2025, is expected to boost CEG’s EPS by more than 20% next year.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-11T14:32:51,CEO: AI and defense demand are remaking the space economy,The space economy is experiencing a kind of growth in 2025 that looks nothing like the speculative frenzy of 2021 — and that's exactly why it matters.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=15e3a0cd644f61b03f9dea71aff866b7d4444267146c36ae9b22fd4bedf898a5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-ai-and-defense-demand-are-remaking-the-space-economy-143251288.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-ai-and-defense-demand-are-remaking-the-space-economy-143251288.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-ai-and-defense-demand-are-remaking-the-space-economy-143251288.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"The space economy is experiencing a kind of growth in 2025 that looks nothing like the speculative frenzy of 2021 — and that's exactly why it matters.
The data from Space Capital's latest Space Investment Quarterly, which has been tracking private market investment in the space economy since 2012, reveals a market that has fundamentally matured. With another $5.8 billion invested across 115 companies in Q3, this year has already surpassed 2024 in overall investment and is on track to rank among the top three funding years on record.
Perhaps more importantly, the $49 billion invested over the trailing 12 months represents a decisive shift in where capital is flowing. Instead of a return to the SPAC-era boom, the space economy is experiencing sustainable growth driven by defense demand, artificial intelligence breakthroughs, and genuine commercial traction.
The center of gravity has shifted from speculative narratives to funded, dual-use capability, and investors are backing companies with customers, contracts, and clear profitability paths.
Defense demand is the new growth engine
The most significant trend reshaping the space investment landscape is the pivot toward national security applications.
The White House has signaled a clear shift away from civil space priorities while leaning aggressively into defense, and the numbers bear this out. The Space Force could see its budget reach $40 billion in fiscal year 2026 — a staggering 40% year-over-year increase — driven by the urgent need for advanced platforms and resilient space architectures.
This policy backdrop has turbocharged investment in Golden Dome solutions, from satellite manufacturing to defense-centric capabilities designed to enhance tracking, resilience, and space domain awareness.
Space infrastructure investment reached a five-quarter high of $4.4 billion in Q3, fueled by a breakout year in US satellite manufacturing and record activity in the Chinese launch sector.
Notably, venture capital firms drove 86% of investment activity in Q3, demonstrating that this isn't just government contracting; it’s a durable dual-use market blending commercial and defense demand.
The AI revolution reaches orbit
While defense spending dominates headlines, the integration of artificial intelligence with space-based data is quietly revolutionizing the applications layer of the space economy.
Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) investment has surged from $1 billion in 2020 to a record $21.6 billion as of Q3 2025, and Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) launch of AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF) in the quarter marked a watershed moment."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-11T13:32:00,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" or the Entire S&P 500: What's the Better Option for Growth Investors?","The big names in tech have been doing well of late, but a slowdown could be overdue.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4b9d139ec826a38981202cad07daf0304bc49c0262367d5772fe0c51a1b632a1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,fool.com,200.0,,"If you're thinking about investing in the stock market today, you may be wondering whether it's a better idea to go with the big names in the ""Magnificent Seven"" or to simply hold a position in the entire S&P 500.
The Magnificent Seven refers to some of the most prominent growth stocks in the world: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Investing in these companies has yielded strong returns for investors over the years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 makes for a more balanced investment overall, as it gives investors broader exposure to the market while still growing over the long term. By having a position in the 500 best stocks rather than just the top seven, there's much more diversification.
Which option should you go with today, if your focus is on long-term growth?
The Magnificent Seven are magnificent, but they could be overdue for a decline
One way you can gain exposure to the Magnificent Seven is by investing in the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS 0.54%). The fund invests in just the Magnificent Seven and, thus, can be an easier option than investing in each stock individually. Since its launch in April 2023, the fund has soundly outperformed the S&P 500, rising by more than 165% while the broader index has achieved gains of around 64%.
Many of the Magnificent Seven have benefited from an uptick in demand due to artificial intelligence (AI) and have been investing heavily in next-gen technologies. However, many investors worry that a bubble has already formed around AI stocks and that spending could slow down, especially if there's a recession on the horizon. If that happens, then these stocks could be susceptible to significant declines.
While these stocks have been flying high of late, back in 2022, when the market was in turmoil due to rising inflation and as investor sentiment was souring on growth stocks, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks fell by more than 26%. The worst-performing stocks were Meta and Tesla, which lost around 65% of their value. That year, the S&P 500 also fell, but at 19%, it was a more modest decline.
The S&P 500 is more diverse, but that doesn't mean it's risk-free
If you want to have exposure to the S&P 500, you can accomplish that by investing in an S&P 500 index fund, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 0.30%). Its low expense ratio of 0.09% makes it a low-cost, no-nonsense way of tracking the S&P 500. Its focus is to simply mirror the index, and it does a great job of that.
The problem, however, is that while the S&P 500 will give you exposure to more stocks than just the seven best stocks in the world, how those leading stocks do will still have a significant impact on the overall stock market. And the Magnificent Seven, because they are so valuable, are also among the SPDR ETF's largest holdings.
But even if you were to go with a more balanced exchange-traded fund, such as the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which has an equal position in all S&P 500 stocks, that may only offer modest protection from a wide-scale sell-off. In 2022, the ETF declined by 13%.
You're always going to face some risk when investing in the stock market, especially if your focus is on growth stocks, which can be particularly volatile.
What's the better strategy for growth investors?
If your priority is growth, then going with the Magnificent Seven can still be the best option moving forward. These stocks will undoubtedly have bad years, but that's the risk that comes with growth stocks. However, given their dominance in tech and AI, the Magnificent Seven still have the potential to vastly outperform the S&P 500 in the long run, and their gains are likely to far outweigh their losses."

What Is Figma's Investment Narrative?
To believe in Figma as a long-term investment, I think you need to buy into the idea that AI integration can solidify its place as a leader in collaborative design. The recent Google Cloud partnership, coming right after a surge in attention from OpenAI’s ChatGPT integration, gives a compelling lift to near-term catalysts. Real-time AI-powered editing and a 50% latency cut for image generation could drive user engagement and cement Figma’s software in critical design workflows for large enterprise clients. However, the speed and scale of the stock’s bounce signal that expectations may be running high, particularly as Figma faces an expensive valuation and guidance showing a sharp earnings decline over the next few years. The risks of potential growth slowdowns or increased competition, combined with major insider selling and short financial track record, mean ongoing volatility could be a reality, even as the story just got a lot more interesting with this latest news. But investor optimism is one thing, sustaining margin growth is another entirely.

By disrupting the cable industry, this company now sports a huge market cap of $505 billion (as of Oct. 7).
But it's smart not to forget another streaming powerhouse in Alphabet's (GOOGL 1.85%) (GOOG 1.87%) YouTube. It is estimated that this division has 2.5 billion monthly active users, showcasing its massive reach.
Netflix deservedly gets a lot of attention. But here's why YouTube could be worth more.
Netflix stock's valuation can be applied to YouTube
On Oct. 7, Netflix shares traded at a price-to-sales ratio of 12.5. Applying this multiple to YouTube's trailing-12-month ad revenue implies the Alphabet division is worth $476 billion, not far off from Netflix. But remember that the YouTube sales figure does not include money it's making from subscriptions, which are a significant revenue driver.
YouTube possesses many attractive business qualities
YouTube has a massive network effect. According to data from Nielsen, it commanded 13.1% of daily TV viewing time in the U.S. in August, much higher than Netflix. It doesn't have to pay for content up front, reducing financial risk. And people of all ages with vastly different interests can find virtually unlimited amounts of content that fits their needs.
YouTube has many advantages over Netflix. There are valid reasons the former is likely worth more on a stand-alone basis."

This concept is still in the research phase (neither generative AI nor quantum computing has achieved widespread commercial adoption), but the potential value of combining these two technologies is already attracting early movers that aim to establish themselves on the pick-and-shovel side of the opportunity.
Among those early movers, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 1.78%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 3.95%) belong on your long-term investment watch list because of their exposure to this burgeoning technology.
Alphabet
Alphabet arguably sparked the market's latest hype cycle over quantum computing in late 2024 when it debuted Willow, a state-of-the-art quantum chip that achieved major success in reducing the error rates that such chips are prone to.
While Willow is still thousands of times more likely to produce errors than a classical chip, what Alphabet has done shows that it is on track to create quantum computers suitable for practical large-scale use. Moreover, Willow performed a benchmark test computation in around five minutes that would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion years to solve.
Machines with this level of raw computational power will have commercial applications in industries like drug discovery, logistics, and materials science. But their potential synergies with generative AI could be even more exciting.
In September, Google researchers released a paper suggesting that, beyond just solving complex problems, quantum computers could also generate results on their own. In other words, they can theoretically learn from data and produce useful outputs just like a large language model (LLM), but bigger -- much bigger.
Instead of producing pictures of flying giraffes and vibe code, quantum-powered AI could map out as-yet unseen molecular structures, for example. The potential of this technology could transform the way people live and do business.
But even though Alphabet has established itself as an early leader in quantum computing, it is far from a pure play. The company's massive online search business could still face disruption as people shift from using Google to querying LLMs like ChatGPT.
Yet Alphabet also has several cash cow businesses that will allow it to pour resources into quantum computing research and other technologies. In the second quarter, its revenue rose 14% year over year to $92.4 billion, while its net income jumped 19% to $28.2 billion.
D-Wave Quantum
D-Wave Quantum is not a diversified technology behemoth like Alphabet. Instead, it is a relatively small quantum computing pure play. It's unique in the industry because it's already selling commercially available quantum computers to organizations around the world -- although this comes with some important caveats.
For starters, unlike the generalized quantum computing being developed by Google and other early movers, D-Wave is pioneering chips that use a technology called quantum annealing, which involves finding the lowest-energy solution to a particular problem. That could have huge applications in fields such as logistics (finding the most efficient routes to deliver large numbers of packages, for example).
D-Wave believes its quantum annealing technology could advance AI by helping customers build more energy-efficient, optimized workloads. It has released an open-source AI software tool designed to help developers integrate quantum processors into standard machine-learning architectures. The open-source approach could help D-Wave accelerate innovation at the intersection of AI and quantum computing while it focuses on other aspects of its business.
D-Wave continues to sell its quantum annealing technology to research institutions, and in the second quarter, its revenue surged 42% year over year to $3 million. That said, the company remains an incredibly speculative investment: Its operating losses jumped by 40% to $26.5 million in the period. Investors shouldn't expect sustained profitability from D-Wave anytime soon.
Which stock is better for you?
Alphabet and D-Wave Quantum are both early leaders in quantum computing, but that's largely where their similarities end. Alphabet is already a successful blue chip business with plenty of resources to pour into its quantum research. D-Wave is burning cash and may have to dilute existing investors by issuing more stock to stay afloat long enough to reach profitability -- assuming it ever does. While D-Wave's far smaller size gives it more potential for explosive growth if it achieves major commercial success with its technology, it is also a significantly riskier investment."

BOTHELL, WASHINGTON / ACCESS Newswire / October 10, 2025 / ReelTime Media, Inc. (OTCID:RLTR) today highlighted a striking market divergence as its stock continued to rise while many of the world's largest AI companies fell sharply. Investor confidence in ReelTime's flagship ""Reel Intelligence"" (RI) platform propelled ReelTime higher, even as global tensions and tariff anxieties triggered losses across the broader AI sector.
ReelTime's stock resilience stems from the unique independence of its RI platform. Unlike conventional AI systems that rely on specialized chips and massive data centers, RI is fundamentally chip-agnostic and globally distributed, meaning it is not tethered to any single hardware supplier, cloud cluster, or country's infrastructure. This strategic advantage has insulated ReelTime from the geopolitical headwinds currently battering its peers.
Everyone is encouraged to try RI Now for free at http://tryrinow.com/
""While others scramble to navigate chip shortages, tariffs, and political crosswinds, RI thrives because it lives throughout the connected world,"" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of ReelTime Media. ""RI doesn't rely on a single chipset or server farm. It was built to operate everywhere, all at once, making it resilient where others are vulnerable.""
Industry analysts have taken note of RI's unconventional design and performance. In an update earlier this year, experts described RI as ""smarter, more capable, higher quality, more efficient, and significantly more environmentally friendly"" than any other AI on the market. Since its public launch in March, RI has surpassed industry-leading AI systems across multiple domains, from language fluency to image generation, music composition, and even 4K video creation, all while using only a fraction of the computing resources required by traditional models. These breakthroughs, achieved without the massive server farms or costly GPU clusters of rival platforms, reinforce why investors see ReelTime's technology as fundamentally different. Today's market action underscores that RI's hardware-agnostic, globally distributed approach is proving its value, as ReelTime extends its rally in the face of challenges that sent many big-tech AI stocks sinking.
Why Reel Intelligence (RI) Is Superior to Traditional AI Platforms
-
All-in-One Creativity: RI handles an array of tasks that typically require multiple AI tools, from natively generating 4K cinematic video and photorealistic images to composing Grammy-eligible music with vocals and even writing or debugging software code. This comprehensive capability outstrips siloed platforms that specialize in only text, images or code, positioning RI as a one-stop creative intelligence solution.
-
Self-Learning & Adaptive: RI continuously improves itself via proprietary real-time feedback loops, allowing it to evolve faster than competing models that wait for manual retraining. In practical terms, RI gets smarter and faster with each interaction, whereas traditional AIs remain static between big updates. This adaptive learning gives RI a growing performance edge over time.
-
Independent of Data Centers: Dubbed the ""greenest AI on Earth,"" RI runs without energy-draining centralized servers. Its lightweight, distributed architecture leverages existing connected devices for processing power instead of power-hungry data centers. By eliminating bulky server farms, RI dramatically reduces infrastructure costs and carbon footprint, all while delivering high-end AI functionality to users.
-
Globally Distributed Power: Rather than hinging on any single chipset or cloud facility, RI scales across a worldwide network of nodes, dynamically allocating work around the globe for maximum efficiency.

The headline-grabbing designer debuts this past season — from Matthieu Blazy at Chanel to Demna at Gucci — are just a sign of how powerful a storm is passing through.
There’s also the continued slide of the American department store, the near-complete digitization of marketing, President Donald Trump’s trade war with the world, the after-effects of the pandemic, the tech dominance of a few large players like Meta and Google, and so on and so forth.
The industry is just different today, even from only seven or eight years ago.

And as the changes started to pile up, the old business models stopped working or stopped working well enough to avoid some kind of a big transformation project.
The numbers just aren’t adding up the same way.
Antony Karabus, a longtime strategic adviser to retailers, gave a back-of-the-envelope accounting of how the costs of all the retail must-haves have changed since 2017 or 2018.
- “In retail, IT was somewhere between 1.5 percent and 2 percent of sales,” Karabus said. “Now it is anywhere from 3 percent to 5 percent-plus.
- “Marketing has gone from under 2 percent to somewhere between 3 percent and 5 percent of sales, which is massive,” he said. “Today, the cost of digital technology, digital marketing is dominated by Amazon, Facebook, Instagram and Google.”
- Logistics costs have “exploded” from a range of 3 percent to 4 percent of sales to anywhere from 5 percent to 10 percent as the industry seeks to keep up with Amazon’s free shipping and returns for Prime members.
Taken together, that’s a 5- to 10-point swing in costs that has brought the respectable 10 percent or 12 percent EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin down into the doldrums of the midsingle digits.
“It’s getting a lot harder to make money,” Karabus said. “And whenever you think you’ve got a really strong position, it’s not guaranteed. The great example is what’s happening with Lululemon right now with Alo and even Costco at the other end of the spectrum getting stronger and stronger. [Lululemon was] considered to have had a strong moat around their business. You see it even with folks like that.”
Fashion has always been competitive and brands have had to push to keep improving. But getting just that much sharper might not be enough.
“If you continue to incrementally get better, you are falling further behind Amazon, Costco and Walmart, because they have more wherewithal to leapfrog further,” Karabus said.
And even the very big have proven to be able to be agile, too, with Walmart standing as Exhibit 1, as it seems to be successfully retooling to meet the competitive threat of Amazon.
Since that divide between the very big and everyone else in retail is not a new thing, the giants have already taken big steps ahead.
Investment banker David Shiffman, head of consumer retail at Solomon Partners, said: “Of the top 150 publicly traded retailers, 82 cents of every revenue dollar goes to the top 20. The bigger you are, you have greater scale, you enjoy lower cost of capital, you have a stronger balance sheet, you have the ability to reinvest more.”
Business is draining away to the extremes.
“Where has market share gone? Luxury players selling to U.S. consumers and fast-fashion players — Zara and H&M — have done fantastically well. Off-price has taken enormous share,” Shiffman said.
“What’s left are the lifestyle brands that are predominantly the specialty retailers that have been around for decades, that are very mature, have large store bases, have large DTC businesses that now are lower margin businesses,” he said. “The market doesn’t ascribe high values to them. The middle has gotten hollowed out.”
This all goes a long way to explaining fashion’s curiously active deal market, which was supercharged instead of shut down when Trump again ratcheted up tariffs on U.S. imports.
Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. snatched up Foot Locker Inc. in a $2.4 billion deal. Prada is buying Versace from the struggling Capri Holdings. Authentic Brands Group is taking Guess Inc. private and bought Dockers from Levi Strauss & Co. Bluestar Alliance is buying Dickies from VF Corp.
At the other end of the retail market, Saks Global is shopping a stake in Bergdorf Goodman and The Webster sold a majority position to Frasers Group.
Shiffman is bullish that there’s more activity ahead for the deal market as companies come to grips with the change that’s still to come in retail.
“When you have black swan events, hundred-year floods, they’re supposed to happen infrequently. The reality is, in retail, they’re happening annually,” he said.
“Those who are miscapitalized — either undercapitalized or over-leveraged — are going to have to remedy balance sheet-types of challenges. You’re going to see more large-cap multibrand players continue to prune their portfolios. You are going to see a growing appetite by brand management companies to deploy more capital and buy more businesses and buy businesses of size and scale.”
That leaves the giants playing in another league entirely, the rare unique companies starting up their growth curve, everybody else looking for traction and the brand management crew, which at the very least has a clear vision for the future.
“The predominant portion of the companies that are for sale today are distressed,” said Heath Golden, chief executive officer of Marquee Brands, which owns the intellectual property of Martha Stewart, Ben Sherman, Anti Social Social Club, Body Glove and many more.
“Either it’s a healthy brand within a distressed company or a distressed company,” Golden said. “Liquidity can be challenging and that’s causing people to seek buyers.
“Then there’s other companies maybe that aren’t yet distressed, but in this environment with the challenges that are happening out in the sourcing world, largely tariff driven, there’s companies that are just struggling to see where the growth comes from — so trying to sell before anything turns too bad on them. The brand management companies have an advantage in that situation because our model helps to solve for those things.”
And that’s really what everybody’s looking for — a solution for an uncertain future.

Britain's Competition and Markets Authority on Friday formally designated Alphabet-owned Google (GOOGL, Financials) as holding strategic market status in online search, activating new powers that allow regulators to intervene in how the company operates its core search services.
The decision marks the first use of the UK's expanded digital markets regime aimed at addressing the dominance of major technology firms. The CMA said the designation is not a finding of misconduct but allows it to pursue proportionate, targeted actions to foster competition in digital markets.
The firm said that Google has more than 90% of the search market in the UK. With these additional powers, the CMA can make companies modify how they do business or fine them if they don't. Potential interventions could include ensuring fairer ranking practices and expanding access to alternative search engines.
Google said the move could slow innovation and delay product launches, citing the company's current investments in AI-driven search features such as AI Overviews and AI Mode, which are covered under the CMA's designation. The company recently pledged to invest 5 billion ($6.65 billion) in the UK and urged regulators to balance oversight with support for technological progress.
The CMA said Google's Gemini AI assistant remains outside the current scope but will be monitored as the market evolves."

According to Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives, the market reaction stems from China’s announcement about tightening restrictions on rare earth materials effective December 1.
""After a relatively calm few months and improving relations between the US and China this step up in tensions has created a white knuckle moment for the markets with tech stocks under major pressure today,"" Ives noted.
The analyst characterized the situation as ""a game of high stakes poker"" between the US and China amid the ongoing AI revolution, with Beijing also increasing scrutiny of NVIDIA’s advanced chips.
Ives maintained his bullish stance on tech stocks despite the sell-off, suggesting that ""the bark will likely be worse than bite this time around as cooler heads prevail."" He views such market reactions as buying opportunities for semiconductor, software, and Big Tech companies.
The analyst highlighted several companies leading what he called the ""4th Industrial Revolution,"" including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Palantir (which he dubbed ""the Messi of AI""), Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.
Ives predicted tech stocks could rise another 7% or more by year-end, describing the current market as a ""1996 Moment...and NOT a 1999 Moment."" He also pointed to OpenAI’s recent investments in NVIDIA and AMD as evidence of ongoing capacity expansion and enterprise demand.
""Sell-offs like today we encourage investors to buy the tech winners and not head for elevators despite this war of words between Trump and Xi,"" Ives concluded.

Third quarter earning season is underway with the biggest tech names slated to report later in the month. It'll of course give us the latest read on just how much companies are spending and making on artificial intelligence, which has driven markets to repeated record highs. Here with more on what to watch is Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and Global Head of Technology Research. Dan, it's great to see you, as always. Um, so we're going into earning season for this company for these companies at a time where there is this debate of valuations. There is this debate about the so-called circular economy, how much they're all sort of spending on each other. Um, what are you going to zero in on in the in these earnings reports?
Yeah, I look, Julia, I'd say, I mean, the street's still massively underestimating what this tech cycle is going to look like. I think it's an AI super cycle. And I think this 3Q earnings is going to be much more of a validation moment in terms of not just for chips but for software. And I think the broader build out. Look, it continue the bears in hibernation mode. They've missed the last two and a half years. and they'll continue to miss this bull market that I think has another two years ahead of it.
You know, it's interesting because I haven't talked to that many bears, right? The bears, the straight up bears are hard to find on this stuff. It's more the message that maybe you should start to diversify a little bit. It's not that you should sell necessarily, maybe take a little bit of profits and put it in some of the smaller companies in the space, put them outside of AI entirely because maybe we're in a little bit of a a breathing period here. What do you think of that argument, Dan?
Look, I get it. I mean, but my view is we're in the second inning of a nine- inning cycle. So, I mean, to to peel away from an AI perspective, talk about people have peeled away from AMD over the last, you know, a month ago, or Oracle six months ago, or Nvidia a year ago. See my whole point is like, the street's under estimating what this cycle is going to look like. And I think ultimately in the next one, two years, numbers are maybe 20, 30% underestimated. And I think that's why three Q earnings is just going to be more validation showing the use cases are exploded."

While many larger brands looking for this sort of one-stop service lean on bigger, more established companies like The Trade Desk, Google, and Amazon for their streaming service ad buys, Vibe has pitched itself as the perfect partner for smaller brands that haven't dipped their toes into the world of TV advertising.

The company attributes its rapid growth in part to this decision, as well as the development of its ad placement algorithm.
Vibe said it focuses on ""performance marketers,"" think gaming apps or direct-to-consumer beauty brands, who tend to buy ads on platforms like Instagram instead of TV. For these companies, TV advertising can feel overwhelming– a barrier to entry that larger adtech companies aren't poised to help them overcome.
Querou, who is Vibe's co-CEO, told Business Insider that the company's team has invested heavily in its generative AI studio, which has been an essential tool for companies that are new to the TV ad game.
Vibe's AI studio allows advertisers to enter their company's name or URL, and the platform will create a custom ad from there. More than 10% of the ads run by Vibe.co are currently AI-generated, Querou says. He predicts this number will rise to 35% by the end of the year and 95% by 2028.

Querou also told BI that Vibe's ad targeting product has been a key component in the company's growth.
""We built our own data assets that allow us to be much more granular” in matching a specific product to the right viewer, he said. ""We’ve transformed the whole buying stack into a recommendation engine.”
Looking ahead, Querou says Vibe plans to combine this homegrown AI approach to help scale the company. While they are planning to hire for some key management roles, he says other positions, like account managers, will be filled by internally developed AI agents."

AFRM is deepening its partnership with Google by backing the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2). AP2 is an open standard, payment-agnostic protocol designed to facilitate secure, agent-led transactions across various platforms. By supporting AP2, AFRM isn’t just adding another integration; it is helping embed its flexible and transparent payment options into a whole new era of digital payments.
AFRM’s platform already integrates with Google Pay and Chrome’s autofill feature, and through AP2, its partnership with Google highlights AFRM’s commitment to responsible lending and consumer trust. By providing real-time assessments and instant credit decisions, often with 0% APR, AFRM allows users to access clear, interest-free installment plans without hidden fees. This could open new opportunities for the company to connect with new consumers and merchants.
This collaboration represents a pivotal moment in the world of payment innovation and the rise of agentic commerce. As AI assistants increasingly handle purchase decisions and financial interactions, AFRM’s integration within AP2 ensures its relevance in a fast-changing digital ecosystem. Also, it signals the company’s intent to diversify beyond BNPL and establish itself as a tech-savvy financial partner.
With this integration, AFRM positions itself at the forefront of agent-led payments, where trust, transparency and technology come together to redefine how consumers and AI agents transact securely. If AP2 gains traction, the company could benefit from increased transaction volumes, better brand recognition and stronger relationships with merchants in Google’s extensive ecosystem. AFRM’s total transactions surged 51.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.
How Are Competitors Faring?
Some of AFRM’s competitors in the fintech space are PayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL and Visa Inc. V.
PayPal is making significant strides in the world of AI agents with the launch of its Agent Toolkit, which seamlessly links AI models to its payment APIs. PayPal’s total payment volume increased 6% year over year in the second quarter of 2025.
Visa is advancing rapidly in the world of AI agents with its Intelligent Commerce initiative. It is developing secure frameworks that enable AI agents to seamlessly interact with Visa’s payment APIs, carry out transactions and handle user preferences while ensuring transparency and control. Its processed transactions increased 10% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

Carnival Corp. & plc recently posted another record quarter. People are still cruising. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow earnings by 47.9% this year.
Carnival is the largest global cruise company. It's brands include Carnival Cruise Line, AIDA Cruises, Costa Cruises, Cunard, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn.

On Sep 29, 2025, Carnival reported it's third quarter 2025 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus. It was the 12th consecutive earnings surprise.
Earnings were $1.43, beating the Zacks Consensus of $1.32 by $0.11.
Revenue was a record of $8.2 billion, up over $250 million from the year ago quarter on lower capacity. This was the 10th consecutive quarter that Carnival has posted record revenue.
Gross margin yields were 6.4% higher than last year.
All-time high net yields were 4.6% higher than 2024 and outperformed the company's June guidance by 1.1 points driven by strong demand and onboard spending.
Carnival's exclusive Celebration Key beach destination in the Bahamas also opened in the quarter and should be a growth catalyst for 2026.
Carnival Booking Trends Remain Strong
Everyone has been watching the leisure and hospitality companies for clues about the strength of the consumer. But Carnival isn't seeing any slowdown.
Since May, Carnival's booking trends have continued to strengthen. It has higher booking volumes than last year and is far outpacing capacity growth.
It has already booked nearly half of 2026, which is in line with last year's record levels at the same time, but Carnival has been able to get historical high prices for North America and Europe segments.

Dublin, Oct. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""2025 Connected TV Platform Expansion in the U.S.: Gaming, Fitness, Smart Home"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
This study draws from the analyst's Q1 2025 survey of 8,000 US internet households. The survey is demographically representative of US internet households, with quotas for age, income, gender, and educational attainment.
TV operating system (TV OS) platform vendors and TV OEMs are looking for new use cases and applications to drive TV sales, advertising revenue, and uptake of related services. With widespread adoption of large-screen TVs, 4K and HDR, relatively little interest in 8K and a business model transitioning away from a high volume, low margin hardware model to a high margin advertising model, CTV platform vendors and TV OEMs benefit from expanding beyond the traditional feature set. With smart TVs now reaching 68% of US internet households, this creates new possibilities for commerce, gaming, fitness, and smart home applications, among others.
This study investigates new differentiators and points of interest for US CTV buyers. It examines demand for smart home hub capabilities, health and fitness services and integrations, advanced gaming functions and features, artistic display capabilities, telehealth, content creation, interactive shopping, and more. It identifies consumer openness towards technologies such as optical content recognition, embedded cameras and microphones, AI and AI assistants, among others.

At the heart of this initiative lies “Edge,” a new digital foundation developed in partnership with Google that brings cloud computing to the restaurant level. Currently live in hundreds of U.S. restaurants and beginning international deployment, Edge enables AI-powered operations, predictive maintenance and real-time decision-making. Management expects this to improve uptime, food quality and crew productivity.
McDonald’s also reported strong adoption of its geofencing technology through “Ready on Arrival,” which halves food pickup wait times in the United States and nearly eliminates them altogether in key markets. Combined with the company’s 185 million 90-day active loyalty users, these digital enhancements are creating an increasingly data-driven ecosystem that deepens engagement and boosts frequency.
Management noted that 2025-2027 will represent a key investment phase as McDonald’s scales AI integration across its consumer, restaurant and enterprise platforms. These initiatives are expected to boost cost efficiencies and margin expansion over time.

Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. CBRL is advancing its multi-year transformation plan with an emphasis on data-driven personalization and operational modernization.

Additionally, Cracker Barrel continues to refine its kitchen and service workflows to drive consistency, speed and guest satisfaction. These initiatives, combined with disciplined cost management, are beginning to yield tangible productivity gains.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Wall Street analysts have long been calling Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) an undervalued AI play. However, the stock seemed to be under the influence of two key overhangs: AI-related threats to Google search and antitrust proceedings against the company. But with the recent court ruling largely in favor of the company, the stock is rising, and many believe it has more room to run.
We recently surveyed some of the most popular discussion boards on Reddit to see what retail investors are buying. One of the most popular stocks Redditors are buying these days is Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG). Our research is based on investing-related discussions on subreddits like r/Investing and r/Stocks.
Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. Google has over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews. OpenAI, Alphabet’s biggest competitor now when it comes to AI search, has less than 5% of its users paying, and its business model is still developing. Google’s first-quarter results showed continued strength in its cloud unit, with revenue up 28% year over year and solid operating income growth. This supports Google’s broader AI strategy and underscores the scale advantages of its cloud business.
Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“We’ll wrap things up with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) , which in similar fashion to Hemnet, only experienced a marginal share price decline over the year. That said, Alphabet did meaningfully underperform our average portfolio return as concerns that it’s near monopolistic position in Search (which generates the majority of their advertising revenue) could be eroded by new Artificial Intelligence (AI) alternatives like ChatGPT and Perplexity. When it comes to the potential risks AI poses to the dominance of search, our view is a balanced one. No doubt uncertainty has increased but we believe Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each) and long-standing investments and leadership in AI (DeepMind and Google Brain)."

Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:

Also during the quarter, the company unveiled several AI improvements that were well-received by the developer community, especially due to its continued partnership with AI pioneer OpenAI.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-10T11:15:00,3 Breakout Growth Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,These three companies look like they could be AI leaders over the long term.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7e6ad7b95861fc2c7d2a9b3539eb0dcf4592ed3f14bf364bdb221c422543402b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/3-breakout-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/3-breakout-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/3-breakout-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for/,fool.com,200.0,,"Growth stocks have been leading the market higher, and with artificial intelligence (AI) still looking like it could be in the early innings, there is every reason to believe this could be the case moving forward.
Let's look at three growth stocks that looked positioned to lead over the next decade.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 1.85%) (GOOG 1.87%) was supposed to be at risk when chatbots started answering questions directly, but the company turned that threat into an advantage. It folded its Gemini models right into search, rolling out AI Overviews and AI Mode so users could move back and forth between traditional search and AI chat with a click. That change has driven more queries, which is feeding into Alphabet's advertising platform, driving growth.
The company has always been good at using its own ecosystem to stay ahead. It became the default search engine for billions of people by controlling Android and the Chrome browser and cutting a revenue-sharing deal with Apple to lock in prime placement on iPhones. Now it's building a similar moat in AI.
While its cloud computing business, Google Cloud, is only No. 3 in market share, it has arguably the most complete AI stack. In addition to its leading Gemini model, it also has custom AI chips, called tensor processing units (TPUs), that help lower costs, strong data analytics tools, and Vertex AI for helping customers build and deploy their own AI models and applications.
On top of that, it Waymo's robotaxi business keeps expanding into more cities, and its work in quantum computing is starting to show real progress. Alphabet is setting itself up not just to protect its lead in search but to become one of the leading AI and tech companies on the planet over the next decade.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.04%) turned itself into one of the biggest AI beneficiaries because it figured out how to use the technology to keep people engaged on Instagram and Facebook. Its AI-driven recommendation systems have become so good at feeding users the content they want to see that time spent on its platforms keeps going up, which creates more ad space to sell.
At the same time, its AI tools give advertisers better targeting and more effective ads, which has led to higher prices and strong returns for marketers. That combination pushed ad revenue up 22% in the most recent quarter.
What will make Meta interesting over the next decade is that it is still barely monetizing some of its largest assets. WhatsApp, with 3 billion users, has only just started showing ads, and Threads is still in the early stages of user growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also been pouring billions into AI infrastructure and talent to pursue what he calls ""personal superintelligence."" Meanwhile, the company is testing smart glasses with consumer appeal and has not walked away from its metaverse ambitions.
None of these projects have to succeed to keep Meta growing, but if even one of them works out, the sky is the limit for the stock.
3. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 1.93%) emerged as one of the key behind-the-scenes players in the AI buildout. As companies look for alternatives to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), they have been increasingly turning to Broadcom to help them design custom-built chips to handle AI tasks. While these chips are pre-programmed and lack the flexibility of GPUs, they tend to be faster and more energy efficient than GPUs for the tasks for which they've been designed.
As the market starts moving toward inference, where costs per inference matter more and Nvidia's CUDA software is less of an advantage, Broadcom is positioned to take AI chip share.
Broadcom first proved its chops by helping Alphabet design its TPUs, which now handle a big chunk of Google Cloud's AI workloads. That success led Meta and ByteDance to sign on as customers, and together those three represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for Broadcom in fiscal 2027. A fourth customer, widely believed to be OpenAI, has reportedly placed a $10 billion order for next year, and reports suggest Apple is also working with Broadcom on its own AI chips.
As more companies look for ways to cut the cost of inference, Broadcom's expertise in custom application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is likely to make it an indispensable supplier for years to come. Together with its strong networking portfolio and VMware virtualization business, which is helping customers run AI workloads in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, Broadcom is well-positioned to see strong growth over the next decade."

In 2025 alone, losses from exchanges and wealthy individuals have reached billions, prompting widespread alarm over escalating state-sponsored cyber threats.
SponsoredGoogle Warns CZ of a State-Backed Attack — Is North Korea Behind It?
In a recent X post, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, publicly disclosed a security alert from Google. The alert indicated a potential attempt by government-backed attackers to compromise his account.
Zhao noted that the alert occurs sporadically, prompting responses from the community. Crypto analyst Neel Kukreti described it as a rare Google notification typically reserved for individuals handling sensitive information. These include journalists or researchers.
“It’s not always a real hack, but better safe than sorry. You’re probably fine, but it’s good practice to stay locked down these alerts don’t show up for nothing,” he stated.
Furthermore, Google describes these alerts as cautionary. According to the company’s blog, these notifications have been issued since 2012 as precautionary measures when evidence suggests government-backed attack attempts.
“The notice reflects our assessment that a government-backed attacker has likely attempted to access the user’s account or computer through phishing or malware, for example,” Google clarified.
They are sent in batches to at-risk users and do not imply actual compromise or identify the specific government involved.
SponsoredNorth Korean Hackers Drive Record-Breaking Crypto Heists in 2025
Meanwhile, CZ speculated that the Lazarus Group — a state-sponsored hacking collective operating under North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau — could be behind the attack attempt. The group is notorious for targeting cryptocurrency firms and services. It was also responsible for the massive Bybit hack earlier this year.
Nonetheless, Zhao’s speculation might not be misplaced. According to security firm Elliptic, North Korean hackers are no longer limiting their focus to exchanges and companies but have started targeting wealthy crypto individuals.
“As crypto prices have risen, individuals have become increasingly attractive targets, often lacking the security measures employed by businesses. Some of these individuals are also targeted due to their association with businesses holding large amounts of cryptoassets, which the hackers are looking to steal,” the report reads.
The growing focus on individual investors reflects a broader escalation in North Korea’s cyber operations this year. In 2025, North Korean hackers stole over $2 billion in cryptocurrency assets.
According to Elliptic, this represents the highest annual total to date, lifting the regime’s cumulative known haul to over $6 billion. Officials widely believe these funds support North Korea’s military programs.
“The thefts are a record for the regime-linked hackers who now account for around 13% of North Korea’s gross domestic product (GDP), according to United Nations’ estimates,” BBC reported.
With losses growing, crypto professionals and investors face urgent calls to strengthen digital protections. High-profile incidents like CZ’s Google alert demonstrate that even the most prominent in crypto remain vulnerable to sophisticated, state-linked adversaries."

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed the legal tests were met to designate Google with the status in general search and search advertising services.
The move marks the first time the CMA has used new powers to designate a tech firm with the status as it looks to tackle the dominance of IT giants, which means it can enforce measures if needed.
Under new digital market rules which recently came into force, firms designated with the status can have conduct requirements imposed on them which boost competition for UK businesses and choice for consumers.
Google accounts for more than 90% of searches in the UK, while it is also used by more than 200,000 UK businesses to reach customers.
In June, the CMA said it was looking at whether it needed to loosen Google’s control of its search engine and allow publishers more influence over how their content was used.
Potential changes could see the regulator force Google to give internet users the option to use an alternative search engine.
But the CMA confirmed on Friday that that status would not apply to Google’s Gemini AI assistant, although other AI-based search features are included, such as AI Mode and AI Overviews.
Designating a firm with the status is “not a finding of wrongdoing and does not introduce any immediate requirements”, the CMA said.
But it said it would consider “proportionate, targeted interventions”, with the CMA set to start consulting on possible measures later in the year.
Will Hayter, executive director for digital markets at the CMA, said: “By promoting competition in digital markets like search and search advertising we can unlock opportunities for businesses big and small to support innovation and growth, driving investment across the UK economy.
“We have found that Google maintains a strategic position in the search and search advertising sector – with more than 90% of searches in the UK taking place on its platform.”
Alphabet-owned Google warned over possible price rises and an impact on growth and innovation from potential “interventions” from the CMA.
Oliver Bethell, senior director for competition at Google, said: “Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation.
“Others pose direct harm to businesses, with some warning that they may be forced to raise prices for customers.”"

The firm reiterated its Outperform rating, calling Alphabet a “Top Pick” as AI-driven integration continues to boost growth and monetization.
“GOOGL’s AI leadership continues to translate into strength in core Search and GCP,” BMO said, pointing to ongoing AI integrations and product launches, driving incremental user value.
The bank raised its third- and fourth-quarter gross revenue forecasts by 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively.
BMO noted that Google is “all in on AI integration into Search,” with “AI Mode scaling to 100M+ MAUs in the first 2 months.”
The firm said expert checks suggest Google’s new AI search features are “providing publishers with less organic/SEO traffic, leading publishers to lean further into paid ads to recoup the lost traffic/revenue,” which BMO described as “a foreseeable tailwind for GOOGL and the broader advertising industry.”
The analysts also highlighted momentum in Google Cloud Platform, noting that “GCP remains well-positioned for share gains, supported by AI product integrations and ramping AI-native workloads.”
BMO raised its 3Q25 GCP growth forecast to 38%, from 35% previously.
On YouTube, BMO said that continued investments to support creators should aid robust content generation, adding that new data-sharing tools are supporting improved targeting and driving ROAS higher.
While the firm continues to monitor outcomes of the Ad Tech Remedies trial, BMO maintained that “a structural break-up is unlikely,” and that a “court-enforced settlement would better restrict Google’s conduct rather than a forced divestiture.”

Shares of automation software company UiPath (NYSE:PATH) jumped 12.3% in the afternoon session after the stock extended its positive momentum as the company announced a major push into advanced artificial intelligence through an expanded platform and several key partnerships.
UiPath revealed a shift from traditional Robotic Process Automation to what it called ""agentic"" automation, which uses AI agents to handle more complex tasks. To support this, the company announced a collaboration with OpenAI to build a ChatGPT connector, integrating the popular AI into business workflows.
Further strengthening its AI ecosystem, UiPath also detailed partnerships with Snowflake to improve automated data processing and with Google to use its Gemini models for voice-enabled agents. These moves aimed to help businesses deploy AI more quickly and effectively.

What Is The Market Telling Us
UiPath’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for UiPath and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 22 hours ago when the stock gained 4.3% as confidence in the artificial intelligence market was renewed, pushing both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new all-time intraday highs.
The rebound was led by chipmaker Nvidia, whose shares rose nearly 2% after its CEO confirmed that demand for computing has ""gone up substantially"" in recent months. These comments helped reassure the market that the AI boom is supported by genuine demand, calming fears that were sparked a day earlier by a report questioning the profitability of Oracle's cloud business. The rally was strong enough to put the information technology sector on pace for a fresh closing high. This upward momentum occurred despite potential headwinds from an ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which entered its second week.
UiPath is up 38% since the beginning of the year, and at $17.83 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of UiPath’s shares at the IPO in April 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $258.55.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Nvidia’s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago when the stock gained 2.3% on the news that several Wall Street firms raised their price targets on the stock and reports surfaced of a major deal involving its advanced AI systems.
The positive sentiment was fueled by a reported deal where cloud provider CoreWeave agreed to supply Meta Platforms with up to $14.2 billion in AI computing power using Nvidia's latest GB300 systems. This agreement highlighted the immense and sustained demand for AI infrastructure from major tech companies. Further boosting investor confidence, several financial firms, including KeyBanc, Barclays, and Citi, increased their price targets for Nvidia. Analysts pointed to an improving supply of key components and strong, continued spending in the AI sector as the primary reasons for their optimistic outlook, which helped push the stock to a record high.
Nvidia is up 40.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $194.05 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $14,100.

“We are putting this out now because both internal and external customers are like, ‘This thing’s good, let’s go.’”
Quick Suite, which costs $20 per user per month, can integrate with Slack and other tools from close Amazon partner Salesforce Inc., and ingest data from internal databases, social media feeds, as well as Microsoft Corp.’s file storage or Adobe Inc.’s tools for creative professionals and marketers. The software is housed in a web app that can follow users around the internet via a browser plugin.
White said Quick Suite recently rolled out to Amazon employees, who have churned through a series of AI tools in the last few years.
“ChatGPT is great, but, you know, you can’t use it at work,” she said, nodding to the reluctance of many companies to let their workers put sensitive data into unsecured versions of the chatbot.
Plenty of people are anyway, and the largest technology companies have raced to deploy tools capable of competing with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft last week said it would move paid subscribers of its consumer Copilot chatbot into a new tier of its Office suite, an effort to shore up the company’s position with workers who want to bring AI to work. Alphabet Inc.’s Google on Thursday announced the debut of an AI platform called Gemini Enterprise, which is also aimed at everyday workers. The platform will cost a monthly fee of $30 per user, Google said.
Unlike those companies, AWS is a stranger to most laptop-toting workers, and didn’t play a leading role in the introduction of popular AI services. The most successful AWS products are building blocks like file storage and processing power for corporate technology departments and web developers."

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.
The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official. This marks the first time Nvidia has been allowed to ship its AI chips to the country since Trump became president.
The move follows the announcement of a massive AI infrastructure project called Stargate UAE during President Trump's visit to the country earlier this year. The project, unveiled in May, included a proposed 5 gigawatt data center hub in Abu Dhabi managed in part by OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and Oracle (ORCL), with infrastructure supplied by Cisco (CSCO) and Nvidia.
Trump's AI deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia have opened up new potential international markets for Nvidia as geopolitical tensions cloud its prospects in the Chinese AI market. Although the US government lifted a short-lived surprise export ban on sales of Nvidia's chips to China in exchange for a cut of its revenue from the region — a highly unusual arrangement that has yet to be finalized — China has now reportedly banned tech companies from buying Nvidia's chips.

In another boost to Nvidia stock on Thursday, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse published a note raising his price target on the company to a Wall Street high of $300 from $240, dismissing the recent growing fears of an AI bubble.
""We are still in the early innings of a multi-trillion AI Infrastructure build-out with just the Hyperscalers providing significant line-of-sight into hundreds of billions of dollars worth of demand for the next handful of years,"" Muse wrote. Hyperscalers are Big Tech cloud providers, such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet-owned Google (GOOGL, GOOG).
Muse's view highlights the bull side of the AI bubble debate, which sees Big Tech as justifiably rushing to build data centers to meet unprecedented AI demand.
""Thus, this is not a bubble, and we are still in the early innings of this investment cycle,"" Muse wrote.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also added to optimism over the company in comments to CNBC on Wednesday, saying that demand for the company's technology is showing no signs of slowing down.
""Demand for Blackwell is really, really high,"" Huang said on CNBC. ""I think we're at the beginning of a new buildout, beginning of a new industrial revolution."""

3 AI Stocks to Buy Right Now
Analog Devices is benefiting from secular growth drivers in automation, AI infrastructure, and automotive electrification. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is riding on its strong market position in high-performance analog (HPA), especially in the industrial, communications infrastructure and consumer markets. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Analog Devices has a leading market position in converters, where it has around half the market share. The company sells converters and amplifiers in integrated forms, which are categorized as “other analog” products. Analog Devices has a leading position in the digital signal processor market.
ADI expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenues to increase 23% year over year, with revenues of $3 billion at the midpoint, with industrial and consumer leading the recovery. This outlook suggests a return to Analog Devices’ long-term model growth of 7-10% annually, backed by structural tailwinds in AI, automation and electrification.
Micron Technology is benefiting from surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery. The pricing benefits are likely to be driven by rising AI server demand, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM supplies. This will support Micron’s margin expansion and profitability.
This Zacks Rank #1 company is capitalizing on the AI boom with its HBM3E solutions, which are increasingly being adopted by major hyperscalers and enterprise customers. Micron is poised to be the key beneficiary of surging AI-related infrastructure spending, as companies continue to build out GPU clusters and AI data centers that require advanced memory solutions. AI PCs are an important part of Micron’s growth plan. MU’s new LPCAMM2 memory is made for AI-ready laptops and workstations that need to handle heavy workloads, such as AI tasks, simulations, and multitasking.
An expanding partner base that includes the likes of NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, is enabling Micron to capture a larger share of the AI infrastructure market. Deepening relationship with major cloud and enterprise customers ensures stable revenue streams and reduces the risk of pricing volatility. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Micron anticipates revenues of $12.5 billion (+/-$300 million) and adjusted earnings of $3.75 (+/- 15 cents).
Microsoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI into its applications. AI assistants, including Microsoft 365 Copilot for commercial customers and the consumer Copilot in Windows, reached 100 million monthly active users in fourth-quarter fiscal 2025. The integration of AI capabilities across this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s product portfolio is driving revenues per user for Microsoft 365 commercial cloud products.
Microsoft is accelerating its AI push, committing more than $30 billion to capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Alongside this, the company has pledged an additional $30 billion to the U.K. over the next four years, signaling that its AI strategy is rapidly materializing and driving an aggressive global expansion. Microsoft is expanding its product ecosystem with the launch of proprietary AI models, MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-1-preview.
In terms of cloud infrastructure, Microsoft has transformed every Azure region into an AI-first environment with liquid cooling capabilities, positioning itself at the forefront of the AI infrastructure wave. Microsoft has added more than two gigawatts of datacenter capacity over the past 12 months, now operating more than 400 datacenters across 70 regions globally, above any other cloud provider."

ATLANTA, Oct. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Splitit, the pioneer of embedded card-linked installments, announced the launch of an invite-only partner program designed to make pay-later capabilities native to Agentic AI, the next generation of AI-driven commerce.
The Splitit Agentic Commerce Partner Program will bring card-linked installment capabilities to autonomous shopping agents—AI systems that can search, recommend, and make purchases on behalf of consumers and businesses.
""Agentic AI will fundamentally reshape how consumers and businesses buy,"" said Ran Landau, CTO of Splitit. ""Splitit's mission is to ensure that seamless, transparent installments are built into this new paradigm from day one, not bolted on later. We look forward to partnering with leading merchants, platforms, networks, and banks in developing meaningful use cases that can be beneficial to shoppers and brands.""
As shoppers increasingly turn to generative AI for deal-hunting, recommendations, and gift inspiration, the lines between browsing, decision-making and purchasing are blurring. According to Adobe data, 53% of consumers plan to use AI tools for product research and 40% for recommendations this holiday season. Splitit's initiative ensures that payments can keep pace with these new autonomous shopping behaviors.
How It Works
-
Native AI payments: Registered AI agents can request real-time installment options directly within merchant checkout flows. These options are delivered through existing payment rails—banks, PSPs, or partner lenders—without redirecting users or requiring new credit lines.
-
Use existing cards: Users pay with their existing credit or debit cards. Splitit's platform handles plan creation and payments in the background, ensuring merchants are still paid upfront.
-
Built on open standards: Splitit's solution aligns with emerging industry frameworks like Google's AP2 and OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol, ensuring flexibility and interoperability across future agent ecosystems.
Agentic Commerce is redefining how discovery, decision, and payment intersect. By embedding installments directly within this new layer, Splitit transforms payments from a downstream process into a native capability of autonomous commerce, preserving brand control and maintaining trust across global networks.
The Splitit Agentic Commerce pilot program launches in Q4 2025. Interested parties, including merchants, networks and payment providers, can apply to join by contacting sales@splitit.com."

Partnership with Permian Labs, the developer of the USD.AI protocol unlocks blockchain-based credit markets for scalable GPU deployments
ATLANTA, GEORGIA / ACCESS Newswire / October 9, 2025 / QumulusAI, a provider of GPU-powered cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence, today announced a $500 million non-recourse financing facility arranged by Permian Labs and distributed through the USD.AI Protocol.
The facility allows QumulusAI to finance up to 70% of approved GPU deployments with stablecoin liquidity from USD.AI's blockchain-based credit market. This structure offers faster access to capital compared to traditional financing alternatives like bank or private credit capital, with flexible terms enabling a non-dilutive path to scale AI infrastructure.
QumulusAI's facility reflects a broader shift in how compute infrastructure is financed. Global demand for AI infrastructure is projected to surpass $6.7 trillion by 2030, yet capital remains concentrated among hyperscalers like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. USD.AI's financing model opens new pathways for emerging operators like QumulusAI, linking real-world hardware directly to blockchain-based credit markets for accelerated, more transparent scaling.
Permian Labs developed the financing framework behind USD.AI, which treats GPUs as a financeable commodity. Permian Labs issues GPU Warehouse Receipt Tokens (GWRTs), and USD.AI serves as the on-chain DeFi protocol that enables those tokens to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoin-based credit, unlocking capital for the next generation of AI builders.
This structure creates yield-bearing opportunities for onchain depositors, while giving operators fast, transparent access to non-dilutive financing.
For QumulusAI, the $500 million facility signals institutional confidence in its infrastructure growth strategy and provides a repeatable model for scaling deployments with blockchain-native financing rails. For Permian Labs and USD.AI, it represents the continued expansion of real-world assets into on-chain credit markets, bridging institutional capital with income-generating compute infrastructure.
""This partnership represents a paradigm shift in AI infrastructure financing,"" said Mike Maniscalco, CEO of QumulusAI. ""By leveraging Permian Labs' tokenization framework, we can scale faster and more flexibly - meeting the surge in AI compute demand without the constraints of legacy financing.""
""QumulusAI is exactly the type of innovative AI operator we built USD.AI to serve,"" said Conor Moore, Permian Labs Co-Founder and COO. ""Their integrated approach to AI supercompute-combining HPC cloud, purpose-built data centers, and controlled power generation-fits seamlessly with our tokenized financing model, proving how blockchain can unlock institutional capital for real-world infrastructure."""

""With the “clearing event” of Judge Mehta’s remedies decision behind it, investor focus should shift back to Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) fundamentals. While search revenue growth may moderate, the company’s leadership in search, AI, cloud computing, and YouTube is expected to sustain low double-digit growth. We believe Google’s durable competitive moat—anchored by its core search franchise, robust AI platform, and significant financial resources—positions it well to maintain long term relevance. AI investments are already bearing fruit, with Gemini outperforming peers on technical benchmarks. In addition, Google Cloud remains a powerful growth engine, and YouTube continues to deliver strong momentum. Collectively, these drivers should enable sustained EPS growth in the high teens to 20% range. Such performance would readily justify a 20x–25x earnings multiple and support meaningful upside potential, even after the recent 50% surge in Google’s share price.""

Available starting at $30 per user per month for the Enterprise Standard and Plus editions and $21 per user per month for the Gemini Business plan, the platform is meant to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft's 365 Copilot. It will enable customers to use Google's Gemini to analyze corporate data and access AI agents in one place.
""Google Cloud is uniquely positioned because we offer all the layers of technology that people need in order to use enterprise AI at scale,"" Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said.
""Starting at the foundation, we offer infrastructure, both GPUs, as well as our own [tensor processing units], and Gemini is optimized on this stack to give you great performance, great quality, [and] low latency,"" he added.
Google said its offering benefits from a number of key features, the first of which is the company's Gemini AI models.
""You need a super-powerful large language model that forms the brains, or the nervous system, of how you interact with your enterprise systems using a large language model. And that is Gemini,"" Kurian said.
Gemini Enterprise also includes what Google calls a workbench, which allows users to coordinate AI agents to automate certain tasks, as well as a ""taskforce"" of prebuilt Google agents that customers can use to perform work such as deep research on topics.
Google said users will be able to connect Gemini Enterprise to existing data sources, including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and SAP. Customers can also track and audit agents to ensure they're working properly and with the appropriate data.
""What we're doing is bringing AI to every user by providing them [a] single front door through which they can chat with all of their enterprise data, search for information, and use agents ... to do a variety of tasks on their behalf,"" Kurian explained.
According to the Google Cloud CEO, companies ranging from consulting services to telecommunications to hospitality businesses to software firms are already using Gemini Enterprise for a variety of scenarios, including improving customer service and enhancing individual team productivity.
But Google's offering isn't the only game in town. Microsoft sells its own comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools that allow customers to chat with its Copilot bot to search and organize proprietary corporate data."

Google has announced a new €5 billion investment in Belgium to expand its data centres and AI infrastructure, marking one of the largest single technology investments in the country’s history and signalling the tech giant’s growing involvement in Europe.
The investment will fund the expansion of Google’s existing site in Saint-Ghislain, in the Wallonia region of Belgium, and support the creation of around 300 jobs.
The project is viewed as key to accelerating access to artificial intelligence and cloud services across Europe.
“With today’s announcement, Google is deepening its roots in Belgium, extending our investments in the country and creating new avenues for AI-driven transformation,” said Bikash Koley, vice president for Global Infrastructure at Google.
Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever hailed the announcement as a milestone for the country’s digital economy and energy transition.
“Google’s new investment is a powerful sign of trust in Belgium as a hub for digital innovation and sustainable growth. By expanding advanced cloud and AI infrastructure in St. Ghislain, creating skilled jobs, and securing new carbon-free energy, Belgium not only strengthens its economy and energy transition. This project is also of strategic importance, consolidating our role as a leader in Europe’s digital future,” he said.
The new facilities will run on carbon-free energy and link into Belgium’s renewable grid, in line with both national and EU 2030 climate goals.
Wallonia’s digital momentum
The investment has been particularly welcomed in Wallonia, where Google first established its Belgian data centre campus in 2009.
“The €5 billion investment announced by Google in Saint-Ghislain confirms Wallonia's central role as a European hub for data processing and storage,” said Pierre-Yves Jeholet, vice-president of the Government of Wallonia.
“It creates jobs in the digital sector, stimulates innovation and economic activity around the site, improves local infrastructure, and strengthens the development of artificial-intelligence skills. This investment also contributes to strengthening our region's digital sovereignty and is therefore fully in line with the priorities of our next digital strategy.”
Local officials echoed the optimism. “This development makes us a dynamic innovative ecosystem, creating opportunities for other businesses too. And we should be proud, as local representatives, to do everything we can, hand in hand with inter-city development agency IDEA, to help them integrate in the best possible way,” said Florence Monier, mayor of St. Ghislain.
Strategically important for defence and security
Defence and foreign trade minister Theo Francken said closer cooperation with global tech firms must be balanced by strong safeguards for national interests.
“Belgium values the exchange with global tech leaders like Google. Strengthening our cyber and data capabilities requires open dialogue, while firmly safeguarding our sovereignty and security,” he said.
The project will further strengthen Google’s collaboration with Belgian telecoms operator Proximus, which is developing sovereign cloud services with the US firm.
“We welcome Google's decision to further invest in Belgium, reinforcing the region’s role as a key driver of digital innovation in Europe and further strengthening our partnership,” said Fabrice De Windt, CEO of Proximus."

But there's still time to find bargain stocks that are engineering the AI revolution and have massive long-term opportunities. Consider Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%), Amazon (AMZN -0.56%), and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.14%).
1. Alphabet: The world's search engine
Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the largest search engine in the world. But it's a lot more than that, and it's moving AI forward with its Gemini large-language model (LLM) that brings the internet search to a new level. It also offers AI solutions for advertising clients to up their game and achieve greater success, putting more money in Alphabet's pockets, too, and its cloud computing clients benefit from the strength of the LLM in creating their own AI apps.
Companies like Target and Wayfair are using AI through Google Cloud to gather data, personalize the user experience, and improve cybersecurity.
Google has many businesses and varied revenue streams, including devices like smartphones, subscription services like storage, and self-driving cars. Revenue increased 14% year over year in the 2025 second quarter, demonstrating the power of its interconnected platform. But it has a long growth runway as advertisers are just touching the potential in AI-powered campaigns, and cloud users experiment with AI to build better businesses.
It's also highly profitable, and operating income increased 14% over last year with a 32.4% margin.
Despite its robust performance and long-term potential, Alphabet stock trades at a bargain price of 26 times trailing-12-month earnings.
2. Amazon: E-commerce and cloud rolled into one
Amazon is the leader in e-commerce, by far, but it's also tops in cloud computing. That's a combination that's nearly impossible to beat, and both of these industries continue to grow as companies make deeper inroads into these markets and use AI to improve in both spaces.
E-commerce is still less than a fifth of total retail spending in the U.S., but around 40% of that spending goes to Amazon. As e-commerce increases as a percentage of retail sales, Amazon will benefit organically. But the company is not waiting around for that to happen. It's spearheading the shift through its incredible value proposition, especially through the Prime program, which generates loyalty and volume. Fulfillment times keep speeding up, with the percentage of same or next-day deliveries up 30% year over year in the second quarter.
The generative AI business is largely within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud segment, and as of the second quarter, it had a $123 billion run rate. Yet, CEO Andy Jassy thinks it's still in its early innings.
""It's a very unusual opportunity that we're very bullish about,"" he said.
Amazon stock trades at a P/E ratio of 34. That's the highest on this list, but it's below its one, three, and five-year averages.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) produces the chips that make AI possible. When you hear of companies like Nvidia and its peers making chips, it's actually designing the chips and partnering with TSMC to bring them to life. That gives TSMC incredible exposure to AI, and gives investors access to many different AI stocks leading the charge.
TSMC has been around since well before the recent generative AI takeover of technology, and its other categories, like gaming and autonomous vehicles, are still an important part of its business, giving it more stability and protection. But the AI business has become its largest, accounting for 60% of the total, and sales increased 14% year over year in the 2025 fiscal second quarter (ended June 30).
Total revenue increased 44% over last year, and both gross margin and operating margin expanded significantly, to 58.6% and 49.6%, respectively.
To get around tariff issues and generally expand its global reach and cost-efficiency, TSMC is opening an Arizona production location, and the company is well positioned to keep supporting and benefiting from advances in AI.
Taiwan Semiconductor stock trades at a P/E ratio of 33, an attractive entry point for new investors."

(Reuters) -Serve Robotics said on Thursday it is partnering with DoorDash to deploy its sidewalk robots to fulfill orders on the food delivery platform, in a move to capture more customers and expand its reach beyond Uber Eats.
Shares of the San Francisco-based robotics firm surged more than 25% in mid-day trading, hitting their highest level in eight months.
The company said customers ordering via DoorDash from select stores and restaurants in Los Angeles may have their orders delivered by a Serve robot, adding that it plans to expand its DoorDash deliveries across the U.S.
Companies have increasingly been adopting automation for last-mile deliveries to reduce labor costs and speed up service times amid strong demand.
The tie-up with DoorDash, the top food delivery platform in the country, will help Serve increase the volume of orders available for its robots by tapping into merchants and customers who use DoorDash instead of Uber's food delivery app.
So far, Serve has deployed its robots for deliveries solely on Uber Eats, which it partnered with in 2021.
""This partnership enables us to go to cities where DoorDash is the dominant player. Now that we have such a significant fleet size, there's a very sizeable supply that we can provide to companies... and we're looking for more demand, so that every minute of every day, the robots have access to more jobs,"" Serve co-founder and CEO Ali Kashani said in an interview.
The tie-up with DoorDash will boost Serve's revenues once it scales up to a level matching the Uber Eats partnership, he added.
Serve currently operates in cities including Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Atlanta through Uber Eats and has completed over 100,000 deliveries from more than 2,500 restaurants.
The partnership comes days after DoorDash unveiled its in-house delivery robot, Dot, which can navigate bike lanes, roads and sidewalks.
DoorDash has also partnered with Alphabet's Wing for drone deliveries.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-09T10:15:00,What Are the 3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now?,"Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon are three top AI stocks to buy now.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=177c58a37493c9bbd731f7c0b312997e1e50a8aaf150723d6b48cb49388fd12e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/what-are-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/what-are-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/what-are-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-buy/,fool.com,200.0,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be the biggest theme driving the market today, and for good reason. The technology has the potential to completely reshape the world we are living in, and it is still in the very early days of its development.
Let's look at three AI stocks to buy now.
Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -0.08%) saw where AI was headed very early in the game, and its decision to give away CUDA for free to universities and research labs paid off big by giving it one of the widest moats in the industry. Developers have built their foundational AI code on Nvidia's software platform, which has effectively locked them into its ecosystem. Even if a rival comes out with a slightly better chip, ripping out years of code and retraining engineers is a nonstarter for most companies, especially when it comes to training large language models (LLMs). That is why Nvidia still controls more than 90% of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market for AI workloads.
The company has also gone far beyond just selling chips. Its proprietary NVLink interconnect allows its GPUs to work as one massive unit, which is a critical edge as AI models get larger and more complex. Now Nvidia has made another big strategic move by investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI. This will give Nvidia insight into where AI models are headed, and the two companies will work together to help shape the future of AI.
CEO Jensen Huang has predicted that data center spending on AI could reach as much as $4 trillion over the next several years, and Nvidia looks positioned better than anyone to capture that spending.
Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 1.85%) (GOOG 1.87%) is positioning itself to become one of the biggest AI beneficiaries of the next decade. Its Gemini model has progressed rapidly to become one of the leading foundational models. It's helping power both its AI and search efforts, as well as its cloud computing unit.
The company developed a wide moat in search by becoming the default search engine on most devices on the planet. It did this by owning the popular Chrome browser and Android operating system, and then struck a search revenue-sharing deal with Apple. Now, as there is a shift toward AI, Alphabet has incorporated its Gemini model throughout its search platform with both AI Overviews and AI Mode, which lets people easily shift from AI-powered search to an AI chatbot with the click of a mouse. This is leading to more queries and helping the company generate more ad revenue.
Meanwhile, the company's cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, has been growing quickly, and it has an advantage as the only company with a fully integrated AI stack. In addition to its Gemini model, it has taken the lead with custom AI chips that give it cost and performance advantages, while also having leading data analytics and other services.
Meanwhile, longer-term bets like its Waymo robotaxi business and progress in quantum computing could turn into new growth drivers. Combined, all of this makes Alphabet a top AI stock to own.
Amazon
While most people think of Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) as an e-commerce company, behind the scenes, it is a leader in AI and robotics. The company created the cloud computing industry, which today is one of the industries benefiting the most from the AI boom.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is both the company's largest segment by profitability and its fastest-growing. Last quarter, AWS revenue jumped 17.5% to nearly $31 billion, with operating income topping $10 billion. The growth is being fueled by customers looking to use its services and infrastructure to help build and run their AI workloads. On the service front, its Bedrock solution lets customers tap into the top foundation LLMs and customize them, while SageMaker gives them a platform to build and train their own. It has also recently introduced an open-source framework for building AI agents, called Strands, and Agentcore, a secure environment to deploy them at scale. On top of that, Amazon has built its own AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which lower costs for customers and give AWS an efficiency advantage.
Amazon is also embedding AI across its e-commerce business to squeeze out more profits. It already has more than 1 million robots working in its warehouses, which are coordinated by its DeepFleet AI model. Amazon is also using AI to predict where to store items for faster delivery, optimize driver routes, and improve its advertising platform. These changes add up to a better operating margin. Last quarter, North American operating income surged 47% on just an 11% increase in revenue.
Overall, Amazon remains well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI over the next decade."

Welcome to Stocks and Translation. Yahoo Finance's video podcast that cuts through the market mayhem, the noisy numbers, and the hyperbole to give you the information you need to make the right trade for your portfolio. I'm Jared Blickery, your host, and with me is Yahoo Finance's Brooke De Palma, who's here to connect the dots and to be your personal bridge between Wall Street and Main Street.And today we're gonna be looking into the recent bullish price action and technicals and stocks and crypto, along with some options talk and a look into earnings season right around the corner. And our word of the day is volatility. It's more than just the so-called VIX, we break down what you need to know. And on today's market show and tell, we're talking simple options trays in Google's alphabet. It's up 70% since those April lows, and we're gonna tell you how to squeeze a little bit more juice out of this mag 7 L.And this episode is brought to you by the number 8%. As we head into earnings season, that's how much profits are expected to grow in the S&P 500. We will tell you why those estimates have been rising and why the uptrend is so unusual.And today we are welcoming back Bob Lang, who's the founder of Explosive Options.net and a veteran options technician who specializes in our word of the day, volatility, risk management, as well as trader education. He has mentored thousands of retail and pro-traders, and he also wrote the book Know Your Options How to Build Wealth Using Proven.trading strategies and technical analysis. He's also a frequent guest on the Yahoo Finance Network. Welcome back,
Bob. Great to be here and I really enjoy your show. The program is fantastic. I watch it every every chance I get.
I appreciate that. And why don't you just begin with telling us how you're seeing the market right now?
Well, you know, hitting new all-time highs, um, there's nothing, um, bearish about that, of course, um, but it does seem a little bit scary, you know, at some point in time, the market's gonna come down and it's going to surprise a lot of people. What we've been experiencing for the past few months, uh, Jared, and it's been the, um, dip buyers. Dip buyer's been very active, you know, pulling back when the market comes down to like 8, 10%.Um, correction, pullbacks or whatever, uh, the, the dip buyers have been right there and, uh, buying the market up. So I, I mean, why fight the trend, why fight the momentum?Um, when that's been the order of the day, that's been the pattern that I've been noticing for the past several months. And
time now for a word of the day, which is volatility, and it isn't necessarily good or bad, it's how much and how fast prices move. Now higher volatility means wider springs and wider swings and more uncertainty, while lower volatility means steadier prices. Now when it picks up market wide, even sturdy.Stocks, they can feel a little jumpy there, but with higher volatility also comes opportunity. And so Bob, how do you think about this concept and how do you navigate it maybe as a first time investor? When do you jump in? Well, Brooke,
you know what people talk about volatility as being a trader's best friend, and frankly that's that's true and it's not true. It's true because volatility opens up opportunity.for the market when the market comes down to to buy options or stocks or whatever. But if I'm an options trader and I'm looking for options to to move in a particular direction, what am I looking for? I'm looking for momentum, and momentum is created by lower volatility. I want to see lower volatility sustain itself for a period of time. And what, what does lower volatility, um, get to? It gets you that.Um, investors and traders are much more comfortable adding money into the market and staying in the market for a period of time, so money keeps flowing into the markets. We see prices going up and up and up. Remember something. The, the market is a is a is a discounting mechanism for the future. It's also a um.An area where the supply is short and the demand is strong, then we see prices just continually going higher and, uh, you know, trying to step in front of that train, you know, good luck.
Yeah, one of the things I've, I track seasonality and I, I measure seasonality and volatility and one of the trends that we kind of observe is that volatility starts to trend.Slowly up in August, September, and then it tends to peak in October. So that means you would have a higher VIX, which by the way, is just measuring, um, options on the S&P 500. So we're just talking about a generic stock index here, but October is a time when we've seen historical market crashes, and sure enough, I've noticed volatility creeping a little bit higher. Is this concerning.At all, um, how do you, how do you use VIX or the, excuse me, how do you use the VIX or volatility in some of your work and just trying to time the market? Well, first of all,
I'm going to take you to the side of that position with, with the crashes. Also, October is notoriously called the crash month, but it's also a month where we've seen market bottoms settlement too. So we see market bottoms in 1929. We saw it did go down a little bit later on the night. We also saw market bottom in 1987.Um, when the market crashed back then, so the market did bottom, um, in those two instances and also in 2009. So, um, I would, I would look at the volatility as an opportunity to get in, but you have to understand the movements and volatility, the seasonal patterns that are going in place. Look, we just started in October, which is a seasonally strong period.to the end of the year. And when you look at the history of the markets this year and in past years, when the 1st 9 months are up strong like they are this year in 2025, the odds are favoring the markets going up into the end of the year, the last 3 months of the year. So that's a trend I really don't want to fight. Yeah,
it's certainly insane.This momentum that we have ever since those April lows, and we're even getting some year-end calls at the S&P 500 could go even higher, reaching as far as 7000. We heard from Evercore, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo. What do you make of those year-end calls and will the momentum just keep on moving on?
Well, you know, frankly, you know, trying toUm, pin the tail on the donkey when you're blindfolded, you know, sometimes it works and, but usually it doesn't. So is that where we're at now kind of where we're at right now. I don't really pay attention to what some of the analysts are saying, the strategists are saying, because they know the market is overbought right now. But remember something overbought is simply just a condition. It's not a signal. So markets can be overbought for a long period of time. If you look at some stocks, look at Pallanttier for a while there, and even Google, when we're going to.for a whole month, month and a half, this, this stock was overbought, and you could have picked at any point and said, OK, that's enough. I got to get off and you were, you were wrong. It just kept going and going and going. So eventually, the stock market is going to signal to you to say, hey, look, you know what, it's time to go down and overbough condition doesn't necessarily give you that signal. It's just simply a condition.
All right, let's jump into our new segment, market show and tell, and we're gonna lean on yours.expertise here, Bob. The ticker is alphabet, which is one of the top Mag 7 performers recently, and there's been lots of bullish AI headlines as antitrust risk has faded, but we want to talk about some of the technicals and specifics here. You're looking at a call, uh, you're looking to buy a call option in Google's parent company Alphabet, and a call option gives the buyer the right to buy a stock at a set price by a specific date.So what are some of these specifics that you're looking for in alphabet, kind of map out the risk and reward.
So I'm, I'm looking for alphabet, um, OK, so if I'm looking at about a 6 month play, we're talking about March or April, um, I have to kind of handicap myself by saying,That what is my expectation for what Google is going or Alphabet Google is going to do next year, right? What's a reasonable amount of return that we can get in a in a good market? What what's the market setup look like? We've got a friendly Fed. We've got a friendly business environment. We've got um deregulation coming in. We, we just recently heard that Google settled um with uh with the country of England. I think they have another settlement coming up with Europe and so forth.
levershere that are currently in Google'sfavor.
That's right, Brooke, and, and, and.So these things are, are, are definitely bullish for Google. So if I'm looking at Google, I say, you know, this is, it's a mega cap, you know, I want to, you know, pick something ridiculous in terms of a target for next year. No, I'm thinking maybe, maybe the stock could do 25-30% next year, right? If, if, if all of these um things work in their favor and stay bullish, of course, anything can change. So I'm looking at that, maybe for the next 6 months, could the stock do 10, 15%? Sure, why not, right? I mean, if theIf the conditions remain favorable, you got a couple of earnings reports into March. You've got the October report coming up in a few weeks. We've got January report coming up and then, um, into, uh, into the early part of next year. So if, if the stock remains bullish, I mean, I'm, I'm looking at maybe going about 3 or 4 strikes out from where the current prices right now. I think it's about 242, 244, maybe go out to the 260, and if the stock makes a 15-20% jump, that option is going to be very profitable.
Let me just follow up here for the audience. Maybe somebody who's just getting their feet wet and options right now. You're talking about buying a call, so you are paying the seller of that option, what's called a premium, and you don't get that back. So if this trade doesn't work out in your favor, if the if the stock price doesn't rise to that level or that strike level by your target date by expiration, then you lose the money. Any other risks that investors should think about as they conduct some of these options trade.
Well, as far as buying calls are concerned, it's a cash settlement.Um, it's cash only. It's there's no margin involved. So whatever I'm buying in terms of a call option, that's the most I can lose. Defined risk, defined risk, right? I can't, I can't lose anything more than than what I put into it. So if I'm, if I'm paying for an option that costs, say, $15 for one contract it controls 100 shares of stock, so it's 100 times $15 that's going to cost one contract's gonna cost me $1500 right?And you think, well, OK, that's, that's the most I can lose. But the most I can make, you know, is technically infinity, right? I mean, the stock could keep going up and up.
Google could hit infinity someday.
Well, wouldn't be, wouldn't that wouldn't that be nice, right? So, um, so if you, you know, if, if, you know, it's all about managing risk, right? And, and, um, I know $15 for an option is somewhat expensive, and you know, for somebody who is just starting out to, to put.Plunk down $1500 on a100s,100 shares, right? But if the stock is trading at $24 100 shares of that, you know, it's gonna cost more than $24,000. I'd rather if I'm gonna lose money on a trade on Google, I'd rather lose $1500 24,000 dollars, although it's not gonna go to 0, but I.But the, the theory is that my risk is contained is, as you said, defined risk with the option trade, and I can't lose anything more than I put into it.
We have so much more to get to, but we do need to take a quick short break. But coming up, we're talking about an unusual jump in expectations for earnings season, and we're stepping onto the court for a tennis-themed run day showdown. Stay tuned.This episode is brought to you by the number 8%. That's how much Wall Street is expecting earnings per share to jump in the S&P 500 this earnings season. Now what's notable is the direction of these estimates. Analysts typically lower their profit forecasts ahead of quarterly reports, which then lowers the bar for these companies to clear. Bob, when you think about these expectations.What are these higher expectations yet again, another earnings season that we're seeing higher expectations going in. What is this telling you?
Well, as you said, it's raising the bar for performance, right? And and it's quite high. And, and I think I want to say about 2 months ago the estimate was for about a gain of about 3 to 4%, and there were several sectors that were showing negative, like, like home builders and even retailers and some.Uh losses being baked in. That's, that's right. So I, I think that that sets up a little bit of disappointment. But look, somebody told me a long time ago, it throws me this question. Do you really want to be short during earning season? And you know, you want to be negative, you want to be short. And really theThe answer is no, because a lot of these earnings, um, that companies deliver, usually they outperform or and, and the market tends to give them a little bit of a break. There's some companies that, look, you know, technically they don't look very well, very good, and if they disappoint, they're going to get punished, but companies that are doing better.I, I look at a company like Robin Hood, which has been an unbelievable in 2025
has been tremendous up over 300% since the April.
So you might want to think, OK, well, uh, maybe, and, and just for the past few, few, uh, couple of months when they got inserted into the S&P 500, the stock is up enormous, and you might think to yourself, well, maybe the good earnings are already baked in. I'd say not so fast. I'd say, look, you know, we've got to pay attention to what they say and what they're doing.And going forward, they have some great relationships and certainly with um with AI and with crypto, they're doing a lot of good things and um maybe, maybe they only beat beat by a little bit on their earnings, but it's going forward they might be well and do well and technically the stock is really in great shape.
Bob, I'm wondering, what do you do during earnings season? Are you listening for certain things on the call? Are you looking for guidance? Are you looking to day trade with options, some of the results? like what do you do during earnings season? Well,
earnings season, I'm I'm, I'm looking for theHighest quality names in the highest, uh, best looking charts that I can find. I'm looking for options flow. I'm looking for, um, interest from, um, big institutions that are coming in and and buying, buying these names because look, big institutions, they don't just step in there in one day and just buy everything. It's very methodical and very slow, and you know, they're they're not, they don't want to make a big splash and show everybody, hey, look, we're here. It's like an
elephant unusual options activity banner on the TV.
Well, that that's exactly right. But you know what I mean.Um, I, I want, I want, I want to be a fly on an elephant's rear end when, when, um, when he's stepping in the room and buying, buying stocks, because if he steps in water, everybody's going to get wet, and he's gonna, everybody's going to know about it. So I, I, I really tend to, to, to take this earnings season very seriously aboutFinding the best trends, the best momentum stocks, and going with those.
Youknow what's interesting is there has been that discussion recently that there could only be 2 reports every year as opposed to the quarterly reports that we have now. You know, when you think about what that could mean for investors' knowledge about a company.If you're just getting started, where, where else do you do you sort of get in to get hindsight or insight into thecompany? Well,
you just talked about volatility a few moments ago, right? Well, you know, fewer reports a year is going to reduce volatility of the market, right? Is that a good thing? Well, for a trader, probably not, but I mean for for for an investor, it's probably just fine. Look, I mean it was about 6 or 7.Years ago that a lot of retailers stopped giving monthly guidance except for one, Costco was the only one that still gives monthly guidance. So, you know, there was a lot of volatility around some of those numbers that came out with monthly guidance and so forth. They stopped doing it and volatility started to come down with some of those names. So I, I don't think it's that it's, it's that big of a a problem or that big of an issue. I mean, earnings or earnings are still going to.You know, you still have to deal with them. If it's 2 times a year, or if it's 4 times a year, you're still gonna have volatility around those events because of the uncertainty and people want to get prepared for this.
You mentioned charts a minute ago, and I know you use some technical analysis. Tell me about some of the tools that you like. What's your, what's in your tool kit.
I I love to see momentum.like RSI or like the RSI like the MacD um I also look at uh money flow indicators like the accumulation distribution, check and money flow is one of my favorites. Um, I also pay attention to what's happening on the price chart because look, number one indicator is the price chart number two is volume. So if, if I'm looking at a chart and I only had the price action and theVolume I didn't have any other indicator. I can I can I I I can really get a good read for where the market's gonna go or or where a particular stock is gonna go. But I have all these those supporting indicators which help me, um, really get a clear picture of where things are at. So I'm by
the way, we have all those on the Yahoo Finance and site for free.
I, I use them every single day. Um but as far as theUm, price is concerned, moving averages are so important because moving averages act like a magnet. They pull the stock to back to it's like self-fulfilling. That's that's correct. And, and you know, when, when stocks get too far away from moving average, it pulls it back. When it gets too far down away from the moving average, pulls it right back up again. So you can kind of really find it define the space where you can start getting in and getting out of stocks.
Movinginto the end of the year, we talked about those S&P 500 targets.Talked about the momentum that we're seeing behind AI. We also seeing momentum behind alternate assets as well. How do you make, or what do you make of this year and momentum that we're getting, especially in those alternate assets, and how do you sort ofunderstand where to go
right
now?
I think you're talking about, right? crypto and gold. So crypto and gold. So I, I, I think that there's a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement.With um alternative assets, I think we've seen some weakness in the dollar and so quite a bit of
um about 9% year to date is,
yeah, so a lot of distrust around the world with the US and you know, I mean, as the debt continues to grow and the obligations continue to grow for the United States, I think there's a lot of countries out there that are worried, Are we going to pay our bills? And uh, you know, I mean, we, we have aUh, a, a president here who's got different policies than other presidents in the past, and who knows, he, he, he seems to be very creative in putting different ideas together, um, you know, look, investing in companies like Intel and other other, you know, that's kind of unprecedented right now, but, you know, things are different, so we, I think the uncertainty there.Um, creates this, uh, demand for alternative currencies aside from the, from the dollar. So that's where you're seeing a lot of interest in crypto and in Bitcoin and gold and silver, platinum, all these names are are starting to move up, but I do think that the excitement and enthusiasm about Bitcoin is going toPush that through, um, probably through 150,000 by early next year.10,000
right now. All right, that is a target that is down. All right, now we have got a market's take on a classic Hollywood ga show staple. Who wore it better?Today we're channeling the tennis world. On the left catwalk confidently strikes the big serve. It's power first, make a statement, then win the point before your opponent even blinks. In market terms, that's a decisive move. Strike while the windows open, take the lead, don't overthink it. And on the right catwalk, we've got the perfect return. This is composed, calmed, see the ball.Send it back with purpose. In markets, that's patience under pressure, absorb the hit, read the bounce, turn defense into opportunity. So Bob, which owns the runway today? Is it the big serve that blasts through or the perfect return that flips the script?
Oh, you're you're you're you're talking my language here. I play tennis 4 or 5 times a week.So I'm right there. I love to play tennis and I'm mostly doubles and play with my wife mixed doubles, and I play with, so I love it and and it's it's been so much fun. But um I, I'm going to go with the big serve. OK. That's, that's, that's what I did. I love the big serve and um, you know, a big serve can really take uh take your opponent out of the game and um.Um, fortunately, you know, I fortunately I've got a good serve and, and, and that, and that that works in my favor. So, uh, that I wish I had a little bit more of my game with the backhand and a forehand, but that's where I'm at
Bob for the everyday just to get in, would you also recommend the big serve?
Um, no, probably not. So, uh, you know, I've been in this, in this business for a long time and and.Um, I, I've taken chances, taken risks, um, where I can, and, um, you know, taken some hits, but also get a little bit of reward, you know, as this as another allergy in baseball, you got to take some risk, right? You can't steal second with your foot on first, right? So, um, if you've got to step out there and on a risk curve a little bit, but um.You know, there's smart ways to do it and um, you know, again with options, there's smart ways to do it aswell.
Under a minute, uh, I love to talk about risk management. I know that's one of your themes as well. Any final words for the viewers.
Um, managing your risks, this is one thing that we all can control, and we can always control what we have, um, on our portfolios at risk. So if you allow yourself to let the market take control, then you're gonna eventually get punished byUm, sellers or when the when the market's ready to turn the other direction. So, um, I think that the most important thing is to learn, learn your, um, risk management rules, um, and pay attention to those and be true to those rules and, and, and, and you're going to be fine and live to fight another day.
I would underscore that 1000 times and always have a plan, ideally in writing.Well, I mean, we've learned a lot here today. We started out with volatility, it's, um, it's used a lot, but it can also lead to opportunities. And Bob, you reminded me that even though we tend to get market crashes in October, at least historically, that also means there are opportunities in October. So that's the flip side of that coin.We talked about technical analysis, the import the importance of being able to read a chart, uh, even if you don't have any indicators, doing a blind can be an important skill for everybody and then just thinking about some of the options trades, uh, we kind of broke down a call trade, but that's another case where you have defined risk up front. You're not gonna, you lose potentially what you put in, but you have an infinite potential payout and you don't.have an infinite potential loss, and I think that's kind of a big thing for people just stepping into the options world.

So, if I'm looking at Google, I'd say, you know, this is it's a mega cap to I might, you know, pick something ridiculous in terms of a target for next year? No. I'm thinking maybe maybe the stock could do 25, 30% next year, right? If if if all of these um things work in their favor and and stay bullish.
Of course, anything can change. So, if I'm looking at that, maybe for the next six months, could the stock do 10, 15%? Sure, why not, right? I mean if the if the conditions remain favorable, you got a couple of earnings reports into March. We've got the October report coming up in a few weeks. We've got January report coming up. And then um into uh into the early part of next year. So, if if the stock remains bullish, I mean, I'm I'm looking at maybe going about um three or four strikes out from where the current price is right now. I think it's about 242, 244. Maybe going out to the 260 and if the stock makes a a 15, 20% jump, that option's going to be very profitable.
And let me just follow up here for the audience, maybe somebody who's just getting their feet wet in options right now. You're talking about buying a call. So you are paying the seller of that option what's called a premium and you don't get that back. So if this trade doesn't work out in your favor, if the if the stock price doesn't rise to that struck level or that strike level by your target date, by expiration, then you lose the money. Any other risks that investors should think about as they conduct some of these options trade?
Well, as far as uh buying calls are concerned, it's a cash settlement. Um it's cash only. It's there's no margin involved. So, whatever I'm buying in terms of a call option, that's the most I can lose.
Defined risk. Yeah.
Defined risk, right? I can't I can't lose anything more than than what I put into it. So if I'm if I'm paying for an option that cost say $15 for one contract times it controls 100 shares of stock. So it's 100 times 15. That's going to cost one contract's going to cost me $1,500, right? And you think, well, okay, that's that's the most I can lose.
But the most I can make, you know, is technically infinity, right? I mean the stock could keep going up and up and up.
Google could hit infinity someday.
Yeah, well wouldn't that be wouldn't that wouldn't that be nice, right?
So, um so if you, you know, if if, you know, it's all about managing risk, right? And and I I know $15 for an option is somewhat expensive. And you know, for somebody who is just starting out to to put plunk down $1,500 on a trade is
Cuz you're buying 100 basically 100 shares.
Basically 100 shares, right? But if the stock is trading at $243, buying 100 shares of that, you know, it's going to cost
That's a lot more money. $24,000.
But I'd I'd rather, if I'm going to lose money on a trade on Google, I'd rather lose 1500 than 24,000, although it's not going to go to zero. But I but the the theory is that my risk is contained as as you said, defined risk with the option trade. Um and I I can't lose anything more than I put into it."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-09T10:00:00,Better Quantum Computing Stock: IonQ vs. Rigetti Computing,IonQ and Rigetti are taking two different approaches to quantum computing.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9307f5873e7a6dc3986326c7f4abfb3e5a2736c4f678b14fc2ce4d7043956be7,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/better-quantum-computing-stock-ionq-vs-rigetti-com/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/better-quantum-computing-stock-ionq-vs-rigetti-com/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/better-quantum-computing-stock-ionq-vs-rigetti-com/,fool.com,200.0,,"Quantum computing investing is an incredibly speculative space, but if you pick the right company, you could be rewarded with incredible results. On the flip side, if you pick the wrong stock, the investment could go to zero.
There are also two types of companies in this realm: Pure-plays and legacy big tech. Legacy big tech includes companies like Alphabet and IBM that are getting into the quantum computing race, and have businesses to fall back on if their quantum computing endeavors don't pan out. These are much safer investments, but don't have near the upside potential as investing in pure-plays like IonQ (IONQ -6.07%) or Rigetti Computing (RGTI -0.36%).
Both of these are popular pure-play quantum computing stock picks, but does one offer a more compelling investing case than the other? Let's find out.
The two are taking fundamentally different paths
Rigetti Computing and IonQ are taking two different approaches to quantum computing.
Rigetti Computing is using superconducting quantum computing, which is the approach that many companies are taking, including most of the legacy tech businesses. This technique cools a particle down to absolute zero, then uses its quantum mechanics for calculations. Cooling a particle down to absolute zero isn't cheap, so this gives IonQ an advantage.
IonQ uses a trapped ion approach, which can be done at room temperature. Furthermore, IonQ's trapped ion approach is far more accurate, and IonQ holds world records in one-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelity tests, which measure how accurate a quantum computer is. IonQ's two-qubit gate fidelity sits at 99.97%, while Rigetti's system has a 99.5% two-qubit gate fidelity. While IonQ's advantage may not sound like much, that extra 0.47% is incredibly difficult to come by and shows the inherent accuracy advantage of the trapped ion approach.
However, IonQ's accuracy advantage isn't without its drawbacks. Superconducting quantum computing has far better processing speeds. So, the question of which technology will become commercially relevant boils down to what the market wants.
For a quantum computer to be commercially viable, it must be accurate. This makes IonQ seem like the better buy. However, if Rigetti can reach an accuracy level that's on par with IonQ -- say, a year or two later -- IonQ may not have established a strong enough foothold to hold off a competitor with superior processing speed.
It's impossible to predict the winner of this outcome years before it happens. Both Rigetti and IonQ point toward 2030 as being a turning point in quantum computing relevance, and predicting that far out is a fool's errand. As a result, there may be a better option than picking just Rigetti or IonQ.
Picking both stocks increases the odds of success
Instead of picking one or the other, I'd advise that investors purchase both. That way, if one succeeds while the other flops, the entire investment isn't worthless. Furthermore, the winner of the quantum computing race is likely to provide massive returns, and one gigantic winner can outweigh a lot of losers. This balanced approach decreases the risk in investing in an emerging trend like quantum computing.
Another way to invest in both companies while also grabbing some others in the quantum computing realm is by purchasing a quantum computing ETF. This investment basket is filled with stocks that are investing in the quantum computing realm, including legacy tech players. While the upside for this investment isn't as great, it doesn't have nearly the downside, because some large companies won't go belly-up if they fail to deliver a successful quantum computing solution.
While I like IonQ's chances a bit more, I can't ignore Rigetti Computing or some of its other peers. That's why I think taking a balanced approach to this industry is a smart idea, and that approach has a much better chance of getting investors positive returns compared to just picking a single pure-play."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-09T09:30:00,Prediction: These Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Could Outperform Nvidia by 2030,Nvidia has become one of the defining megacap players of the artificial intelligence boom over the last three years.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=08276bf6ac476df57d5aac6ea07ff699a5ac081ff99de0a42bd7c5fe42ce7590,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-these-ai-stocks-could-outperform-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-these-ai-stocks-could-outperform-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-these-ai-stocks-could-outperform-nvidia/,fool.com,200.0,,"Over the past few years, Nvidia has become synonymous with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Its GPUs power everything from ChatGPT to self-driving cars, and its market capitalization surged past $4 trillion, firmly establishing the chipmaker as the largest company in the world.
Yet as the AI race matures, the next decade may not belong to Nvidia alone. Two companies -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.14%) and Alphabet (GOOGL 1.85%) (GOOG 1.87%) -- are quietly positioning themselves to challenge its dominance from distinct but equally powerful angles.
Nvidia's rise has largely been fueled by its high-performance chips, but the broader AI ecosystem relies on companies that supply crucial infrastructure and integrated platforms enabling this revolution. By 2030, investors may look back and realize that the true winners of the AI boom were those laying the foundation of the intelligent economy.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: The ultimate pick-and-shovel AI stock
While Nvidia specializes in designing GPUs, its Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) that brings this hardware to life. As the world's largest chip manufacturer by revenue, it produces cutting-edge 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer chips that power not only Nvidia's products, but also those of Advanced Micro Devices and Apple's M series processors. In many ways, TSMC is the pillar supporting the broader semiconductor industry.
As global demand for AI computing accelerates, the company's value proposition grows increasingly compelling. Its dominance in advanced node manufacturing should drive sustained revenue growth and expanding profit margins, backed by industry-leading pricing power.
Moreover, TSMC's strategic investments to diversify its geographic footprint beyond Taiwan -- including new production facilities in the U.S. -- are helping mitigate geopolitical vulnerabilities while deepening relationships with key customers. For investors looking for an infrastructure-first way to participate in the AI revolution, it represents the ultimate pick-and-shovel opportunity.
2. Alphabet: Building a complete AI ecosystem
Over the past several years, Alphabet has methodically constructed a vertically integrated AI ecosystem.
At the infrastructure layer, Google Cloud's tensor processing units (TPUs) provide a powerful alternative to Nvidia's GPUs for both training and inference workloads. Layered on top of this hardware foundation are Alphabet's growing ambitions in quantum computing, anchored by its custom Willow chip.
On the software side, the company has introduced Cirq, an open-source quantum programming framework that complements the company's hardware advances. Meanwhile, DeepMind, the company's in-house AI research lab, is helping push the frontiers of next-generation machine intelligence. Taken together, these assets position it at the intersection of classical computing and quantum AI.
Crowning this ecosystem is Gemini, Alphabet's large language model (LLM), which competes directly with OpenAI's ChatGPT (via Microsoft Azure) and Anthropic's Claude (via Amazon Web Services). By combining infrastructure, research, and software under one roof, Alphabet has quietly built one of the most diversified and formidable AI suites in the world.
The next AI winners might already be hiding in plain sight
While Nvidia will likely remain a cornerstone of the AI narrative, investors seeking durable, long-term growth may find greater opportunity in companies that enable and scale up AI rather than those centering on a single product line.
TSMC stands to benefit from continuous chip upgrade cycles regardless of which company's designs are in demand, while Alphabet is embedding AI into every layer of its business: search, advertising, streaming, Android, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and autonomous systems.
In many ways, Taiwan Semi and Alphabet represent two sides of the same coin: One company powers the physical infrastructure of the AI era, while the other drives its digital intelligence.
By the end of this decade, both TSMC and Alphabet could quietly -- yet decisively -- outperform Nvidia, reminding investors that the true winners of technological revolutions are rarely those that perfect a single product category, but rather the ecosystems and enablers that make these products and services a crucial feature of everyday life."

This investment aims to bolster the company’s AI infrastructure for Google Cloud and enhance core services such as Search, Maps, and Workspace.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
The St. Ghislain site will see further integration into Google’s global network of 42 cloud regions, advancing the company’s capacity to meet enterprise demand for high-performance, low-latency AI services.
Organisations such as Odoo, UZ Leuven, and AZ Delta in Belgium currently rely on Google’s infrastructure for developing and scaling AI-based solutions.
With this new commitment, Google’s total investment in Belgium will surpass €11bn since its initial data centre build in St. Ghislain in 2007.
Google’s data centre operations in Belgium currently engage around 600 individuals in technical, engineering, security, and facilities roles. The Belgian data centre also maintains relationships with nearly 150 local suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia.

By GlobalDataIn addition to the data centre expansion, the Alphabet subsidiary is pursuing additional energy procurement in Belgium.
It has entered into agreements with Eneco, Luminus, and Renner for more than 110 megawatts (MW) of carbon-free electricity. This aligns with Google’s objective to operate its sites on carbon-free energy at all times.
Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said: “Google’s new investment is a powerful sign of trust in Belgium as a hub for digital innovation and sustainable growth.
“By expanding advanced cloud and AI infrastructure in St. Ghislain, creating skilled jobs, and securing new carbon‑free energy, Belgium not only strengthens its economy and energy transition.”
Since 2010, Google has signed European renewable power deals totalling over 4.5 gigawatts (GW) and specifically supported 365MW of clean energy in Belgium.
The company is collaborating with Centrica Energy and grid operator Elia to integrate demand response solutions using battery storage at St. Ghislain.
Google global infrastructure vice president Bikash Koley said: “With today’s announcement, Google is deepening its roots in Belgium, extending our investments in the country and creating new avenues for AI-driven transformation.
“Our investments in technical infrastructure and AI skills development help ensure people across Belgium and across Europe have access to opportunity in this exciting era of European innovation.”
Analysis from Implement Consulting, commissioned by Google in 2024, suggests that widespread adoption of generative AI could add €45–50bn to Belgium’s GDP over 10 years.
In September 2025, Google opened a new data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, as part of a £5bn ($6.8bn) investment in the UK to enhance its AI infrastructure."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-09T08:44:00,Contrarian Play: Buy These 3 Quantum Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Before Wall Street Realizes Its Mistake,Analysts could be underestimating these stocks.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0a4f9718f754e553f0e43bd17dd4da1e9d488539e95173ee205a96e534a205ef,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/contrarian-play-buy-these-3-quantum-ai-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/contrarian-play-buy-these-3-quantum-ai-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/contrarian-play-buy-these-3-quantum-ai-stocks/,fool.com,200.0,,"Wall Street analysts get paid big bucks to thoroughly research the stocks they cover. They pore over financial statements, study industry trends, and interview corporate executives to project how stocks might perform. After all that effort, though, they can sometimes still get it wrong.
I suspect this might be the case with three quantum artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Buying these stocks before Wall Street realizes its mistake could be a great contrarian play.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.85%) ranks as the world's largest communication services stock based on market cap. It's the fourth-largest stock across all sectors. The company is best known for its Google search engine, YouTube, Android operating system, and other components of the Google ecosystem. However, it's also a leader in quantum computing, with its Google Quantum AI unit focused on building large-scale quantum computers by the end of the decade that can be used in AI and other applications.
This stock has been sizzling hot since the overall market sell-off in early April that resulted from the Trump administration's tariff moves. However, many analysts expect the momentum to wane. The consensus 12-month price target for Alphabet is below the current share price.
Interestingly, though, 54 of the 65 analysts surveyed by S&P Global in October rated Alphabet stock as a buy or better. I think those ratings are more indicative of the stock's potential than the pessimistic price target.
To be sure, Google Quantum AI is unlikely to significantly impact Alphabet's stock performance over the next 12 months. On the other hand, AI that doesn't rely on quantum computers probably will. I look for a huge AI tailwind to continue driving higher revenue for Google Cloud.
2. IonQ
While quantum computing and quantum AI are mere drops in the bucket for Alphabet, these arenas are everything for IonQ (IONQ -6.07%). The company has achieved several key quantum computing milestones, including improving classification accuracy in large language models (LLMs) using quantum fine-tuning earlier this year.
After a stocky start to 2025, IonQ stock went on a tear beginning in March. The stock has especially skyrocketed over the last month. But analysts seem to think IonQ's sizzle will soon fizzle. The consensus 12-month price target is a double-digit percentage below the current share price.
You might think Wall Street's recommendations would be decidedly bearish for IonQ. However, that isn't the case. Of the eight analysts surveyed by S&P Global this month who cover the stock, six rate it as a buy or a strong buy. The two outliers recommend holding IonQ.
I can understand why some might be concerned about this stock. IonQ isn't profitable yet. Its shares trade at a nosebleed trailing-12-month price-to-sales ratio of 303. But I like the company's technology and its smart acquisitions, especially the addition of Oxford Ionics. This stock could be a massive winner over the long run.
3. Rigetti Computing
Rigetti Computing (RGTI -0.36%) captured investors' attention with its July 2025 announcement that it had cut its two-qubit gate error rate by half. This set the stage for the company to release its Cepheus 1-36Q, the largest multichip quantum computer, for general availability only a few weeks later.
Largely as a result of these developments, Rigetti has been one of the best-performing quantum computing stocks this year. Wall Street doesn't anticipate the good times will keep rolling. The average 12-month price target for the stock is almost 50% below Rigetti's current share price.
Granted, only three analysts surveyed by S&P Global cover Rigetti. But all of them recommend buying the stock despite having price targets lower than the current share price. Importantly, two of the analysts haven't updated their views on Rigetti since August.
Rigetti is in the same boat as IonQ -- unprofitable with an absurdly high price-to-sales multiple. However, the company also stands to benefit as it makes further quantum computing and quantum AI advances."

- Google introduced a new agentic platform with a chat interface that combines Gemini models, first and third-party agents and what was formerly known as Agentspace, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said Thursday.
- The platform, called Gemini Enterprise, has a central governance framework to support audits and monitoring. Gemini Enterprise lets customers access an ecosystem of 100,000-plus partners, Kurian said. As part of the platform, enterprises can deploy a new low-code visual builder and pre-built, specialized contact center agents.
- “By bringing all of these components together through a single interface, Gemini Enterprise transforms how teams work,” Kurian said in a blog post. “It moves beyond simple tasks to automate entire workflows and drive smarter business outcomes — all on Google's secure, enterprise-grade architecture.”
Dive Insight:
Most enterprises are pursuing AI adoption with help from vendors, but not all new updates are purely beneficial to customers.
Naming conventions for AI tools and platforms are hard to keep up with, to put it lightly. Gemini, for example, is the name for Google’s chatbot, the family of large language models that powers it and the new agentic platform’s moniker.
“AI vendors are continuously changing product names and prices because they are basically making it up as they go along,” Matt Cain, distinguished VP analyst at Gartner, said in an email to CIO Dive. “There is no solid long-term strategy guiding their way. They are in reactive mode, and this is characteristic of a new technology market with explosive growth.”
In February 2024, Google rolled out a new user experience as part of the debut of Gemini for Workspace, which itself was available as an enterprise add-on that replaced what was formerly known as Duet AI for Workspace Enterprise.
Google isn't alone in its AI naming woes. BBB National Programs' National Advertising Division called attention to Microsoft’s universal use of Copilot as a product descriptor in June, recommending the cloud hyperscaler should modify advertising to improve clarity.
Enterprises trying to keep up with AI vendors often end up confused, Cain said. Confidence in providers falters amid muddled product names.
“The customer benefits when prices drop,"" Cain said. ""But name changes rarely lack additional clarity and only add to overall market confusion.""
CIOs should feel empowered to push back on vendor claims and ask for clarification when necessary. Enterprises have the upper hand in negotiations as the agentic AI supply far exceeds demand, according to Gartner research.
Google said the changes announced Thursday aim to simplify AI use for enterprises, presenting users with ""a single front door for AI in the workplace.""
Gemini Enterprise is available to customers starting Thursday, offering access to more than 1,500 agents as part of the partner ecosystem. Early adopters include Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and Virgin Voyages.
The cruise line has deployed 50-plus specialized AI agents as part of their companywide adoption of Gemini Enterprise. The agents help employees with an array of tasks, such as personalized marketing outreach via an agent called Email Ellie.
“AI has accelerated our deployment of campaign assets, scaling our output while deepening personalized brand expression… our financial results have benefited from this as well as other initiatives,” Nirmal Saverimuttu, CEO of Virgin Voyages, said during a Tuesday call. “Agents have been deployed as an invisible workforce to support our team, thereby multiplying the impact and unleashing their potential.”

(NASDAQ:ISRG) is one of the companies that are pertinent to the discussion about The Future of Artificial Intelligence: 10 Predictions for 10 Industries.
In June this year, Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle Corporation, said during the second quarter earnings call that Oracle Health was building AI agents into its EHR system that would be the envy of the technology world. He added that Oracle was working on agentic AI across its business lines, such as healthcare, and aims to add customers from other tech companies that got out of the AI business. Ellison further highlighted:
“Oracle was using the most modern application generators and AI database technology to build their application suite, adding AI and analytics using OpenAI, xAI, Google, Llama and other popular LLMs on top of that application data. No other company is even attempting to build the depth and breadth of AI-based applications like us.”
According to media platform, Becker’s Healthcare, voice-activated AI will reportedly be a big part of the new EHR Oracle Health is developing.
Intuitive Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), a firm that develops, manufactures, and markets products that enable physicians and healthcare providers to enhance the quality of and access to minimally invasive care, is another company that is aggressively integrating AI into the healthcare business. The firm recently introduced updates to the popular robotic surgery system named da Vinci 5. The system enables surgeons on two different sides of the world to collaborate on a surgery, pointing to a future where advanced surgeries can reach patients globally without the need for travel.

In 2005, the two largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., when measured by market cap, were energy giant ExxonMobil at $392 billion and industrial bellwether General Electric worth $375 billion. Now, just 20 years later, technology companies spearheading advances in artificial intelligence (AI) rule the roost.
Four household names top the list. AI chipmaker Nvidia is the frontrunner at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), regularly climbing to new heights. Cloud and software provider Microsoft takes up second place, worth $3.9 trillion. iPhone maker Apple is nipping at Microsoft's heels at $3.8 trillion, and search pioneer Alphabet rounds out the top four at $3 trillion.
With a market cap of nearly $2.4 trillion, it seems almost a foregone conclusion that Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) will soon join the fold. The company has numerous growth drivers that continue to defy detractors, and the vast opportunity represented by AI will likely take the company over the finish line into the $3 trillion club.
A rare triple threat
What sets Amazon apart from the competition is its triad of successful businesses. While it's impressive for a company to have even one industry-leading business, Amazon has two and a third that's a strong contender in its field.
First up is Amazon's flagship e-commerce platform. The company made its fortune as a pioneer in the nascent e-commerce space in 1994, before ultimately earning the moniker of ""Everything Store"" and becoming the world's largest online retailer. Amazon is also the world's second-largest retailer, behind just Walmart.
Results from the second quarter help illustrate the overall magnitude of the company's success. Net sales of $167.7 billion increased 13% year over year, with 61% of the topline coming from digital retail or third-party seller services. This fueled net income of $18.2 billion, up 35%.
Amazon's second industry-leading business -- and by far its most important segment -- is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud infrastructure services business. AWS provides on-demand computing solutions, software applications, AI, and more.
The company continues to dominate the space it pioneered in 2002, with an estimated 30% of the market, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, with 20% and 13%, respectively, according to Statista. Furthermore, the cloud segment continues to grow at a respectable clip, up 17% year over year in the second quarter. AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income for the first six months of 2025, helping to fund the company's other growth initiatives.
Last but certainly not least is Amazon's fast-growing advertising business, which is fueled by its valuable product search, as well as Amazon Prime Video, live sports programming, Fire TV, and the company's live-streaming gaming platform, Twitch. Advertising revenue of $15.7 billion increased 23% year-over-year in the second quarter, accounting for 9% of total revenue. These statistics place Amazon third in the race for digital advertising dominance, behind only Google and Meta Platforms.
If that trio of successful businesses wasn't enough, Amazon is also one of the foremost authorities on AI, with more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already available for its cloud customers, and plans to offer many more. ""AI will be a substantial catalyst,"" according to CEO Andy Jassy.
The path to $3 trillion
Amazon has a market cap of roughly $2.35 trillion (as of this writing), so its stock price will only need to increase by roughly 27% to reach $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $902 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.
Wall Street is currently predicting Amazon's growth will clock in at roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. However, given its history of strong execution, that target us likely conservative and I predict the company will make the grade sooner.
Finally, at 34 times earnings, Amazon trades at a premium compared to a multiple of 31 for the S&P 500. That said, the company has delivered stock price gains of 712% over the past decade, far exceeding the 239% gains S&P 500. This helps illustrate why Amazon represents a compelling opportunity as it marches toward $3 trillion."

SINGAPORE, Oct. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Food as the destination. Sweat-and-spa escapes. Tech-enhanced experiences. Travellers are rewriting the rulebook on why they travel, opting for meaning over mileage, and experiences over rote itineraries. Trip.com Group and Google explore this shift in Why Travel?, a new global consumer report that examines the intersection of purpose, people and place in travel.
By combining Trip.com Group's global booking intelligence and proprietary booking data with Google's research and search insights, the report uncovers how travellers are seeking deeper purpose and richer connections through culture, community, and technology to create more experience-focused journeys in 2026 and beyond.

Dunamu, the operator of the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, will have to overcome five legal hurdles if it is to complete its much-vaunted merger with the tech giant Naver, according to a new report.
Naver is the country’s biggest and most prominent internet firm, South Korea’s answer to Google. Upbit, meanwhile, has cornered some 72% of the domestic crypto market.
A Dunamu-Naver merger could create a crypto-tech behemoth on a scale previously unseen in the East Asian market.
However, the South Korean newspaper Hanguk Kyungjae identified several issues that stand in the way of the alliance, despite the merger talk leaving the tech and crypto sectors “abuzz.”
It called these legal hurdles “significant,” and added that “policy uncertainties” could also undermine the bid.
Hurdle 1: Tradfi Regulations
In late 2017, South Korean regulators imposed a rule effectively barring traditional financial companies from doing crypto-related business.
Although they never enshrined this in national law, financial industry guidelines still exclude the possibility of banks and other lenders providing crypto-related services.
Naver wants to merge its Naver Financial unit with Dunamu. The former is classified as an electronic financial service provider under the terms of the Electronic Financial Transactions Act.
Regulators would, in theory, need to modify their guidelines for the merger to go ahead as currently proposed.
Hurdle 2: Stablecoin Legislation Uncertainty
Domestic market observers think that one of the key goals of a Naver-Dunamu merger centers on the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins and the expansion of the payment ecosystem.
If Naver’s existing Naver Pay platform could make use of a KRW-pegged coin, the firm could expand its presence in the payments market.
However, politicians and regulators remain divided on several key stablecoin-related matters, despite President Lee Jae-myung’s intention to legalize KRW-pegged tokens.
The central Bank of Korea (BOK) has taken a cautious stance, insisting that only commercial banks or consortia where banks are majority stakeholders should be allowed to issue stablecoins.
But some politicians want to allow fintech firms and other IT players to issue their own tokens.
Should the BOK get its way, this could prove a setback. The newspaper wrote:
“A bank-centric structure would likely force the Naver-Dunamu alliance to participate solely as a technological and operational partner in a bank-led consortium, rather than directly as an issuer.”
Hurdle 3: A Conflict of Interests?
If the Naver-Dunamu alliance issues a KRW-pegged stablecoin, the new firm could struggle to list this token on Upbit.
The terms of the Virtual Assets Act explicitly prohibit exchanges from listing or trading coins that they or their affiliates have issued.
If this proves to be a major problem, the new company could explore workarounds, such as listing on other domestic and international exchanges. But such a step would “significantly diminish” the impact of the merger, the newspaper added.
Hurdle 4: Stock Market Setbacks?
A merger could see Naver restructure Naver Financial and look to list it on the NASDAQ exchange alongside Dunamu.
The newspaper explained that both companies have “actively incorporated overseas listings and split listing scenarios into their mid- to long-term strategies.”
But recent revisions to the Commercial Act and the Capital Markets Act have bolstered minority shareholder protection.
The amended acts stipulate that in corporate restructuring processes, including mergers, spin-offs, and IPOs, minority shareholders must receive “fair value” offers for their holdings.
Experts believe that class action or shareholder derivative suits could follow if existing minority shareholders are not offered a suitably advantageous financial package.
Hurdle 5: Governance structure questions
Speculation is rife that Naver’s Global Investment Officer and Chairman Lee Hae-jin has earmarked Dunamu’s Chairman Song Chi-hyung as his successor.
This has led to further speculation that Song could eventually become Naver’s largest single shareholder.
Song currently holds over a quarter of Dunamu’s shares. The newspaper explained:
“Dunamu, which generates approximately 1 trillion won [$702.2 million] per year in net profits, is unlikely to agree to a merger deal without a ‘carrot’ like securing management right or becoming the largest individual shareholder.”
However, market regulations would stipulate that various compliance-related matters must first be satisfied.
This could prove far from straightforward. The transfer of management rights to Chi or installing him as the largest individual shareholder is “unlikely to be achieved through a simple stock transaction,” the newspaper concluded.
Only time will tell if Naver and Dunamu have what it takes to overcome these obstacles and pull off what would undoubtedly become East Asia’s biggest IT-sector merger in recent years.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Google will serve as the official cloud provider of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games and has joined LA28 as a founding partner, organisers said on Wednesday, in a deal that also extends to Team USA and NBCUniversal's U.S. coverage.
The partnership will use Google's cloud infrastructure and AI tools, including its Gemini model and new Google Search features such as ""AI Mode"" to help fans discover information during NBCUniversal's multi-platform broadcasts and to support LA28 operations, the organisers said.
LA28 chairperson and president Casey Wasserman said the tie-up aims to deliver ""a technologically advanced, engaging and digitally accessible Games,"" adding that Google's products would help attendees navigate venues and get real-time information.
Google marketing vice president Marvin Chow said the collaboration would make the Games ""more personal and interactive"" for fans.
NBCUniversal's ad chief Mark Marshall said combining Google's technology with NBCU's content would create ""a world class viewing experience.""
YouTube will also partner with NBCUniversal to host select Games-related content as an extension of NBCU's coverage, the companies said.
Organisers said Google's technology would support millions of fans, athletes and more than 70,000 volunteers and workers expected for LA28.
The announcement comes amid a surge of sponsorship announcements this year by LA28, the private, non-profit company organising the Games.
Google is LA28's fifth founding partner, joining Starbucks, Honda, Comcast and Delta.
LA28 set a goal of signing $800 million to $1 billion in new deals in 2025, which would lift total sponsorship revenue to about $2 billion. A top official last month told Reuters the Games were on track to meet or exceed its targets.
The Los Angeles Games will mark the city's third time hosting the Olympics, after 1932 and 1984, and its first Paralympics. LA28 has said it plans to rely on existing venues rather than build new permanent infrastructure.

Google (GOOGL) just unveiled a new addition to its Gemini family the Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model giving developers a more capable way to build AI agents that can actually use software interfaces. Announced Tuesday on the company's blog, the model is now available in public preview through the Gemini API on Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.
Built on Gemini 2.5 Pro, the new model specializes in visual understanding and reasoning, allowing AI systems to navigate and interact with apps or websites much like a human would. Google says it already outperforms competing models on multiple web and mobile control benchmarks and does so with lower latency.
Right now, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is fine-tuned for web browsers, though Google says it's also showing promising results on mobile UI tasks. Desktop-level controls aren't fully supported yet, but they're on the horizon.
With this release, Google is clearly signaling its ambition to make Gemini a central tool for developers looking to build intelligent, task-performing AI agents not just chatbots."

Anthropic, the AI startup backed by Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), is making a big move into India. The company plans to open its first Indian office in Bengaluru in early 2026, marking its second base in Asia after Tokyo. CEO Dario Amodei is visiting the country this week to meet government officials and local partners as part of the expansion push.
India has become one of Anthropic's fastest-growing markets and now ranks as the second-largest user base for its Claude chatbot. The country's booming tech ecosystem, deep AI talent pool, and growing enterprise adoption are fueling that growth. Claude, known for its strong coding and reasoning abilities, is already available in India through both free and paid plans, though pricing in local currency hasn't been rolled out yet.
The expansion sets up a fresh AI face-off in India. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), registered its local entity earlier this year and plans to open a New Delhi office soon. They'll be competing with Google's Gemini and AI newcomer Perplexity, both of which have been offering advanced tools for free to Indian users.
Anthropic, valued at $183 billion after a $13 billion Series F round in September, also plans to triple its global workforce as demand for Claude surges worldwide."

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Steven Grasso, the CEO of Grasso Global Inc., said after the most recent quarterly results from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) that he still believes Google search is facing “existential” threats from AI. The analyst said he would not be a buyer of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares and explained his bear thesis on CNBC:
“I still think there’s an existential threat and even though search is up and Gemini has helped search, you don’t get the clicks when you go through an AI search, you’re not getting the clicks that you would normally get when you go through a Google search. So when you go on a perplexity search for me, I just see the summaries. If you see the summary with Google, are you clicking on anything? And how does that affect revenue going forward? That’s something I’m concerned with. I wouldn’t be a buyer of Google.”
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe concerns around AI-related threats to Google search are overstated. Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. As of April, Google had over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews. Google’s competitor OpenAI failed to impress the market with its GPT-5 model, while Gemini is gaining traction with new features. Analysts believe the company is strongly positioned to start placing ads in AI search results, which means its core ads business will not be impacted despite the decline in traditional search.
Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is successfully executing on its vast AI potential. The company’s key advantages – stemming from industry-leading models, a full-stack approach to technical infrastructure (including proprietary chips), access to high-quality data, rapidly improving product launch velocity and a robust distribution ecosystem of seven different apps with over two billion users each – are beginning to meaningfully widen Google’s moat and competitive differentiation in AI."

Stocks have been seeing some gains so far in October with the major indices reaching record closes. However, our next guest outlines why there is reason to be cautious and what that means for traders. Bob Lang, explosive options technical analyst joining us here now with the Options Playbook sponsored by Tasty Trade. Bob, great to see you, especially on set, sir. Uh let's start here. So the VIX perking up as it does tend to do this time of year, right? How do you play that, Bob? You know, are you concerned enough to buy protection on the general market?
Well, I look uh Josh, great to be with you. So I look at volatility in in terms of time frames, right? And when the market's been up for 7, eight, nine months of the year, like it is this year, it tends to lead to bullish behavior to the end of the year. And when that happens, we usually see a suppression of volatility. Now, the VIX is hovering around 16 17%, which is a little bit lower than normal. The average uh VIX is about 19 20%.
But it's a little bit lower than normal. It it's really feeding into more money coming into the market. Lower volatility tends to make people a little bit more relaxed, a little bit more uh aggressive into the markets. Um I think that that can be a little bit worrisome, especially since we're worried about um some uncertainties coming out here. and anything could hit out of left field, you know, whether it's tariff related or whether it's AI or whether it's something else or some earnings uh shortfalls coming up the next few weeks. I think it's really behooves most people to have some protection on and either buying volatility or else you're buying um puts, put options are very cheap right now. um with the VIX been at 16 17%. So I think that that's a that
Your bottom line is some caution is warranted here.
Absolutely.
Okay. I want to talk about AI as well. Lots of hot talk about an AI bubble from, you know, some very well respected investors saying, hey, they hear echoes of 1999. What's your what's your take on that?
Josh, you know there's always a bubble going on. There's always bubble somewhere. Um I I look, I go back to the the late 80s, right? There was a bubble in biotech. In the late 90s, there was a bubble in uh .com names in technology.
Does a bubble have to burst for you to know there was a bubble?
No, in fact, actually, you know what? The people who identify bubbles are the ones who actually are not into it. I was in the bubble during the late 90s, during the .com and I was loving it. It was great, making lots of money. And I'm sure right now, if there's a bubble going on in AI, there's a lot of people making money. Are they complaining at all? Absolutely not. So, you know, it's it's only at the end of the of the ride that people are getting upset and and and disgusted about.
Look, I mean there was some um talk from uh Paul Tudor Jones the other day. talking about, Yeah, I think yesterday he said, you know, we're in a bubble right now similar to that we're late 99 2000. And he did reference the period between October of 1999 to March 2000 where the NASDAQ went up 80%. Well, I I remember that time and I remember that a lot of short sellers got blown out of the water then during that six- month period.
So, you know, I I think you just have to keep it in context and keep the reference point is there of course uh that when you know, the market blew up and the Nasdaq dropped 72% from the highs in March of 2000 to uh to 2001. So, you you do have that reference point there, but I I do think that we really don't have to fear the fact that we're in a bubble right now. It's just make money as you can.
Um, let's get to some trades. Sticking with AI, talking about Google.
Google. So, um this has been a stock that's been one of my favorites over the past few months. And it's up something 70% since the lows in April. Um it's kind of consolidating right now. I do like the I like like the chart here. Um if it gets above 250, 253, it's got some room to to run. So I'm looking at maybe like a like a March call for uh for Google, maybe even even to January of a little bit shorter term.
But uh I'm looking at a call maybe paying about $17 in March. And if it gets past a certain level, about 253 to 255, this stock's got some got some leg to uh to run. I think that in 2026, this is going to be the year of Alphabet or Google. I think with the with a positive business environment, you've got lower interest rates coming in over the next couple of months and into 2026. And then uh deregulatory environment and also, you know, we've seen uh Google come out and settle with uh with the with the English government. And they got lawsuits with Europe and I think even in the United States, they're going to be settling these lawsuits and it's going to be a tail one for the stock.
And OpenAI, they're not going to come in and and just take search, Google's bread and butter.
I I think that Google's got a a real good foothold in this and look, they're number one in search. They they they continue to expand that footprint and search and there there really is no competition for them. And I I think going forward, um yeah, OpenAI is going to be some competition, but there's also other competitors out there too. There's Microsoft, there's Amazon, there's Apple too.
Speaking of Microsoft, you got a trade there, too?
Like I really like Microsoft. It's uh created a nice little bull shaped pattern here, Josh and it it ran up uh had an unbelievable run in the summertime, came back down, made a low here and it's making the higher highs and higher low, which is our textbook definition of an uptrend. And I I do like um Microsoft going into earnings season. Um I think it's going to make a run past uh 550 um and if it gets past that 550 marker, which is the old high back in early August, um I think it's got to run to 600.
Bob, always great to see you. Appreciate your time and those trades, sir.

“There’s no notion that Google has to date gained monopoly or market power” in the artificial intelligence market, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein told Judge Amit Mehta. Likewise, “there’s been no finding that Maps is a monopoly product or that YouTube is a monopoly product.”
Mehta, who found that Google has monopolized search and search advertising, is crafting a remedy to resolve the company’s illegal conduct. In a decision last month, he ruled that Google could no longer pay companies to exclusively use its Search, Chrome web browser or Google Play Store, though he declined to bar all payments outright. Mehta’s ruling incorporated aspects of proposals from Google and the Justice Department, which led to Wednesday’s hearing where both sides argued for him to adopt their language in a final order.
During the trial, witnesses testified that Google offers an “all-or-nothing” bundle to device manufactures, effectively requiring they preload nearly a dozen of Google’s apps if they want access to the the Play Store, the largest app store on Google’s Android operating system. That requirement, for example, forced Microsoft Corp. to feature Google search on its Surface Duo touchscreen device instead of its own search engine, Bing.
The Justice Department argued that the same prohibitions that apply to Search, Chrome and Play should also apply to Google’s Gemini, a proposal the company opposes.
Google’s YouTube is the TV service of choice for viewers of all ages, Bloomberg has reported. It now accounts for more than all of Walt Disney Co.’s TV networks and streaming services combined, according to recent data from Nielsen. It also generates more sales from advertising than all four broadcast networks combined, and users collectively watch over 1 billion hours of video on YouTube every day.
Google Maps, meanwhile, dominates the digital mapping and navigation market by a significant margin. Last year, the service surpassed 2 billion monthly users globally, placing it among a handful of Google’s most widely used products. Comparatively, Apple Inc. had “hundreds of millions” of Apple Maps users in 2020, the company has said. More than 5 million other apps and websites also rely on the Google Maps Platform to power location services like navigation and local business data."

In a new note, the firm called the artificial intelligence leader “the biggest case yet of Silicon Valley’s vaunted fake it ’till you make it ethos.”
“AI is a game of kings, and OpenAI knows it,” DA Davidson said, adding that the “staggering amount of compute required to build increasingly powerful frontier models” means that only a handful of companies, “MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META and Elon Inc,” can afford to compete.
According to the firm, “OpenAI has the lead with the top frontier model and the top AI chat app, and is trying to leverage that lead to become an instant mega cap.”
But its dominance “is still somewhat tenuous,” as “Google has made significant strides,” while “Anthropic is state-of-the-art for programming,” and “Meta and Elon are deploying tens of billions to catch up.”
DA Davidson said OpenAI is “likely at a $16bn revenue run rate” but “losing around $10bn this year.” Despite that, it “has embarked on its ambitious attempt to fake it ‘till you make it,” with “commitments now exceeding $500bn.”
“This is working so far,” the firm said, citing “the recent release of Sora 2,” which “represents a breakthrough in democratizing video generation.”
The firm concluded, “We prefer core AI winners MSFT and NVDA,” saying that “even if OpenAI does not ultimately succeed in becoming an instant mega cap, NVDA will have plenty of demand for its chips and MSFT will have plenty of AI customers.”

Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) is putting $10 billion into a massive new data center hub in India, underscoring how central the country has become to the company's global strategy.
The project, located in Andhra Pradesh, will include three campuses in Adavivaram, Tarluvada, and Rambilli. Once complete, it will provide about 1 gigawatt of computing capacity and form the backbone of what Google calls India's first international AI Infrastructure Hub.
Before building can start, the Andhra Pradesh State Investment Promotion Board still needs to give its approval. Next week, Google executives will go to New Delhi to meet with state officials and sign the contract.The company says the project will also include major upgrades to India's digital backbone new submarine cables, cable landing stations, and fiber networks aimed at speeding up internet connections and supporting local research and businesses.
Big tech companies from around the world are doing the same thing in India. Amazon (AMZN) is spending $8.2 billion to make its cloud network bigger, and Microsoft (MSFT) is spending $3 billion to make its Azure platform bigger. OpenAI is also looking at working with local businesses to build additional AI data centers.
Analysts remain positive on Alphabet's outlook. The stock carries a Strong Buy rating with an average price target of $247.06. Shares are up about 30% this year.
If approved, the Andhra Pradesh project will be Google's biggest infrastructure investment in India and a major step in turning the country into an AI hub for the region."

But there's a catch that investors need to understand.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7e31ed3ec33fef0e0837d59bdb1bda0187214bc72eecdc03b6f62a7ed2ecfde5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/amd-openai-payday-starts-in-a-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/amd-openai-payday-starts-in-a-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/amd-openai-payday-starts-in-a-year/,fool.com,200.0,,"Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.05%) just inked a headline-grabbing artificial intelligence (AI) partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI -- but investors shouldn't expect big sales right out of the gate.
The OpenAI contract is indeed a big deal. However, the revenue clock doesn't start until the second half of 2026, with the real ramp-up to follow in 2027. Each gigawatt-scale tranche of AMD's Instinct MI450 and Helios rack installations could translate into double-digit billions of annual AI-related data center revenue once ramped. You just have to give AMD some time to get its number-crunching ducks in a row.
AMD's AI superhighway won't open until late 2026
AMD is finally getting the green light to build a 6-gigawatt AI superhighway with OpenAI. But it takes time to deliver on a project this big.
The on-ramp opens in late 2026, when the first AMD MI450/Helios systems go live. Traffic really starts moving in 2027, when each new lane -- Instinct chips and Helios racks -- can add many billions of annual revenue once it's humming along at full scale. AMD's management expects the partnership to add more than $100 billion to the company's sales over ""the next few years,"" including direct OpenAI shipments and a smattering of additional deals inspired by this week's announcement.
The speed limit and mile markers are baked into a complex set of stock warrants: OpenAI unlocks vesting based on actual chip deployments and AMD share-price targets.
If all targets are met, OpenAI could acquire up to 160 million AMD shares in five years. That's about 10% of the 1.6 billion shares AMD has in circulation today. The final tranche takes effect when AMD's stock reaches $600 per share. That's about triple the stock's closing price on Oct. 6.
Whether OpenAI goes public or not, this structure gives the private company market-based performance incentives. It's a great road for AMD and a genuine route around Nvidia's pricey tollbooths -- but it's a long drive with scheduled maintenance, not an instant teleport.
AMD and OpenAI can still see other people
Crucially, this contract is nonexclusive. AMD can sell MI450/Helios to anyone, and OpenAI will keep buying AI accelerators from Nvidia (NVDA -0.08%) (and possibly others) because the world needs every ounce of AI compute it can get nowadays.
You're watching the industry shift into a multivendor phase -- less obviously dominated by Nvidia, more about second-sourcing and managing the total cost of ownership. The AI accelerator industry suddenly looks more competitive. AMD's Instinct chips may not win many head-to-head performance comparisons against Nvidia's Blackwell family, but the math often changes when you include power consumption in those calculations.
The domino effect: Who's next in line to buy AMD chips?
Will OpenAI rivals like Anthropic, X, Meta Platforms, or Alphabet's Google follow with big AMD orders? That's hard to tell, and some of it may already be happening behind closed doors. It's fair to say that OpenAI tends to set the tone in the AI market, and others tend to follow suit when the ChatGPT maker takes a big step.
Wall Street was quick to embrace the news either way. AMD stock hit a fresh all-time high on the announcement, arguably for good reason: This deal is real validation and a clearer line of sight to big AI dollars for the chip-supplier underdog.
You just need to give the top line some time to expand, since the OpenAI sales won't start flowing until the second half of 2026. But you know what they say about patience being a virtue, especially on Wall Street. Big, juicy AI revenue streams are coming AMD's way, just not right away."

The robotaxi service delivered over 2.2 million fully driverless rides in the second quarter of 2025, representing 148% year-over-year growth and signalling robust operational momentum as the platform scales globally.
Strategic partnerships with Uber and Lyft mark a pivotal shift in Baidu's international expansion strategy. These collaborations will deploy thousands of Apollo Go vehicles across Asia, the Middle East and Europe, leveraging established mobility platforms to accelerate market entry while maintaining an asset-light model. The approach addresses previous concerns about capital intensity in autonomous vehicle deployment and creates pathways to higher-margin international markets where ride fares substantially exceed those in China.
The unit economics story strengthens the investment thesis considerably. Apollo Go achieved unit-level profitability in Wuhan, where taxi fares run approximately 30% below tier-one Chinese cities and significantly under international market rates. This operational efficiency, combined with RT6, the world's first purpose-built Level 4 autonomous vehicle with the lowest-in-class unit costs, positions Baidu to capture substantial value in premium fare markets overseas. The Hong Kong expansion into complex right-hand drive environments demonstrates technical capabilities that few competitors have achieved at commercial scale.
As Baidu diversifies its revenue base, Apollo Go’s contribution could become increasingly meaningful. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2025 revenues is pegged at $4.34 billion, reflecting a 9.33% year-over-year decline as the company transitions toward a more balanced mix beyond online marketing. However, Apollo Go’s expanding international operations and improving unit economics are expected to offset this temporary softness over time. With proven technology, operational efficiency, and growing global reach, Apollo Go remains well-positioned to power Baidu’s next phase of long-term growth.
Competition Heats Up in Global Autonomous Mobility
Baidu faces intensifying competition in autonomous driving from Tesla TSLA and Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo, both of which are scaling similar driverless mobility initiatives. Tesla continues expanding its Full Self Driving technology through over-the-air updates, enhancing its capability for wider commercial deployment across global markets. Alphabet’s Waymo, meanwhile, is ramping operations in the United States with growing ride-hailing coverage and stronger fleet utilization metrics. While Baidu’s Apollo Go focuses on mass market robotaxi commercialisation, Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo are reinforcing their positions in premium autonomous transport, underscoring the race for global leadership in self-driving innovation."

We recently published Top 10 Trending Stocks as Famous Billionaire Predicts Massive AI Stock Rally Before Bubble Burst. CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the trending stocks.
Amit Daryanani, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, said in a latest program on CNBC that CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ:CRWV) is positioned to benefit from the rising AI infrastructure demand. He recently started covering the stock with a $175 price target.
“You have Microsoft and Meta over here and hopefully other customers as well. I do think fundamentally what’s happening with them right now is demand for AI infrastructure is far in excess of what supply is. Coreweave is positioned to benefit really well from having one of the largest independent GPU clusters — 250,000 plus GPUs — that a lot of customers beyond just Microsoft and Meta could use. I would argue customers like Google and others could look at this as well to meet incremental demand, because that’s really what the shortage is right now: there’s not enough supply to go around for all these companies.”

CHGG witnessed a gloomy second quarter of 2025, with revenues of $105.1 million being down 36% year over year and subscription services revenues falling 39% to $89.7 million. The subscriber base plunged 40% to 2.6 million, largely due to lower traffic stemming from Google’s AI Overviews. However, amid a steep fall in the top line, the company maintained a robust streak of cost-cutting, which is aimed at stabilizing its profitability structure.
Chegg is currently taking aggressive steps to reduce its total operating expenses across multiple fronts, including workforce reduction and office closures, necessary cuts in operating expenses, lease and real estate rationalizations and significant capital expenditure reductions. Through these restructuring efforts, during the first six months of 2025, its total operating expenses declined year over year by 72% to $202.5 million. Besides, owing to CHGG’s disciplined cost management and restructuring actions, it expects to realize adjusted expense savings of between $165 million and $175 million for 2025, with an additional $100-$110 million in adjusted savings expected in 2026.
However, sustaining margins will depend on how fast Chegg can offset subscriber erosion with growth in its Busuu and Skills businesses. Given the increased demand for AI tools across digital learning, CHGG is intently focusing on incorporating AI into its business model through its diversified service offerings, including Chegg Study, Chegg Skills and Busuu, and shifting away from its Q&A-based subscription model.
Along with the cost management efforts, the business enhancement strategies are expected to catalyze Chegg’s margin scale in the upcoming term.
Chegg’s Market Competition Position
Chegg operates in a highly competitive landscape that spans school programs, online education and digital learning services. Key market players like Duolingo, Inc. DUOL and Udemy, Inc. UDMY represent distinct yet overlapping challenges within the broader edtech ecosystem.
Duolingo dominates the language-learning niche with its gamified app and AI-driven engagement. With a strong mobile presence and daily user engagement, Duolingo has built a brand synonymous with accessible, bite-sized learning. Contrarily, Udemy has aggressively leveraged AI-powered upskilling, launching its Innovation Studio, acquiring Lummi to enhance course material creation (particularly in visuals and design), and introducing generative AI tools such as AI Learning Assistants and Role Plays for soft skills development.
Compared with Duolingo and Udemy, Chegg’s legacy content base, existing learners and its Busuu platform give it a foothold in language learning and academic support. Overall, Chegg’s edge over Duolingo and Udemy is modest, as it can survive and even thrive if its AI enhancements are well-executed comparatively."

AI hyperscalers are spending billions of dollars on AI computing equipment, and that trend doesn't appear to be slowing anytime soon. However, there's another important computing trend that's on the horizon, and it could have significant ramifications in the AI space.
Quantum computing is the next big computing trend coming, and it could affect the AI realm. By picking the right stocks, investors can take advantage of both trends, making the stocks involved in both fantastic options to buy and hold over the next decade.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.85%) is a leader in both the AI and quantum computing realms. In quantum computing, it kicked off a miniature quantum computing investment rush last December when it announced the results of its Willow quantum computing chip. Alphabet has a massive incentive to develop its own in-house quantum computing solution, as it won't have to purchase expensive computing units from third-party vendors like Nvidia. Alphabet has nearly unlimited resources to spend on quantum computing compared to some of the pure plays, and this advantage could yield a viable quantum computing solution.
Alphabet also has a leading generative AI model in Gemini that has emerged as one of the top picks. Quantum computing could be the technology necessary to take AI to the next step, and if Alphabet develops a strong in-house solution, it could propel it to win both the quantum computing and AI arms races.
Even if it fails at both, it still has a strong base business to fall back on. Alphabet is a great pick in both the AI and quantum computing spaces, but it's also a relatively safe investment.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Quantum computing requires specialized chips to help make sense of the calculations. The best semiconductor company in the world is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.14%), and it will be heavily involved in the quantum computing realm, just like it is with the AI arms race.
Taiwan Semiconductor is constantly developing new technology, with the latest advancement coming from 2nm chips. An investment in Taiwan Semiconductor is a bet that the world is going to need more advanced chips in greater quantities, which is a no-brainer idea. By the time quantum computing becomes commercially viable, Taiwan Semiconductor will have already developed several new generations of chips, which could have massive ramifications in the quantum computing realm, including whether it's worth the cost over classical computing methods.
Time will tell which quantum computing company develops a winning solution, but odds are that chips going into these processing units will likely be sourced from TSMC.
3. Nvidia
Nvidia is the undisputed king of AI investing, but has no plans to develop a quantum processing unit. However, that doesn't mean that it's ignoring the quantum computing realm. Instead, it's focusing on ways to integrate quantum computing devices into existing classical computing networks that feature its graphics processing units (GPUs) in a hybrid approach. This is a genius path to take, as the quantum computing realm is highly competitive, and Nvidia doesn't want to take its focus off of what it does best.
Nvidia has adapted its CUDA software to the quantum realm and has launched it as CUDA-Q. This provides quantum computing developers the same technology that allowed its GPUs to dominate the AI arms race, and will also lock users into deploying the Nvidia ecosystem to support quantum computers.
By investing in Nvidia, you're capturing the bulk of the AI computing power buildout while also bridging the gap to the next big technology. Furthermore, by not ignoring the massive AI spending that's going on now, you reduce the risk of missing out on huge returns that may or may not come from quantum computing, as the technology is still working on establishing commercial viability."

""There are elements of investor behaviour and market pricing currently that rhyme with previous bubbles,"" Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman's chief global equity strategist, wrote in a new note. ""However, we see key differences.""
The report pointed to several similarities between today's market and past speculative booms. Valuations are climbing, market leadership is narrowing, and capital intensity is increasing. Additionally, the emergence of vendor financing in the AI space is echoing dynamics seen in the late-1990s tech bubble.
Oppenheimer pointed out that bubbles typically occur when the combined market value of companies linked to a new technology far exceeds the cash flows they can realistically generate. That disconnect hasn't happened yet, he said.
The AI boom so far has been led by a group of tech giants — including Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) — with little sign of the explosive competition that typically fuels market excess.
Indeed, Big Tech's dominance has ballooned. The five largest US tech companies are now worth more than the combined markets of the EURO STOXX 50 (^STOXX50E), the UK, India, Japan, and Canada. Meanwhile, the 10 biggest US stocks — eight of which are tied to tech — account for nearly a quarter (24.5%) of the entire global equity market, at roughly $25 trillion.
That level of concentration could raise bubble comparisons and has even prompted investors to start questioning ""whether all of this is rational or ... classic signs of an unsustainable bubble.""
But unlike those earlier episodes, Oppenheimer argues that today's rally has been supported by strong fundamentals, ""rather than irrational speculation about future growth."" The report also noted the biggest winners — such as leading AI and cloud companies — have unusually strong balance sheets, providing a cushion that many dot-com firms lacked.
Still, Oppenheimer isn't dismissing concerns outright. Valuations in the technology sector are ""becoming stretched,"" the note said, citing a range of metrics including P/E ratios, PEG ratios, price-to-book versus return on equity, and dividend discount models.
However, those valuations have not yet reached the extreme levels seen in past bubbles, such as the dot-com era or the late stages of the 2020-2021 tech surge.
For now, the rally appears to be on firmer ground, though not without risks."

(GOOG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this company have returned +3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.29 per share, indicating a change of +8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.96 points to a change of +23.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.64 indicates a change of +6.9% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."

ARLINGTON, Va., Oct. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) announces a new initiative to develop an infrastructure-focused Data Center Quality Standard aimed at advancing operational excellence, reliability, and sustainability in the rapidly expanding global data center market.
Driven by the growth of AI, cloud computing, and digital services, demand for data centers is increasing worldwide. According to McKinsey & Company, global demand is expected to triple by 2030, with U.S. demand projected to grow 20–25% annually. Meeting this need will require an estimated $6.7 trillion in global capital investment by the end of the decade, including $5.2 trillion specifically for AI-ready data centers. Amid this unprecedented growth and complexity, the absence of consistent standards across critical components and infrastructure can introduce vulnerabilities in implementation, uptime, sustainability, and lifecycle management. The industry needs trusted, unified quality standards that evolve in step with the pace and scale of investment.
Administered by TIA, the Data Center Quality Standard will build on existing quality and supply chain standards with an initial focus on data center physical infrastructure. This new standard will:
-
Establish a common framework for quality that operators, customers, regulators, and partners can trust.
-
Help streamline supplier qualification processes and reduce costly redundancies.
-
Provide a shared language and sets of practices for consistent performance across the industry.
-
Address reliability, sustainability, and lifecycle management—key areas driving customer decision-making.
Insights from Industry Leaders
""Beyond sheer demand, the physical complexity of data centers adds another layer of urgency. Facilities must integrate servers, networking equipment, storage systems, generators, and cooling towers—each with its own quality, reliability, and maintenance requirements,"" stated Gino Tozzi, Global Head of Data Center Infrastructure Quality at Google which recently joined TIA's QuEST Forum. ""Establishing a unified quality framework will help ensure these systems perform together seamlessly to support the industry's rapid growth.""
""TIA's mission is to bring the ICT industry together to create standards that solve real-world challenges,"" said Dave Stehlin, CEO of TIA. ""This initiative is both timely and essential and we believe this collaborative process will create a practical framework for global adoption of this Data Center Quality Standard."""

OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), a company that hasn’t turned a profit, is spending billions building out data centers to power its artificial intelligence offerings.
On Monday, the company inked a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that will see the chipmaker provide next-generation GPUs to OpenAI, which will also have the opportunity to purchase up to 10% of the company. Nvidia (NVDA), in turn, is pouring $100 billion into OpenAI, which is also a major customer.
Meanwhile, tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) continue to spend billions on their own AI data centers. Then there’s the $40 billion Oracle (ORCL) is spending on Nvidia chips to power OpenAI’s Project Stargate, the Financial Times reported in May.
It all makes for a rather confusing array of deals and moves that continue to raise questions about when exactly all of this spending will turn into profits, not to mention the specter of the dot-com crash of the early 2000s.
But even if the AI hype cycle plays out like the dot-com bubble, a good amount of that investment in AI infrastructure will still pay off, at least in the long run.
“I actually do believe that there is significant long-term demand,” Ram Bala, associate professor of business analytics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, told Yahoo Finance.
“I think it's definitely going to pan out. The macroeconomic challenge is ... there's probably going to be this intermediate phase where it seems like we overbuilt a lot of this and demand isn't quite catching up to all of that.”
Bubbling up
Fears of an AI bubble have been percolating for months as AI stock prices and corporate valuations have continued to soar. Nvidia, the world’s AI chip leader, has a market capitalization north of $4.5 trillion. On top of that, OpenAI is now valued at $500 billion, more than Elon Musk’s SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), which is valued at $400 billion.
The explosion in AI interest and the promise of future riches have also sent Microsoft and Google’s valuations above the $3 trillion mark, with Microsoft quickly closing in on $4 trillion.
It’s enough to raise the hair on anyone’s neck.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos last week said that we’re likely witnessing an AI bubble during a discussion at Italian Tech Week, but he added that some of those investments will eventually pay off.
""When people get very excited, as they are today, about artificial intelligence, for example ... every experiment gets funded, every company gets funded,"" Bezos said. ""The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and bad ideas."""

Alphabet Investment Narrative Recap
To believe in Alphabet as a shareholder, you need conviction that its leadership in AI and cloud technology will keep driving engagement, revenue, and margin growth, even as record-high capital expenditures put pressure on profitability. The Gemini AI milestone and recent tech rollouts reinforce critical long-term catalysts around Alphabet’s innovation engine, but do not materially change the ongoing legal and regulatory risks, which remain the key short-term concern for the business.
Among recent announcements, the integration of Reserve with Google into BOLT-ON TECHNOLOGY’s platform stands out for its immediate impact on operational efficiency and customer experience. Enhanced integration of Google’s services into everyday workflows continues to support Alphabet’s push for greater user engagement and monetization, directly tying back to the company’s most important revenue and margin drivers.

McKinsey is projecting that quantum computing revenue will jump from $4 billion in 2024 to as much as $72 billion by 2035.
One way to get exposure to the industry is by investing in tech companies with quantum computing segments, such as Alphabet. But if you're looking for growth potential and don't mind more risk, there's a different kind of quantum computing stock that's worth considering.
IonQ is a leader among pure-play quantum computing companies
IonQ (IONQ -6.07%) is one of a few pure-play quantum computing companies, with the other notable examples being Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum, and Quantum Computing. IonQ was the first to go public, and it also sets itself apart through its trapped-ion technology, which allows its quantum systems to operate at room temperature.
Of these companies, IonQ has also been the most successful so far and is the most reasonably priced. It has reported $52 million in revenue over the trailing 12 months, more than twice as much as any of its competitors. It's also trading at 319 times sales as of Oct. 3, and while that's high, it's less than the valuations on the rest of the aforementioned quantum computing companies.

Billionaire investor Steve Eisman warns of a very different economic reality if one were to remove the gains of AI from the equation.
The financial analyst best-known for predicting the 2008 housing collapse—and made famous by the 2015 film The Big Short—said on a recent episode of The Real Eisman Playbook podcast that the U.S. economy is a “tale of two cities”: While GDP growth may indicate a robust economy, by removing AI expenditures from the picture, you instead see stagnation.
The U.S. GDP in 2024 was $29.18 trillion, estimated to grow by 1.8% in 2025, Eisman said. That 1.8% growth is worth about $530 billion. But if you were to factor in the AI infrastructure spending by Magnificent Seven companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, it would total about $400 billion, by Eisman’s calculations, meaning if you were to subtract that sum from the projected growth of U.S. GDP, it would amount to very little.
“The U.S. economy is not even growing, really, 50 basis points outside of AI,” Eisman said. “So clearly there have to be pockets of weakness.”
A wealth of economists and tech giants have warned of an expanding AI bubble as investments in the technology mount with little robust evidence so far of the technology’s transformative ability. As concerns over little job growth and creeping inflation grow, so too does worry about the health of the U.S. economy.
Signs of a limping consumer piles onto these fears. According to a New York Federal Reserve Bank report released in August, household debt increased by $185 billion to reach $18.39 trillion in 2025’s second quarter, while auto loan balances increased by $13 billion, hitting $1.66 trillion. Student loan balances also inched up $7 billion to total $1.64 trillion.
“The pain is going to happen across the board,” Lakshmi Ganapathi, founder of investment research firm Unicus Research, told Eisman on the podcast. “It’s in the retail. It’s in the buy-now-pay-later. It’s definitely in the auto.”
Warning signs in the auto sector
Ganapathi points to the auto sector as a case study for a hidden way consumers are struggling. During the pandemic, the stimulus checks many Americans received—totaling 476 million payments worth $814 billion—made consumers appear wealthier than they really were to banks, she said. This allowed them to qualify for prime loans, despite not truly having that wealth.
“The credit score prime was an illusion,” Ganapathi said. “Whatever the prime credit scores that are sitting on the [asset-backed security] are technically subprime.”
The pandemic also marked a period of booming car sales, many above sticker price, as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) hiked prices as a result of supply-chain issues and increased consumer demand."

Most Wall Street analysts see the drawdown as a buying opportunity. The average target price of $70 per share implies 32% upside from its current share price of $53. And the highest target price of $135 per share (set by Shyam Patil at Susquehanna) implies 155% upside.
A few successful hedge fund managers opened positions in The Trade Desk during the second quarter, as detailed below:
- Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management bought 533,200 shares.
- Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global bought 2.6 million shares.
- Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management purchased 998,900 shares.
Importantly, while none of the hedge funds above started particularly large positions in The Trade Desk, their purchases are still noteworthy. Additionally, all three fund managers beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.37%) during the last three years, which makes them good role models for retail investors.
The Trade Desk has a key advantage in its independent business model
The Trade Desk is the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in the adtech industry. Its software lets brands and agencies plan, measure, and optimize data-driven campaigns across digital channels. Its platform features cutting-edge omnichannel capabilities and artificial intelligence (AI) tools that help media buyers manage budgets, evaluate inventory, and target campaigns, according to Frost & Sullivan analysts.
The digital advertising industry is dominated by walled gardens, ecosystems where a single company controls most of the ad supply chain. Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms are perfect examples. They control ad inventory and data across web properties like Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram; they also own the adtech software required to run campaigns on those websites and applications.
The Trade Desk avoids those conflicts of interest with its independent business model, meaning it does not own web properties or advertising inventory. In turn, the company has earned a reputation for objectivity and transparency that has made it the most popular DSP for the open web. The Trade Desk is especially dominant in connected TV (CTV) advertising due to partnerships with Netflix, Roku, and Walt Disney.
However, the company also has a strong presence in offsite retail advertising, meaning ads that use first-party retail data to target consumers through third-party websites and applications. The Trade Desk sources data from Walmart, Target, Albertsons, and many other large retailers, to help customers grade and fine-tune campaign performance.
Retailers may hesitate to share data with competitors like Google, simply because Google could use the data to sell its own advertising inventory. ""Objectivity is a major factor here,"" The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green told analysts on the second-quarter earnings call. ""We do not compete with retailers and only an independent, objective partner like us can truly help advertisers unlock this opportunity.""
The Trade Desk stock crashed after its second-quarter earnings report
The Trade Desk reported somewhat disappointing financial results in the second quarter, despite beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 19% to $694 million and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings jumped 5% to $0.41 per diluted share. Green said, ""With our leadership in CTV as well as other areas such as retail media, digital audio, identity, measurement, and data, we are winning more business.""
Nevertheless, the stock fell nearly 40% following the report due to intensifying concerns about competition. Meta Platforms and Amazon reported faster advertising sales growth, marking the reversal of a long-standing trend where The Trade Desk regularly outpaced its largest rivals. Additionally, Amazon recently struck deals with Netflix and Roku that could erode The Trade Desk's dominance in CTV advertising.
However, investors should consider the big picture: While The Trade Desk stock has declined 55% year to date due to concerns about competition, shares now trade at 30 times adjusted earnings. That is not cheap, but the valuation is reasonable for a company whose adjusted earnings are forecast to increase by 16% annually through 2027.
Additionally, Wall Street may be underestimating future earnings. The Trade Desk has a competitive moat in its independent business model and its status as the leading demand-side platform for the open internet, which may lead to an acceleration in top- and bottom-line growth beyond what analysts anticipate. In that light, now is a good time to buy a small position."

He is the portfolio manager at Coatue Management, a hedge fund that beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.37%) by 122 percentage points during the three-year period that ended in June.
Laffont made some notable trades in the second quarter. He sold 596,100 shares of Amazon (AMZN -0.56%), trimming his stake 5%. He also bought 3.3 million shares of CoreWeave (CRWV 3.69%), an AI stock backed by Nvidia (NVDA -0.08%), which now ranks as his largest holding at 8% of his portfolio. CoreWeave stock is up 230% since going public earlier this year.
Here's what investor should know.
Amazon: The stock Philippe Laffont sold in the second quarter
Amazon has a strong presence in three big industries. The company accounts for more than 40% of U.S. e-commerce sales and 15% of digital ad spending, and it's gaining share in both markets. Also, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts for 30% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending, nearly as much market share as Microsoft and Alphabet hold combined.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of the growth strategy. In retail, AI tools help allocate inventory, forecast demand, and streamline last-mile delivery. In advertising, generative AI tools help brands create images, videos, and audio for campaigns. In cloud computing, AWS regularly introduces features to support AI workflows, such as recently added tools for building and managing AI agents.
Amazon reported second-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 13% to $167 billion on particularly strong growth in advertising and cloud services. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 1.5 percentage points as AI innovations continued to drive efficiency, and GAAP net income increased 33% to $1.68 per diluted share.
Wall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings seem fair. My guess is Philippe Laffont trimmed his position to rebalance his portfolio after Amazon stock popped in the second quarter. Whatever the reason, I am confident the decision to sell does not reflect a lack of conviction. Amazon is still his third largest position at 6% of his portfolio.
CoreWeave: The Nvidia-backed AI stock Philippe Laffont bought in the second quarter
CoreWeave is the leader among an emerging class of cloud computing platforms known as GPU clouds or AI clouds. Whereas traditional clouds like AWS and Microsoft Azure were built for a broad range of workloads, CoreWeave designed its data centers specifically for artificial intelligence and it was recently ranked as the most capable AI cloud services provider by SemiAnalysis, a research company that specializes in the semiconductor industry.
""CoreWeave's product offerings sets a new standard across the GPU cloud industry,"" wrote Chief Analyst Dylan Patel. ""As demand for high-performance compute continues to grow, CoreWeave's investments in software and hardware infrastructure makes them a clear leader in GPU cloud reliability."" The report highlighted its close partnership with Nvidia as a key strength because it affords the company early access to the latest GPUs.
CoreWeave reported explosive second-quarter financial results. Revenue surged 207% to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income increased 135% to $200 million. Meanwhile, revenue backlog jumped 86% due to expanded contracts with OpenAI and an unnamed hyperscale customer (likely Microsoft or Alphabet). And there has been more good news since the quarter ended. CoreWeave last month announced a $14 billion deal with Meta Platforms.
As a caveat, CoreWeave has a substantial amount of debt due to its furious buildout of AI data centers, so much so that interest expense erased more than 20% of revenue in the second quarter. However, while investors should monitor the metric, borrowing money to capitalize on demand for AI infrastructure is not unreasonable, and CEO Michael Intrator says the company only takes on debt when a signed contract covers the costs.
Wall Street expects CoreWeave's revenue to increase at 90% annually through 2027. That makes the current valuation of 15 times sales look reasonable. Additionally, Nvidia evidently has a great deal of confidence in CoreWeave because 91% of its portfolio is invested in the company. The stock has been volatile since its March IPO, but patient investors comfortable with price swings should consider buying a small position today."

QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) continues to hold its position as a leader in smartphone chip technology, staying ahead of the curve with new processors that now include built-in AI capabilities. Its supply deal with Apple runs through March 2027, which should help sustain sales in the near term. The company also maintains a strong foothold in premium smartphones powered by Alphabet’s Android software. With signs of another smartphone upgrade cycle emerging, investors who have waited patiently may finally see better returns.
So far in fiscal 2025, which ended on June 29, smartphone chips have accounted for about 63% of QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s total revenue. However, the company is working to lessen its dependence on this segment. It’s placing more focus on its IoT and automotive businesses, both of which are seen as promising growth engines that could help offset any decline in Apple-related revenue.
QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s dividend growth streak of 21 consecutive years also makes it a prominent investment in the eyes of income investors. With a quarterly dividend of $0.89 per share, QCOM has a dividend yield of 2.11%.

Reeves called the new centre, part of a £5bn investment pledge from Google, a “powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy”. Labour is desperate to attract more spending like this to Britain, strengthening efforts to kickstart growth.
But growing fears of an unsustainable artificial intelligence (AI) bubble could jeopardise this entirely.
AI optimists predict the technology will deliver a world of abundance and breakneck economic growth, brought about by huge productivity gains, scientific breakthroughs and legions of robots.
But a different kind of AI boom is already here, brought about by a colossal spending drive on data centres, artificial intelligence chips and the energy needed to bring about that future.
In the US, spending on new data centres is believed to have been one of the main economic drivers in recent months.
In particular, Jason Furman, the Harvard economist, says IT equipment and software accounted for 92pc of GDP growth in the first half of the year.
As a result, economists at Deutsche Bank said last week that data centre investments are helping bail out a US economy that would otherwise be hard hit by an immigration crackdown and Donald Trump’s tariffs.
“In the absence of tech-related spending, the US would be close to, or in, recession this year,” they said.
To ensure the wheels keep turning on America’s data centre blitz, the White House has been courting tech executives that officials instinctively dislike, such as Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI’s Sam Altman.
That only looks likely to accelerate in the coming months. Altman, the creator of ChatGPT, has promised to spend $500bn over the next four years on a “Stargate” project to develop the computing power required to develop AI.
Oracle, the IT giant founded by Trump ally Larry Ellison, is building many of those data centres, and is expected to issue around $65bn in debt over the next three years to do so.
Meanwhile, Zuckerberg has said Meta plans to invest $600bn by the end of 2028."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-08T00:00:00,Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be the Nvidia of Quantum Computing by 2035,"Nvidia currently dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but another big-tech peer could be better positioned for the rise of quantum applications.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=90faba3f5000f4b075f9f6ec9e8944335a3570cd6f0c66542059fc63fd451974,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/prediction-this-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-w/,fool.com,200.0,,"Every major technology wave has produced its defining infrastructure giant. The internet had Cisco. The smartphone era was molded by Apple. And today's artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is dominated by Nvidia. But as AI begins shifting toward more advanced frontiers -- most notably quantum computing -- another contender may rise to the forefront: Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.89%).
Alphabet stands out with unmatched depth across research, hardware, and software. The company is deliberately weaving these assets together to build a powerful ecosystem designed not just for today's AI race, but for the quantum era that lies ahead.
DeepMind: Alphabet's research powerhouse
One of Alphabet's clearest strengths in the AI race is DeepMind. More than just a research and development (R&D) project, DeepMind has become Alphabet's intellectual engine. Its work has produced breakthroughs across reinforcement learning, computing simulations, and optimization -- advancements that flow directly into Google's products.
TPUs: Alphabet's hardware advantage
Nvidia cemented its dominance by making GPUs and its CUDA software indispensable for machine learning. Alphabet has followed a similar playbook with its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- custom-built accelerators designed specifically for deep learning and neural networks.
Integrated directly into Google Cloud, TPUs provide more than just raw processing power; they give Alphabet a structural edge over rivals like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
This hardware-software integration has attracted high-profile customers including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Safe Superintelligence, all of which rely on Google's TPU network. Alphabet isn't positioning itself as just another cloud provider -- it is strategically building an end-to-end tool chain designed for the future of more sophisticated AI workloads.
Cirq: Alphabet's quantum developer toolkit
The final piece of the puzzle is Cirq, Alphabet's open-source framework for quantum programming. Much like Nvidia's CUDA architecture, Cirq equips developers with the tools to experiment with quantum applications today while quietly binding them into Alphabet's broader ecosystem for tomorrow.
While quantum computing may still be in its infancy, Cirq ensures that researchers and enterprises can get ahead of the curve by starting to build algorithms now. As quantum AI matures, these early adopters will already be embedded within Alphabet's framework. In this way, the company is methodically transforming what was once a speculative pocket of the AI realm into the foundation for mainstream infrastructure.
Valuation implications: Alphabet's quantum AI future
For investors, the central question is whether Alphabet's vision will translate into measurable financial results. Over the next decade, the company's AI and quantum initiatives could reshape its revenue mix and profitability profile in some powerful ways:
- Cloud upside: Google Cloud is already operating at an annual revenue run rate of $54 billion -- but this runway is far from peaking. As more enterprises look to diversify beyond Nvidia's ecosystem, Alphabet's TPUs provide a scalable, enterprise-grade alternative. This dynamic could push Google Cloud's revenue well past $100 billion annually by next decade.
- Ecosystem lock-in: Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson recently valued the combined potential of DeepMind and TPUs at nearly $900 billion. When Cirq is layered on top of this stack, Alphabet gains a first-mover advantage in quantum AI applications -- similar to how CUDA secured Nvidia's leadership position. The result is higher switching costs for businesses and a formidable technological moat built to last for the long term.
If Alphabet executes on this vision, it will successfully reframe itself in the eyes of the market -- no longer seen primarily as an ad-tech company vulnerable to cyclical budgets. Instead, the company could be valued like an AI infrastructure leader. Against this backdrop, the company's valuation multiples could expand to reflect its role as a ubiquitous technology platform rather than just an advertising behemoth.
Over the next 10 years, Alphabet could emerge as the backbone of quantum-powered infrastructure -- a strategy with the potential to add trillions in market capitalization and redefine the company not just as a search powerhouse, but as the default platform on which the next era of AI is built."

What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat?
Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them.
I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility.
On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this.
I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value.
What do you make of that, Dan?
These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future.
They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future.
The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future.
And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out.
The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold.
So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend.
But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."

Here's the topic. I can't think of two better guys to talk about this with. I want to get your take on the AI spending boom.
Cuz we do hear skeptics coming out. And these are not guys you can just dismiss. These are some very well-known, well-respected investors.
And you're hearing them talk about maybe an AI bubble.
They'll say, I'm hearing echoes of 1999. It's kind of some spooky stuff.
I'll start with you, Daniel Newman. You hear this talk, what do you make of it?
Yeah, I I think it's a lot of hot air in that in that balloon. I I do think that there are little bubbles within the overall AI trade. Companies that have zero revenue that are getting 10 and 20 billion dollar valuations. You see it with some of the quantum names. You see it with some of the energy names that are just running really fast.
But you look at the operating leverage and the strength of the largest, the Mag 7s, the Broadcoms, TSMCs, ASML, these are sturdy companies with incredible balance sheets that are making very intelligent bets on what the next 5 to 10 years
are going to look like. And by the way, one thing on 1999, when in 99, the earnings were not even close to keeping up in terms of the companies and the prices of these stocks.
It's not the same case. If you actually look at the line of how the earnings are matching with the revenue growth and the price appreciation, it is right in line. So, I think a lot of people want it to be a bubble. I call it the this is just the most hated rally of all time. But I actually think there is a really bright future and that AI is is really only in its beginnings, Josh.
So Patrick, let me I'm going to ask you the same question, but maybe I'll just frame it a little differently.
How confident are you that on the other side of what's literally going to be trillions spent here, that investors are going to see on the other side of that, they're going to see, okay, we're going to see material, meaningful revenue generation.
Yeah, so I was working at a .com during the .com boom and the .com crash.
Uh but I do want to buttress it on one end and just say, I'm confident for the next, let's say two years, as long as the hyperscalers can be funding their CAPEX with cash
before they have to be diving into debt or doing some equity financing. I feel really good about that. But to answer the the question, I feel a lot more confident than I did during .com. There were so many different bad business models that were out there. Literally, if you have access to a browser, you can get the benefit of AI. We have connectors now, we have APIs, we have ecosystems that quite frankly, uh didn't didn't exist. Am I going to Babe Ruth this? Absolutely not. We should be asking these questions, and what we should be looking at are milestones of that downstream."

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is once again in the courtroom spotlight this time facing a remedy trial that could reshape how it does business in digital advertising. The trial kicked off in late September in Alexandria, Virginia, just months after Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that Google had broken antitrust laws by using its ad tech arm to maintain monopoly power.
The Justice Department and 17 states want the judge to go big asking her to force Google to sell its AdX ad exchange and make the auction system behind its publisher ad server, DFP, open-source. If that doesn't restore competition, the DOJ says Google should be required to sell DFP altogether. But experts warn that such a breakup would be messy and slow. Columbia professor Jason Nieh told the court it would be an undertaking of unprecedented complexity, possibly taking more than five years to complete.
This comes just weeks after another ruling found Google held an illegal monopoly in online search, though the judge stopped short of forcing it to sell Chrome a move analysts saw as a win for the company.
The ruling, if anything, is a gentle slap on the wrist, said Sara Owens, senior VP of analytics at AXM. She added that the real challenge for Google might come from the rise of AI search tools like OpenAI and Perplexity, which are already changing how people find information."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-07T17:12:46,Alphabet Holds Firm as Google Tests New Gemini AI App Redesign,Revamp aims to boost engagement with a more visual and interactive experience,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3b56d2ee1535888a3bb79557ce3f74e4c18ce7b729b599b6f6147e22ecd7086d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-holds-firm-google-tests-171246637.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-holds-firm-google-tests-171246637.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-holds-firm-google-tests-171246637.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.
Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) isn't moving the market this week, but its AI story is intriguing. Google is apparently exploring a new Gemini app design that feels more like speaking with a creative assistant than tapping into a search box.
A recent Android app build replaces the chat interface with a scrolling feed of visual prompts, suggestions, and shortcuts like Create Image and Deep Research. Gemini may soon suggest questions instead of waiting for users to think of them, making the app more engaging and useful.
Wall Street likes Google's direction.Bank of America still thinks Alphabet is a good buy and has a price objective of $252. Google's stock is close to its 52-week high of $256, which suggests that investors believe in the company as it grows and comes up with new ideas.
Google has expanded beyond AI. The company announced a $4 billion Arkansas data center that will create jobs and renewed a long-term deal with NBCUniversal to stream NBC content on YouTube TV. Alphabet is considering selling or spinning out Verily life sciences to focus on core growth areas.
New competitors keep appearing. AI company Perplexity made its browser, Comet, free for everyone, offering an alternative to Chrome and highlighting how quickly AI is changing.
However, Google's Gemini revamp implies the corporation is reconsidering AI use to make it more natural, creative, and human."

The move signals the AI startup’s push to deepen its presence in its second-largest market after the U.S.
Amodei is expected to visit Mumbai to meet Ambani and other senior executives at Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company and the parent of the nation’s top telecom operator, Reliance Jio, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Anthropic has been in discussions with Reliance for some time over a potential partnership to expand access to its Claude AI assistant in India, the people said.
India — the world’s second-largest online market after China, with more than a billion internet subscribers — has emerged as an important growth region for Anthropic. Several Indian AI startups already use its Claude models in their products for both domestic and U.S. clients. India also accounts for the second-highest share of traffic to Claude’s website after the U.S., according to digital intelligence firm Similarweb.
In August, Reliance Industries partnered with major technology companies, including its existing investors Google and Meta, to build AI infrastructure and enterprise solutions through its new unit, Reliance Intelligence. The Mumbai-headquartered conglomerate had also explored a potential collaboration with OpenAI, which rolled out its under-$5 ChatGPT plan in India earlier this year and announced plans to open an office in New Delhi later in 2025.
That Reliance-OpenAI partnership was expected to be announced during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s planned visit to India last month, but Altman ultimately postponed the trip.
Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to OpenAI for comment.
Alongside Mumbai, Amodei is visiting New Delhi to meet top lawmakers and senior federal government officials, sources said. He is also expected to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two people familiar with his trip plans told TechCrunch.
Later in the week, Amodei will be in Bengaluru to announce Anthropic’s office opening on Thursday, sources told TechCrunch. Anthropic EMEA head Guillaume Princen and startups chief Daniel Delaney are also accompanying him. Prominent venture funds, including Accel and Lightspeed, are also hosting dedicated sessions with Anthropic executives this week to share insights on how developers and startups can leverage Claude for their offerings."

AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP), in collaboration with the iMasons Climate Accord (iCA), today unveiled theEmbodied Carbon Disclosure – OCP Base Specification, with contributions from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Schneider Electric and more, the first major work product from their alliance. This foundational specification establishes a common, open framework for reporting data center equipment carbon impact data. This framework is designed to reduce duplication, align reporting practices, and streamline carbon disclosure for both buyers and suppliers in the digital infrastructure ecosystem. Leveraging OCP's Community and OCP's ecosystems ability to impact the data center supply chain and iMasons reach with the end user community, this work is a crucial step in tackling one of the industry's greatest challenges, creating sustainable, and scalable digital infrastructure capable of meeting the requirements for AI and HPC from the data center to the edge.
This specification directly responds to the industry's need for consistent, transparent carbon reporting. By harmonizing carbon disclosure requirements across stakeholders and eliminating duplicative data requests, the specification and provided template simplifies information sharing, accelerates supplier compliance, and empowers buyers with clear carbon insights that can be used to make a purchasing decision. A standard taxonomy for supplier carbon disclosures related to data center materials and equipment provides the industry an opportunity to build new tools and utilize existing sustainability solutions with a common data structure for reporting carbon impact and methodology applied to derive the result.
""The large AI data center buildout and expansion worldwide in front of us has the potential to have an enormous impact on our environment. The OCP Community is committed to ensure that any potential negative impacts are minimized. It was with this as a guiding factor that OCP established an alliance with iMasons Climate Accord, and are very pleased to see the initial fruits of the effort materialize. This new open carbon disclosure framework gives our members and the data center ecosystem a trusted, community-led standardized data carbon reporting format they need to make sustainability a central part of their purchasing and product development decisions,"" said George Tchaparian, CEO at the Open Compute Project Foundation."

Tanzeel Akhtar is a seasoned journalist who has been reporting on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology since 2015. Her work has appeared in leading publications including The Wall Street Journal,...
Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) continues to cement its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, ranking fifth among U.S. corporate treasuries with approximately $80 billion in digital assets, according to company data and recent regulatory filings.
A chart published by the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla.
Bitcoin Holdings and Valuation
According to the company’s latest Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion.
The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC.
The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date.
The appreciation reflects Bitcoin’s sustained rally through Q3 2025. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense, noting the accounting implications of its Bitcoin-centric balance sheet.
ATM and Preferred Stock Programs
The filing further detailed updates to Strategy’s extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which collectively represent about $63.9 billion in potential capital issuance. These include:
• $2.1 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF)
• $4.2 billion in Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC)
• $21 billion in 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK)
• $4.2 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD)
• $21 billion in Class A common stock (MSTR)
The company reported no new share issuances during the period, noting that any proceeds from potential future sales would be presented net of commissions.
Financial Position and Oversight
As of the end of Q3 2025, Strategy’s digital-asset carrying value remained $73.21 billion, with a corresponding deferred-tax liability of $7.43 billion. The figures reaffirm Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as its core corporate reserve asset.
The financial disclosures were internally prepared and reviewed by KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. With Bitcoin’s market value continuing to climb, Strategy’s holdings now place it firmly among the top five U.S. corporations by total treasury size — a rare achievement for a firm whose reserves consist primarily of digital assets.

Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching App Lovin, Alphabet and XAI. First up, App Lovin, those shares sharply rebounding. They fell 14% on Monday after Bloomberg News reported the SEC is probing the data collection practices of the mobile advertising technology company.
The agency is specifically looking to allegations that App Lovin violated service agreements with platform partners to push more targeted advertising. But city analyst Jason Bazne notes the regulator has not officially accused the company of wrongdoing.
He views the absence of an 8K filing as a positive. It suggests the firm, he says, does not view this as a material risk. The shares up nearly 7% today.
Next up, Alphabet, it's Google lost a Supreme Court bid to pause major changes to its Google Play App Store in an anti-trust case filed by Fortnite maker Epic Games. The Supreme Court without explanation denied Google's request to temporarily put part of a lower court ruling on hold.
The company sought to block a requirement to allow rival App stores access to its app library and bar it from blocking downloads from competitors in Google Play. A Google spokesperson said the company is disappointed by the ruling and will continue to appeal.
And finally XAI, Elon Musk's XA AI startup appointing a new chief financial officer. The Financial Times reporting Musk tapped former Morgan Stanley executive Anthony Armstrong to take the helmet as CFO at both XAI and X, the social media platform. The executive previously helped Musk complete the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter and was one of his lieutenants during his stint at Doge.
Armstrong's predecessor left the company just months into the job.

While Warren Buffett said, “our favorite holding period is forever,” occasional investor skittishness is nothing new. Yet has it gone to extremes?
Despite solid stock market performance this year, “I think that we’re in a period where people are not sure about capitalism,” ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi on a new episode of the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (see video above; listen below).
“I do believe we’re still stuck with what happened in 2000 and 2008, which were both horrendous,” he continued. “Although if you held on to the Mercks of the world, you ended up doing fine.”
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Cramer has sat in the host chair of ""Mad Money"" for nearly two decades and is the author of several books, including the recently published ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" He has studied markets and worked to demystify them for the average investor. He was one of the first to call out Nvidia (NVDA) — “my best pick” — when it was just a gaming company. He also had a hand in coining the acronym FAANG (Facebook, now Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG), now Alphabet (GOOGL).

“FAANG was the greatest creator of wealth in my life other than Nvidia, and I think my job was to find great stocks,” Cramer said. “But I wanted people to understand why I thought they were great.”
For many young investors, crypto and the hot stocks of the moment often crowd out the more traditional names and advice, leaving them susceptible to more volatile investments. “Compounding is so boring,” Cramer said. “People think it’s too hard. They don’t understand what the P/E means. They don’t understand what it means to buy and hold a great stock.”
This shorter-term thinking contrasts with Buffett’s sentiment on the stock market. He once said, “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”

Year to date, markets remain stable. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up nearly 15% while the Russell 2000 (^RUT) is up 11.61%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up 9.76%. Top S&P 500 performers during this same time period include Robinhood (HOOD), Seagate Technology (STX), Western Digital (WDC), Newmont (NEM), and Palantir (PLTR).
Impatience and skittishness are only two obstacles, according to Cramer. “The market got a bad rap because it seemed to be the playground of billionaires,” he said. “It got to be the image of the filthy rich, and the billionaires don’t help.”"

The rat’s nest of AI partnerships just got a bit more tangled. And for those who suspect the whole thing is a bubble, well, the latest entanglement is another thing to fret about.
ICYMI: OpenAI just struck a deal with AMD, a chip designer that directly competes with Nvidia, which itself announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI less than a week ago. Nvidia, the world’s biggest company by market value, also competes with Oracle, which last month became the hot AI stock when it also reportedly struck a $300 billion deal with, you guessed it, OpenAI.
OpenAI, reportedly the biggest private company on the planet, with a half-trillion-dollar valuation, is also deeply financially connected to Microsoft and Google (the second- and fourth-most valuable publicly traded companies, respectively).
If it looks as if the industry is mostly a small handful of large companies sort of just trading money and services back and forth, congratulations: You understand the AI financing machine.
Under the deal announced Monday, which sent the chip designer’s shares (AMD) up 23%, AMD is effectively subsidizing demand by issuing OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares, investor Paul Kedrosky noted Monday. “That makes OpenAI a 10% shareholder: part customer, part financier — a risk transfer from cash to stock, as well as making OpenAI the largest and thus controlling AMD shareholder,” Kedrosky said.
As I wrote here last week, intertwined setups, including some known as “vendor financing,” are common in the frothy world of artificial intelligence. But the many layers of overlap, concentrated among the companies whose stocks have been propping up the US stock market, have made it hard to disentangle how much demand for AI is authentic hunger from customers and investors and how much of it is just capital being recycled to keep up the appearance of progress.
Vendor financing — along with the doubling, tripling or quadrupling of companies’ valuations — is one of the unflattering echoes some analysts see in comparing today’s AI frenzy with the late-90s dot-com bubble. Back then, telecom equipment giants like Cisco, Nortel and Lucent borrowed heavily to offer their customers financing deals that essentially ensured sustained demand for telecom equipment.
Because that high-tech equipment was in short supply, customers — many of them startups trying to build out fiber-optic cable — inflated their orders, contributing to a glut that left them reeling when, in 2001, it became clear the tech and telecom companies had overestimated demand. The equipment makers like Cisco were left holding bad debt while the startups went bust.
“We have all been witnessing elements of this behavior,” wrote Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, in a note last month. “The lessons of the dot-com bubble are all but forgotten, but they echo in eternity,” he wrote, noting vendor financing was “key” to the demise of Lucent — once the world’s biggest telecom equipment company and billed, as Nvidia is now, as a “picks and shovels” play in the emerging tech economy. (Lucent barely averted bankruptcy in the 2002 downturn and was sold to French competitor Alcatel in 2006.)
No market two cycles are exactly alike, of course, and the existence of vendor financing is hardly a guarantee we’re in one now.
“We see some important differences,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Monday. Chief among them: The Big Tech companies are in a much stronger financial position than many of the over-inflated stocks of the dot-com era.
But putting the discussion about circular financing and whether or not it’s profitable to the side, it’s worth looking at the product at the core of all this spending: generative AI powered by large language models, or LLMs. That’s where plenty of other investors, analysts and academics are screaming that the emperor has no clothes.
LLMs are popular, to be sure, and they’ve grown in capabilities in the past few years. Proponents say LLMs will change the world — someday. But their use cases have so far come up short of the “superintelligence” hype that AI advocates have long touted. An MIT survey of 300 companies found that 95% “are getting zero return” on their AI investment — a result that briefly rattled investors in August. Meanwhile, “workslop” — the nonsensical, unusable presentations spit out by AI — has become its own headache across many white-collar industries.
The downsides of AI are well-documented, however, as chatbots have dragged some people into delusional, at times deadly, spirals.
But let’s pick up that discussion of the dollars-and-cents business again. Because a bunch of people are starting to use the B-word.
“I think that this is the biggest and most dangerous bubble the world has ever seen,” Julien Garran of MacroStrategy Partnership wrote in a rather pessimistic report Friday. He estimates that a “misallocation of capital in the US” led by AI is 17 times bigger than the dot-com bubble and four times bigger than the 2008 real estate bubble.
Garran notes that the “majority of the LLM AI ecosystem” is losing money. “It is only an explosion in round-tripping” — buying and selling an asset over and over to create the appearance of high demand, distinct from vendor financing — “from Nvidia that is keeping the bubble inflated.”"

Other tech giants featured on the list included Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms, a contingent that’s spending tens of billions of dollars annually to develop large language models and AI chips to get a competitive edge in the AI arms race.
But the AIQ 50 wasn’t only dominated by the tech sector. In fact, there were 17 other sectors with representation, including financials, health care, retail, energy, and transportation.
This expansive embrace and quick adoption of generative AI differs from past technological advancements. The widespread adoption of the internet in the late 1990s caught many industries completely off guard, including physical retail and banking. More recently, the expensive and complex IT-led shift to cloud computing saw multiple sectors lag behind, including airlines, agricultural producers, and hospitals.
Kate Smaje, a senior partner at consulting giant McKinsey, says that unlike other digital transformation efforts, with AI there have been notable winners and losers within each sector, rather than entire industries falling behind on adoption.
AI, Smaje says, “it’s something that is innately democratized to everyone across the organization. It doesn’t matter whether you’re at the front line, you’re the HR director, or you’re the CEO. Your ability to use it and figure out ways to improve your lot, as it were, is a lot easier.”
Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, which ranked 36 on the AIQ 50 list, has applied AI and machine learning models across all parts of the company’s business, ranging from how it recruits patients to enroll in clinical trials to reimagining the supply chain and helping surgeons perform procedures.
Jim Swanson, J&J’s chief information officer, says that the company created a “lighthouse” framework to organize how it thinks about the value it can extract from AI across the business.
At the top of the lighthouse are use cases that apply to core products and services, including the use of AI to improve surgical outcomes. The middle layer focuses on utilizing AI to improve functions like customer support or patient enrollment in drug trials, while the lowest level involves employee productivity tools. In each case, Swanson says, he prioritizes investments that can generate big outcomes."

On Sept. 16, the company announced an AI infrastructure project called Stargate UK, whereby it is partnering with other businesses and the British government to boost AI tech in the United Kingdom.
This followed the government's call ""to make sure that Britain maintains its position as a world leader in AI."" To do so, the country plans to increase its computing capacity by a minimum of 20x by 2030, with Stargate serving as a step toward that goal.
Great Britain's flurry of AI activity this year led Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to declare, ""The U.K. will be an AI superpower."" While OpenAI's Stargate project helps the British government meet its AI objectives, it also creates opportunities for Amazon (AMZN -0.56%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.89%). Here's what investors should know about Stargate UK's implications for this pair of tech giants.
How Stargate UK helps Amazon and Alphabet
The Stargate UK initiative illustrates why the AI market is expected to see incredible growth in the coming years. Analyst forecasts estimate the industry will hit $244 billion in 2025 and expand to $1 trillion by 2031 as businesses and governments around the world rush to adopt AI. OpenAI's Stargate can't support this level of expansion alone, which will enable Amazon and Alphabet to gain from the rising demand for computing capacity.
Both possess some of the world's largest cloud computing infrastructure. Amazon is the global leader here, and Alphabet is third behind Microsoft. Building on this success, they have constructed custom semiconductor chips to power their AI systems, creating competitors for Nvidia's pricey AI chips. This allows them to enhance AI performance while managing costs, which can help them capture customers.
In addition, Amazon partnered with artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic last year, integrating the latter's AI models into Amazon's services.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's research division, Google DeepMind, achieved a milestone on the path to artificial general intelligence. DeepMind's AI became the first to win a gold medal in an international computer programming competition, demonstrating AI's potential to match human thinking. DeepMind is based in the U.K.
Factors contributing to Amazon and Alphabet's AI might
Such AI advancements mean Amazon and Alphabet are well placed to meet the growing artificial intelligence needs of organizations, which require technologies tailored to the unique demands of AI systems.
The two companies now find themselves in a technological position similar to that of the broadband providers that replaced dial-up providers in the early days of the internet.
Moreover, Amazon and Alphabet continue to invest heavily in tech infrastructure to power their AI ambitions. Alphabet poured $67 billion into capital expenditures over the trailing 12 months through the second quarter. Amazon's capex was an astounding $103 billion over the same period.
Alphabet committed 5 billion pounds in support of the British government's AI efforts, including the opening of a data center near London on Sept. 16, coincidentally, the same day OpenAI announced Stargate UK. Amazon aims to rival Stargate's scale through Project Rainier, which the company calls ""the world's most powerful computer for training artificial intelligence (AI) models.""
The pair can afford these costs. After its $67 billion in capex spending, Alphabet was left with $66.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the last 12 months through Q2. Amazon's FCF was $18.2 billion over that time.
Investing in these quiet winners
With AI as the latest growth driver for Amazon and Alphabet's businesses for years to come, now is a good time to consider scooping up their stocks. Here's a look at each one's share price valuation using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which reflects what investors are willing to pay for every dollar of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.
Contrasting these numbers against those of AI luminaries Microsoft and Nvidia provides some context. OpenAI is collaborating with Nvidia on the Stargate UK project, while Microsoft invested billions of dollars in OpenAI.
The chart shows Amazon and Alphabet sport more attractive valuations than Microsoft and Nvidia, as indicated by the lower P/E ratios. In fact, Amazon's earnings multiple has dropped from last year, and while Alphabet's has risen, it remains considerably below those of its AI counterparts.
This suggests the potential upside from the U.K.'s AI investments may not be fully baked into Amazon and Alphabet's stock prices, given that they are indirect beneficiaries of the Stargate deal. Investing in these major AI companies now offers an opportunity for share price appreciation over the long term as the AI sector expands."

The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.
Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.
In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to “enormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.""
Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.
In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. “The changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users’ ability to safely download apps,” Google warned.
Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.
In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.
Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.
Those commissions were the focal point of an antitrust lawsuit that video game maker Epic Games filed against Google in 2020, setting up a month-long trial in San Francisco federal court that culminated in the jury's monopoly verdict.
Epic, the maker of the Fortnite game, lost a similar antitrust case targeting Apple's iPhone app store. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year."

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.34% lower. Alphabet Inc. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Looking at valuation, Alphabet Inc. is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 24.75. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 24.7.
Also, we should mention that GOOG has a PEG ratio of 1.66. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.66 as trading concluded yesterday.
The Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 84, positioning it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries."

This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.37% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.14%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.71%.
Shares of the internet search leader witnessed a gain of 4.4% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 8.04%, and outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 4.26%.
Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Alphabet in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.29, up 8.02% from the prior-year quarter. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $84.56 billion, showing a 13.42% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.
GOOGL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.96 per share and revenue of $334.66 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +23.88% and +13.4%, respectively.
Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.34% decrease. At present, Alphabet boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
Investors should also note Alphabet's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 24.64. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 24.7 for its industry.
One should further note that GOOGL currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.66. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Internet - Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.66 at yesterday's closing price.

The decision was seen as a loss for Google's adtech competitors like Magnite, as the Chrome web browser helps Google's advertising business function and improves its ad targeting.
Later in the month, Magnite sued Google, becoming the third SSP to do so, a sign that it believes Google is not competing fairly. It also shows that this is unlikely to be the end of Google's legal saga.
As a result of the downward pressure from the ruling on Google, the stock finished the month down 16%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
As you can see from the chart below, the stock mostly headed lower last month, except for a brief spike that came after it filed its own lawsuit against Google.
Google still dominates
Google is the 800-pound gorilla in the digital advertising industry, and what happens to the tech giant can have a lot of influence over the rest of the industry, so it wasn't a surprise to see Magnite pull back on the favorable antitrust ruling for Google. Magnite stock lost 4% on Sept. 3, the same day that Alphabet stock soared.
In addition to being able to keep Chrome, Google will not be forced to divest the Android operating system.
The more direct news for Magnite came later in the month when it filed a lawsuit against Google on Sept. 16. Magnite said it was seeking financial damages and other remedies in response to the U.S. District Court's earlier ruling that Google had ""willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power"" in ad exchange and ad server markets.
By doing so, Magnite became the third SSP to sue Google in the last two months.
What's next for Magnite
A potential breakup at Google was never a great investing thesis for a stock like Magnite, which has struggled to reassert itself following the pandemic-era boom.
While the digital advertising market continues to grow, Magnite revenue was up just 6% in the second quarter.
The company is profitable, but it will likely have to deliver faster growth than that to drive a rebound in the stock from here."

SINGAPORE and HAMILTON, Bermuda, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bermuda has sent a clear signal to the global subsea communications industry: the Atlantic island is open for business and ready to anchor the next wave of digital connectivity.
At Submarine Networks World 2025 in Singapore—the largest annual gathering of subsea communications professionals—executives from the Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) and the Regulatory Authority of Bermuda (RA) showcased Bermuda's growing role as a strategic hub for transatlantic cable development. In tandem with a business attraction mission to Hong Kong, BDA not only attended this year's Submarine Networks World event but also sponsored a high-level networking reception for industry leaders, investors, and technology innovators.
Bermuda's emergence as a digital hub was accelerated by the Submarine Communications Cable Act of 2020, which created a clear and investor-friendly regulatory framework specific to the subsea cable segment. Since then, two major transatlantic cables—Nuvem and Sol— have been announced by tech giant Google to land in Bermuda, the first under the enactment of the recent legislation, putting the island firmly on the map as the Atlantic's next connectivity gateway.
""Bermuda has close partnerships in both the United States and Europe, uniquely positioning it to become the Atlantic's physical and digital crossroads,"" said Kendaree Burgess, Managing Director of the BDA. ""The strength of our regulatory framework and blue-chip business climate, combined with global endorsements from some of the biggest tech companies in the world, make it clear that Bermuda is a secure and business-ready jurisdiction for subsea infrastructure.""
To bring further awareness to the strategic industry opportunity presented by the territory's regulatory approach, Craig Davis, Senior Manager of Electronic Communications at the Bermuda Regulatory Authority, participated in a conference panel titled ""Connecting the Caribbean – A Sudden Surge in Subsea Activity."" As a part of this session, Davis outlined how Bermuda's approach balances investor confidence with long-term resiliency and sustainability in the industry.
Bermuda's participation in Submarine Networks World 2025 also marked the launch of a wider East Asia engagement mission, with BDA executives traveling on to Hong Kong for investor meetings aimed at deepening ties with businesses seeking to expand across the Atlantic corridor.

The major indexes are trading in record territory. This might discourage investors who are looking to put some more money to work, as they might believe that they'd be better off waiting for a dip.
That might sound like a smart strategy, but in practice, time in the market usually beats trying to time the market. Moreover, there are always some reasonably priced opportunities -- and sometimes, they include some of the biggest and most dominant companies out there.
In my view, these two megacaps are the best stocks investors can buy with $1,000 right now.
Alphabet's playing a leading role in the AI revolution
Alphabet (GOOGL 1.89%) (GOOG 1.87%) is best known for Google Search, its crown jewel segment that raked in revenues of $54.2 billion in Q2 alone and that commands 90% of the search market. But the company is much more than that. In 2023, CEO Sundar Pichai said that six of Alphabet's products and services are used by 2 billion people each. That showcases its tremendous reach and adoption.
The monster success of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots gave the market reasons to be concerned about the future of Google Search's competitive position. But these worries now seem to have been overblown. Google Search posted an 11.8% year-over-year revenue gain last quarter, and management is boasting about the huge early success of its AI Mode feature.
Nvidia deservedly gets a large share of the attention in AI. But it's worth pointing out that Alphabet is also working on its own AI chips. Additionally, the business has a booming cloud platform that's generating rising profits. Demand is strong, with companies like PayPal, Wayfair, Target, and Mattel leveraging its AI tools.
Moreover, Alphabet's Gemini LLMs are being used to improve the user experience of all the products and services the company owns. Advertisers also benefit from AI. ""Over 2 million advertisers now use Google's AI-powered asset generation tools to run ads,"" said Philipp Schindler, chief business officer of Google.
This AI stock has soared by 228% in the past five years, and the company carries a market cap of $3 trillion. But its shares still trade at a compelling forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.1 -- a good deal for such an excellent company.
Meta is strengthening its network effects
Meta Platforms (META 1.07%) is another stock to add to the portfolio today. Its family of apps combined had 3.48 billion daily active users during the second quarter, a gargantuan figure. And that was up by 6% year over year.
These apps benefit from a powerful network effect. For Meta, the best outcome is not only growing the user base, but getting people to spend more time on these apps. That's where it's getting a lot out of AI, which it's using to personalize content recommendations. It's also giving users AI tools to find information or generate text and images.
""Advancements in our recommendation systems have improved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram just this quarter,"" founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the Q2 earnings call.
Meta generated 98% of its revenue in Q2 from advertising activities. Unsurprisingly, the business is focused on finding more ways to monetize all the engagement on its platform. Again, AI is coming into the picture, helping advertisers be more creative and effective, creating ads that are driving higher conversions.
During the Q1 earnings call, Zuckerberg said that should AI continue to improve ad capabilities, in the future, advertising will be a ""meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today. That view implies big revenue upside.
In the past five years, Meta's stock has risen by 171%. It sports a market cap of $1.8 trillion, and at a forward P/E ratio of 25.2, its valuation is reasonable. Taking advantage of that would be a smart move."

Despite mounting concerns over a government shutdown and fresh warnings of an AI ""bubble,"" strategists across Wall Street say there's still upside for US equities heading into year-end.
Ed Yardeni, veteran market watcher and president of Yardeni Research, raised his S&P 500 (^GSPC) target back to 7,000, describing the current rally as a ""slow-motion melt-up"" fueled by earnings resilience and further support from Fed rate cuts.
Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel echoed that view, keeping a base-case target of 7,750 for 2026 and assigning a 30% chance of a ""bubble scenario"" that could see the S&P 500 hit 9,000 by the end of next year, driven by accelerating capital markets and continued AI investment.
Signs of that exuberance are already emerging: On Monday, OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) announced a multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that gives the ChatGPT maker the right to acquire up to 10% of the chipmaker as part of what executives have described as ""the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.""
That wave of AI spending has prompted several high-profile voices to weigh in. Last week, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos described the current boom as a ""good kind of bubble"" that could spark massive investment and innovation, ultimately benefiting the broader economy.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon offered a more cautious tone, warning that while tech and stimulus tailwinds could keep the economy accelerating into 2026, investors should not be surprised to see a drawdown in the next 12 to 24 months as some capital fails to generate returns.
The debate over whether markets are veering into bubble territory comes as valuations hover well above historical norms.
According to DataTrek Research, the S&P 500 is trading at about 25 times expected earnings for this year, a level the firm said ""reflects complete confidence (and then some)"" that profits will meet expectations. That implies earnings will climb 13% next year and another 10% in 2027.
That means ""higher valuations than historical norms are the key to further upside for the S&P 500,"" DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote. He added that ""solid earnings growth over the next 2–3 years [is] already baked into stock prices.""
In other words, much of this rally still rests on the shoulders of Big Tech."

Shares of fuel cell technology Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) jumped 8.2% in the morning session after the stock continued its rally from the previous trading session, fueled by a significant analyst price target upgrade and positive operational updates.
The shares built on a remarkable gain from the prior trading day, which saw the stock surge over 30%. The momentum was initially sparked after investment bank H.C. Wainwright more than doubled its price target on the company to $7 from $3, reaffirming a Buy rating. Analysts noted that rising electricity costs created a supportive environment for the green hydrogen sector.
Adding to the positive news, Plug Power reported tangible operational milestones. The company achieved record production levels at its Georgia hydrogen facility and delivered its first 10-megawatt electrolyzer system to Galp, a major energy company in Portugal. The sharp price increase also appeared to trigger a short squeeze, as traders who had bet against the stock were forced to buy shares to cover their positions, further driving up the price.
Is now the time to buy Plug Power? Access our full analysis report here.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Plug Power’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 98 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 36.1% on the news that H.C. Wainwright more than doubled its price target on the company's shares to $7 from $3 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating.
The analyst firm pointed to a few key factors for the optimistic outlook. It noted that significant increases in electricity prices over the previous few months and growing regulatory support for nuclear power created a more favorable environment. These conditions, combined with strong demand for power from data centers and industrial electrification, were expected to make green hydrogen more competitive in price. This could support wider use of Plug Power's hydrogen solutions.
Plug Power is up 73.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.04 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Plug Power’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $248.61.

However, researchers have suggested new ways to increase long-term memory of AI models, as they often can’t hold context over several sessions.
Nineteen-year-old founder Dhravya Shah is attempting to solve problems in this area by building a memory solution, called Supermemory, for AI apps.
Originally from Mumbai in India, Shah started building consumer-facing bots and apps a few years ago. He even sold his bot that formatted tweets into good-looking screenshots to the social media tool Hypefury.
The founder, who was preparing for an entrance exam to get into IIT (Indian Institute of Technology), earned good money from this sale and decided to move to the U.S. to attend Arizona State University instead.
After relocating, he challenged himself to build something new each week for 40 weeks. During one of those weeks, he built Supermemory (which was initially called Any Context) and put it on GitHub. At that time, the tool allowed you to chat with your Twitter bookmarks.
The current version of the tool extracts “memories” or insights from unstructured data and helps the applications understand the context better.
Shah secured an internship at Cloudflare in 2024, where he worked on AI and infrastructure. He later worked as a developer relations lead at the company. During this time, advisors, including Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht, asked him to turn Supermemory into a product.
This year, he decided to build Supermemory full-time.
Supermemory, now described as a universal memory API for AI apps, builds a knowledge graph based on the data it processes, and personalizes the context for the users. For instance, it can support querying across month-old entries for a writing or a journaling app, or searching for an email app. As the solution allows for multimodal inputs, it could also allow a video editor to fetch relevant assets from a library for a particular prompt.
The startup can ingest any type of data, the company says, including files, docs, chats, projects, emails, PDFs, and app data streams. Its chatbot and notetaker feature lets users add memories in text, add files or links, and connect to apps like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Notion. There’s also a Chrome extension that lets you easily add notes from a website.
“Our core strength is to extract insights from any kind of unstructured data and give the apps more context about users. As we work across multimodal data, our solution is suitable for all kinds of AI apps ranging from email clients to video editors,” Shah said."

In its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Middle Coast Investing highlighted stocks such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 5.21%, and its shares gained 49.86% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 03, 2025, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $246.45 per share, with a market capitalization of $2.975 trillion.
Middle Coast Investing stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:
""We invested in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earlier this year when the market viewed it as an AI loser, which seemed unlikely to me. Gemini has only grown in prominence since then. The other part of this thesis was that a government break up of Alphabet would be good for shareholders. The market disagrees; but after the recent anti-trust ruling did not force Google to sell its Chrome unit, the stock has gone up. Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous driving unit, is also an AI-powered company that is deploying fleets in more and more cities. Not GenAI, exactly, but in the ballpark.""
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in the 7th position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 178 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the end of the second quarter which was 164 in the previous quarter. In the second quarter of 2025, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) achieved a revenue of $96.4 billion, representing an increase of 14% compared to Q2 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of ALPHABET INC. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / October 6, 2025 / Artificial intelligence (AI) may be software, but it is built from hardware: steel, copper, concrete, and energy. Every search query, AI-generated image or digital transaction routes through a data center, the brick-and-mortar to the cloud. These facilities, ranging from modest colocation sites to sprawling hyperscale campuses, run 24/7 to store and process the data behind cloud computing, AI, streaming and more.
The companies that own and operate this infrastructure fall into two groups: hyperscale cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google and Microsoft, and the real estate owners such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Digital Realty and Equinix. Hyperscalers are no longer just tenants, and data center REITs are not just landlords. Both the tenant and the landlord are now active energy market makers who are reshaping how power is sourced, scheduled and delivered.
Grappling with increased energy demand
Electricity demand from US data centers is rising at a pace not seen in decades. According to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data center electricity use grew 7% annually between 2014-2018, then more than doubled to 18% annually from 2018-2023, largely driven by cloud expansion and AI-optimized servers. It is estimated that by 2028, AI workloads alone could increase total data center energy use by 20-40% above baseline forecasts.
Hyperscalers and data center REITs include renewables in their procurement strategies for a few reasons. For one, corporate carbon reduction targets are driving procurement at scale. Google has a 24/7 clean power goal and both Digital Realty and Equinix have stated they are looking for 100% renewable energy coverage.

Based on the offering, the software segment will grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.
Image recognition software is an application of artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies that enable computers to analyze, interpret, and understand visual data such as images and videos. These software solutions are designed to replicate the human ability to recognize objects, scenes, patterns, and even faces within digital imagery. Image recognition software typically employs complex algorithms and deep learning models trained on vast datasets to extract meaningful features from visual inputs and make accurate predictions or classifications. Image recognition software is also used in security and surveillance systems for facial recognition, object detection, and anomaly detection, enhancing safety measures in public spaces and critical infrastructure. Furthermore, image recognition software enables machines to intelligently perceive and respond to their environments in autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and robotics.
Based on technology, facial recognition will grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.
Facial recognition technology utilizes algorithms that analyze facial characteristics such as the distance between the eyes, the nose's shape, and the face's contours to create a unique biometric profile for each individual. Facial recognition algorithms can compare these biometric profiles against stored templates in a database or live video feeds in real-time to accurately match faces and identify individuals. Facial recognition technology finds applications in various sectors, including security, law enforcement, retail, banking, and hospitality. Security and surveillance systems enhance access control measures by allowing organizations to authenticate individuals based on facial biometrics, thereby improving security and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive areas. Additionally, facial recognition technology enables personalized customer experiences in retail environments, which can be used for customer identification, targeted marketing, and customized recommendations based on previous interactions. Despite its potential benefits, facial recognition technology raises concerns regarding privacy, surveillance, and possible misuse, prompting ongoing discussions about ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding its deployment."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-06T13:16:00,2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,Nvidia and Alphabet are two top AI stocks to buy and hold for the long term.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5262d6c58be236cd1ede24403878a0182fc562f6b6884f6c48483555c3b7ff8a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/2-artificial-intelligence-stocks-you-can-buy-and-h/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/2-artificial-intelligence-stocks-you-can-buy-and-h/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/2-artificial-intelligence-stocks-you-can-buy-and-h/,fool.com,200.0,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) looks poised to remain one of the biggest investment themes for the next decade, and the megacap tech companies that have already been benefiting from it are likely to be some of the biggest winners from here. Two that I view as particularly good stocks to buy now and hold for the next decade are Nvidia (NVDA -0.08%) and Alphabet (GOOGL 1.89%) (GOOG 1.87%).
Nvidia
In sports, the greats often dominate because they see how a play is developing before anyone else. The same can be said for Nvidia, which anticipated the direction that the AI market would take long before its competitors. That's why, after creating its CUDA software platform, which allowed developers to easily program its graphics processing units (GPUs) for specific uses, it gave the software away for free, and pushed it into the universities and research labs where early AI development was taking place.
That prescient move led to most of the early AI code being written for Nvidia chips. It would be costly and time-consuming to rewrite this code, and since most developers in the field are already fluent in CUDA, they tend to want to keep using it.
That has helped the chipmaker take and keep its dominant position in the GPU space, where it now controls over a 90% market share. The company didn't stop there: Its proprietary NVLink interconnect -- a protocol that includes both hardware and software -- allows multiple chips to function as one massive unit. That provides better performance, which further serves to hold competitors at bay.
Now, Nvidia is going on offense again. It recently committed to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, which effectively secures a massive long-term customer for its high-end chips while giving it greater insight into what the most advanced AI models will need next. The companies will work together at the chips, software, and systems levels to help shape where AI heads next. This makes Nvidia a stock worth owning for the next decade.
Alphabet
A year ago, investors worried that AI would threaten Google's dominant search business as people shifted to querying chatbots, but Alphabet (GOOGL 1.89%) (GOOG 1.87%) is now being viewed as one of the world's top AI companies. Its Gemini large language models compete at the top tier with OpenAI's offerings, and the Gemini app has become one of the most downloaded. Meanwhile, the company has embedded Gemini through its search engine. Its new AI mode allows users to quickly toggle between traditional search and an AI chatbot, while AI-powered features such as AI Overviews, Circle to Search, and Lens have driven more queries.
At the same time, Alphabet has several huge advantages over any potential competitor. Its ownership of the Chrome web browser and the Android operating system, along with its search revenue-sharing deal with Apple, combine to make it the default way most people in the world access the internet. It also has a huge data advantage and one of the world's largest and far-reaching ad platforms on the planet, which helps it monetize queries better than anyone else.
On top of that, Alphabet is a cloud computing leader. While it's currently the third largest cloud infrastructure provider, its technology stack is arguably the most complete in the industry. Its Gemini models are top-notch, while Vertex AI helps customers build and deploy models and apps. Google Cloud is also a leader in data center analytics, and the company created Kubernetes, an open-source platform that's the industry standard for deploying and managing containerized apps.
Alphabet is also a leader in custom AI chips. Its tensor processing units (TPUs) -- custom AI accelerators -- have been highly praised, even by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. These chips, often used in conjunction with GPUs, help give Alphabet and its customers a cost advantage. As the market begins to shift more toward inference -- powering AI applications rather than developing the models -- this will become an even bigger advantage.
Then there are Alphabet's attractive longer-term bets. Its Waymo robotaxi business has a nice first-mover advantage, and it's expanding to more and more U.S. cities. The company also has its hand in quantum computing, where its Willow chip is showing reductions in its error rates as its size scales up.
Overall, Alphabet looks like one of the best-positioned companies in AI for the next decade."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-06T12:21:00,5 Top Stocks to Buy in October,Don't look to 2026 yet. There are still great buys now.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=896c30c8bc84b8218e7d9ebbe1189742cf0d451ea63996aaaca83967a2f0d4d8,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/5-top-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/5-top-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/5-top-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,fool.com,200.0,,"The fourth quarter has officially arrived, which is a time when many investors reflect on year-to-date portfolio performance but start to shift their focus to where the market could be heading in 2026. This makes it important for investors to identify some values in the market and scoop up shares before they begin to rally.
I've got five stocks I have identified as great picks for October. I think investors would be wise to consider them as soon as possible, as they could rally to end the year.
Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -0.08%) has been one of the best-performing artificial intelligence stock picks over the past few years. Although 2025 hasn't been as strong a performance as 2023 or 2024 due to its size, Nvidia could maintain its place as the top AI stock if management's market projection comes true.
They believe that global data center capital expenditures will reach $600 billion this year, but rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's incredible growth and would lead to heightened demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).
If this projection comes true, Nvidia's stock is a must-own. Nvidia's management works closely with its end customers, and receives information about orders years in advance so they can ensure they have proper capacity to meet demand. As a result, investors should at least trust the direction of increased AI spending over the next five years, making Nvidia an excellent stock to buy as soon as possible.
Taiwan Semiconductor
Alongside Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.14%) is another huge beneficiary of increased AI spending. Nvidia and its competitors don't have the in-house capabilities to produce their own chips. So they farm out that work to a chip foundry like Taiwan Semiconductor.
TSMC, as it's also called, has established itself as the leading chip foundry, and nearly every big tech company is a client. So, as long as the general market trend is to use more advanced chips in greater quantities, Taiwan Semiconductor is a smart investment.
I think Taiwan Semi is still a great stock to buy now, and it could see further gains to close 2025 as data center capital expenditure plans for 2026 are revealed.
Alphabet
One of these big AI spenders is Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.89%), the parent company of Google. While Alphabet has spent a ton of money on AI infrastructure, it isn't solely being done to power its generative AI model, Gemini. Alphabet also rents some of this computing power out to various clients through its cloud computing platform, Google Cloud. This gives Alphabet a revenue source to offset these expensive buildouts.
Furthermore, Alphabet has emerged as a leader in the generative AI space and has integrated it into the Google Search engine with AI search overviews. While there was some fear about Google potentially being replaced by a generative AI-first search engine, I think this evolution of the product allows it to maintain its leadership position.
Alphabet isn't the world's largest company yet, but it produces the most profits (outside of Saudi Aramco). This could lead to a strong stock movement as the market realizes Alphabet's potential.
MercadoLibre
One of my favorite stocks outside of the AI movement is MercadoLibre (MELI -3.78%). MercadoLibre is the leading e-commerce giant in Latin America, and it has a thriving fintech platform in that geography as well. Because Latin America is well behind the U.S. in both of these trends, this gives investors the chance to turn back the clock and invest in industries that they already know will be successful.
MercdaoLibre has been a longtime winner, but its future is just as bright as it continues to develop the Latin American commerce market. There are far more people to serve in Latin America than in the U.S., so this is an important factor to watch. We're still years away from it being complete, making MercadoLibre an excellent stock to buy now.
The Trade Desk
This year hasn't been kind to The Trade Desk (TTD -0.26%). Its stock is down more than 65% from its all-time high, due to its perceived slowing growth rate. The ad technology platform has had a rough transition migrating its clients from its old platform to its new AI-powered one, and this has caused some customers to leave the platform altogether.
However, The Trade Desk is making some changes and looking to boost revenue growth past the 14% rate that management projects for the third quarter. Time will tell if management can right the ship, but The Trade Desk has a long track record of success and is operating in an important and growing market. I think investors should give it the benefit of the doubt and bet on a strong turnaround play between now and the end of 2026."

You are not alone. When a stock climbs nearly 195% over five years and rockets over 16% in the past month alone, it is natural to wonder what is driving the action and whether it is justified. IBM has been catching lots of attention lately, making headlines for everything from its competitive position in quantum computing to talent moves in the ever-heated race for AI leadership.
Just in the last few weeks, IBM’s name has popped up alongside Google and Microsoft in discussions about a future dominated by quantum machines. That kind of buzz often raises expectations and, as we are seeing, stock prices. With a 31.1% gain year-to-date and a 30.6% jump over the past year, investor optimism seems strong. But is the market running too far ahead of reality, or is IBM simply catching up to where it should be valued?
The short answer, at least for now, is that IBM’s valuation does not exactly scream “undervalued.” When we run the numbers through six major checks, IBM gets a value score of 0, which means it is not judged to be undervalued by any of our traditional benchmarks.
Of course, there is more than one way to size up a stock’s worth. In the next section, we will break down each of these valuation approaches, and at the end, I will show you an even better way to cut through the noise when it comes to assessing IBM’s true value in your portfolio.
International Business Machines scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: International Business Machines Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company’s intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to present-day dollars. In IBM’s case, the analysis uses a two-stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, capturing cash flow estimates from both analysts and longer-term extrapolations.
Currently, International Business Machines reports an annual Free Cash Flow (FCF) of $11.48 Billion. Analyst estimates project this figure to grow steadily, reaching $18.73 Billion by 2029, with intermediary growth supported by both forecast data and model-based assumptions after 2029. For context, analyst consensus goes out five years; projections further into the future are calculated by Simply Wall St based on historical and industry factors.
Based on these cash flow projections, IBM’s estimated intrinsic value is $288.19 per share. Compared to its current trading price, this DCF-based valuation signals that the stock is approximately 0.1% overvalued. This is a difference so small it suggests the stock is trading almost exactly at “fair value.”"

It's a top priority for companies of all sizes and in all industries. The most successful businesses in the future will be those that can harness the power of this technology.
Investors must pay close attention, and the good news is that it's not too late to join the party. Here's one leading AI stock that I think investors should buy before the end of 2025.
AI from A to Z
You don't have to search far and wide to find a smart AI bet. Look no further than Alphabet (GOOGL 1.89%) (GOOG 1.87%). About a decade ago, the company began shifting its strategy to focus more on AI. These days, it's a leader in the space.
Alphabet's family of large language models, called Gemini, are integrated with its various user-facing products and services. The company's ad customers also benefit from AI tools that drive creativity and boost targeting capabilities that can increase return on money spent.
Google DeepMind is a leader when it comes to AI research, and Alphabet is developing its own chips, called Tensor Processing Units. And with Google Cloud, the business owns a powerful platform that enables other companies to build their own AI applications.
Time to buy
Despite being one of best ways to put money to work behind the AI trend, shares aren't expensive. They trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.4. I think investors would be smart to buy the stock now."

A $6.3 billion agreement between red-hot CoreWeave (CRWV 3.61%) and the company at the very heart of the AI boom, Nvidia (NVDA 0.07%), sent both stocks higher. So what exactly is a backstop, and what does this latest announcement mean for both CoreWeave and Nvidia?
What is a backstop?
A backstop agreement is a safety net -- a guarantee that a company will step in as a buyer of last resort if things don't go according to plan. Many of these deals have involved the guarantee of a lease. If, say, Microsoft agreed to provide a $1 billion backstop for a lease between a data center operator and a cloud provider, the data center operator will be made whole if the cloud provider fails to pay its lease (up to a maximum of $1 billion).
Much like a cosigner on a loan, these backstops from large, successful companies allow smaller companies to access significantly more credit at better rates than they could otherwise.
In CoreWeave's deal, Nvidia is obligated to pay the company up to $6.3 billion through 2032 if the cloud provider has unsold capacity. The agreement was actually signed in 2023, but was only publicly revealed in an SEC filing this month.
CoreWeave needs Nvidia's guarantee
The benefit to CoreWeave is pretty straightforward. Building AI data centers is extraordinarily expensive. There are few companies that have cash flows large enough to pay for substantial data center capacity outright. CoreWeave is using debt -- a lot of it -- to build its data centers and acquire capacity from existing infrastructure providers.
CoreWeave needs money, and Nvidia's backstop allows it to access the capital it needs. Lenders are much more likely to agree to favorable terms -- or extend credit at all -- when they know one of the most successful companies on the planet is on the hook for billions of dollars.
Since the agreement is not new, its public revelation won't really change anything for CoreWeave's ability to access financing. However, it does help quell growing concerns from investors over the sustainability of its business model. That's great for its stock price.
Nvidia has a lot to gain, too
While CoreWeave's benefits are more readily apparent, Nvidia wins as well. CoreWeave serves an important role in Nvidia's ecosystem -- a role that extends well beyond being just another customer.
CoreWeave lowers the friction for companies that can't afford or justify massive, upfront graphics processing unit (GPU) purchases. Wider access means more sustainable demand. It means more AI workloads inside the CUDA software ecosystem -- a key element of Nvidia's moat -- reinforcing developer lock-in.
It also gives Nvidia a buffer and offloads risk. Nvidia gets to reap the benefits of supplying the AI data center build-out without directly spending its own money to build capacity and drive demand. It lets CoreWeave do so instead. That means it's CoreWeave that is spending enormous amounts of its cash -- and the cash it has borrowed -- to build capacity.
If AI demand drops sharply, obviously, it would be bad for Nvidia, but it could be disastrous for CoreWeave. Nvidia's obligation to creditors is capped at $6.3 billion. It's CoreWeave that's on the hook for the full amount of its debt.
Critically, the deal is structured so that Nvidia gets to use the unsold capacity it is paying for.
Who wins?
In the short term, both companies get what they need. Over the long term, however, Nvidia is the clear winner. If AI demand continues at the levels we are seeing today, both companies win. If AI demand cools, however, CoreWeave is in a tight spot.
CoreWeave is walking a tightrope, and its success requires AI demand to stay hot. I'm not sure that will happen. It's entirely possible that even if AI succeeds over the long term, there will be a period of retraction. This could prove fatal to CoreWeave given its enormous -- and expensive -- debt load."

Many of the top picks surged during September, leaving investors wondering if there's still room for these stocks to run during October and throughout the end of the year. I think there's a high likelihood of this occurring, as quantum computing is shaping up to be a huge theme in the market during 2026.
I've got three top quantum computing stocks investors will want to pick up during October, and they cover a broad range in the quantum computing industry.
IonQ
IonQ (IONQ -6.07%) is one of the most popular quantum computing stocks on the market. It received a bit of fame by being the first quantum computing pure play to go public, and the stock has been a massive success. Since its IPO, it's up nearly 500%.
However, a large chunk of that performance has come recently, as it's starting to announce increased breakthroughs in quantum computing. Its most recent innovation, which it announced on Sept. 25, was meeting the milestone of #AQ 64, which means that the system is capable of 18 quintillion (2 to the 64th power) possibilities. This achievement brings IonQ one step closer to achieving commercial relevance, which it must do before it becomes a successful investment.
IonQ has a lot of hype building around the stock, but it's far from profitable, and its quarterly revenue only comes from research contracts. That could flip in the near future if a large-scale commercial client sees value in its technology over traditional computing methods. Most quantum computing companies point to 2030 as the date when that might occur. Still, if IonQ can continue innovating at this rate (it crossed the #AQ 36 milestone only nine months ago), quantum computing could become viable much sooner than that.
IonQ is a risky bet in the quantum computing space, but if it works out, it could make investors a ton of money.
Alphabet
Another quantum computing competitor is Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.89%). Alphabet initially kicked off the quantum computing investment rush last December when it announced that its Willow quantum computing chip had completed a task that would have taken the world's most powerful supercomputer 10 septillion (10 to the 25th power) years to complete.
Quantum computing is an incredibly important technology for Alphabet to develop, as it would allow Alphabet to increase the profitability of its cloud computing division. Currently, Alphabet purchases computing units from a few vendors, which means it must pay for that company's profits. If Alphabet develops in-house quantum computing capabilities and doesn't need to purchase computing units from a supplier like IonQ, it will become far more profitable.
Even if Alphabet doesn't win the quantum computing race and must continue buying quantum computing units from a supplier like IonQ, most quantum computing usage will likely come over the cloud, which will boost Google Cloud's revenue.
This makes Alphabet a win-win investment in the quantum computing realm, and with Alphabet's massive resources, I'm willing to bet it will develop a viable quantum computing device internally.
Nvidia
Lastly, there is Nvidia (NVDA 0.07%), which currently makes the most powerful computing units that utilize traditional computing methods. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and there are countless GPUs in service today, training and operating AI models. Replacing the existing computing infrastructure with a quantum-based one isn't possible, and the best use for quantum computing appears to be deploying it in traditional computing scenarios in a hybrid approach.
Nvidia is working to bridge the gap in that hybrid computing architecture, adopting its leading CUDA software to quantum and renaming it as CUDA-Q. By ensuring that its GPUs will be used alongside quantum processing units in a hybrid approach, Nvidia will cement its role in the next phase of computing, allowing it to continue its dominance.
An investment in Nvidia allows quantum computing investors to bridge the gap between what's currently popular and what may be popular in five to ten years. However, if quantum computing turns out to be a flop, then Nvidia's GPUs will still be the most powerful computing unit available, making the stock a must-own for the foreseeable future."

Is It Time to Buy the Stock?,UiPath stock could have a strong upside if these partnerships can help reaccelerate revenue growth.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d95fb01ddc9d3564a818a0b7609a69d1b7d382e36f8c39d6905300509042393c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/uipath-stock-jumps-nvidia-collaboration-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/uipath-stock-jumps-nvidia-collaboration-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/uipath-stock-jumps-nvidia-collaboration-buy/,fool.com,200.0,,"UiPath (PATH 0.97%) finally gave the market something to get excited about. The stock popped after the company laid out a series of new collaborations with Nvidia, Alphabet, Snowflake, and OpenAI. For a business that has been slogging through a multiyear turnaround, this was great news, as it shows a company ready to play a central role in how enterprises actually use artificial intelligence (AI).
Going down a new path
UiPath is no longer trying to be just a robotic process automation (RPA) company that uses software bots to automate rule-based tasks such as data entry. Instead, it is shifting to agentic automation, where its AI agent orchestration platform can coordinate how humans, bots, and different AI agents all work together. These new partnerships are about pushing that vision into the real world.
The deal with Nvidia focuses on industries that have little room for error. UiPath will use Nvidia's Nemotron models and NIM microservices to power agents that can run on-premises in regulated environments like healthcare and fraud detection, where data can't leave secure systems. Meanwhile, it will bring Alphabet's Gemini models into its platform, so people can use automation with voice commands.
In addition, by linking up with Snowflake, it will tie Snowflake's Cortex AI to its orchestration platform to help customers act on data insights in real time. And finally, its OpenAI partnership adds a ChatGPT connector that lets customers weave advanced large language models (LLMs) right into their workflows without rebuilding everything from scratch.
When you look at these moves together, UiPath is trying to position itself as the Switzerland of enterprise AI agents: integrating with everyone and letting customers pick whichever models they want without locking themselves into a single vendor. That pitch resonates because companies are wary of vendor lock-in, and having one orchestration platform that can handle all these AI agents could become a valuable advantage. The collaboration with Snowflake looks particularly compelling because the combination should be able to offer an alternative approach to Palantir that can deliver similar data-driven automation and real-world insights using a customer's data that is already warehoused inside Snowflake servers.
Meanwhile, even before announcing these partnerships, UiPath was already seeing early signs that its turnaround was starting to take hold.
In its most recent quarter, the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) climbed 11% to $1.72 billion, beating the high end of guidance. Cloud ARR jumped 25% to cross the $1 billion mark, proving that the migration to the cloud is moving along. Net revenue retention stabilized at 108% after several quarters of slippage, which is important because it suggests existing customers are still spending more. Its public sector business, which had been frozen earlier in the year, is starting to come back, and adjusted operating margins jumped to 17% as the company's past cost cuts and restructuring efforts began to show up in its numbers.
Is the stock a buy?
While UiPath still has plenty to prove, there are other encouraging signs. The return of founder Daniel Dines as CEO has given the company a steadier hand and clearer focus on its agentic automation vision. More than 450 customers are already building AI agents on its platform, and 95% of new customers are adopting its core automation products too, suggesting the new AI tools are complementing rather than replacing its traditional offerings.
Trading at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 4.1 times expected 2026 revenue, the stock's valuation is inexpensive for a business with improving fundamentals. If these partnerships can further help accelerate growth, UiPath's stock could have plenty of upside ahead.
That said, this is not a low-risk story, and there will likely be bumps along the way. However, for investors willing to bet on a company that looks like it is getting its act together and has some powerful partners lined up, the stock looks like an interesting buy."

What makes AI stand out from other buzzwords is that the results are clear and strong, and that it's being developed by stable giants as opposed to risky start-ups.
One of them is Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%), parent company of search engine Google. Alphabet is using AI in its search business as well as its cloud business, and it has incredible long-term opportunities. But it trades at a bargain price.
Dominating with AI
It's been impossible not to notice the new AI summaries that appear on top of many Google searches these days. Alphabet has developed its own large language model (LLM) called Gemini that powers its search results to give users quick and readable answers to their questions. It also offers AI services to its advertisers to help them run successful campaigns, putting more dollars into its own pockets.
Alphabet also has a robust cloud computing segment, and it provides a large suite of AI solutions and tools for clients that want to develop customized apps through its platform. At least one Wall Street analyst recently said is ""the most valuable company"" based on its AI business. And as the AI race heats up, Alphabet, which is the fourth-largest company today according to market value, could surge higher.
One reason that could happen quickly is that its stock is trading at a bargain valuation of only 23 times forward earnings. As it gains ground in AI, its stock is likely to advance, and this valuation can easily handle higher gains."

The company built its reputation supplying networking gear to data centers, but its real growth engine today is with application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. These are custom AI chips that large hyperscalers (companies that own massive data centers) are starting to turn to help reduce costs when training large language models (LLMs) or running inference.
Unlike graphics processing units (GPUs), these chips are preprogrammed for specific tasks before they are built. This can lead to better performance and efficiency for the tasks for which they were designed, but they lack to ability to be reprogrammed, and thus are a lot less flexible.
The company's playbook is simple, but it's hard to replicate. Broadcom works side by side with a few select customers to create chips programmed for specific purposes, leveraging its deep library of intellectual property (IP) around interconnects and energy-efficient circuitry. It then uses its close ties with foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.36%) to help produce the chips.
Broadcom has been seeing huge momentum in this area. It helped Alphabet (GOOGL 1.89%) (GOOG 1.87%) develop its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) years ago to help power its cloud computing business and has stayed a key partner as those chips have evolved. It has also scored design wins with Meta Platforms and ByteDance.
Combined, it thinks these three customers are a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal 2027, which is huge considering it's on track to generate around $63 billion in revenue this year. It also recently announced that a fourth customer, widely believed to be OpenAI, has placed a $10 billion order with it for next year.

While everything appears to be clicking now for Broadcom, the same model that has propelled the stock higher is also where the biggest risk lies. Broadcom's ASIC business depends on a small set of very large customers. Losing even one would leave a noticeable hole in both revenue and profits. That concentration is not just a financial issue, as it gives those customers leverage and time to build their own chip design expertise.
We have already seen this story playing out in other corners of the tech world. Apple, one of Broadcom's biggest wireless component buyers, recently replaced one of the company's Wi-Fi chips with its own in-house developed Wi-Fi chip. Meanwhile, Alphabet previously found a cheaper Wi-Fi chip partner in Synaptics. This shows how determined big tech companies can be to lower component costs.
There are signs a similar shift could be coming in AI chips. Reports suggest Alphabet is working more closely with MediaTek on parts of its next TPU generation and taking on more of the design work itself. Hyperscalers have enormous capital budgets but are always looking to stretch every dollar spent on computing power. If they believe they can achieve the same performance with a cheaper partner or by doing the work in-house, they will ditch Broadcom.
As these companies learn more from working with Broadcom, they also gain negotiating power. This can lead to lower gross margins over time, even if the relationships remain intact. Meanwhile, the long design cycles in ASICs mean Broadcom commits resources years ahead of production, so any change in a customer's roadmap can make that investment less valuable.
For now, Broadcom has a technical edge. Its proprietary IP around high-speed SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer), its expertise in low-power design, and its ability to integrate advanced packaging at the latest TSMC nodes still make it the go-to partner for hyperscalers that want a custom solution. That has bought the company time and kept competitors like MediaTek at bay for now.
Investors, though, should not assume that the edge is permanent. History shows that once a few large tech companies can figure out how to lower costs by cutting out or switching to a new partner, they tend to do so. The stock's recent run-up is tied almost entirely to its custom AI-chip opportunity, which makes this a risk worth watching closely.
Broadcom is positioned well for now, but its success has armed its biggest customers with the know-how to one day go it alone or with a cheaper partner like MediaTek or AIChip Technologies. That is the kind of risk that does not show up in next quarter's numbers but can reshape the story over a few years if even one major customer decides it no longer needs Broadcom's help."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-04T22:30:00,These Quantum Computing Stocks Could Be the Secret Winners of the AI Boom,Quantum computing could drive increased investment in AI a few years from now.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ea3c193518f7137b2353f399ca976f52febb06abbc823e33b3238bd0030efeb8,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/these-quantum-computing-stocks-could-be-the-secret/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/these-quantum-computing-stocks-could-be-the-secret/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/these-quantum-computing-stocks-could-be-the-secret/,fool.com,200.0,,"Quantum computing isn't as big an investment theme as artificial intelligence (AI). AI is currently the market's fixation, and for good reason, as that's where a ton of investment dollars from companies around the globe are going.
However, within a few years, quantum computing could greatly accelerate artificial intelligence computing, and there are a handful of companies that could cash in on this exciting technology. If you want to increase your risk tolerance in exchange for a greater reward, I think investing in these companies offers a compelling trade-off.
IonQ
IonQ (IONQ -6.07%) is one of the most popular quantum computing stocks, likely stemming from its claim of being the first quantum computing-focused company to debut on the public markets. However, its technology is also compelling and could have massive implications in the AI realm.
Instead of superconducting quantum computing, which most competitors in this space use, IonQ takes a different approach. It utilizes trapped-ion quantum computing, which has two primary benefits.
First, trapped-ion quantum computing doesn't need near absolute-zero temperatures; it can be done at room temp. This is a massive advantage, as it isn't as expensive to operate, and specialized facilities do not need to be developed.
Second, trapped-ion quantum computers provide far greater accuracy than their superconducting counterparts. IonQ currently holds two world records for quantum computing accuracy. IonQ's accuracy comes at the cost of computing speed, but for early adopters of the technology, having accurate calculations instead of high speed is more desirable.
IonQ believes that quantum computing can significantly boost AI capabilities. Recently, IonQ announced that its Tempo system has reached the #AQ 64 performance milestone. This indicates that its computing space for quantum calculations has doubled from the last milestone it achieved nine months ago. This advancement further increases IonQ's potential to become viable in boosting AI, as a hybrid system can significantly reduce energy consumption while running these models.
Time will tell if IonQ's solution is commercially viable, but all signs point toward it becoming a massive winner in the coming years from the hybrid quantum computing industry.
Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.89%) is also developing a quantum computing chip. Its Willow quantum computing chip has delivered impressive results, and Alphabet has nearly unlimited resources to invest in this technology.
Alphabet understands the benefits of a hybrid quantum computing system tasked with AI, and it's aiming to develop its own technology so it doesn't need to go out and purchase computing units from external suppliers like it has to with AI.
If Alphabet can develop a viable quantum computing solution, its generative AI model, Gemini, would immediately reap the benefits of boosted computing power. This would likely propel Gemini to the top of the leaderboard in best-performing AI models, making Alphabet a must-invest stock if it does.
Additionally, Alphabet would likely offer its quantum computing abilities through its cloud computing service, Google Cloud. This would allow anyone to rent quantum computing capabilities from Alphabet, leading to a huge demand for the service. Furthermore, because it wouldn't need to pay a middleman to outfit it with computing equipment, this would be highly profitable growth, especially if there are no other commercially viable quantum computing options available. Even if Alphabet's quantum computing investments flop, it will still be able to purchase quantum computing units from a company like IonQ for use in its Google Cloud servers. If there's a huge demand for quantum computing power, Google Cloud will reap the benefits of the technology through this service regardless of how its internal developments pan out.
Should Alphabet develop a viable quantum computing solution, it would have two major benefits and would likely send the stock soaring. This could propel Alphabet to become one of the world's largest companies, making it a no-brainer buy right now."

The firm believes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has become an AI Winner, which it thinks is right. Moving forward, the earnings revisions will be crucial. The firm will be focused on upward revisions, mainly in Search and GCP, hinting at faster search as well as cloud growth from Gen AI. Willow, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s latest quantum chip, has state-of-the-art performance throughout a number of metrics, enabling 2 major achievements. First, Willow is capable of reducing errors exponentially as it scales up using more qubits.

Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.89%) and Amazon (AMZN -0.53%) are widely seen as key beneficiaries of this revolution. Alphabet (through Google Cloud and Workspace) and Amazon (through AWS) serve enterprise markets. Still, they are also heavily exposed to consumer-driven segments, such as digital advertising and e-commerce.
On the other hand, Microsoft (MSFT -0.19%) is more enterprise-centric, with a business model primarily based on seat-based subscriptions and long-term contracts. This recurring, enterprise-first model gives Microsoft stronger visibility than its peers, which are more reliant on cyclical consumer markets.
This edge may help propel Microsoft's market capitalization ahead of Alphabet and Amazon by 2030. Here are some other reasons why this prediction can become a reality in the next few years.
The case for Microsoft
Microsoft's enterprise-focused AI strategy is proving to be a key advantage. Overall, over 800 million monthly active users are engaging with all the AI features embedded in its portfolio.
The company has integrated Copilot across its core offerings, including Office, Teams, Dynamics, Security, and GitHub, and monetizes it through either recurring subscriptions or consumption-based pricing. The Copilot family of apps caters to over 100 million monthly active users. While Copilot is used by nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies, there remains a significant opportunity to further expand usage within existing accounts.
Copilot is also the fastest-growing product in the Microsoft 365 productivity suite. With an installed base (paid M365 commercial seats) of over 430 million and initial pricing of $30 per seat per month, there is still a long runway for seat penetration and an increase in average revenue per user in future years.
Increasing adoption of cloud computing is also a significant growth catalyst. Azure has become the second-largest cloud infrastructure services player globally, with a 20% market share. By aggressively expanding its data center capacity, which now spans over 400 Azure data centers across 70 regions, Microsoft is preparing to meet the rapidly increasing demand for AI.
The company is also rolling out liquid cooling and software improvements at data centers, which are crucial for conserving power while running complex AI workloads. All this can translate into lower unit costs and better margins for Microsoft, especially as workloads scale.
Beyond compute, Microsoft has also built an extensive technology stack. At the data layer, the company has a complete data and analytics platform called Fabric. The company operates Azure AI Foundry at the model layer, enabling enterprises to build, manage, and customize AI applications and agents at scale. Finally, at the application layer, Copilot, Copilot Studio, Copilot Tuning, and SharePoint enable organizations to create millions of custom agents embedded directly in their daily workflows.
Together, this can position Microsoft as the operating system for enterprise AI -- another exceptional opportunity for the long run. The end-to-end stack helps create a sticky customer base, reduces customer churn, and increases contract size. Microsoft already has a contracted backlog of $368 billion at the end of fiscal 2025. The company also has a 98% annuity mix, implying that 98% revenues are recurring in nature. The company, thus, enjoys high revenue visibility in the coming years.
Microsoft trades at 28.3 times forward earnings, which is not exactly cheap. However, the premium is justified considering the durability of its enterprise-first model and the fact that it is in the early stages of AI adoption. Hence, Microsoft's shares could still offer considerable upside over the next five years.
Alphabet and Amazon may stumble
Although Alphabet and Amazon are formidable players in AI, Microsoft appears far more resilient. Alphabet's Gemini family of models is now helping enhance monetization across its core offerings, including Search, YouTube, and Android. Google Cloud is also the third-largest cloud infrastructure services provider, with a 13 % market share.
However, increasing evidence suggests that the company's flagship Google search business has come under intense threat, especially from AI chatbots and other AI-enhanced search engines.
Alphabet also faces risk to its digital advertising business in the current challenging economic environment. The rising number of antitrust cases in the European Union limits its ability to integrate search and digital advertising with AI capabilities. Hence, while at 22.8 times forward earnings, Alphabet looks cheaper than its peers, the discount can be attributed to the inherent challenges faced by its business.
Amazon is also investing heavily in generative AI technologies to strengthen its e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. The company's Bedrock service (used by customers to develop and scale custom AI applications, while also giving access to multiple foundation models) is gaining traction. The company says its custom Trainium chip is showing 30% to 40% better price-performance than other graphics processing units (GPUs) providers in inference workloads. AWS remains the leader in the cloud infrastructure services market, with a 30% market share.
However, the company's key engine, AWS, saw revenue grow at 17.5% year over year in the recent quarter, far lower than the 34% year-over-year growth reported by Azure. The company's e-commerce margins are also low. Hence, Amazon's ability to fund future AI initiatives without compromising on near-term profitability looks weak. Despite these challenges, the company is trading at an elevated valuation multiple of 28.9 times forward earnings, leaving little room for error.
Many prominent analysts also view Microsoft as a company with significant upside potential. Coatue's Philippe Laffont estimates Microsoft's market capitalization to be nearly $5.7 trillion by 2030. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities expects Microsoft's market capitalization to potentially surpass $5 trillion by the end of 2026 (18 months from June 2025).
Hence, Microsoft appears to be better positioned than Alphabet and Amazon to grow in the current economy. In case Alphabet and Amazon stumble, Microsoft's market value can surpass even their combined values by 2030."

The collaboration also involves building AI-powered shopping agents designed to redefine e-commerce experiences.
See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings.
PayPal’s bold push into AI-powered shopping, now as Google’s primary payments processor and with upgraded Honey features, comes after a challenging year for its stock. While big tech partnerships have sparked interest, the 1-year total shareholder return of -13% and longer-term performance show momentum has yet to turn. This reflects the market’s cautious wait-and-see stance as competitive risks linger alongside growth potential.
If these shifts in digital commerce pique your curiosity, it might be the perfect time to discover fast growing stocks with high insider ownership
Yet with shares hovering near five-year lows and analysts projecting nearly 20% upside, the question remains: are these innovations a catalyst for PayPal’s next rally, or is renewed growth already baked into the price?
Most Popular Narrative: 34.2% Undervalued
PayPal Holdings closed at $69.25, while the most-followed narrative sets fair value substantially higher. This viewpoint hinges on Venmo's momentum and the company's ambitious expansion into new merchant solutions, suggesting powerful catalysts behind the bullish outlook.
The two biggest things that make me excited about this company are 1: The monetization of Venmo and then 2: PayPal open. Venmo is a very popular app/tool that people are using all over. One thing that they/past management had issues with was how to monetize it. Slowly, besides transaction fees and earning interest off of customers’ unused cash, they have started to begin adding a Debit and a Credit card into the mix. Along with that, and what I am most bullish on, is how they are having Venmo being able to be used in stores. I mean even the other day when I was on DoorDash I noticed that Venmo is now an option to use for payment.
Want to know what kind of growth story justifies such a target? The narrative relies on aggressive expansion, network effects, and game-changing revenue streams that could redefine PayPal's future. The math behind the fair value is bold and fueled by more than just incremental growth. Uncover all the assumptions and see the full blueprint that shapes this market-moving valuation perspective.
Result: Fair Value of $105.25 (UNDERVALUED)
Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts."

Economic data releases and earnings
A double-digit fall this week has shoved Reddit into an unflattering spotlight.
After a third-party research report showed that ChatGPT was citing Reddit content far less than it used to, investors recoiled, calling into question the viability of the social forum's ambitions to become a key player in the AI transition.
At the heart of Reddit's predicament is a tension between revenue strategies, where one path to growth shrinks or closes another. Anticipating that AI chatbots are on a course to disrupt how people search and discover information online, Reddit has fashioned itself as a rare source of direct human connection and dialogue. And if the digital world will soon be drowning in AI slop, Reddit's seemingly limitless reservoir of conversational authenticity will only become more valuable.
But Reddit's licensing agreements with AI companies like OpenAI and Google, while offering guaranteed revenue, also place the social forum at the whims of a new, untested paradigm of AI search.
When Reddit IPO'd last year, this newsletter described its AI ambitions as a Faustian bargain. The beloved forum was trading a piece of its soul for a short-term promise of payment. Empowering the companies behind large language models might sabotage Reddit's advertising potential and its relationships with the very users who make the service valuable in the first place. Surrendering itself as training material seemed short-sighted and ill-advised.
But investors had other ideas. Reddit shares have exploded, rising more than 200% over the past year.
Like any sudden drop after a huge run-up, this week's sell-off could ultimately turn out to be a blip.
Besides, Reddit is aware of the problem of losing user engagement to the encroachment of AI answer engines and is pursuing creative ways to get around it. If AI systems are becoming less reliant on Reddit inputs, one strategy is to make Reddit content even more useful and, in turn, valuable.
As Bloomberg reported last month, part of Reddit's negotiations with Google to re-up their licensing agreement is a discussion of a new kind of partnership that would steer Google users to contribute to Reddit's forms. Google traffic would generate Reddit content, boosting its relevance and elevating its importance in the AI ecosystem.
In addition to talks about dynamic pricing — with Reddit receiving more money as AI answers rely more heavily on its posts — the discussions reflect a strategy by the social forum to get more bang for their content buck."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-04T09:15:00,3 Must Own Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before 2025 Is Over,AI investing will continue to be a prevalent theme in 2026.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ee38dbd2ac04a57926cdf6216c263189485341493a32324a148db885300be5f7,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-must-own-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-bu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-must-own-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-bu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-must-own-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-bu/,fool.com,200.0,,"2025 is three-fourths over. While that may be odd to say, the reality is that a new investing year is almost upon us. However, there are still plenty of stocks that are worth buying now, especially to capture an end-of-year rally that may occur as institutional investors reposition their portfolios to capture gains where they think the market will be heading in 2026.
Three stocks that I think are must-owns heading into 2026 are Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.89%), Meta Platforms (META 1.07%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.53%). All of these could see significant investor interest over the next year as the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race intensifies, making them excellent stocks to own now.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet is the parent company of Google, among many other brands. While it was initially a laggard in the AI arms race, it has caught up and established itself as a top option in the space. Its Gemini generative AI model consistently ranks as one of the best, and it is likely the most quickly used due to its integration with the Google Search engine via AI overviews.
Alphabet was negatively viewed throughout most of 2025 as investors were worried that generative AI could replace the Google Search engine. Additionally, there were antitrust concerns surrounding Google's search engine business, although those fears were relieved when a Judge only required Alphabet to change a few things and didn't require a breakup.
Now that both of those fears are essentially gone, investors can appreciate Alphabet for the impressive business that it is. I predict this will cause the stock price to increase substantially over the next few years, as it still trades at a discount to most of its big tech peers (when measured by its forward price-to-earnings ratio, as seen in the chart below).
Alphabet is a top stock to own heading into 2026, and buying shares even after its sizable run is a smart move.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms is the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, along with a handful of other social media sites. This makes Meta primarily an advertising business, but it's using AI to increase the effectiveness of its platforms.
Meta continues to improve its AI-powered ad tools, but it has already seen higher conversion rates combined with more time spent on its platforms. This increases Meta's revenue, but the effect is far from complete. We'll see more tools released and other technologies implemented that continue to increase effectiveness over the next few years, and this should lead to continued strong growth from Meta, which grew its revenue by an impressive 22% in Q2.
Additionally, Meta released the second generation of its AI glasses. Time will tell if these are a hit among the general population, but if it can produce a piece of hardware that's a must-own, then Meta will have created a brand-new revenue stream out of nothing. Even if it flops, Meta's AI investments in its ad business will pay off, making Meta a great stock for 2026.
3. Amazon
Nearly every person in the U.S. is familiar with Amazon, but few recognize what really drives Amazon's profits: AWS. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud computing wing, and it is essentially Amazon building out excess computing capacity and renting it out to those who need it. This allows clients to move workloads from expensive on-site hardware that must be maintained by skilled labor to Amazon's servers, where this isn't needed.
This has become a popular option for traditional workloads alongside emerging artificial intelligence workloads. As a result, the cloud computing industry is booming.
AWS is the market leader in this industry, but it has grown more slowly than its two primary competitors (Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure). However, it may be able to turn it around in 2026 and deliver strong growth that boosts Amazon.
Although AWS only accounted for 18% of total revenue in Q2, 53% of operating profits came from AWS. This makes AWS' continued growth key for Amazon investors. If AWS can increase its growth rate from its current 17% pace to a much faster 30% to 40% range (how quickly Google Cloud and Azure are growing), Amazon shareholders could be handsomely rewarded in 2026."

While valuations are high, comparisons to the dot-com era suggest this may be a structural shift.
The combined market value of the United States' Magnificent Seven tech giants has now exceeded the entire output of the European Union, as a relentless rally in technology stocks stretches valuations and stokes concerns over potential market excess.
As of the close on 2 October 2025, the seven leading US tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla — commanded a total market capitalisation of $20.8 trillion (€17.7tn), eclipsing the EU’s total economic output of $19.4tn (€16.5tn).
Nvidia alone, now the world’s most valuable company, boasts a market valuation of around $4.3tn (€3.9tn) — equivalent to the GDP of Germany, Europe’s largest economy.
This extraordinary milestone is fuelling debate. Is this a transformative moment for global capitalism, or are we witnessing the early signs of a new tech bubble?
To assess that, we must ask: What truly defines a technology stock bubble — and how does today compare to the speculative frenzy of the early 2000s?
What is a tech bubble?
A tech bubble could be defined not just by high valuations, but by a widespread disconnect between market prices and the underlying economic reality or business fundamentals.
It’s characterised by speculative fervour, excessive investor optimism, and the belief that rapid technological change will deliver limitless profits — often without regard to earnings or sustainable business models.
Renowned economist Robert Shiller describes bubbles as periods of “social contagion” — where stories of quick riches fuel mass enthusiasm, drawing in more investors and driving prices even higher, regardless of the fundamentals.
In this phase, fear of missing out overrides risk assessment.
“Speculative bubbles are fuelled by the contagious spread of market stories, which inspire enthusiasm and a desire to participate among a growing number of investors,"" Robert Shiller wrote in his 'Irrational Exuberance'.
Hyman Minsky, another influential economist, argued that during euphoric booms, speculation becomes the dominant force in markets.
As asset prices climb, they are increasingly justified by narratives rather than data. Eventually, a trigger — whether macroeconomic, regulatory, or psychological — bursts the illusion, leading to a sharp correction. In tech bubbles, this dynamic is often amplified by the allure of innovation.
Investors project exponential growth onto emerging technologies — from dot-coms in the late 1990s to blockchain in the 2010s, and now potentially artificial intelligence.
‘This is not a bubble, but a reshaping of capitalism’
Jordi Visser, senior managing director and head of macro research at 22V Research, argued that branding today’s rally as a bubble misses the point.
“To separate AI from the lazy shorthand of ‘bubble’, we have to recognise that what’s unfolding is not speculative mania but a structural arms race,” he said, pointing to deep investment by governments and corporations in AI capabilities as a matter of national and economic security.
Rather than being driven by unsustainable euphoria, Visser suggests that AI is accelerating a decades-long process of economic concentration. That's one where wealth and innovation are being compressed into fewer hands, be they companies, households or nations.
“Bubbles lift everyone into euphoria; concentration leaves most behind,” he said.
Still, there are signs that investor sentiment is stretching. The speed of capital inflows into AI-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the speculative rise of small-cap AI names, and the dominance of a few megacaps over the broader market may not suggest a full-blown bubble, but they do indicate heightened risk.
Moreover, the structural bets being placed on AI may not all yield long-term gains. As with previous technological revolutions, not every firm will emerge a winner. The ghosts of AOL, BlackBerry and Yahoo! — once market leaders — still linger as reminders of how quickly innovation can outpace incumbency.
Are we in dot-com-like euphoria?
To assess whether we’re in a bubble similar to the late 1990s, it’s worth revisiting the numbers. The current tech rally can be traced back to November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT — a landmark moment for generative artificial intelligence that ignited a new wave of enthusiasm in Silicon Valley and beyond.
Since then, the Nasdaq 100 — the benchmark index for the largest US tech firms — has surged by 140% in under three years.
That’s impressive, but still modest compared to the dot-com era. In the three years leading up to the March 2000 peak, the Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 500%.
By that measure, we’re still far from the level of euphoria that defined the turn-of-the-century tech boom. Valuations, while elevated, are not yet extreme.
One of the most widely used indicators to assess equity valuations is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company’s current share price to its expected earnings over the next 12 months.
Here’s how the Magnificent Seven currently stack up:
Nvidia: 33.2x
Microsoft: 33.2x
Apple: 33.3x
Alphabet: 24.8x
Amazon: 32.1x
Meta: 25.5x
Tesla: 220.0x
Only Tesla appears significantly out of line, trading at a forward P/E of 220 — the highest in the Nasdaq 100 alongside Palantir, another AI-focused firm. Excluding Tesla, the group’s valuations are actually lower than the broader Nasdaq 100, which currently trades above 40x forward earnings.
In this context, while pricing is undoubtedly rich, it doesn’t yet reflect the frothy excesses of the dot-com bubble, at least not by traditional valuation standards.
Bottom Line
Today’s tech rally is extraordinary in both scale and symbolism.
That the world’s top seven tech companies can collectively outvalue the European Union’s economic output speaks volumes about the shifting balance of economic power in the digital age. But by traditional measures of euphoria — explosive price increases, irrational valuations, widespread retail mania — the current cycle falls short of the dot-com peak.
That may offer comfort to some, but the line between structural transformation and speculative excess is often thin."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-03T23:15:00,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Alphabet,It's difficult trying to choose between these two dominant companies.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=70d308ab4c99347f818395c12d664646ea4ea10687254413cf557a0e645e0901,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-amazon-vs-alphabet/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-amazon-vs-alphabet/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-amazon-vs-alphabet/,fool.com,200.0,,"Given how much impact the tech sector has on the U.S. and global economies these days -- a trend that might become even more prominent in the years and decades ahead -- it's important that investors allocate some portion of their portfolios to these kinds of businesses. This smart strategy can certainly help to boost portfolio returns over the long haul.
Amazon (AMZN -0.53%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.87%) (GOOGL 1.89%) are two great options to consider. They each possess very favorable traits that make them worthy investment candidates. But which of these ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks is the best one to buy right now?
Amazon's sprawling empire
What makes Amazon unique is that it has its hands in multiple tech-driven markets. For instance, the company is the undisputed leader in online shopping. As the economy expands, spending activity increases, and more transactions shift away from brick-and-mortar retailers, Amazon will keep gaining.
The business is involved in a more exciting area, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) being the leading cloud computing platform in the world. AWS has become an essential partner for its customers, as they move their IT workloads off-premises and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools more. It's contributing more to the overall company's finances, with annualized revenue of $124 billion in the second quarter (ended June 30) and a stellar operating margin of 32.9%. Investors might be interested in owning this stock simply to have exposure to AWS.
Digital advertising is another high-potential area that Amazon has a strong position in. It helped produce almost $16 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, which represented a 22% year-over-year increase. Just in the U.S., Amazon's ad services can reach an audience of more than 300 million people.
It's already a colossal organization. And Amazon is in a good position to keep growing at healthy clip for a long time.
Alphabet leads the AI race
Alphabet is a top choice for investors who want greater exposure to the AI boom. Given the huge capital investments taking place, as well as the general bullishness surrounding this trend, betting on AI seems like a smart move.
Alphabet is involved in many parts of this powerful secular trend. It works on AI research at DeepMind. It develops its own chips, having a presence in infrastructure hardware.
With Google Cloud, which is a direct competitor to AWS, Alphabet has a key platform that serves AI needs of its customers. The company's Gemini large language models are embedded into its user-facing apps. And Alphabet is leveraging AI to improve capabilities for its advertising customers.
While the market seemed to be worried at first that AI was going to dismantle Alphabet, the business is performing well. Revenue and operating income both increased by 14% during the second quarter. Google Search, the company's bread and butter, saw sales rise 12%. Management points to strong adoption of the product's AI Mode feature.
The business is in an enviable position. It possesses many durable competitive advantages, like network effects and its unrivaled ability to collect and leverage data. Plus, it has a fortress balance sheet that minimizes financial risk.
Think about upside
Amazon and Alphabet are two of the best businesses in the world. They dominate the markets that they operate in, and that isn't going to change anytime soon.
Investors should consider the potential upside over the next five years and beyond. Profit growth is one important area to look at. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Amazon's earnings per share are projected to increase at a compound annual rate of 18.6% between 2024 and 2027, higher than Alphabet's expected 14.6% yearly pace.
Valuation is also another critical component. Amazon shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2. Alphabet's trade at a cheaper multiple of 23.4.
I don't see why investors can't own both of these wonderful companies."

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the stocks that Wall Street analysts are discussing these days.
Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, said in a latest program on CNBC that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) continues to be a leader in the AI space. She explained why she likes the stock:
“Looking at Alphabet, people are worried about what will the impact of OpenAI be on Google’s advertising business and genesis. I think the impact is not going to be as great as people think and you have the upside from Waymo and their YouTube business.”
Photo by Kai Wenzel on Unsplash Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe concerns around AI-related threats to Google search are overstated. Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. As of April, Google had over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews. Google’s competitor OpenAI failed to impress the market with its GPT-5 model, while Gemini is gaining traction with new features. Analysts believe the company is strongly positioned to start placing ads in AI search results, which means its core ads business will not be impacted despite the decline in traditional search.
Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“We’ll wrap things up with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) , which in similar fashion to Hemnet, only experienced a marginal share price decline over the year. That said, Alphabet did meaningfully underperform our average portfolio return as concerns that it’s near monopolistic position in Search (which generates the majority of their advertising revenue) could be eroded by new Artificial Intelligence (AI) alternatives like ChatGPT and Perplexity. When it comes to the potential risks AI poses to the dominance of search, our view is a balanced one. No doubt uncertainty has increased but we believe Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each) and long-standing investments and leadership in AI (DeepMind and Google Brain)."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-03T13:15:00,"Opera's flagship and GX browsers to receive upgraded free, native browser AI tools","Opera [NASDAQ: OPRA], a leading global browser and AI agent company, today announced its upcoming browser-AI upgrades to its free browser portfolio that will complement its premium Opera Neon AI browser for advanced users.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ab9e717d1b74dfa9ba0aba1d94ce37a8b4e9b862766e482dbf453883db59a378,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/operas-flagship-gx-browsers-receive-131500191.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/operas-flagship-gx-browsers-receive-131500191.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/operas-flagship-gx-browsers-receive-131500191.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"OSLO, Norway, Oct. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Opera [NASDAQ: OPRA], a leading global browser and AI agent company, today announced its upcoming browser-AI upgrades to its free browser portfolio that will complement its premium Opera Neon AI browser for advanced users.
Opera is a browser expert with more than 30 years of experience in building superior products actively chosen by hundreds of millions of monthly active users. Over the past years, Opera has combined accelerating revenue growth and healthy profitability, with rapidly expanding browser AI capabilities at no charge to its users.
Since the launch of Aria in May 2023, Opera browser users have had access to Opera's free AI assistant. Aria is powered by OpenAI's GPT models and Google's Gemini models directly inside Opera One, Opera GX, Opera Air, Opera browsers on Android and iOS, as well as in Opera Mini.
Over the next weeks, Opera will be launching new versions of its flagship browsers with an upgraded free browser AI, which will bring faster models, better browser integration, higher usage limits as well as access to open source local models.
This week, Opera started shipping its new, premium offering: the new Opera Neon browser. While Aria offers everyday AI support to hundreds of millions of Opera users, Opera Neon is built around agentic AI, which allows AI power-users to move beyond basic AI capabilities and use Opera Neon to work on complex projects with them. This means users can now delegate certain tasks to the browser. The Tasks feature allows them to work on multiple projects in parallel, with the AI agents operating within the context of each task. Opera Neon navigates the web on its users' behalf - checking multiple sites, filling out forms, as well as helping with research and automation of repetitive tasks. The new agentic Opera Neon browser is now rolling out to the large number of people who joined the waitlist.
""Our users already have access to free AI built directly into their browsers. That AI is about to get a powerful upgrade. Should they need more advanced capabilities like agentic browsing and task delegation, the premium Opera Neon product offers them a seamless upgrade path. With years of browser expertise and proven monetization methods, we can sustainably deliver both free AI for hundreds of millions of users as well as premium agentic experiences for power users,"" said Krystian Kolondra, EVP Browsers.
Opera's two-tier approach ensures that every user can access AI in the way that fits them best: everyday AI built into Opera's free browsers, and the Opera Neon browser for those who want a premium AI-powered browsing experience."

Google (GOOGL, Financials) is planting new roots in Arkansas with a $4 billion data center in West Memphis, its first facility in the state. The project, announced this week, is one of the biggest private investments ever made in the region.
Spread across more than 1,000 acres, the data center will run on power from Entergy Arkansas. The site is expected to fuel Google's growing cloud and AI operations, while also giving a major boost to the local economy. Construction will bring thousands of jobs, and once the center opens, hundreds of people will be hired for operations.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders called it a milestone for the state, saying the scale of the project shows confidence in Arkansas' workforce and future growth. For West Memphis, it's a chance to become a key part of the tech economy.
Google isn't stopping at the build.The corporation also said it would set up a $25 million Energy Impact Fund for the neighborhood around it. The money will be used to help people weatherize their homes, install innovative energy-saving devices, and train people for careers in the energy sector.
The move shows how tech companies are racing to build more data centers all around the U.S. to keep up with the demand for cloud services and AI. It's a new chapter for Arkansas, and it might change the state's role in the digital economy for a long time."

The company is reportedly aiming to sell or spin off its Verily life sciences unit, and even as it faces legal noise over YouTube’s content moderation and app store practices, investors don’t seem rattled—at least not for long.
Alphabet’s tech-centric portfolio and core advertising business continue to power returns, so it may come as a surprise that in classic valuation checks, Alphabet only passes 1 out of 6 measures of being undervalued. The stock’s recent 16.2% climb in the past month, on essentially flat movement last week, hints that the market is recalibrating both risk and future growth, especially as Google’s Cloud group trims staff and the AI landscape evolves rapidly.
If you’re weighing Alphabet’s upside, it helps to dig below surface-level price action into what those valuation models actually say. In the next section, I’ll break down what each valuation approach reveals and why, even when a company like Alphabet looks expensive, raw numbers might not tell the whole story. And if you want the smartest way to interpret all these scores, keep reading—I’ve saved the best for last.
Alphabet scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: Alphabet Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a fundamental method for estimating a company’s intrinsic value by projecting its future free cash flows and discounting them back to their value today. In Alphabet’s case, the model uses recent financial data and analyst estimates to forecast cash flows for the next several years, then extrapolates further into the future.
Alphabet currently generates Free Cash Flow of $81.4 Billion, and analysts expect this to grow steadily. Projections show Free Cash Flow reaching $140.1 Billion by 2029. For years beyond 2029, future cash streams are extrapolated based on long-term growth estimates. Actual analyst forecasts stop after five years. All figures here are reported in US dollars, mirroring the company’s financial reporting.
According to the DCF analysis, Alphabet’s fair value comes out to $244.73 per share using this cash flow trajectory. With the stock trading just 0.4% above that benchmark, the model implies Alphabet is valued almost exactly in line with the sum of its discounted cash flows."

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 22 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.
Lightspeed Commerce Investment Narrative Recap
To be a confident Lightspeed Commerce shareholder, investors need to believe in the company’s ability to sustain revenue growth from digital payments and cloud-based services while eventually converting that momentum into profitability. The addition of Sameer Samat and Odilon Almeida to the Board may modestly reinforce execution on product innovation and industry relationships, but it does not materially change the immediate focus on improving cash flow and addressing persistent profitability challenges.
Among recent announcements, Lightspeed’s completion of its authorized share repurchase program stands out as a move affecting shareholder value, yet the most important near-term catalyst remains operational gains in expanding customer locations, payments penetration, and improved cash generation, not directly Board composition.
However, investors should also keep in mind that intensifying competition from larger incumbents puts increasing pressure on both revenue growth and gross margins if Lightspeed cannot maintain a compelling edge...

Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) is leaning into the playful side of artificial intelligence with the wider release of its Gemini 2.5 Flash model and the viral Nano Banana tool that's helping it win over millions of users.
The company said that Gemini 2.5 Flash is now available for production use, offering developers support for 10 aspect ratios that make it easier to create content across social platforms. At the same time, Nano Banana, a quirky image-generation tool that lets users create animated GIFs and edits, has gone viral and helped Gemini surpass OpenAI's ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in Apple's App Store.
Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai leaned into the buzz, encouraging developers to go bananas in a post on X.
For investors, the momentum is meaningful. The surge in Gemini adoption has added energy to Alphabet's AI story, helping lift the company past a $3 trillion market value last month. Analysts say the release underscores how Google is balancing infrastructure investments with consumer-facing AI products in its battle with OpenAI and Meta."

Cipher Mining Investment Narrative Recap
To own Cipher Mining, investors need conviction in the company’s ability to profitably expand beyond Bitcoin mining into AI-centric data center hosting, all while managing high capital demands and volatile revenue tied to crypto cycles. The recent Fluidstack agreement, backed by Google's US$1.4 billion lease commitment, could accelerate Cipher’s shift toward diversified revenue, potentially reducing near-term reliance on Bitcoin, but the company’s capital intensity and unproven HPC execution remain key risks. If tenant demand materializes as hoped, Cipher’s growth runway lengthens; if not, cash returns may lag expectations due to underutilized infrastructure.
Among Cipher’s recent moves, the US$1.3 billion zero-coupon convertible note offering stands out for its scale and timing, providing additional funding flexibility to meet new data center commitments and support future expansions. This approach aims to strengthen Cipher’s capital position as it broadens its mix of compute services, underscoring how closely financing strategy is tied to its biggest catalysts.

Chicago, IL – October 3, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: CoreWeave CRWV and Alphabet GOOGL.
Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:
CoreWeave vs. Google: Which AI Infrastructure Stock Is the Better Buy?
CoreWeave and Alphabet provide cloud infrastructure services for AI workloads. CoreWeave offers GPU-accelerated infrastructure for AI, while Google is a well-established tech giant with diverse revenue sources and an expanding presence in the cloud and AI sectors.
Increased spending on AI infrastructure benefits CRWV and GOOGL, but not equally. So, if an investor wants to make a smart buy in the AI infrastructure space, which stock stands out?
Let’s scrutinize closely to find out which of these two stocks currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter bet now.
CRWV: An Explosive Growth Story
The booming demand for AI infrastructure is greatly benefiting CoreWeave, which saw its revenues skyrocket by 207% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. This marked the company's significant milestone of its first-ever billion-dollar quarter. Adjusted EBITDA almost tripled to $753.2 million.
Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. CoreWeave recently announced yet another expansion of its contract with OpenAI. The new expansion contract, worth $6.5 billion, involves CRWV supplying capacity for OpenAI training of its next-generation models. The total value of the OpenAI contract now stands at an impressive $22.4 billion, which includes $11.9 billion agreement in March and $4 billion expansion in May. OpenAI’s (which is a leading AI company) massive contract not only enhances revenue visibility for CRWV but also validates its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable.
Collaboration with NVIDIA is another positive aspect. CoreWeave was among the first cloud providers to put NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. Additionally, it deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its “Mission Control” for enhanced reliability and performance. NVIDIA also has an agreement with CRWV to purchase residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions."

She may not have the same name recognition as other tech execs like Tim Cook, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg—not yet, anyway—but Mira Murati is one of the most-watched entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. The former chief technology officer from OpenAI, who left to launch her own AI startup last year, just celebrated a major milestone: Her company, Thinking Machines Lab, just launched its first product this week, called Tinker. Rather than be another generative-AI chatbot like ChatGPT, Tinker is designed to help researchers and developers fine-tune AI models without the need to manage massive computing infrastructure. The launch represents the first commercial product from Thinking Machines, which raised a record-breaking $2 billion in seed funding at a $12 billion valuation.
Murati, the 36-year-old Albanian-American engineer-turned-executive, has emerged as a defining figure in the AI boom. Her journey from a mechanical engineering student to the chief technology officer who helped create ChatGPT exemplifies the rapid transformation of both AI technology and the careers of those building it. More recently, her ability to resist Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive recruitment efforts—including reported billion-dollar offers to acquire her company and poach her talent—has solidified her reputation as a leader willing to chart her own course in an industry dominated by tech giants.
From Albania to the world stage
Born on December 16, 1988, in Vlorë, Albania, during the final years of the country’s totalitarian regime, Murati’s early life was shaped by political upheaval and economic uncertainty. Her parents, both high school teachers who taught literature, encouraged her academic pursuits, but Murati told Microsoft’s CTO Kevin Scott in 2023 that she had an “organic interest towards math and science,” where she excelled in Olympiads and competitions throughout her schooling.
At 16, Murati won a scholarship from United World Colleges—a program that brings together students from over 80 countries to promote intercultural understanding and social responsibility—to study at Pearson College on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. But after graduating from Pearson in 2005, Murati pursued an unusual academic path that would prove prescient for her later career. She enrolled in a dual-degree program, completing a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Colby College in 2011 and a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Dartmouth College’s Thayer School of Engineering in 2012. This combination of liberal arts and engineering disciplines provided her with both analytical thinking skills and technical expertise, which would prove handy in her later roles in Silicon Valley."

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today at a joint community celebration with state and local leaders, Entergy Arkansas announced it will power Google's planned $4 billion technology investment in Arkansas.
Google's investment will focus on cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure, including the development of a new data center in West Memphis, Arkansas – the company's first facility in the state. Google also announced plans for a $25 million Energy Impact Fund to scale and accelerate energy affordability initiatives in Crittenden County and the surrounding area as the company shows its commitment to being a good community partner. The funds will go towards home weatherization, innovative energy efficiency technology and energy workforce development.
""We're proud to be partnering with Google to bring unprecedented economic opportunity to Arkansas. Google's $4 billion investment in its new facility, its $25 million Energy Impact Fund, and its investment in the future of our students demonstrates what lasting community impacts aimed a project of this magnitude can have,"" said Entergy Arkansas President and CEO Laura Landreaux. ""Entergy Arkansas is committed to powering growth and building a stronger, more vibrant future for the next generation and has found a partner in Google who shares this same vision.""
Google will cover the full energy costs associated with powering the facility, which will contribute over $1.1 billion in net benefits over the life of the contract and help to reduce electricity rates for all Entergy Arkansas customers. Electric grids operate on economies of scale, so when large customers establish service to power a major new project, they help spread the utility's fixed costs to operate and maintain the grid over a wider customer base, driving down electricity prices for everyone.
The facility will be powered by Entergy Arkansas's strong existing generation power portfolio and transmission grid which will be bolstered by a new 600-megawatt solar project, backed by a 350-megawatt battery storage system that will be located in Jefferson County, Arkansas. Google will pay rates that cover the cost of this resource. Entergy Arkansas has filed this resource for approval with the Arkansas Public Service Commission, and the company's plans will ensure reliability of the system, strengthen the resiliency of the grid, and maintain affordability for customers.
Landreaux continued, ""Large industrial and technology companies are increasingly looking at our state because we offer reliable power at affordable rates, and we plan to keep it that way. Large customers, such as Google, help support investments in infrastructure additions that not only help power their facilities but also result in improved grid reliability that benefit all customers."""

CoreWeave offers GPU-accelerated infrastructure for AI, while Google is a well-established tech giant with diverse revenue sources and an expanding presence in the cloud and AI sectors.
Increased spending on AI infrastructure benefits CRWV and GOOGL, but not equally. So, if an investor wants to make a smart buy in the AI infrastructure space, which stock stands out?
Let’s scrutinize closely to find out which of these two stocks currently holds the edge, and more importantly, which might be the smarter bet now.
CRWV: An Explosive Growth Story
The booming demand for AI infrastructure is greatly benefiting CoreWeave, which saw its revenues skyrocket by 207% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. This marked the company's significant milestone of its first-ever billion-dollar quarter. Adjusted EBITDA almost tripled to $753.2 million.
Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. CoreWeave recently announced yet another expansion of its contract with OpenAI. The new expansion contract, worth $6.5 billion, involves CRWV supplying capacity for OpenAI training of its next-generation models. The total value of OpenAI contact now stands at an impressive $22.4 billion, which includes $11.9 billion agreement in March and $4 billion expansion in May. OpenAI’s (which is a leading AI company) massive contract not only enhances revenue visibility for CRWV but also validates its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable.
Collaboration with NVIDIA is another positive aspect. CoreWeave was among the first cloud providers to put NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. Additionally, it deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its “Mission Control” for enhanced reliability and performance. NVIDIA also has an agreement with CRWV to purchase residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions.
CoreWeave is actively expanding its data center network, enabling it to serve a diverse client base with low latency and high reliability. With over 900 MW of active power targeted by year-end, CRWV is positioning itself as a top-tier provider capable of supporting large-scale AI training and inference workloads. The launch of a new Ventures Fund to invest in AI startups and several acquisitions like Weights & Biases (acquired), Core Scientific, and OpenPipe (announced) strengthen CRWV’s position."

Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Google's multibillion dollar investment in West Memphis is one of the largest ever made in Arkansas.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3cf99a819d76afee85a833715dae04ea6d882cc69bf9d44d3010ad40792b6ca0,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://eu.commercialappeal.com/story/money/business/2025/10/02/google-data-center-4-billion-dollars-west-memphis-arkansas/86354716007/,https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/money/business/2025/10/02/google-data-center-4-billion-dollars-west-memphis-arkansas/86354716007/,https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/money/business/2025/10/02/google-data-center-4-billion-dollars-west-memphis-arkansas/86354716007/,commercialappeal.com,200.0,,"Google to invest $4 billion in data center project in West Memphis. Everything we know
The Mid-South will soon have another major tech company building a data center campus.
Officials from both West Memphis and Arkansas gathered Oct. 2 for the official announcement of Google's new data center campus.
The tech giant plans to invest $4 billion on the project, located at 1500 South Loop Drive in West Memphis. The campus will be located on 1,100 acres.
""Google's multibillion dollar investment in West Memphis is one of the largest investments ever in our state and an incredible testament to the work my administration has done to build Arkansas' energy capacity, invest in our workforce and streamline regulatory processes,"" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.
The event comes nearly a month after Google confirmed plans for its West Memphis campus. On Sept. 5, Laurel Brown, regional head of data center public affairs for Google, confirmed the project and Google's partnership with utility company Entergy.
Additionally, Google announced plans for a $25 million Energy Impact Fund to finance energy affordability initiatives for residents within Crittenden County and nearby communities in Eastern Arkansas.
Ruth Porat, Google Alphabet president and chief investment officer, praised the Energy Impact Fund as a proactive way to meet community needs with economic investment. Porat also announced Google will allocate $4 million within the state of Arkansas for workforce development along with artificial intelligence education and certification programs. The allocation is part of an education accelerator and a joint partnership with the Arkansas Department of Commerce.
That education accelator initiative extends to all students at the University of Arkansas and Arkansas State University, where all students will be eligible for free Google AI personal subscription plans, Porat said.
The project has been in development for some time, albeit under monikers including ""Groot LLC"" and ""Project Pyramid.""
In May, West Memphis City Council approved a 30-year payment-in-lieu-of-taxes (PILOT) for the $1 billion project with Groot LLC. At the time, council members and West Memphis Mayor Marco McClendon confirmed the group had signed non-disclosure agreements and could not share details about the company and the project fully. (The PILOT covers up to $10 billion in construction costs.)
""Today is a proud moment for West Memphis, Crittenden County and the Delta,"" McClendon said during the Oct. 2 event.
McClendon added that the new data center will bring thousands of construction jobs and expects, once completed, the campus will add hundreds of jobs; however no specific figures were provided for jobs.
McClendon also stated that Google will use local union workers for its construction contract work.
In December 2024, a Groot LLC filed a permit application with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Memphis District for a five-building data center campus under the guise, ""Project Pyramid."" In that application, the data center campus was located on a 1,178-acre parcel along Bollinger Road.
The Google campus is located northwest of xAI's Colossus campus at the former Electrolux building in Memphis (the Mississippi River separates the two tech giants' respective properties). Colossus was xAI's first data center campus in South Memphis, the company is currently expanding with Colossus 2 at 5420 Tulane Road in Whitehaven.
Water usage and environmental impact for Google's West Memphis campus
During the Oct. 2 event, McClendon took a shot at Shelby County, specifically Memphis, making it a point to confirm that Google's new data center will not rely on or use gas turbines. He added that residents will not have to worry about an increase in air pollution as Google begins expanding into Crittenden County.
""West Memphis is about to show the world we can lead the way,"" McClendon said. ""Google, welcome to West Memphis, better known as the 'Best' Memphis.""
The use of gas turbines to power its data centers has been a point of controversy with xAI and its continued expansion in South Memphis.
The Google facility will require a little under 1 gigawatt of electricity. Google's initial phase of construction will warrant 900 megawatts of electricity split between batteries and solar (600 megawatts and 350 megawatts, respectively), McClendon said.
Entergy Arkansas CEO and President Laura Landreaux said the battery models that will be used at the site are still to be determined. Entergy is collaborating with West Memphis Utility Commission for energy solutions at the site.
Entergy Arkansas LLC will supply a portion of the power for Google's campus. On Sept. 5, the utility company filed a long-term special rate contract application with Google via the Arkansas Public Service Commission.
Katie Ottenweller, energy market development lead for Google, confirmed that the first phase of construction will be one data center building, with plans for a multi-building campus in the future. That includes a possible greywater plant; however, no plans have been finalized for a water treatment plant or other buildings at this time, she said.
Ottenweller said the initial data center will rely on air-cooled chips and will not require water. That data center building is expected to be completed within 18 to 24 months.

The Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in September, its lowest reading since April. The decline was attributed to growing pessimism among Americans regarding inflation and a weakening job market. This data is particularly concerning for companies reliant on discretionary spending, such as those in online retail, travel, and the gig economy, as reports suggest a bleak consumer outlook could curb spending on non-essential items and services.

Lyft’s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 4.6% on the news that Mizuho initiated coverage on the company with a Neutral rating and a $24 price target.
A ""Neutral"" rating often suggested that an analyst believed the stock was fairly valued with limited potential for significant gains. This lack of a strong ""buy"" signal from a new analyst covering the stock appeared to weigh on investor sentiment. Adding to this view, MoffettNathanson LLC also maintained its own neutral recommendation on Lyft's shares. While MoffettNathanson did raise its price target to $20 from $16, the prevailing neutral stance from the analysts seemed to have prompted the sell-off.

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 3.8% in the afternoon session after reports surfaced that the company was in early talks with its competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), about a potential deal to manufacture chips for them.
The potential deal was viewed as a major vote of confidence in Intel's push to build its foundry business, which makes chips for other companies. A partnership would be significant because AMD, a fierce competitor, has historically relied on Taiwan's TSMC for manufacturing its chips. For Intel, securing its main rival as a customer would validate its manufacturing technology and its ambition to compete with global foundry leaders. For AMD, the arrangement could provide a US-based production alternative and increase its bargaining power with other suppliers.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $37.33, up 3.9% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 36 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% as an analyst note from Deutsche Bank tempered investor enthusiasm, leading to some profit-taking.
The bank reiterated a ""hold"" rating on the stock. While it raised its price target to $30 from a previous $23, the new target remained below the level where the shares were trading. The cautious view gave investors a reason to sell and lock in gains, especially after the stock had a strong rally through September. The move also came as the broader market showed weakness amid concerns over a potential government shutdown.
Intel is up 84.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $37.33 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $731.86.

WEST MEMPHIS, Ark., Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Google is making a multi-billion investment in the State of Arkansas to support the development of a new data center in West Memphis. This new data center will create hundreds of new operations jobs and thousands of construction jobs in the region.
“Google is investing in the next generation of AI innovation in Arkansas and across the country,” said Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer of Alphabet and Google. “We see AI and the energy powering it to be the innovations that will define this century. The upside of AI cannot be unlocked without the energy it requires. That is why Google is building energy capacity that protects affordability for ratepayers and creates jobs that will drive the AI-powered economy.”
Google is constructing the advanced data center campus in West Memphis across a site of more than 1,000 acres. The campus will include a data center facility, office buildings, a substation facility, and other infrastructure.
“Google’s multi-billion-dollar investment in West Memphis is one of the largest investments ever in our state and an incredible testament to the work my administration has done to build Arkansas’ energy capacity, invest in our workforce, and streamline regulatory processes,” said Governor Sanders. “Here in the Natural State, we are providing great businesses like Google with an environment where they can innovate, expand, and invest in the hardworking people who are the backbone of our state’s economy.”
Company executives joined state officials and local leaders on Thursday to celebrate the announcement of the new facility. Google executives highlighted the new data center campus and its importance for the growth of the company’s AI initiatives.
“Arkansas is a state where innovative companies can thrive, and we are proud today to officially welcome Google, one of the most innovative companies in the world, to the Natural State,” said Clint O’Neal, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission. “This new data center campus will help power Google’s search and AI capabilities, but it will also play a major role in powering our region’s economy. This is a major win for both the State of Arkansas and the City of West Memphis. Congrats to the team, including Entergy Arkansas, for their excellent work on the project.”
Entergy Arkansas played a significant role in meeting the electrical requirements for the project. Google will be covering the full energy costs for the West Memphis facility and will be ramping up new solar energy and battery storage resources for the facility."

This approach allows companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to tailor silicon to their exact needs, offering a compelling, often less expensive, alternative to the pricier, general-purpose Nvidia chips.
By helping these key players design their proprietary AI accelerators, Broadcom solidifies its foundational role in the sector, ensuring its technology is deeply integrated into the core infrastructure of the AI revolution.
KeyBanc Capital Markets reinforced this outlook by reiterating its Overweight rating on Broadcom and raising its price forecast to $420 from $400, citing the company’s foundational position in AI and the broader semiconductor supply chain.
Following recent channel checks, analyst John Vinh said that the supply chains of Nvidia and Broadcom “sound the best,” as upward revisions are coming to chip-on-a-wafer-substrate (CoWoS) supply.
Broadcom’s trajectory as a core AI beneficiary is evident in its expanded targets. Its 2026 CoWoS supply goal has climbed to 190,000 units, reflecting an anticipated year-over-year increase exceeding 160%, Vinh noted.
A critical factor in its AI dominance remains control over Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPU franchise through 2026, with volumes expected to more than double.
Additionally, Broadcom has secured significant new AI ASIC orders, including 400,000-500,000 units for OpenAI and roughly 100,000 units for Apple, reinforcing its influence over AI development and production.
Analyst John Vinh raised the price forecast to $420 based on $10.37 fiscal 2026 consolidated earnings per share (EPS).

At least one company has confirmed that data from their Oracle systems has been stolen, according to one of the people.
“We have seen Cl0p demand huge seven- and eight-figure ransoms in the last few days,” said Cynthia Kaiser, vice president at Halcyon’s ransomware research center. “This group is notorious for stealthy, mass data theft that heightens their leverage in ransom negotiations.”
The group began sending extortion emails on or before Sept. 29, according to Genevieve Stark, head of cybercrime at Google Threat Intelligence Group. The emails were sent from hundreds of compromised third-party accounts and claimed the theft of data, she said.
The extortion emails include sloppy English and grammar and are considered characteristic of the group, according to a person familiar with the campaign, who asked not to be named as the information isn’t public. They didn’t disclose the targets of the extortion letters or whether any of the victims had paid a ransom.
Stark said at least one of the email addresses used on the extortion notes was previously used by an affiliate of Cl0p, and the messages contain contact details that are listed on Cl0p’s own website. Alphabet Inc.’s Google doesn’t yet have sufficient evidence to verify the claims made in the extortion demands, she said.
The hackers compromised user emails and abused the default password-reset function to gain valid credentials of internet-facing Oracle E-Business Suite portals, according to Halcyon. However, one of the people familiar with the matter said they believed the theft was caused by a vulnerability the hacker exploited in Oracle’s E-Business Suite."

Vendors and tech giants published official updates showing progress on error correction, larger qubit systems, hybrid quantum-classical stacks and new research centers aimed at real-world use.
Google reiterated its Willow roadmap and published research on error correction and scalable chips and NVIDIA NVDA launched a dedicated “Quantum Day” and announced an Accelerated Quantum Research Center to couple AI supercomputing with quantum research. Pure plays like Rigetti highlighted multi-chip systems and new commercial availability in their quarterly results. Together, these companies have sketched a year of measurable engineering advances and growing commercialization pathways.
Below are four stocks expected to gain from quantum computing in 2025.
Microsoft MSFT
Microsoft’s first-half 2025 quantum computing-based developments center on Majorana 1 and on partnerships to scale quantum hardware and control. Earlier this year, the company unveiled Majorana 1 as a breakthrough topological-qubit processor and a measurement/control approach intended to simplify qubit control and make very large qubit counts practical, positioning Microsoft to pursue a distinct, potentially more scalable hardware path than superconducting or trapped-ion approaches. Microsoft’s focus on developer toolchains and collaborations to accelerate scalable systems suggests the company is pushing both hardware differentiation and cloud integration as its path to commercial quantum advantage. For investors who prefer a diversified tech heavyweight’s exposure to quantum instead of startups, Microsoft’s official roadmap points to multi-front engagement.
IBM IBM
IBM in 2025 is pursuing a stepwise engineering route to fault-tolerant quantum computing that includes building a new IBM Quantum Data Center and an explicit roadmap toward large-scale, fault-tolerant machines. IBM also highlighted international System Two deployments, including a collaboration with RIKEN, along with continued Nighthawk-family hardware and software releases to expand circuit complexity, all signaling IBM’s investment in data-center-scale infrastructure, strategic partnerships and software stacks to support near-term commercial users and research collaborators.
As IBM has outlined, its current focus is on building industrial-scale, co-located classical–quantum platforms and ecosystems that enterprises and governments are likely to adopt first. The company’s 2025 outlook emphasizes steady platform expansion and strategic deployments rather than relying on a single near-term “killer app.”"

Reddit Investment Narrative Recap
To be a Reddit shareholder today, you need to believe in the platform’s ability to convert user-generated content and engaged online communities into revenue through digital ads and licensing partnerships, despite shifts in traffic from Google and emerging AI tools. The recent sharp decline in daily active users and a steep drop in ChatGPT citations is material, as it directly affects Reddit’s most important short-term catalyst, high-margin data licensing, and highlights the biggest immediate risk: diminishing site engagement and traffic dependency.
Among recent developments, the class action lawsuit alleging that Reddit made misleading statements about its Google-driven traffic stands out as especially relevant. This challenge, coming amid already heightened market scrutiny due to reduced ChatGPT references and lower DAUs, adds pressure around advertising revenue and underscores core questions about Reddit’s control over its own growth levers and transparency with stakeholders.
In contrast, investors should consider the full impact of Reddit’s platform exposure and risk of over-reliance on third-party traffic sources...

Shares of aerospace and defense company Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) jumped 5% in the morning session after the company announced a major expansion of its partnership with Japanese satellite operator Synspective, securing its largest-ever single-customer order for 10 additional dedicated launches.
This new agreement brought the total number of contracted missions for Synspective to 21. The deal followed a previous multi-launch contract from just months prior, in June 2024, highlighting a strong and growing business relationship. As the sole launch provider for all of Synspective's satellites currently in space, Rocket Lab reinforced its Electron rocket's leading position in the small satellite launch market. The launches were scheduled to take place from Rocket Lab's complex in New Zealand through the end of the decade.
Is now the time to buy Rocket Lab? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Rocket Lab’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 73 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago when the stock gained 4.9% on the news that the company announced it delivered two spacecraft to NASA for the ESCAPADE mission to Mars. The twin spacecraft, named Blue and Gold, were delivered to Kennedy Space Flight Center. Rocket Lab completed the design, build, integration, and testing of the spacecraft in just three and a half years, a notably fast timeline for a Mars mission. This achievement highlighted the company's ability to rapidly develop space technology, partly by manufacturing parts in-house. This capability aims to make space science more efficient and cost-effective, a factor that resonated positively with investors.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico), a biotechnology organization focused on aging and age-related diseases and founded by Alphabet Inc. and Arthur D. Levinson, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation for ABBV-CLS-628, an investigational therapy for the treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). ABBV-CLS-628, an anti-PAPP-A monoclonal antibody, was developed by Calico in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. The therapy is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating its safety and efficacy in patients with ADPKD.
""We are pleased that ABBV-CLS-628 has been granted Fast Track Designation,"" said Arthur D. Levinson, Ph.D., CEO of Calico. ""This recognition reflects the significant unmet need facing the ADPKD community and the potential of ABBV-CLS-628 to slow kidney function decline in patients with a high risk of rapidly progressing disease. With limited treatment options available, we are hopeful that this therapy may ultimately provide patients with much-needed treatment options.""
ADPKD is the most common inherited kidney disease worldwide.1 Characterized by the development and growth of fluid-filled cysts in both kidneys, the progressive disease leads to kidney failure in more than 50% of patients by age 60. At that stage, dialysis or a transplant are the only treatment options.2
Fast Track Designation is an FDA process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. This status provides sponsors with increased communication and collaboration from the FDA regarding their drug candidate to address questions and issues quickly, with the potential of getting important new therapies to the patient earlier.3
About ABBV-CLS-628
ABBV-CLS-628, an investigational human monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit PAPP-A activity, is being evaluated for the treatment of ADPKD. ABBV-CLS-628 has completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (ACTRN12622001550796) in which it was shown to be safe and well tolerated with no significant adverse events reported to be associated with the drug.
The ongoing Phase 2 study (NCT06902558) is now enrolling across approximately 95 sites globally. Participants receive intravenous ABBV-CLS-628 or placebo every 4 weeks for 92 weeks, with safety follow-up for up to 15 weeks. This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of ABBV-CLS-628 in slowing disease progression in ADPKD."

Optimism and Scaling Ethereum: Progress Made
The more scalable and efficient Optimism becomes, the more appealing it is to users and developers. Already, many entrepreneurs are eyeing Optimism to launch some of the best meme coin ICOs.
At the heart of Optimism’s vision is the Superchain, an ambitious “network of networks” that unifies Ethereum layer-2 platforms built on its technology into a single, cohesive ecosystem.
Key chains leveraging the OP Stack include the second-largest layer-2, Base, and Unichain by Uniswap, a DEX. Optimism fosters shared liquidity, seamless cross-chain messaging, a secure base layer, low fees, and enhanced throughput by interconnecting them.
Driving this progress is the open-source OP Stack, which enables one-click deployments of layer-2s compatible with Ethereum. However, fragmentation has remained a challenge, until now.
The 16a upgrade, launching today on the mainnet, addresses this by streamlining interoperability.

Everything to Know About the Optimism Superchain Upgrade
The Optimism Superchain upgrade, delivered via 16a, is a targeted maintenance release building on Upgrade 16 from July 2025.
It was thoroughly tested on the Sepolia Superchain in late September, enduring over 10 days of validation before today’s mainnet deployment.
Pending governance approval, Superchain Upgrade 16a will be proposed for execution soon:
📍 Sep 22 → Superchain Sepolia

— Optimism (@Optimism) September 19, 2025
This update replaces Upgrade 16, incorporating ecosystem feedback for greater flexibility and security. The refined code is cleaner, eliminating unused elements that could pose risks. It also introduces developer-friendly toggles, such as turning on or off the ETHLockbox or supporting custom gas tokens for L2s.
Collectively, these enhancements lay the groundwork for the full Interop Layer rollout in early 2026, which will feature native message passing, ERC-7802-compliant asset bridging, and shared fault proofs.
While the upgrade activates today, adoption won’t be uniform across OP Stack chains. Base, for instance, plans to implement it on October 8.

In anticipation of the rollout, OP crypto prices are stable, with local support holding at $0.60.
The key resistance is at $0.85, the September high.
For buyers to gain momentum, OP must break above $0.80, reversing losses from the third week of September. Such a move could solidify a path to $0.85 and $1 in the short to medium term, making OP crypto one of the breakout tokens to watch in Q4 2025.

The strategy is aimed at coping with a shortage of AI data center capacity and letting Microsoft free up its own server farms to provide lucrative AI services to customers.
This is just one of a string of deals Microsoft has struck with so-called neoclouds — a new category of small infrastructure providers that lease out AI-focused computing power. Microsoft has inked more than $33 billion in commitments to such providers, including Nebius, CoreWeave Inc., Nscale and Lambda. The deals demonstrate the company’s growing willingness to use relative newcomers for important infrastructure.
Cloud vendors have generally operated their own data centers, but Microsoft is struggling to bring sufficient computing capacity online. Renting access to servers from neoclouds speeds things up since they have already solved logistical challenges including obtaining sufficient power and chips.
“We are in very much land-grab mode in the AI space,” said Scott Guthrie, who leads Microsoft’s cloud efforts. “We’ve made the decision that we don’t want to be constrained in terms of capacity.”
Nebius shares were up about 5.5% at 10:17 a.m. in New York, while Microsoft was mostly unchanged. Nebius and the other neocloud firms declined to comment.
The advent of power-guzzling generative AI has put enormous strain on data center infrastructure. So Microsoft is freeing up capacity in its own data centers for cloud clients by running some computing for internal and OpenAI work at neocloud facilities, Guthrie said.
For example, the first foundation AI models built under consumer AI chief Mustafa Suleyman were trained at a CoreWeave data center near Portland, Oregon, according to people familiar with the work."

With Rental Registries, Cities Seek to Close Data Gap With Landlords
The proliferation of artificial intelligence has led to an explosion of demand for cloud hyperscalers, where Amazon Web Services has the biggest market share. It’s followed by Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud Platform, with Oracle’s huge growth suggesting there’s a fourth major player on the field. CoreWeave Inc. is also garnering investor attention.
The scope of Amazon’s challenge becomes clear in its dwindling stock market valuation. At roughly 25 times expected earnings over the next 12 months compared with 27 times for the Nasdaq 100 Index, Amazon is close to its biggest discount to the tech-heavy benchmark on record. Oracle, on the other hand, is trading at 40 times estimated earnings, near its highest P/E ratio since the dot-com era, while Microsoft trades at nearly 32 times, above its 10-year average.
Alphabet shares are trading for 22 times forward earnings, a modest premium to the company’s long-term average. Although that’s less than Amazon’s multiple, the gap used to be much wider.
Amazon shares dipped 0.6% on Thursday while Alphabet gained 0.1% and Oracle gained 1.7%. Microsoft was little changed.
While the overall expansion of the cloud services market means there may be room for everyone to co-exist, the rising competition is troubling for Amazon since AWS accounted for more than half of operating profit in the second quarter. In late July, the company reported cloud revenue growth that lagged far behind Microsoft and Alphabet, and it gave a weaker-than-expected forecast for operating income.
“Q2 provided the first warning signal that AWS is falling behind Azure when it comes to winning AI work flows, but they are falling behind Oracle and CoreWeave to an even greater extent,” said Clare Pleydell-Bouverie, co-manager of the Liontrust Global Innovation Team in London, which manages roughly $1.3 billion.
These companies will likely remain industry leaders over the coming years, but Amazon may start coming up short by comparison, she added. “We’re not seeing that same AI induced acceleration in their backlog.”"

Chicago, IL – October 2, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT.
Is Apple Stock About to Break Out?
After stumbling out of the gate this year, sliding more than 30% in the first four months, Apple has staged an impressive comeback. Over the past three months, the stock has outpaced nearly every other tech giant, trailing only Alphabet.
Earlier in the year, skeptics pointed to Apple’s lackluster AI strategy and slower growth compared with rivals like Microsoft and Alphabet. But a strong Q3 report, highlighted by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales and record services revenue, has helped the company reclaim leadership. The latest iPhone launch has also fueled optimism, delivering meaningful upgrades across the product line, including the new iPhone Air.
At the same time, Apple is signaling a more deliberate approach to AI, committing $500 billion in US investments tied to artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and data centers. Additionally, rather than racing to build its own standalone AI model, Apple may be positioning itself as a strategic partner in the broader AI ecosystem and leveraging its strong position in eyeball real estate with mobile devices.
With strong momentum behind it, Apple now looks poised for a technical breakout that could carry shares to fresh record highs. Below, I’ll break down the trade setup.
Apple Stock Forms Bull Flag
In recent months, Apple’s price action has resembled that of a classic growth stock, climbing steadily higher. Over the past two weeks, shares have been consolidating into an increasingly tight bull flag, which typically signals an imminent breakout.
The key level to watch is $257. A decisive breakout and close above this resistance would confirm the bull flag and likely propel Apple to new record highs.
Today’s session briefly pushed above $257 before reversing back into the range, underscoring why it’s important to wait for a closing confirmation rather than intraday moves. On the downside, a close below support at $253.50 would suggest the stock needs more time to reset before attempting another leg higher.
Are Apple Shares Overvalued?
Concerns about Apple’s valuation are valid. The stock is trading at an elevated multiple while sales are expected to grow only in the mid–single digits. That said, Apple still commands an extraordinary position with over 1.5 billion iPhone users and a rapidly expanding services business. It’s also worth noting that nearly all Mega cap tech stocks are trading at premium valuations."

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) made a significant six-figure investment into a U.S. Treasury Bill in mid-September, anchoring a flurry of trading activity that also saw her purchase shares in popular technology stocks and a Bitcoin ETF.
The transactions, made on Sept. 11, were detailed in a financial disclosure report filed with the House of Representatives on Sept. 27, 2025.
Piling On US Treasury Bills Ahead Of Rate Cuts
The congresswoman's largest transaction was a purchase of a U.S. Treasury Bill valued between $100,001 and $250,000.
This move into a safe-haven asset marks a strategic shift from a disclosure covering her trades in August, which showed she had sold a Treasury Bill valued between $15,001 and $50,000.

In the general sense, if investors anticipate the Fed will lower rates, buying T-Bills beforehand allows them to lock in higher yields before they decline. This fall in yields increases the price of the bond or fixed income security, making your earlier purchase more attractive.
Other Fresh Trades By Marjorie Taylor Greene
Alongside the large government debt purchase, Greene also bought smaller stakes, each between $1,001 and $15,000, in ten different companies and funds.
These included tech giants like Alphabet Inc. Class C and Adobe Inc., cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.
| Asset | Transaction | Amount |
| Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) | Purchase | $1,001-$15,000 |

The iPhone maker had been preparing a cheaper, lighter variant of its headset, code-named N100, for release in 2027, Bloomberg said. But the company told staff internally last week that it is reallocating employees from that project to accelerate work on glasses.
The $3,499 Vision Pro, launched in February 2024 to heavy fanfare, has struggled to sustain momentum amid a thin slate of mainstream content and competition from cheaper devices such as Meta's Quest.
Apple is working on at least two types of smart glasses, the report said. The first, dubbed N50, will pair with an iPhone and lack its own display. Apple aims to unveil the model as soon as next year, ahead of a release in 2027.
The second version, with a display, is planned for 2028, but Apple is now seeking to accelerate development of the product that could challenge the Meta Ray-Ban Display, the report said.
In September, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off the company's first consumer-ready $800 smart glasses with a built-in display and a new wristband controller at Meta's Connect event. Meta also unveiled a new pair of Oakley-branded glasses called Vanguard aimed at athletes.
Apple's glasses will rely heavily on voice interaction and artificial intelligence, the report said.
The company declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.
At its annual product launch event last month, Apple introduced an upgraded line of iPhones, alongside a slimmer iPhone Air.
The event, however, was light on evidence of how Apple — a laggard in the AI race — aims to close the gap with the likes of Google, which showcased the capabilities of its Gemini AI model in its latest flagship phones.

Google Cloud exceeds $50 billion with its annual run rate and gains positive momentum following a favorable court ruling.
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw double-digit revenue growth in the search engine, Google, and the media-sharing platform, YouTube. The company’s new launches under the AI trend, including AI Mode and AI Overviews, have gained significant usage across the globe. With its annual revenue run rate surpassing $50 billion, the company’s cloud services have immensely contributed to the overall revenue growth.
On September 2, 2025, the U.S. court ruled in favor of Google against the government’s request to sell its Chrome browser and Android operating system. The ruling enabled the company to maintain its relationship with Apple. Additionally, following the ruling, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s monthly performance gained an uptick of 14.63%, signaling the wide positive reception of the court’s decisions to deny Google’s breakup.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-01T20:44:13,Why Shares of Alphabet Stock Climbed 14% Last Month,"The company is seen as winning the battle for artificial intelligence (AI) supremacy, and got a favorable antitrust ruling in September.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5b4898125cc12aa206ddbff48a9933013b0c9217f1cb41e89943ba0e3a921d8f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/why-shares-of-alphabet-stock-climbed-14-last-month/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/why-shares-of-alphabet-stock-climbed-14-last-month/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/why-shares-of-alphabet-stock-climbed-14-last-month/,fool.com,200.0,,"Shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) climbed 14% higher in September, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The parent company of Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud was helped by an antitrust ruling and new artificial intelligence (AI) services it launched last month. As one of the megacap technology stocks, Alphabet stock is up close to 50% in the last year and increasingly seen as a winner in the AI boom.
Here's why the stock climbed to new all-time highs yet again in September.
New AI tools and an antitrust ruling
In early September, Alphabet received an update on its antitrust case with Google Search. A judge gave out remedies for the company after determining it was a monopoly in the search engine space. However, with the rise of new AI tools like ChatGPT, the judge's remedies were not harsh on Google, allowing it to keep its Google Chrome browser and Android operating system under the same corporate umbrella. Alphabet shares jumped on the news that its ecosystem of consumer internet services was not going to be broken up.
In other news, Alphabet released a new image generator called ""Nano Banana"" through its Gemini AI tool. The image creator has gone viral, sending the Gemini App to the top of the App Store rankings, surpassing ChatGPT in the process. This trend indicates that Alphabet is catching up to ChatGPT in customer usage, leading the way in consumer AI innovations.
App Store rankings will not directly impact Alphabet's revenue, but it should stem the tide of users adopting ChatGPT en masse compared to Alphabet products. In recent years, some investors have left Alphabet for dead because of fears over ChatGPT usage. Now, those fears may be proving to be overblown.
Is Alphabet stock a buy?
Alphabet stock had a lot of risks eliminated last month, both from antitrust court cases and its competition in AI. Now, the stock is closing in on a market cap of around $3 trillion.
Despite its soaring stock price, Alphabet does not look overly expensive right now. Its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) sits at 26, which is lower than most of the AI technology players, even though Alphabet has all the tools and assets to dominate the AI race. It has the best data (Google Search, YouTube, Gmail) to train on and top-of-the-line infrastructure through its Google Cloud division.
The stock may be soaring to all-time highs, but don't think you've missed the boat in owning shares of Alphabet. Buy this stock and hold on for the long haul."

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the stocks that caught analysts' attention.
Tom Hancock, GMO portfolio manager, said in a recent program on CNBC that Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a relatively safer AI play because of the company’s diversification. However, he said he does not hold “more” AVGO shares because of valuation.
“Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is more diversified and a safer play. AI is not its only business—it does a lot of other things, including software and semiconductors—but within their AI business, it’s much more targeted with custom chips for companies like Alphabet and Meta, focused on proven use cases such as ad targeting or content delivery. We also think their custom silicon, A6, will gain share over more generic GPUs over time. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is relatively well positioned. Our only hesitation around them, and why we don’t hold more, is valuation.”

For the fiscal fourth quarter, AVGO expects $6.2 billion in AI revenue, up 66% from a year earlier. The company said it secured $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer. Many analysts believe this customer is OpenAI. Some media reports said the two companies co-designed a chip that will be launched next year.
What’s Broadcom’s moat? It makes ASIC, chips designed for specific applications and tasks. As major companies look for custom chips to break Nvidia monopoly and lower costs, Broadcom is positioned well to thrive. Many top AI spenders are teaming up with Broadcom to develop these chips, which are expected to be high-margin, high-volume products, potentially driving substantial growth in both revenue and profits.
Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Shares of fellow semiconductor giant Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also outperformed during the quarter, as customer demand for the company’s custom accelerator chips remained insatiable despite the uncertain economic environment. The company is on pace for 10 consecutive quarters of AI-related semiconductor growth and expects continued strong demand persist, due to the sizable AI opportunity. In addition to its dominant market position, the company’s history of strong capital returns to shareholders results in a favorable outlook for a sizable investor base.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-01T19:29:11,"Walmart now plans to bring drone deliveries to ‘most areas that we operate in,’ exec says","The retail giant’s plans to offer drone deliveries at 100 stores “is just the start,” said Greg Cathey, touting Walmart’s partnership with Alphabet’s Wing.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=36877a730e37164811cb127be784a6db77983466a1a9522c0fbb3045e0b5d287,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-now-plans-bring-drone-192911394.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-now-plans-bring-drone-192911394.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-now-plans-bring-drone-192911394.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"For more than half a decade, Walmart has been testing a variety of drones to assess the viability of airborne deliveries. On Tuesday, a Walmart executive said the company now believes drone deliveries are ready to become a key part of the retail giant’s operations.
Drone delivery will “be in most areas that we operate in,” Walmart senior vice president of transformation and innovation Greg Cathey said Tuesday. While Cathey did not provide a specific timeline, he made it clear that the retail giant is moving beyond small-scale tests.
“The regulatory environment is making it where this can be a viable business for us,” Cathey said onstage at the UP.Summit, in the city where Walmart is headquartered, Bentonville, Ark.
While drone delivery is only currently available at a handful of Walmart’s more than 4,600 U.S. locations—via partnerships with drone makers Wing, a subsidiary of Alphabet, and Zipline, a startup backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—Cathey’s comments mark a notable transition in how major companies are treating drone delivery. Walmart is indicating it is piecing together concrete plans to scale drone delivery, which Cathey described as “really important” to the company.
Walmart signaled its increasing commitment to drones in June, when it announced it would expand its partnership with Alphabet’s Wing to offer delivery across 100 of its stores in Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa. Onstage Tuesday, Cathey said, “100 stores is just the start,” and announced that Walmart would add another region to the mix: Northwest Arkansas, where it is headquartered, with a delivery operation at a Walmart across the street from the retailer’s old headquarters in Bentonville, as well as a location nearby in Rogers, Ark. While Cathey declined to provide a specific number of stores, he said that Walmart planned to add “a lot” and emphasized that drone delivery was a “key part” of the retailer’s last-mile delivery strategy.
Drone deliveries doubled since June
Widespread drone delivery is likely still several years away owing to the numerous technical, regulatory, and financial issues that need to be sorted out. The Trump administration has issued two executive orders on drone delivery, and this summer the FAA finally proposed its new rule that would enable drone operators to fly beyond visual line of sight. However, there is an ongoing public comment period, and the rule isn’t expected to go into effect until next year. Once it is finalized, it will likely take a long time for companies and retailers to build out the infrastructure needed for mass delivery—and for customers to get comfortable enough with the new technology to use it en masse, as drone delivery is still unfamiliar to most of the population and has caused concern in some of the communities where testing has taken place."

The 22-year-old founder loves it: ‘Capitalism is the greatest artistic medium.’
If you take the subway in New York City, or drive a car in Los Angeles, you’ve seen the ads for Friend.com.
“I’ll binge the entire series with you.”
“I’ll never leave dirty dishes in the sink.”
“I’ll never bail on dinner plans.”
The slogans are simple, intimate, needy, and impossible to avoid. Friend.com is the biggest campaign in the New York City subway this year, according to Outfront, an MTA billboard marketing agency.
The AI wearable has 11,000 “always on” advertisements in the MTA, some covering a whole train station. Avi Schiffmann, the 22-year-old creator of Friend, told Fortune that the ad campaign cost him $1 million—an enormous outlay for a startup with barely $7 million in venture capital.
The product itself is simple: a microphone, a Bluetooth chip, and an always-listening mode that pings Google’s Gemini AI to generate responses and store “memories” in a visual graph. The pendant is manufactured in Toronto and marketed as “your closest confidant.” About 3,000 units have been sold, with 1,000 shipped so far, generating roughly $348,000 in revenue—much of which, Schiffmann said, was spent on manufacturing and marketing. “I don’t have that much money left,” he admitted.
But Schiffmann doesn’t care about the skeptics, or even about profitability. “Profitability is ideal,” he says, “but right now it costs me an unfathomable amount of money if you actually use the product.”
Schiffmann said he sees Friend as “an expression of my early twenties”—down to the materials. He obsessed over the fidget-friendly circular shape, pushed his industrial designers to copy the paper stock of one of his favorite CDs for the user manual, and insisted the packaging be printed only in English and French—because he’s French.
“You can ask about any aspect of it, and I can tell you a specific detail,” he said. “It’s just what I like and what I don’t like … an amalgamation of my tastes at this point in time.”
Victoria Mottesheard, a vice president of marketing at Outfront, the billboard marketing agency Schiffmann worked with for the advertisements, told Fortune the campaign was “taking over” the Gotham underworld, as well as over 500 bus shelters in Los Angeles.
“Everyone’s talking about it,” Mottesheard said.
And they are—but not necessarily in a positive light. Within days, the posters became a magnet for graffiti. Some doodles were harmless, but plenty look like protest art: “AI doesn’t care if you live or die.” “Surveillance capitalism.” “AI will promote suicide if prompted.” Posts about the ads, and the graffiti, are everywhere on social media.
Most founders would cringe at that kind of backlash, but Schiffmann called it “artistically validating.” The white space in the ads was intentional, he claimed—the vandalism was part of the plan. “The audience completes the work,” he said, beaming. “Capitalism is the greatest artistic medium.”"
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-10-01T17:59:00,Is Apple Stock About to Breakout?,After a rough start to the year Apple stock has regained its leadership position,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=15837729edb1d12bcbbe02dd9dca4aad7c7aefbd5ce31d09cbb1ea9e3eb3b269,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-breakout-175900183.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-breakout-175900183.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-breakout-175900183.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"After stumbling out of the gate this year, sliding more than 30% in the first four months, Apple (AAPL) has staged an impressive comeback. Over the past three months, the stock has outpaced nearly every other tech giant, trailing only Alphabet (GOOGL).
Earlier in the year, skeptics pointed to Apple’s lackluster AI strategy and slower growth compared with rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet. But a strong Q3 report, highlighted by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales and record services revenue, has helped the company reclaim leadership. The latest iPhone launch has also fueled optimism, delivering meaningful upgrades across the product line, including the new iPhone Air.
At the same time, Apple is signaling a more deliberate approach to AI, committing $500 billion in US investments tied to artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and data centers. Additionally, rather than racing to build its own standalone AI model, Apple may be positioning itself as a strategic partner in the broader AI ecosystem and leveraging its strong position in eyeball real estate with mobile devices.
With strong momentum behind it, Apple now looks poised for a technical breakout that could carry shares to fresh record highs. Below, I’ll break down the trade setup.

Apple Stock Forms Bull Flag
In recent months, Apple’s price action has resembled that of a classic growth stock, climbing steadily higher. Over the past two weeks, shares have been consolidating into an increasingly tight bull flag, which typically signals an imminent breakout.
The key level to watch is $257. A decisive breakout and close above this resistance would confirm the bull flag and likely propel Apple to new record highs.
Today’s session briefly pushed above $257 before reversing back into the range, underscoring why it’s important to wait for a closing confirmation rather than intraday moves. On the downside, a close below support at $253.50 would suggest the stock needs more time to reset before attempting another leg higher.

Are Apple Shares Overvalued?
Concerns about Apple’s valuation are valid. The stock is trading at an elevated multiple while sales are expected to grow only in the mid–single digits. That said, Apple still commands an extraordinary position with over 1.5 billion iPhone users and a rapidly expanding services business. It’s also worth noting that nearly all Mega cap tech stocks are trading at premium valuations.

The social media platform’s shares dropped after SimilarWeb data revealed declining DAUs on a trailing 30-day average. Adding to investor concerns, data from Promptwatch indicated that Reddit’s citation share on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has significantly decreased in recent weeks.
RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson, who maintains a Sector Perform rating and $245.00 price target on Reddit, noted that a third-party study showed Reddit’s citation share on ChatGPT had plummeted from approximately 29.2% to just 5.3% since September 10th.
The analyst attributed this decline partly to Google changing its indexing parameters from 100 to 10 per page, effectively causing third-party large language models (LLMs) to access only one-tenth of their previous results when indexing Google’s search data.
A key unknown factor remains how much of Reddit’s traffic was actually derived from ChatGPT, which could explain the impact on user metrics. Despite these concerns, Erickson indicated he remains ""constructive fundamentally on RDDT on the likely strong ad momentum"" but acknowledged limited visibility on conversation forum citation share in the rapidly evolving generative search landscape.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is reportedly looking to scoop up Rivos, a Santa Clara-based chip startup building processors for AI data centers, according to Bloomberg.
The talks are still early and details remain scarce, but Rivos has been chasing fresh funding at a $2 billion valuation. The company's chips are built on a scalable system-on-chip design meant to handle AI training, inference, and data analytics, and its team includes veterans from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD (NASDAQ:ARM), Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), and Google (GOOGL).
For Meta, the interest makes sense. The company has spent billions buying GPUs hundreds of thousands from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and smaller orders from AMD and expects 2025 capex to top $70 billion. At the same time, Meta is developing its own AI chips to cut reliance on suppliers. Earlier this year, it even tried to buy Korean startup FuriosaAI for about $800 million, though that deal never materialized.
If Meta does move forward, the acquisition would highlight just how serious it is about locking down chip capacity as competition in the AI arms race heats up."

What Is The Market Telling Us
Reddit’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 64 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 21 hours ago when the stock dropped 5.5% on the news that a steeper-than-anticipated drop in U.S. consumer confidence raised alarms about future consumer spending. The Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in September, its lowest reading since April. The decline was attributed to growing pessimism among Americans regarding inflation and a weakening job market. This data is particularly concerning for companies reliant on discretionary spending, such as those in online retail, travel, and the gig economy, as reports suggest a bleak consumer outlook could curb spending on non-essential items and services. The survey's Expectations Index, a measure of short-term outlook, has remained below a key threshold that often signals a future recession, adding to investor concerns about the economic landscape.
Reddit is up 25.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $208.59 per share, it is still trading 22.9% below its 52-week high of $270.71 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Reddit’s shares at the IPO in March 2024 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,135.

Reddit content was cited in just 2% of ChatGPT responses on Tuesday, much lower than the 9.7% of ChatGPT responses that cited Reddit the previous month, according to data from AI search engine tracker Promptwatch. At its peak in September, Reddit was cited in more than 14% of ChatGPT answers.

Still, Reddit was the top social platform cited by the leading AI chatbot, with its content surfacing in 4.3% of ChatGPT's responses on average in September. Meanwhile, LinkedIn, the second-most-cited social platform, was referenced in only 0.4% of ChatGPT's answers during the month.
Reddit is often used as a social media version of a search engine, with users frequently appending ""reddit"" to online queries when looking for advice or instructions. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) still dominates ""traditional"" online search. That means Reddit, like other search resources, faced a potentially existential threat with the rise of AI chatbots, beginning with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.
Reddit has circumvented that threat of displacement by inking billion-dollar data licensing deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google to use its content for their AI models. Reddit has also launched its own AI search and advertising tools.
In mid-September, Bloomberg reported Reddit was also looking to strike its next data licensing agreement with Alphabet-owned Google and was set to discuss dynamic pricing for that deal and its partnership with OpenAI. Such dynamic pricing would allow Reddit to be paid more, as its content is used more often in the companies' AI answers, Bloomberg wrote, citing unnamed executives. The news sent shares surging in mid-September.
Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Andrew Freedman, who holds a short position on the stock, said he doesn't yet think the data is indicative of a larger trend. But he suggested that the data could come up as Reddit renegotiates those licensing deals.
""I generally believe that OpenAI and Google have much more leverage in licensing renewals versus what Reddit management thinks,"" he wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance.
Outside of Reddit's content-sharing deals, investors have closely watched the site's own web traffic, with the platform's daily active users susceptible to changes in Google Search's algorithm."

Get these headlines directly to your inbox: subscribe to Blockspace.
The report adjusted Cipher’s revenue forecasts for 2026 and 2027 to $387 million and $170 million, and EBITDA forecasts $591 million and $256 million. The changes were due to the recent 168 MW Fluidstack lease at Barber Lake. JonesResearch valued the 244 MW gross Fluidstack lease at between $2.44 billion and $3.27 billion, equivalent to $5.86–$7.83 per share on a pro forma basis which included Google’s 24.2 million warrants backing the $1.4 billion commitment.
The firm noted that a recent $1.3 billion convertible debt offering and a proposed $1.7 billion construction loan should fully cover the capital expenditure for remaining Barber Lake and Black Pearl Phase 2 expansions, implying that those deals are largely priced in. As such, Cipher trades at 29.3x–41.2x 2026 EV/EBITDA and 17.8x–27.4x 2027 EV/EBITDA under base-case hashprice assumptions of $0.045–$0.055/TH and $0.035–$0.055/TH, respectively.
JonesResearch expressed skepticism regarding the value of additional HPC pipeline assets—namely Stingray, Reveille, and three smaller sites—citing limited visibility on future deals and persistently declining bitcoin hashprices through each halving cycle. The report highlighted that while Google’s $1.4 billion backstop lends credibility, deployment timing and geography for further TPU-powered colocation remain uncertain.
Because Cipher carries a Hold rating, JonesResearch does not assign a formal 12-month price target. Instead, the analysis focused on valuation multiples and sum-of-the-parts outcomes, concluding that the stock’s current market price already incorporates expected near-term project economics and leaves limited upside.
At time of publication, CIFR is up 1.1% from yesterday’s close."

As part of its Google Home event on Wednesday, the company unveiled a revamped lineup of Nest devices — Google’s brand of smart home security cameras and doorbells — including a new $149.99 Nest Cam Outdoor, $99.99 Nest Cam Indoor, and $179.99 Nest Doorbell. All devices are designed to showcase Google’s AI assistant Gemini AI in the smart home, and all three come with 2K HDR video, a high-definition format that delivers sharper images than previous models and the highest resolution Google has shipped yet, it says.
The company notes it chose this sensor because it would offer the level of fidelity that its Gemini models could use both now and going forward as the technology evolves. Plus, it wanted to ensure that users would be able to zoom and see a certain degree of detail — like a license plate on an unknown vehicle outside their home, perhaps — and balance that with a desire not to consume too much data.
In addition to the 2K HDR, the cameras offer a wider and taller field of view compared with prior devices. The new 152-degree diagonal view allows users to see more of what’s happening. On the doorbell, meanwhile, Google increased both the field of view, now 166 degrees, and the aspect ratio to 1:1, offering a more square image.
This should allow the device to see a more detailed view, including the head and feet of somebody standing at the door, and to the left and right of them, including packages on the ground.
A new sensor and the wider aperture give the cameras better low-light performance, too. Google says the devices allow for 120% more light sensitivity than older models and can stay in full-color mode longer at dawn and dusk. And they’ll still offer infrared vision, which uses heat signatures to see in complete darkness, for nighttime viewing.
Plus, when users are alerted to an event at the door, the preview images will now be zoomed in to show whatever triggered the alert, making it easier to see. Or, if a user wants to have their doorbell’s view permanently zoomed into a particular area, they can now zoom and crop it so it stays fixed.
Gemini smarts come to Nest
However, where Google hopes to compete against rivals is with its Gemini capabilities and improved baseline features.
For starters, it’s doubling its event history from three to six hours on the free tier. And, for every event that has happened in those six hours, users will get a 10-second video attached. If users want more history, they can choose to upgrade to 10 days, 60 days, or other plans.
Gemini comes into play by making notifications smarter.
Today, people receive dozens of notifications when there are camera events, like people detected, motion, packages delivered, and more. But the burden is currently on the user to figure out what matters and what doesn’t. Gemini, instead, will add more context to these notifications.
For instance, instead of just getting a motion alert, you might receive something that says, “dog jumps out of playpen,” which you can then watch in a zoomed-in video preview.
“That’s what Gemini is going to transform. This experience is all underpinned by what we call ‘semantic scene understanding,'” said Anish Kattukaran, chief product officer at Google Home and Nest, in a press briefing ahead of Wednesday’s announcement. “Because Gemini is multi-modal — and this is a hard problem, by the way…it’s not just simple object detection — but because Gemini is multi-modal, what it can do is it can actually parse through and interpret what is happening in the video,” he continued.
“So now we go from ‘person detected’ or ‘package delivered’ to Gemini interpreting that a FedEx delivery driver is placing a package on the porch and walking away,” Kattukaran explained.
In addition, a Google Home app feature called the “Home Brief” will summarize the past 24 hours’ worth of activity you missed while away. That means you could see which packages were delivered, whether it was the dog that knocked over the coffee table, which people stopped by, or anything else that may have occurred. You can also tell Gemini to make the brief longer or shorter, or to focus only on the kids or the pets, or anything else of interest.
You could ask Gemini what time the kids got home from school, if the landscaper showed up, or if UPS came, for instance.
Gemini will also help more people take advantage of more complex features, like home automations — preset routines that control multiple devices automatically — or better understand their energy use.
Instead of configuring automations manually, you could tell Gemini (even fairly vaguely) that you’d like to feel safer in your home, and the AI could advise you how to set up a routine involving closing blinds and locking doors or creating a simulated presence by automatically turning on and off lights while you’re away.
The cameras come in plastic-free packaging and are available in new colors. The Nest Cam Indoor (Wired, 3rd gen. $99.99) is offered in Snow, Hazel, and Berry, while the Outdoor Cam (Wired, 2nd gen., $149.99) is available in Snow and Hazel and is IP56 rated, meaning it’s weatherproof and can withstand dust and heavy rain. The reformulated resin on the outside of the latter is also designed to offer long-term UV protection and better sustainability, Google notes.
For security, a green light will still display when the camera is processing or streaming video, as before. Google additionally offers encrypted video, two-step verification, and commits that your video footage is never used for other purposes, like ad targeting or personalization.
The Nest Doorbell (Wired, 2nd gen, $179.99) comes in Snow, Hazel, and Linen.
Devices are sold at major retailers and on the Google Store. The Nest cameras are available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The new Nest Doorbell will be available in the U.S. and Canada.
To attract a wider consumer base, Google also partnered with Walmart to launch a more affordable doorbell and camera, branded as the onn Indoor Camera Wired ($22.96) and onn Video Doorbell Wired ($49.86). These offer 1080p live view resolution. A paid subscription unlocks additional intelligent features from Gemini.
Nest Aware rebrands as Google Home Premium
Alongside this release, the existing Nest Aware subscription is being rebranded as Google Home Premium, but the tiers and pricing will stay the same. (Home Premium Standard is $10/mo, and Home Premium Advanced is $20/mo.) Google Home Premium will also be added to Google One subscriptions at no extra cost. That means if you have the Google AI Pro tier ($20/mo.), Google Home Premium Standard will be included for free, while Google AI Ultra users ($250/mo.) will have access to Google Home Premium Advanced.
Finally, users will no longer have to switch between the Nest mobile app and the Google Home app, as all the functionality has been integrated into the Home app. The Nest app won’t immediately go away, though. Google says it will first work to make sure Nest users can seamlessly transition over. (Read more about the new Home app here.)"

Doubled its GenAI Velocity, Plans to Grow R&D Org by 30%
Christoff’s appointment comes as Everlaw embarks on an ambitious plan to expand its AI-powered platform. Since 2024, Everlaw has increased its development in generative AI by 50%, further strengthening its commitment to critical long-term technology and AI innovation.
The company aims to grow its R&D team by roughly 30% by the end of January 2026. The hiring initiative includes a range of roles, from software developers to senior leaders in engineering, product, and design. Unlike many software companies, Everlaw favors leaner engineering teams that are given autonomy to design entire features, not just a component that they build in isolation. The end result is a development process that yields higher throughput: more features shipped per unit time. Most importantly, the velocity and quality of Everlaw’s features are recognized by customers, who rank Everlaw #1 out of 132 ediscovery vendors globally."

Is AI a bubble about to burst? Well, many analysts are still saying AI is a strong buy.
Yes, valuations have risen to sky high levels and questions are growing as many AI software stocks have started showing some cracks in recent weeks.
But the huge demand for AI infrastructure is only set to grow further. That's according to many bulls, including analysts at City and Jeffries.
City Group is out with a new forecast saying Big Tech's AI spending is not slowing down anytime soon.
They now see infrastructure spending climbing past $2.8 trillion by 2029.
That's half a trillion more than they were estimating just a few months ago. Why?
Hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are racing to build data centers and secure more compute power with AI capital expenditures projected projected to hit $490 billion by 2026 alone.
And almost every company in the world right now is looking into how to embed AI tools into their operations.
Also, keep in mind that nations around the world from the US to China to Europe are all investing to be more self-sufficient in AI infrastructure.
Just today, the US and Taiwan are negotiating over who should be building more chips.
So, what are the companies that are set to keep growing?
Brent Thill from Jeffries shared his view with Josh Lipton here on Yahoo Finance.
I think the application names that, you know, Salesforce, Adobe, those names, investors are re-underway. They see these open AI demos they just launched about customer care or doing digital signatures and you you start to see what OpenAI is saying, what Sam Altman's saying about wanting to get into SAS or software as a service.
I think that's freaking everyone out. So, you're seeing a lot of money, you're seeing names like Hubspot down 10% today, Braze down 10, Docusign down 11% in one day on the fear of Open AI entering the application game.
It doesn't matter what happens with AI, they're going to need infrastructure. OpenAI is going to need Microsoft, Oracle, Core Weve. And so, I think this the conversation we're having with our clients is the application names are under duress and I don't think it's as bad as the stocks are are telling you, but no one wants to be there right now because there is no S-curve.
So software's kind of a tale of two cities. One side, you know, um, there's zombies and in in trash and in a crazy amount of debris floating in the air and that's in the apps category.
And then on the infrastructure side, it's like the sun's out, you know, temperature's perfect, and everyone wants to be there. And I I'm a little that that's been our our view to stay stay overweight in infrastructure.
I think that trade lasts till 26 before we see money shift back to the broader software coverage. But right now, it's, um, you know, my group continues to underperform semis, AI infrastructure. And and so I think investors will come back to these names at some at some point when they see an S-curve or an inflection in in AI revenue. We don't see that yet in the application names yet.
Brent, since you mentioned Core Weve and I have you here, I want to ask you that they did ink this $14 billion meta deal. I want to get your thoughts on that headline, Brent. And also just you also cover meta.
Whether you have any concerns, Brent, that you have these hyper scalers maybe becoming, are they becoming too relying on kind of one key AI infrastructure name, Brent?
For many that know Meta's infrastructure, they would characterize them as one of the best builders on the planet of data center infrastructure.
And the fact that they would go to Core Weve tells you how good Core Weve is.
And that's all you need to know. Like, Meta can't even keep up with their own plans to build their own infrastructure, and they need to go to Core Weve to help them build that infrastructure.
Same thing, Microsoft, Core Weve, you've heard Google talk. So, all the hyper scalers, all the consumer grade, you know, standout leaders in internet are all turning to Core Weve because they can't make their plans for AI deployments without the help of Core Weve.
And they are considered kind of the master luxury builder if you will of AI.
And many ask, you know, how how long this is going to last, like what's Core Weve's competitive advantage. And over time, I think Core Weve's going to look a lot like Amazon AWS, which is it was the infrastructure to begin with, and then it becomes a software story. and AWS is a giant software story. I think if Core Weve
can pull this off. I said this when Palenteer went public. Like, if Palenteer can go from selling really high-end, you know, was like Tesla, selling really high-end cars to then selling cars that nurses, doctors, you know, can drive, the mass market can drive, then then we're in a great spot. I think Core Weve can get to the mass market over time.
But right now they're winning the best builders in in AI and and and as long as these contracts keep coming and we think they are, you know, stock's going to keep going higher."

DALLAS, Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Parks Associates' recently released Consumer Insights Dashboard: Tech Ecosystem Dashboard reveals 51% of US internet households report owning a smart speaker and/or display. Among those households that purchased or received a new smart speaker in the past six months, over half chose an Amazon-branded device, 18% chose a Google product, and 8% chose Apple's HomePod.
""While Amazon claims dominance in the smart speaker market, other third-party players must stay motivated,"" said Jennifer Kent, VP, Research, Parks Associates. ""Competition among brands such as JBL, Bose, Sony, and Sonos remains intense as they battle for consumer choice and to maintain their position in the market.""
The Tech Ecosystem Dashboard also reports that major brands in the consumer electronics market are expanding their ecosystems by leaning into services, platform control, and established hardware leadership. These strategic positions shape how each brand builds its ecosystem around core users. Amazon and Google serve the broader home, while Apple designs for the individual. Samsung anchors its value in the living room and connected appliances. Each company is investing in operating systems, data services, and cross-device engagement to deepen user loyalty and capture recurring revenue.
Other research highlights:
-
Apple has the most robust ecosystem, reaching 61% of US internet households.
-
Samsung's consumer electronics ecosystem reaches one-half of households and is comprised chiefly of smartphones and smart TVs.
-
Amazon's ecosystem reaches 46% of households and is comprised of smart speakers/displays, streaming media players, and, to a lesser extent, tablets.
-
Google's ecosystem reaches 29% of households and is centered on smart speakers/displays.
-
Microsoft's ecosystem has the widest reach (64%) and is almost exclusively confined to computers, with extended reach through Xbox consoles.
""Trust is central to expanding from hardware into services, and the recent $2.5 billion FTC settlement with Amazon underscores the risks when consumers feel trapped in subscriptions,"" Kent said. ""For Amazon, the smart speaker anchors a broad home ecosystem that connects media, commerce, and utilities, making transparency and trust essential to sustaining engagement.""

Is It Too Late to Buy?,This semiconductor ETF has been an overlooked champ.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4f15f790c8378ed52c410bd25890d55f1e53d0eae62d5a1f6b49e46c71da4fa3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,fool.com,200.0,,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" has been driving the AI boom ever since its earliest days.
The group of seven stocks, which includes seven of the most valuable stocks on the market -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- all have some exposure to AI and are seen as the leading technological companies.
However, after driving the stock market rally through 2023 and 2024, the Magnificent Seven's performance has been more pedestrian this year. In fact, three of the seven have underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
A basket of all seven of those stocks would have gained 17.5% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 through Sept. 26, which was up 13%. That's a solid return, and investors can get exposure to the Magnificent Seven through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF.
However, there's one ETF that has not only nearly doubled the return of the Magnificent Seven this year, it's beaten every stock in the elite group through Sept. 26. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH 2.42%), which is up 33.2% year to date, and has a long track record of outperforming the S&P 500.
Meet the VanEck Semiconductor ETF
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF aims to replicate the MVIS U.S.-listed Semiconductor 25 Index, and like the Magnificent Seven, its biggest holdings have significant exposure to AI. These are the top 10 stocks in the ETF.
| Stock | % of ETF |
|---|---|
| Nvidia | 21.8% |
| Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) | 10.6% |
| Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) | 9.5% |
| Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) | 6% |
| Lam Research | 4.4% |
| Analog Devices | 4.4% |
| ASML | 4.2% |
| Micron Technology | 4.1% |
| Texas Instruments | 4.1% |
| Qualcomm | 4.1% |
Nearly 40% of the value of the ETF comes from Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom, three stocks that have been top performers in the AI boom. Notably, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has also outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF because the SMH's holdings are more concentrated in those three leading stocks.
While the Magnificent Seven might hold better-known stocks like Apple and Tesla, semiconductor companies have seen their business soar during the AI boom as they are providing the core computing power to make AI applications work. They form the building blocks of the AI revolution, and should as long as the data center buildout phase continues, with companies like Oracle pledging to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure.
Is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF still a buy?
The VanEck SMH ETF is not only outperforming the S&P 500 this year, but it has a long track record of delivering superior returns. Since its inception in 2011, the fund has gained more than 2,000%, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $200,000 and trouncing the S&P 500 along the way, which is up by less than 600% during that time.
Looking at its valuation, the SMH ETF isn't cheap, but it's not as expensive as you might think. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39, which is much cheaper than popular AI stocks like Tesla or Palantir Technologies, and is only moderately more expensive than the S&P 500 at a P/E of 28. Meanwhile, some of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top holdings, like Taiwan Semiconductor, still look cheap considering its growth rate.
Given its exposure to the top chip and AI stocks and its diversification across the industry, the SMH ETF still looks like a strong buy. Over the long term, the fund looks like a good bet to continue to outperform the S&P 500, and given the massive capex spending in AI, it has an edge over the Magnificent Seven group as well."

Developed by London-based DeepMind - owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet - AlphaFold is widely considered the global leader in using AI to analyse and predict molecular structures and interactions to discover new therapies.
Biomap is part of a growing cohort of Chinese firms, including start-ups and major tech companies like TikTok owner ByteDance, that are challenging AlphaFold in the rapidly evolving field. ByteDance has developed Protenix, a molecular structure prediction model.

Biomap reported last year that its xTrimo models demonstrated greater accuracy than AlphaFold 3 in determining interactions between 70 antibodies and 44 single-domain antibodies with their targets.
Established in 2020, Biomap secured funding from the government-owned Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) in June last year.
The partnership sought to enhance the city's biotech ecosystem through an accelerator programme called BioMap InnoHub, which incubated more than 10 projects and two companies, with the goal of expanding to more than 50 projects and 20 companies by 2030, Liu said at an event co-hosted by the HKIC on Monday.
On Monday, Biomap also announced the co-founding of a new company in Hong Kong focused on bringing new drugs to market, furthering its commercialisation efforts.
BioGend Science - co-established with Legend Capital, a venture capital subsidiary of Lenovo Group's parent Legend Holdings - would develop several drug pipelines using Biomap's AI platform and Hong Kong's research and clinical resources, Liu said in a speech."

In today’s CEO Daily: Ruth Umoh on McKinsey’s CEO pipeline.
-
The big story: The U.S. government is shut down.
-
The markets: U.S. futures are down but everywhere else is up.
-
Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune.
Good morning. McKinsey is best known as a consulting powerhouse, but its quieter distinction is as a leadership factory—a point I explore in my latest piece for Fortune. No other organization has minted more sitting Fortune 500 chiefs, with a global roster that includes Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai, Citigroup’s Jane Fraser, and Allianz’s Oliver Bäte. The tally stands at 18 current Fortune 500 CEOs and 28 worldwide.
For companies serious about succession, the question isn’t just why McKinsey has this record, but how to emulate it to strengthen internal pipelines.
The firm’s method is as rigorous as it is intentional, more than a dozen former and current McKinsey alumni told me. From day one, new consultants rotate across industries, geographies, and functions, adapting on the fly and mastering unfamiliar businesses. They are expected to deconstruct sprawling problems, craft solutions, and win over skeptical executives—often while still in their 20s. That early exposure to high-stakes decision-making accelerates judgment and builds the confidence boards later crave in C-suite leaders, according to consultants-turned-CEOs.
Equally critical is McKinsey’s culture of constructive dissent. Hierarchy matters less than ideas, and consultants are trained to challenge assumptions and present counterarguments, even to senior partners or client CEOs. This discipline, debating until the best idea survives, teaches future leaders to welcome scrutiny, pressure-test their own reasoning, and make tough calls with limited information.
And the firm’s veterans are not afraid to dissent either. When McKinsey faced bruising controversies in recent years—from its work with opioid manufacturers to a bribery scandal in South Africa—it was often alumni who raised the loudest alarms. “They care deeply about the firm’s role in the world,” says Shelley Stewart, a senior partner who also helps oversee alumni engagement, “and they will tell us when we’ve failed to live up to the standard we claim.”
For those in their early to mid-career, relentless feedback deepens the learning. Reviews are frequent, unsparing, and are paired with coaching from senior partners and an “up-or-out” model that demands growth or exit. Those who rise acquire a habit of continuous improvement and the resilience to thrive under scrutiny.
In a market where a succession misstep can wipe out billions in value, McKinsey offers a blueprint for building a self-renewing leadership engine: move high potentials through multiple businesses to develop range and pattern recognition early. Give emerging leaders real authority quickly by assigning stretch tasks that carry visible stakes. Make feedback and coaching a constant, not a formality. And create an environment where dissent is expected, so future leaders develop the muscle to debate strategy and own the outcome. Read the full article here.—Ruth Umoh

Wall Street will be laser-focused on the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, which tend to grow faster than the rest of the market thanks to powerful trends like artificial intelligence (AI).
The Magnificent Seven stocks include:
Meta Platforms and Alphabet (Google) are heading into this earnings season with significant momentum across their various businesses, mostly thanks to AI. They also happen to be the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks by one traditional valuation metric, making them a great value for investors.
Here's why they might be great buys in October (and beyond).
The case for Meta Platforms
Over 3.4 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every single day, which include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Meta generates most of its revenue by showing ads to those users, so the longer they stay online, the more money the company makes.
Meta uses AI in its recommendation algorithms to learn what type of content each user likes to see, so it can show them more of it. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), this strategy drove a 6% increase in the amount of time users were spending on Instagram compared to the year-ago period, and a 5% increase for Facebook.
Meta has applied a similar AI-powered strategy to its ad-recommendation engine to target users more accurately, which is driving a modest increase in conversions. This allows the company to charge a higher price per ad, because businesses are getting a greater return on their investment.
Meta is also using AI to power new features like its Meta AI chatbot, which launched in late 2023 and already has over a billion monthly active users. It's powered by the company's Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which rival some of the best models from leading start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic. As Meta AI's capabilities expand, it's likely to become a major tailwind for engagement.
Meta's revenue increased by 22% during the second quarter, accelerating from its first-quarter result of 16%. In other words, better engagement and higher ad conversions are driving significant momentum in its business. According to Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street now expects the company to generate $196.1 billion in revenue for the whole of 2025, with earnings of $28.15 per share. Both figures would be record highs.
Meta stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.9 as I write this, making it the second-cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. As a result, there might be plenty of room for upside from here.
The case for Alphabet
When AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT went mainstream in 2023, investors were worried they would take traffic away from traditional internet search engines because they gave consumers a faster and more convenient way to access information. That would have spelled bad news for Alphabet, because Google Search accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue.
Alphabet met those concerns with innovation, developing its own AI models called Gemini, along with a chatbot with the same name. The Gemini models power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to provide holistic answers to search queries. These responses appear above the traditional search results, so users no longer have to sift through web pages to find the information they need.
Overviews strike a good balance between the traditional Google Search experience, and the convenience provided by AI chatbots. As a result, Alphabet said more than 2 billion people were using them at the end of the second quarter, and since they monetize at a similar rate to traditional Google Search results, they aren't hurting the company's valuable core business.
Finally, Google Cloud deserves a special mention because it has become a key part of Alphabet's AI strategy. It provides computing power from state-of-the-art centralized data centers, in addition to an expanding list of ready-made LLMs from top third-party developers. These are the main two ingredients required to develop AI software, which is why nearly all AI unicorns (start-ups worth $1 billion or more) are using Google Cloud in some capacity.
Google Cloud's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 32% during the second quarter. That momentum is likely to continue because the platform's order backlog climbed at an even faster rate of 38%, reaching a whopping $106 billion, which will be converted into revenue as Alphabet brings more data centers online.
Alphabet stock has soared by 48% over the past year, yet its P/E ratio is still just 26.2 which makes it the cheapest member of the Magnificent Seven. Considering the company's resounding success in the AI space so far, I think its stock could be destined for much higher ground."

The service blocks invalid and fraudulent clicks in real-time, giving marketers complete control of campaign performance.
Global digital ad spend is projected to reach $678.7 billion in 2025. Yet, advertisers are on track to lose $172.3 billion to ad fraud by 2028, representing 22% of total ad spend, with 17% attributed to click fraud. As holiday campaigns drive spend and attract the most fraud, vulnerable SMBs risk wasting budget on malicious click activity, resulting in poor campaign performance.
""Fraud prevention is only the first step for businesses that want to generate 20–30% more real leads without increasing their ad budgets,"" said Therese Gustafsson, CEO of SILA. ""SILA gives SMBs the same data transparency and optimization capabilities as large enterprises, so every marketing investment drives genuine growth.""
Unlike standalone fraud detection tools, SILA combines cyber-grade protection with real-time analytics and optimization features, allowing advertisers to block fraudulent clicks, track and trace their sources, optimize targeting and performance with clean data, and boost ROI/ROAS by focusing only on real conversions.
In high-cost competitive markets, fraud is even more rampant. Eliminating invalid traffic can recover as much as 20% of spend. InkDstry, a CRM for tattoo shops, reduced ad spend waste by 22% on average while driving a direct increase in conversions through SILA's platform.
""Before SILA, we were constantly second-guessing whether our ads were reaching the right people, or even real customers,"" said Zen Donegan, CEO and founder of InkDstry. ""Now, we feel confident that every campaign is attracting authentic interest, making our advertising more effective, manageable, and stress-free.""
Available now in the UK and globally, SILA's platform can be activated in minutes, requiring no technical expertise. For more information, visit: https://sila-ai.com/

One of the easiest ways to miss out on outsized gains is to lack the conviction needed to hold stocks through periods of volatility.
All of today's top companies have undergone multiple brutal drawdowns. It's easy to forget that just a few years ago, in 2022, Nvidia (NVDA 0.07%), Meta Platforms (META 1.07%), Amazon (AMZN -0.53%), Alphabet (GOOGL 1.89%) (GOOG 1.86%), and Tesla (TSLA 1.09%) all saw their stock prices fall over 40% from all-time highs. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia stock is trading up more than 1,100%, Meta is up over 500%, and Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet have all crushed the comparable performance of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.37%).
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can make it easier to hold volatile growth stocks through steep downturns because of their diversification. Here's what makes the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG 0.42%), the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI 2.04%), and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ 1.41%) top AI ETFs to buy now.
1. Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF
The Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF invests in the top 10% of S&P 500 companies by market cap. Many of the most valuable U.S. companies are growth and AI-focused names. The ETF has a staggering 62% invested in the ""Ten Titans"" -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Broadcom (AVGO 2.05%) Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix.
The Ten Titans make up 39% of the S&P 500, which is already a lot. But this ETF takes that concentration a step further.
The fund is a particularly good buy for investors who believe that the largest companies by market cap will benefit the most from AI.
The fund's expense ratio of 0.2% is higher than some passively managed ETFs, but it's still reasonable for investors looking for a simple way to bet on today's existing winners.
2. iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF
With a net expense ratio of 0.55%, this fund is considerably more expensive than the 0.03% expense ratio found in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.
Unlike most passively managed funds, this active ETF isn't market-cap weighted. So its weights are based more on conviction than the value of the company.
Oracle's 5% weighting is nearly as high as Microsoft's 5.7%. Oracle could become the largest cloud purpose-built for AI within the next five years. And Broadcom is at 8.4%, right behind Nvidia at 9.2%.
The fund is very new, having launched less than a year ago in October 2024. So investors should only approach the ETF after doing more research on its holdings and the strategy employed by its active managers.
3. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF
This ETF is ideally suited for investors looking to build an AI portfolio around U.S. companies while also gaining significant exposure to international leaders. Around 31% of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is invested in non-U.S. companies. Alibaba Group, Samsung Electronics, Tencent, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all top-10 holdings in the fund. And you won't find any of these companies in the S&P 500 because they are non-U.S. firms.
Another unique characteristic of this fund is that it isn't top-heavy. No holding makes up more than 4%, which is a stark contrast to the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF, which has over a third of the fund invested in just five stocks.
In this vein, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is a good fit for investors looking for a diversified and global approach to the AI theme. The ETF features an ""unconstrained approach,"" which targets established and up-and-coming innovative companies without regard to stock market sector or geography. Its 0.68% expense ratio isn't cheap, but it could be worth it for investors looking for high growth potential.
Bold bets for risk-tolerant investors
These ETFs are likely to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years if investor appetite for tech-focused companies and AI names remains positive. But eventually, companies will need to convert capital expenditures (capex) into returns. We are still in the early innings of the AI build-out, with droves of data centers coming online in the next few years. But demand for those data centers depends on the usage of AI models by end users.
Agentic AI presents an opportunity to further integrate AI into regular business functions by helping with task completion and organization. And edge AI involves running algorithms directly on devices rather than depending on the cloud.
Despite the long-term potential of AI, there are plenty of reasons why the discussed ETFs could disappoint. A cyclical downturn for factors unforeseen could challenge the lofty valuations of companies that are priced for perfection. Or simply a pullback in capex spending after an initial ramp-up.
In this vein, investors need to consider the risks associated with allocating to AI names through individual holdings and ETFs. Investors should only approach AI-focused ETFs if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term investment time horizon, and if the strategy aligns with their existing holdings and investment objectives."

(NASDAQ:META) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On September 26, Meta Platforms announced that it will launch an ad-free subscription option for users of Facebook and Instagram in the UK in the coming weeks. This move is a response to regulatory guidance from the UK’s data protection authority, which had raised concerns about how platforms handle personal information for targeted advertising.
The subscription model offers users a choice: they can continue to use the services for free with targeted advertising or pay a monthly fee to use the apps without ads. Users who opt for the paid plan will not see ads, and their data will not be used for advertising purposes. The introduction of this ad-free tier is part of a broader industry trend where tech companies, including Apple and Alphabet’s Google, are adjusting their models due to increasing regulatory pressure over personal data use and targeted ads.
The pricing for the ad-free subscription is set at £2.99 a month for access via the web. For subscriptions made through iOS and Android mobile apps, the price will be £3.99 a month, with the higher price accounting for service charges imposed by Apple and Google. The company’s ads business accounted for about $164.5 billion in total revenue last year, with ads representing about 98% of that revenue.
Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) develops products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality and mixed reality headsets, augmented reality, and wearables worldwide.

(Reuters) -Popular NBC shows including ""Sunday Night Football"" and ""America's Got Talent"" may disappear from YouTube TV as soon as Tuesday if the two sides fail to agree on a new distribution deal, a standoff that could influence the future of television.
Carriage talks have stalled over the rates Alphabet's YouTube TV will pay to distribute to its 10 million subscribers the shows of Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, the two companies have said.
But a bigger negotiation looms behind the scenes, and it reflects the newfound clout of YouTube as the dominant provider of video services in the United States.
YouTube TV wants to show content offered exclusively on NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service - such as hit reality series ""Love Island"" - directly on its platform, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters. Currently, users have to open the Peacock app to see the shows, even on YouTube TV.
Known as ""direct ingestion,"" it is an approach that NBCUniversal opposes, as it wants to preserve Peacock - which it launched in 2020 - as a standalone service that can collect subscriber data and sell targeted ads. For YouTube, securing NBC content would aid its push to become the country's biggest pay-TV distributor and strengthen the core ad business of Google - which is also owned by Alphabet - on smart TVs, where ad slots command premium rates.
These battles ""will have important strategic implications for the future of media,"" LightShed analyst Richard Greenfield said in a note to clients. Disney's carriage deal with YouTube TV is also up for renewal at the end of October and similar talks will likely occur then, he said.
""We suspect YouTube TV cares far less about the rate it ultimately pays and far more about being able to ingest content from legacy media streaming apps,"" he said.
YOUTUBE'S GROWING CLOUT
YouTube now accounts for the largest share of TV viewing in the U.S., ahead of streaming rival Netflix and traditional media companies such as Disney, according to Nielsen.
Its cable-like subscription service, YouTube TV, ranks among the four largest U.S. pay-TV distributors, and Alphabet's deep pockets recently gave it leverage over Paramount and Fox Corp in carriage talks, according to media firms and analysts.
NBCUniversal offered YouTube the same terms it extended to other large TV distributors - including Amazon's Prime Video Channels - and is looking to include its streaming service as part of the bundle of programming YouTube TV distributes, said the person familiar with the negotiations, who requested anonymity because the talks were private."

The tech giant has termed the order unprecedented and asked the judge to put several portions of the injunction on hold, saying these would cause reputational harm, security risks, and put the company at a competitive disadvantage if the order is allowed to take effect.
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google wrote the following in a filing submitted to the court on September 24:
“This case asks the Court to evaluate the lawfulness of an unprecedented antitrust injunction awarded at the request of a single, private plaintiff that will restructure the entire Android ecosystem, relied on by over 100 million U.S. users and over 500,000 app developers.”
Google was sued by Epic Games in 2020 for allegedly monopolizing and shielding the Play Store from competition. The Fortnite maker secured victory in a jury trial in San Francisco in 2023.
Last year, a California judge issued the injunction, requiring Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google to allow users to download third-party app stores through its app store for three years. It also compels the company to open the Play Store’s catalog of apps to rivals, and enable users to bypass Google’s billing system.
Google has requested the court to pause the provisions and decide by October 17 whether or not it would put the order on hold. The payment provision is scheduled to take effect in October, while the other two orders will come into force during the summer of 2026.

Launched through a dedicated iOS app, Sora 2 arrives with the ability to synchronize dialogue and sound effects, while introducing users to immersive, AI-generated simulations that realistically adhere to the laws of physics.
Positioned as a ""GPT-3.5 moment for video,"" Sora 2 builds upon its February 2024 predecessor by showcasing complex feats that defied the abilities of previous models. OpenAI notes that earlier video models often distorted reality to satisfy prompts, but Sora 2 is designed to model failure and obey physical constraints, a core requirement in creating AI systems that understand the real world.
The new Sora app offers users the ability to drop lifelike video cameos of themselves into CGI environments, with facial and voice likeness captured through a one-time verification. Functioning more like a co-creative platform than a traditional social media app, it prioritizes user interactions and video creation over passive scrolling, with custom feeds and strict well-being safeguards baked in.
In early reactions, Wall Street has taken notice of Sora 2 as a potential disruptor. Shares of digital media incumbents slipped following the announcement: Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) dropped 8.2%, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) slid 4.8%, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) fell 1.3%, and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) declined by 0.5%. “Our companies are in the business of competing for time and modifying consumer behavior. ChatGPT has modified and captured ‘search’ behavior with agentic offerings...and, if confirmed, we see this new Sora app as a direct competitor for consumer engagement/time/data against META, GOOGL/YouTube, TikTok, RDDT, SNAP and the other digital platforms,” Morgan Stanley wrote.
Still, analysts cautioned that toppling incumbents won’t be straightforward, given their entrenched reach. “Changing the behavior of hundreds of millions of people (in META/GOOGL’s cases, billions) is difficult,” they said. “For OpenAI to scale its social app, we think it will be important to provide a substantially differentiated (and better) user experience than leaders like META/GOOGL/YouTube.”
Morgan Stanley suggested smaller companies may feel the disruption earlier, given their limited generative AI capabilities. “Smaller platforms with less sophisticated next generation ML/GenAI offerings could face engagement headwinds faster if consumer adoption of diffusion/video creation tools ramps,” the firm added, flagging Reddit, Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS), and Snap as vulnerable."

Recent gains followed a long-awaited antitrust ruling that avoided the most punitive measures sought by regulators, including the sale of Alphabet’s Chrome browser. The ruling came in the wake of Alphabet’s second-quarter earnings, which showed that demand for artificial intelligence products is lifting sales.
Investors have grown more confident about Alphabet’s position with AI, even as OpenAI’s ChatGPT introduces new features. The company on Tuesday said it is rolling out visual search in AI mode, and The Information recently reported that Meta Platforms Inc. has held discussions about using Google’s AI models to improve its ad business.
In a sign of improved sentiment, MoffettNathanson wrote that the “combination of market leadership, diversification and scale positions Alphabet not only as a winner in the GenAI era but as a company that should rightly be considered for the title of most valuable company in the world.”
The rally in Alphabet shares briefly resulted in the company rising above a $3 trillion market capitalization, although it receded from that peak, and currently has a valuation of around $2.93 trillion.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Right now time for some of today's trending tickers. You gotta find this is Brooke De Palma joins me here for a look at like a little Robin Hood, maybe a little UI path, perhaps a little Instacart. Gonna start with Robin Hood, the company releasing its September month to date trading metrics showing about 187 million option contracts traded. This is what was interesting, Brooke, and it was a good, good write up on Bloomberg about this. So you were watching shares of sports betting operators, so DraftKings, uh, Flutter, because Robin Hood did post these.September today trading metrics showed option contracts traded were around 187 million. Hood kind of emerging as sort of a rival here with we know betters allowed to trade contracts on sportingevents.
Yeah, and their CEO saying that they have more than 4 billion event contracts that have traded on Robin Hood. I think it's worth noting that when this first was sort of up and coming in, I think what has been years now, but really the momentum behind it, especially as you know, gambling rules.Sort of relaxed from state to state. Of course it's still not the case in some states. There's been this increased interest and Robin Hood really taking advantage of not only getting into this, but also getting into crypto as well. And we've just seen Robin Hood's stock absolutely soar year to date. It's up more than 280%. This is one of the top performers in the S&P 500, if not the top performer in the S&P 500 year to date. And if you take a look over the past year, this stock is also up more than 500.100% and so as Robin Hood gets into these new niches that are really attracting a new audience, it's interesting to see how it impacts, you know, that competition you mentioned like a DraftKings like a flutter and now with these sort of, you know, contracts events and this prediction market as well it's worth noting that who made that popular? Well, polymarket this time last year on the election certainly made this idea of betting on overall events really, really popular, really interesting.An interest spot among consumers and now we see Robin Hood stepping into that.
Yeah, so has been a rocket ship to your point, despite that, most analysts still bullish. 19
buys. Yeah, that's it.
Turning now to UIA. Let's get that one too because that company announcing a slew of partnerships, including ones with OpenI, Snowflake, Nvidia. So UI Path, make a robotic process automation software. They announced this collaboration work with Nvidia and OpenAI and do investors really need to hear more than that? You just see Jensen Wong, Sam.And
I mean, let's back up for just a second, Josh. So the stock is up 7% today, but if you take a look at the recent interest among investors, year to date up just 5% compared to a year ago up just 4%, and compared to the company's performance all since it went public back in April 2021, the stock is actually down nearly 80%. And right now we are just a bit away right now the stocks sitting around as you can see in your.Around $13.43. That's just slightly away from the 52 week high of 1,593. And so there is some concern on the street about, you know, where exactly this goes, but certainly if you look at their press release page today, there's so much excitement, those four announcements of them teaming up with these players as well. And so it'll be interesting to see where exactly this goes. I know that investors right now are really looking for results, but there are only 3 buys on the street right now.18 holes in one. So just yeah, so most people on the sidelines waiting to see some return from these, these mega announcements. I thought it was interesting 4 announcements within one day, big
names, big names. All right. Lastly, Instacart get hit with a downgrade over at BTIG, lowering its rating on that name. They go from buy to neutral Brooks. So BTIG, uh, they get lukewarm on this one. It sounds like flagging ongoing negative competitive developments. Amazon, DoorDash, Uber signed delivery deals.
So just recently DoorDash signed a delivery deal with Kroger as they look to get in on that, of course we've been constantly discussing Amazon stepping into that fresh delivery space as well. They announced that back in August, I believe it was. It's, it's a company that continues to struggle to stand out year to date. This stock is down more than 12.5% and largely keep in mind there's some mixed feelings on the street. There's about 17 buys and 16 holes.as well, but this ongoing competition, you know, it's not just Instacart or DoorDash anymore. Now it's Amazon looking into getting into fresh one day delivery. We've also heard so much from Walmart, even Target doing same day delivery.

What Is The Market Telling Us
UiPath’s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for UiPath and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 3.8% on the news that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered cautious remarks on the economy, spooking investors and pulling indexes back from record highs.
Speaking for the first time since the central bank's recent interest rate cut, Powell described the current economic landscape as a ""challenging situation."" He highlighted the difficult task of balancing a weakening labor market against persistent inflation risks. Powell also commented that equity prices appeared ""fairly highly valued,"" adding to investor concerns and prompting profit-taking. The cautious tone from the Fed chair drove declines across major indexes, including the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, as the market reassessed the path forward for monetary policy.
UiPath is up 6.9% since the beginning of the year, but at $13.83 per share, it is still trading 10.8% below its 52-week high of $15.50 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of UiPath’s shares at the IPO in April 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $200.36.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

The features will provide AI chatbot users, who are researching items they want to purchase, Honey’s product recommendations, pricing, and access to deals.
When users ask their preferred AI chatbot a shopping-related question, PayPal Honey’s extension will display links to the products the AI chatbot recommends, along with real-time pricing, merchant options, and offers, PayPal says. The system can also identify when the AI’s own recommendations may have left out major retailers and surface those additional options to the consumer.
The features are designed to help consumers better compare pricing and boost merchant sales through the addition of personalized offers, PayPal notes.
The agentic shopping integrations are designed to be AI agnostic, PayPal told TechCrunch, but will initially work with OpenAI’s ChatGPT with more to follow.
The company says the new features are part of its broader rollout of agentic commerce initiatives, which include the Google partnership, an agentic commerce offering, a remote MCP server, Agent Toolkit, as well as other, smaller deals — like an offer to use Perplexity’s premium service for a year for free, and free access to its new Comet browser.
Of course, the AI providers will be a competitor for products like Honey, as they move into making product recommendations and connecting users with merchants directly. For instance, just yesterday OpenAI announced a plan to take on Amazon and Google with its own agentic shopping system, which includes an “Instant Checkout” feature.
While OpenAI’s system initially only supports Etsy with plans for Shopify merchants “soon,” it’s a signal of what’s to come in the AI era. Instead of browsing the web or Amazon when looking for products and recommendations, users may start their shopping research in an AI chatbot, instead of just browsing the web, where Honey previously had traction, necessitating new products like this.
The AI features are launching after quite a bit of bad press for Honey. A YouTuber accused the company of stealing money from influencers by taking credit for sales that creators had driven. The revelation has even led to some lawsuits over the matter."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israeli high-tech companies raised $11.9 billion over the first three quarters of 2025 as the technology sector continues to thrive despite Israel's two-year-old war against Hamas militants in Gaza.
Funding was 13% higher than in January to September 2024, the nonprofit Startup Nation Central said on Tuesday. It noted that the volume of funding, which was led by cybersecurity firms, rose despite a 22% decline in the number of deals to 569.
At the same time, mergers and acquisitions reached a record $71 billion so far in 2025, nearly five times higher than the same period in 2024, and largely driven by Alphabet's $32 billion acquisition of cyber firm Wiz and Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion purchase of CyberArk.
The tech sector is a driver of Israel's economy, accounting for about 20% of GDP, 15% of jobs and more than 50% of exports.
In the third quarter, Israeli tech firms raised $2.4 billion, up 9% from the same period in 2024 but down 50% from the second quarter. The number of deals contracted to 141, down 24% from the second quarter and 38% year over year. M&A in the quarter reached nearly $32 billion due to the Palo Alto-CyberArk deal.
""The third quarter of 2025 highlighted a market in transition. While funding slowed and investors became more selective, M&A activity reached historic highs,"" said Avi Hasson, CEO of Startup Nation Central.

The brokerage said it views CoreWeave as uniquely positioned to serve both AI-first startups and traditional enterprises building and deploying AI models, calling it an “at scale AI-as-a-Service pure play.”
CoreWeave operates more than 250,000 GPUs across 33 data centers, making it one of the largest independent GPU cloud operators globally.
Unlike traditional hyperscalers such as Amazon or Microsoft, CoreWeave’s infrastructure is purpose-built specifically for AI workloads, allowing it to deliver more than 20% better hardware utilization, Evercore said.
The bank pointed to several near-term catalysts, including an expanded partnership with OpenAI, the potential addition of Google as a cloud customer, a supply agreement with Nvidia that guarantees any unused capacity will be absorbed through 2032, and upcoming disclosure of a new large-scale hyperscaler contract.
Evercore said CoreWeave has strong forward revenue visibility, with about 98% of its sales coming from multi-year “take-or-pay” contracts, typically priced per GPU-hour.
Customer commitments in backlog recently climbed to about $30 billion, roughly half of which stems from OpenAI.
While customer concentration remains high, Microsoft and OpenAI accounted for nearly 80% of second-quarter revenue, Evercore expects the client mix to broaden as new enterprise wins ramp.
The firm flagged high capital expenditure requirements as a key debate, with CoreWeave expected to double spending to more than $20 billion in 2025 to build out new data centers.
However, it said operating margins should expand from the mid-to-high teens to the mid-20% range by 2027 as the business scales and older GPUs move past their depreciation window.
Evercore values the company at 10 to 11 times estimated 2027 EBITDA, a discount to larger cloud and data center peers.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GOOG. Alphabet Inc.'s share was trading at $246.57 as of September 25th. GOOG’s trailing and forward P/E were 26.29 and 23.36 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
Alphabet (GOOGL) has proven resilient despite repeated investor concerns about disruption. Earlier in 2025, sentiment-driven fears that AI would erode its search dominance and weaken CEO Sundar Pichai’s leadership drove the stock down nearly 30%. Yet fundamentals never faltered, with ad revenues and profits continuing to grow. Since then, the stock has rebounded 60% on the back of multiple catalysts: the Google I/O 2025 event showcased Gemini 2.5 updates, new AI-powered search experiences, and creative media tools; management reported double-digit growth in search queries and revenues; AI is driving more targeted ad monetization; and a favorable antitrust ruling preserved Alphabet’s core businesses.
Alphabet’s dominance in AI stems from controlling all three pillars of the ecosystem—hardware via TPUs, foundation models with Gemini, and unmatched reach through search, YouTube, and Google Cloud. Its business remains highly diversified: search still generates over 70% of operating profit with >90% market share, YouTube boasts 2.7 billion MAUs and over 100 million premium subscribers, Cloud is a $50B run-rate business expected to double within five years, subscriptions provide $45B recurring revenue, and Waymo offers long-term optionality.
Risks remain, including rising capital expenditures—guided at $85B in 2025—and potential share loss in search to competitors like OpenAI or Perplexity. Still, Alphabet has navigated technological shifts before, as during the mobile revolution, and appears positioned to lead the AI era. With shares around $240, Rebound Capital values the company at $300/share, reflecting a 25% upside and implying further re-rating potential toward peers like Microsoft and Amazon.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) by Elliot in April 2025, which highlighted its resilient search business, accelerating cloud growth, expanding subscriptions, and AI-driven margin efficiency despite rising CapEx. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 51.8% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out amid growth and investor confidence. The thesis still stands as Rebound Capital emphasizes Alphabet’s AI ecosystem dominance and valuation upside.
Alphabet Inc. is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 219 hedge fund portfolios held GOOG at the end of the second quarter which was 227 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The brokerage lifted its price target to $81 after meeting with company executives, saying management struck an upbeat tone about growth prospects for its Active Copper Cable (ACC) and Linear Pluggable Optics (LPO) products, which are used in data center interconnects.
ACC technology, which emerged in 2024, offers faster speeds and lower power consumption than existing alternatives and could gain traction as cloud service providers move to 800-gigabit and 1.6-terabit networks, Oppenheimer said.
It estimates Semtech has a 70% to 80% share of the ACC market and expects Google to be an early adopter, with others likely to follow.
The firm also pointed to accelerating demand for Semtech’s LoRa wireless technology, which is used for long-range, low-power communications in applications such as drones, robotics and automation.
It said LoRa could sustain growth of more than 20% annually from a base of about $150 million in revenue.
Semtech’s proximity sensing business, branded PerSe, is gaining traction in wearables including Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, and could expand further if adopted in future Apple and Android devices, the note said.
Oppenheimer said a potential sale of Semtech’s non-core cellular module business, which generates roughly $200 million in annual revenue at lower margins, could serve as a catalyst by lifting profitability.
It said a shift in product mix toward data center and LoRa chips would offer further margin upside.

(SOUN) is doubling down on multimodal AI as its key differentiator in the competitive conversational AI space. The company’s latest foundation model, Polaris, blends voice and vision capabilities to deliver real-time understanding across multiple inputs. Management argues that this approach not only improves accuracy and speed but also expands the range of use cases across industries, such as automotive, restaurants and enterprise services.
The second quarter underscored this momentum. Revenues surged 217% year over year to $42.7 million, beating expectations, with demand rising across verticals. CEO Keyvan Mohajer highlighted how integrating vision AI into the stack “marks a transformational shift” in human-computer interaction, enabling more natural and intuitive engagement with devices. Customers migrating to Polaris are reportedly seeing immediate improvements, which have driven renewals, upselling and stronger close rates.
Financially, SoundHound remains unprofitable, posting a non-GAAP net loss of $11.9 million, or 3 cents per share. Still, its robust pipeline, expanding partnerships and guidance raise to $160-$178 million in 2025 revenues indicate confidence in scaling the business.
The challenge lies in execution. Larger rivals like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google possess deep resources and entrenched ecosystems. However, SoundHound’s specialization in multimodal AI, coupled with 20 years of proprietary data and a growing roster of global automotive and QSR clients, positions it to compete on quality rather than scale.
Ultimately, if adoption of multimodal AI accelerates, SoundHound’s early lead could give it a sustainable edge. However, investors will need to watch closely whether this differentiation translates into lasting profitability.
How Does SoundHound Stack Up Against Big Tech Rivals?
While SoundHound AI is leaning on multimodal innovation to stand out, it faces stiff competition from established players. Amazon, through Alexa and its broader cloud ecosystem, remains a dominant force in voice-enabled AI. Its advantage lies in scale, distribution and integration into smart homes and consumer devices. However, Amazon’s solutions have been slower to adopt multimodal capabilities at the level SoundHound claims with Polaris, leaving room for niche specialists.
Google is another formidable rival, with Google Assistant and cutting-edge AI research under its DeepMind and Gemini banners. The company has the infrastructure and data advantage to rapidly expand multimodal features across devices and enterprise services. Yet, Google’s focus is spread across multiple AI initiatives, potentially diluting attention to specific verticals like automotive or restaurants."

Dot is designed to look friendly and even cartoonish — painted bright red, with big LED eyes and a mouth that swings open to reveal where it holds your food — though I’d argue it’s slightly creepy.
DoorDash says it’s already testing the robot with early access partners in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and plans to make it available to the region’s 1.6 million residents by the end of 2025.
It might sound odd for a food-delivery app like DoorDash to compete with trillion-dollar companies like Google and Tesla on autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. In San Francisco, Austin, and cities around the country, hailing a robotaxi is already commonplace for many residents. DoorDash argues that a similar reckoning is coming for the food delivery space, and that Dot’s size and design are key.
The stakes are high for this little, cute (terrifying?) robot. Countless startups have flamed out in the AV space, with some even facing penalties and fines when their machines caused harm. Robotaxis have also become a symbol for Silicon Valley’s broader automation push — and a target for public anger. Waymos have been vandalized on city streets, and it’s easy to imagine Dots becoming the next symbol of that tension.
On Monday at the company’s San Francisco headquarters, DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang told reporters that autonomous delivery in suburbs and cities could become a large market. Tang said a key to delivery robots is navigating “the first and last ten feet,” referring to picking up and dropping off deliveries. Sidewalk robots, such as those developed by companies like Serve Robotics, address this challenge of negotiating tight spaces, but they can’t drive on roads or at high speeds like Dot can.
“You don’t always need a full-sized car to deliver a tube of toothpaste or pack of diapers,” said Tang. “Dot is purpose-built for the millions of deliveries we facilitate every day. It is small enough to navigate doorways and driveways, fast enough to maintain food quality, and smart enough to optimize the best routes for delivery.”
Dot has four wheels and stands less than five feet tall and three feet wide. It’s roughly a tenth the size of a car and weighs 350 pounds. Press a button on what can only be described as Dot’s “mouth,” and enough cargo space is revealed to fit six pizza boxes or up to 30 pounds of food. There are various inserts that merchants can put inside of a Dot to meet their needs, including cupholders and coolers."

It's time now for today's trending tickers. Starting with Wolf speed, a huge mover today. Look at this chart. After closing up more than 1,700% yesterday, the ticker Wolf, WOLF is up another 39% or so in pre-market. That tells you just how excited investors are after the semiconductor maker completed its struc chapter 11 restructuring. In court filings, Wolf Speed said it has cut its total debt by nearly 70% and will save about 60% on
annual cash interest and it's adding five new board directors. Okay, it's up actually just under 22% in premarket now. On to Firefly Aerospace, which is grabbing headlines after a dramatic test mishap. Shares are down more than 10% in the pre-market after the company confirmed that the core booster for its alpha rocket ship rocket was destroyed during a ground test at its Texas facility, just weeks before its return to flight mission.
Firefly said all personnel were safe and it is assessing the damage. The setback follows a prior investigation into an earlier failure. Remember, Firefly only went public last month in one of the most hyped IPOs of the year. Time for a quick look at Google's parent Alphabet. The stock is very much flat in pre-market, but the headline is worth noting. Google agreed to pay 24 and a half million dollars to resolve President Trump's claim that he was censored after the riot
at the capital on January 6th, 2021. This week, Google and other tech giants have also been dealing with the rising costs of H1B visas announced by the Trump administration. The latest this morning is that many companies are considering moving jobs outside of the US to hire those workers in India or the Middle East. And while we're on tech stocks, there's a much smaller player that's been posting massive gains.
SanDisk, the maker of hard drives is continuing its rise in after hours trading up now up more than 20% in the two days on a series of positive updates including at a new fab in lab in Japan and analyst upgrades amid strong demand for memory to fuel the AI era. Finally, Etsy, the online marketplace is making a big move. literally, Etsy announced late yesterday that it will transfer its stock listing to the new New York Stock Exchange on October 13th and will stop trading
on Nasdaq. Etsy said the switch won't affect operations and its ticker symbol will rema remain Etsy, ETSY. The news powered the stock up 15.8% yesterday, although it's giving up some of those gains overnight. Keep watching Yahoo Finance to see where things go from here."

UiPath customers can now build agentic automation into business processes quickly and seamlessly without the need for complex coding and manual effort.
Text-based interactions with AI agents work well for tasks that demand precision, such as analyzing complex datasets, refining documents, or drafting formal communications—but can be challenging when applied to spontaneous conversations or real-world, dynamic interactions. Voice interactions provide contextual cues, subtle communication nuances, and collaborative problem-solving capabilities that text-based exchanges cannot deliver. AI agents can leverage voice communication to enhance their effectiveness in handling unpredictable and open-ended tasks. As AI agents become more prevalent, voice interaction will emerge as a natural communication method.
Leveraging Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform, UiPath enables customers to trigger, build, and manage automation through natural language speech—with the same contextual awareness and enterprise-grade execution as a developer writing code or a process owner building automated workflows. The conversational agent has high automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy rates, multilingual support, reliable function calling for appropriate tool selection, and low latencies for real-time processing. It also enables advanced features like affective (emotion-aware) dialogue and proactive audio (where the model can decide to ignore or respond to certain inputs), elevating the capabilities of AI agents to interact with participants in natural voice.
""Voice is the most natural way we communicate, and now it can be the most natural way to automate,"" said Graham Sheldon, Chief Product Officer at UiPath. ""By bringing Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and Gemini models into the UiPath Platform, customers can trigger and orchestrate automations through real-time speech—making agentic AI more intuitive, more accessible, and more impactful in the flow of everyday work.""
""The first wave of generative AI focused on individual productivity; the next is about transforming core business processes,"" said Michael Gerstenhaber, VP of Product Management for Vertex AI, Google Cloud. ""On Google Cloud's Vertex AI, partners like UiPath are at the forefront of this shift, using our Gemini models to build agents that translate human language directly into complex, automated workflows."""

“We are particularly bullish on the online advertising space broadly, driven by several themes, most notably AI driving more user engagement, better advertising efficacy, helping expand the addressable market, and on the cusp of benefiting from a wave of customer acquisition spending from AI native companies,” the analysts wrote.
Mizuho said its “favorite stocks include Meta Platforms (OP, $925 PT, Top Pick), Amazon (OP, $300 PT) and Pinterest (OP, $50 PT).”
The firm added, “We believe our most out-of-consensus call is our Outperform on Airbnb (OP, $151 PT).”
In online advertising, Mizuho said, “Our favorite name is Meta Platforms (+24% to TP), followed by Pinterest (+49% to TP) and Alphabet (+20% to TP). All OP names benefit from themes we like in the space, particularly Meta where AI is entirely offensive.
“We believe this sector broadly has the most tailwinds from scaling AI in our coverage.”
On e-commerce, the analysts cited Amazon’s “expansion of AWS infrastructure, poised to benefit from the scaling AI inference opportunity and on expanding retail margins, driven by improving efficiency and fast-growing advertising.”
In rideshare, Mizuho preferred DoorDash and Uber but flagged Lyft and Instacart, where “we see competitive risk as an overhang for both.”
For online travel, the firm said, “We like Airbnb (+22% to TP) on the push into hotel, which stands to unlock a significantly larger market and can drive accelerating top line in 2027.”

The analysts said the app, featuring “a vertical video feed with swipe-to-scroll navigation similar to TikTok’s interface,” will allow users to generate clips of up to 10 seconds using AI, with identity verification as a key feature.
Morgan Stanley noted, “Our companies are in the business of competing for time and modifying consumer behavior. ChatGPT has modified and captured ‘search’ behavior with agentic offerings...and, if confirmed, we see this new Sora app as a direct competitor for consumer engagement/time/data against META, GOOGL/YouTube, TikTok, RDDT, SNAP and the other digital platforms.”
However, the bank warned that challenging the incumbents will not be easy.
“Changing the behavior of hundreds of millions of people (in META/GOOGL’s cases, billions) is difficult,” the analysts wrote. “For OpenAI to scale its social app, we think it will be important to provide a substantially differentiated (and better) user experience than leaders like META/GOOGL/YouTube.”
The bigger disruption risk, Morgan Stanley argued, may fall on smaller players. “Smaller platforms with less sophisticated next generation ML/GenAI offerings could face engagement headwinds faster if consumer adoption of diffusion/video creation tools ramps,” the analysts said, citing SNAP, Reddit and Pinterest.
Morgan Stanley also highlighted the app’s potential role in OpenAI’s long-term ambitions.
“We see this likely coming from digital advertising and (to a lesser extent) devices...with search/agentic and now video/social the canvases to capture time, engagement, data...and drive monetization,” the bank stated.

The list consists of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN -0.53%), Meta Platforms, Broadcom, Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix.
Nine of those Titans crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years. But not Amazon, which has produced a mere 41% total return during that period compared to 116% for the S&P 500.
What's more, Amazon has gone nowhere in 2025 -- up just 0.2% at the time of this writing. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up 14%, and Alphabet, Nvidia, Netflix, Broadcom, and Oracle are all up more than 30%.
Here are three reasons Amazon is worth a closer look, and two reasons investors may want to think twice about smashing the buy button.
Reasons to buy Amazon
1. The stock's value
Amazon is a reasonable value, with the stock trading at 33.1 times forward earnings. That's less expensive than Apple, which isn't growing as quickly as Amazon.
Amazon invests in long-term projects, doesn't pay a dividend, and even dilutes its shareholders through stock-based compensation. Whereas many of its Ten Titans peers pay small dividends or at least repurchase enough stock to more than offset stock-based compensation, thereby avoiding share dilution.
Still, Amazon's attractive valuation is a reason to take a closer look at the stock.
2. AWS is the industry leader
Amazon is the undisputed leader in cloud computing. On its latest earnings call, for the second quarter, CEO Andy Jassy estimated that the second-largest cloud player (presumably Microsoft) is about 65% the size of Amazon Web Services (AWS). That's a commanding lead in an industry with decades of growth potential.
Being the market leader gives AWS a ton of exposure to different industries. It's also not solely dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) to drive cloud growth given its legacy position in general computing and basic enterprise services.
3. Amazon has other levers to pull outside of AWS
AWS is the crown jewel, but Amazon also owns Amazon Prime, Prime Video, MGM Studios, Amazon Music Prime, Prime Gaming, Twitch, Audible, Kindle, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and healthcare services.
This diversification makes the company less dependent on any single market and provides numerous options for capital allocation. Amazon is one of those companies that is never short on ideas. Which is why it spends so aggressively.
Reasons to sell Amazon
1. Growth is slowing
Amazon's valuation has decreased for several valid reasons. The biggest being that growth has slowed.
In its most recent quarter, Amazon grew total sales by 13%, AWS revenue by 17.5%, and AWS operating income by 9.7%. These are decent results, but not great given Amazon's aggressive spending.
For the upcoming third quarter, Amazon is guiding for 10% to 13% revenue growth and operating income to be roughly flat year over year. The company's growth is under pressure due to a slowdown in AWS and strained consumer spending, which is affecting its e-commerce business.
2. AWS is losing ground to competitors
Arguably, the primary reason to pass on Amazon is the intense competition in cloud computing. Amazon has a commanding lead right now, but AWS' once seemingly impenetrable moat is showing cracks.
During its second-quarter earnings call, an analyst asked management why AWS was growing slower than the No. 2 and No. 3 cloud players. Jassy explained that AWS is well positioned from an AI standpoint and that customers care a lot about scale and security. He also said that it's still early for AWS and the industry, which is incredible considering AWS is a $123 billion run-rate business.
However, it's undeniable that both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are growing faster than AWS. And then there's Oracle, which is making the case for why there should really be the ""big four"" cloud giants rather than just the ""big three.""
Oracle is bringing over 70 data centers on line in just a few years. These are custom-built for AI and high-performance computing. They're fast, new, and ultra-efficient, which is why Oracle is landing huge contracts with OpenAI and Meta Platforms.
Oracle also partners with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud by embedding native versions of its infrastructure into the big three clouds. This approach reduces latency by bringing AI to the dataset rather than moving huge datasets across cloud providers. With its pure-play business-to-business approach, Oracle is arguably the hottest AI growth stock to buy now.
Buying Amazon for the right reasons
At first glance, Amazon looks like a no-brainer buy given its reasonable valuation and noticeable underperformance compared to the rest of the Ten Titans. But dig deeper, and there are some flaws in the business that shouldn't go unnoticed.
Amazon is different than other companies. When Apple and Alphabet were getting clobbered earlier this year, it was easier to make the buy case because of their reasonable valuations, high free cash flow, and ability to return capital to shareholders. Amazon's aggressive spending leads to inconsistent free cash flow. In this vein, it deserves less slack than the other Ten Titans.
That said, investors who believe that consumer spending will improve and AWS' dominance is here to stay are getting the chance to buy Amazon at a good valuation in a market that is becoming increasingly expensive."

Additionally, Alphabet established strategic partnerships, substantial investments in U.S. AI education, and expanded global initiatives, further solidifying its reputation as a leader in AI.
""The Fortune AIQ 50 demonstrates how companies across industry sectors are beginning to find real value from the deployment of AI technology,"" said Jeremy Kahn, Fortune's AI Editor. ""Clearly some sectors, such as tech and finance, are pulling ahead of others, but even in so-called 'old economy' industries like mining and transport, there are a few companies that are pulling away from their peers in the successful use of AI."""

Nvidia (NVDA 0.07%) and Broadcom (AVGO 1.97%) are designing cutting-edge AI chips.
Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle (ORCL 1.13%) are pushing the bounds of cloud computing.
Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel manufacture chips using equipment supplied by companies like ASML, Applied Materials, and Lam Research.
There's also the indirect method of investing in AI, which can be achieved through any company that utilizes it to enhance efficiency. For example, Walmart's AI-powered supply chain optimization.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with an AI bent offer a simple way to invest in a portfolio of companies rather than picking and choosing just a handful of names. Here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 0.67%), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX 2.95%), and the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG 0.50%) are AI ETFs that have what it takes to outperform the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.27%) over the next five years.
1. Vanguard Information Technology ETF
This ETF mirrors the performance of the tech sector. Big gains from ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Oracle have made the ETF heavily concentrated in just a handful of names.
Just 10 holdings make up 57.8% of the fund. However, many of those holdings have a ton of exposure to AI.
Not long ago, the tech sector was dominated by software names. However, big gains from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which are powering data centers with AI chips, have given the tech sector much more exposure to semiconductor, materials, and hardware. These industries, along with electronic equipment and components, now make up well more than half of the tech sector.
The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is one of the least expensive ways to invest in the tech sector, with an expense ratio of just 0.09%.
2. iShares Semiconductor ETF
If you like the technology sector's increasing reliance on semiconductor stocks, then you'll love this ETF. It's the ideal pick for folks who believe the semiconductor industry is one of the best ways to invest in AI.
The strategy has paid off, as the iShares Semiconductor ETF has achieved a staggering 184% total return over the last five years, which is better than the 151% total return for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and far better than the 151% total return for the S&P 500.
This fund has a higher expense ratio than the aforementioned Vanguard ETFs, at 0.34%. However, it's a great way to get exposure to semiconductor companies that have very low weightings in the S&P 500 (or aren't included at all).
Advanced Micro Devices has a 7.1% weighting in the fund, Qualcomm makes up 5.8%, and Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Intel, Lam Research, Marvell Technology, Applied Materials, KLA, ASML, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all more than 4%.
3. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF
This fund isn't limited to a single sector. Rather, it essentially filters the S&P 500 by doubling down on top growth stocks and leaving out value-focused companies.
This strategy has helped the fund slightly outperform the S&P 500 over the last five years. But it could easily beat the market over the next five years if mega-cap growth stocks continue leading the major indexes to new heights.
Around 55% of this ETF is invested in the Ten Titans, which have plenty of upside potential from AI. What's more, the ETF has a very low expense ratio of just 0.07%, or $7 for every $10,000 invested.
Add it all up, and it's a simple and low-cost way to get exposure to growth-focused S&P 500 companies.
Winning ETFs with room to run
The discussed ETFs are ideally suited for investors looking to build their AI exposure around today's leading companies. However, they may not be suitable for investors seeking to diversify into newer companies.
A common mistake is duplicating holdings across ETFs, which results in more exposure than an investor may realize. For example, if an investor owns Nvidia stock outright but also has $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund, that's another $720 in Nvidia simply because it makes up 7.2% of the index.
However, it could also be a mistake to ignore today's leaders just because they are hiding in plain sight. Big tech firms are ramping up spending on AI, and a lot of that spending is funneling to the semiconductor industry and associated hardware and infrastructure companies. That gives Nvidia and Broadcom the green light to pour excess profits into research and development to expand their lead over the competition.
In this vein, doubling down on top tech stocks through low-cost ETFs may be one of the simplest ways to potentially beat the S&P 500 over the next five years."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-30T01:24:00,Prediction: PayPal's New Google Partnership Could Drive the Stock Higher,The deal put it at the forefront of AI-powered commerce.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=aa3058dabe3be7daaaa0b35c97e52e9bdd9adb6d5d31ba66e6d6797d7e93664f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/prediction-paypals-new-google-partnership-could-dr/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/prediction-paypals-new-google-partnership-could-dr/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/prediction-paypals-new-google-partnership-could-dr/,fool.com,200.0,,"PayPal (PYPL -1.65%) has been trying to turn around its business for years, but its new partnership with Alphabet (GOOGL 1.86%) (GOOG 1.86%) has the potential to be a game-changer. With this partnership, it will change now be at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered commerce.
As part of the deal, PayPal will become the primary payments processor across Google Cloud, Google Ads, and Google Play. Its branded checkout and payment services will also be incorporated throughout Google's broader ecosystem. But that's not all. PayPal will also migrate its entire technology stack to Alphabet's cloud computing platform, Google Cloud. That lets it ditch some of its legacy infrastructure and lean on Google's machine learning to help boost things like fraud detection and speed up transaction processing.
The two companies are also teaming up to create what they are calling ""agentic commerce."" This is where AI shopping agents will be able to help consumers not only make purchases, but also discover new products and comparison shop. The companies will also help develop AI agent standards and best practices. This is where e-commerce appears to be heading, and PayPal has positioned itself well for this future by teaming with Alphabet.
The partnership should also help PayPal expand its reach at a relatively low incremental cost. Integrating its payment platform across Google products brings it access to billions of users and millions of merchants without PayPal having to spend heavily on customer acquisition.
In the past, CEO Alex Chriss has talked about not chasing low gross margin volume for the sake of revenue growth. Now, the economics of payment processing for a client as large as Google isn't going to be robust, but the sheer size of that volume and the technological partnership more than make this deal worthwhile. Meanwhile, moving more of PayPal's workload to Google Cloud should help it launch new features faster.
Why the stock is a buy
While there is still plenty of heavy lifting for PayPal to do, this deal should help the company achieve its goal of accelerating its branded checkout growth from the mid-single digits to between 8% to 10% by 2027, as its branded checkout is expanded to key Google properties.
Investors also should not underestimate the strategic importance of the partnership. For years, PayPal has faced criticism that it was stuck as just a digital wallet with little differentiation. Now it is embedding itself in one of the most influential tech ecosystems while also collaborating on the very protocols that will shape how AI shopping agents transact. That's a very different positioning than being yet another online checkout button.
It's also worth noting that PayPal continues to execute on other fronts. Venmo revenue grew more than 20% last quarter, and Pay with Venmo transactions were up 45%. Physical debit and credit cards are also gaining traction, with 2 million first-time PayPal and Venmo debit card users added in the U.S. in Q2. Transaction volume from those offline channels rose 8%. These aren't headline-grabbing innovations, but they show the company is broadening its user base and strengthening ties with consumers.
The stock has been a laggard, down roughly 20% year to date, even after posting strong earnings last quarter and raising its full-year EPS outlook. That has left PayPal at an attractive valuation, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 11.5 times 2026 analyst estimates.
There is a risk that the market won't immediately reward the partnership, since most of the financial benefit will take time to materialize, but for investors willing to be patient, this looks like the kind of strategic move that can reinvigorate growth and help close the gap between PayPal's valuation and its potential. AI-driven commerce is still in its early innings, and PayPal is now much better positioned than it was just a couple of months ago."

All of the AI hyperscalers are dumping billions of dollars into building out AI computing capacity to push the limits of what's possible. We're still in the early innings of learning what AI can do, and it will be some time before there's enough computing capacity available to see AI's full effect.
Another trend that is on the horizon is quantum computing. Quantum computing has the potential to unlock a new level of AI power that we haven't experienced, but this technology is still being proven.
Combining both of these trends that will play out over the next decade in a single investment option would be ideal, and fortunately for investors, there's a company that is doing that: Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%). Alphabet is heavily investing in both artificial intelligence and quantum computing, and looks like a strong candidate in both of these important and emerging industries.
Alphabet's AI technology is emerging as one of the best available
Alphabet is better known as the parent company of Google, although it owns many other businesses. Alphabet has wisely used its impressive cash flows to invest in many other businesses, and this has led to its widespread success today.
In the AI realm, many investors were worried that its cash cow, the Google Search engine, may be replaced by generative AI. However, that isn't panning out, as Google is still retaining a lot of its user base alongside most of the revenue on the platform. In Q2, the Google Search segment delivered 12% year-over-year growth. That doesn't sound like a declining business, and one feature is likely to thank for its continued relevance.
AI search overview incorporates a generative AI summary at the top of each result, combining the form factor of a traditional internet search engine with generative AI. This makes Google Gemini, the large language model behind the feature, one of the most used in the world, which is a huge advantage for training the model.
Furthermore, Gemini consistently ranks among the best-performing generative AI models, making Alphabet a leader in this space. It's also actively pursuing quantum computing technologies, and the combination of its AI leadership and a viable quantum computing chip could make Alphabet an unstoppable business.
Alphabet is a leader in the quantum computing space
Back in December 2024, Alphabet created a mini quantum computing investment rush when it announced that its Willow quantum computing chip had completed a task that would have taken traditional computing methods 10 septillion (10 to the 25th power) years. While this test was specifically created to test quantum computing viability, it still proves that Alphabet is making progress in this area.
Alphabet is developing its own quantum computing chip for one primary reason: It doesn't want to buy computing units from an external provider. To power its AI ambitions, Alphabet buys graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia and custom AI accelerators from Broadcom. Both of these companies are middlemen that drive the price of computing units up. However, if Alphabet can develop its own quantum computer in-house, it can cut the middleman out and be far more profitable.
This makes integrating quantum computing into its existing AI computing infrastructure easier, and also gives Alphabet an advantage in the cloud computing space, as it could rent out quantum computing capabilities.
Time will tell if Alphabet develops a winning approach in the quantum computing realm, but it's already an established leader in the AI world. With nearly unlimited resources compared to some quantum computing pureplays, I'm confident that Alphabet can develop a viable quantum computing chip that boosts its AI capabilities and can be rented out via cloud computing offerings. This makes Alphabet a genius stock pick to bridge the gap between AI and quantum computing, and I think investors can be confident scooping up shares today with the expectation that Alphabet will beat the market over the next decade."

Perplexity is stepping straight into Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) turf. The startup has launched its Perplexity Search API, a tool that lets developers tap into the same global-scale infrastructure behind its fast-growing answer engine.
The new service gives developers access to an index of hundreds of billions of web pages, refreshed in real time. That scale matters in the AI era, where apps depend on deep, reliable context. When it comes to AI, context is king, the company wrote in a blog post, adding that its system doesn't just search at the document level but slices content into smaller chunks that can be ranked and retrieved on the fly. For developers, that means cleaner results, less preprocessing, and quicker integration.
Alongside the API, Perplexity rolled out a software development kit to show exactly how it designed and optimized the system. It's a clear sign the company wants to be seen not just as an AI answer engine, but as a search infrastructure provider too. The push comes weeks after Perplexity made headlines with a surprise $34.5 billion bid for Google's Chrome browser."

Bessemer Venture Partners partner and top investor Byron Deeter doesn't buy the argument that today's AI surge is just another dot-com bubble. His reason: the money this time is backed by real revenue.
The numbers are pretty big, and yet the revenue side is the difference this time, Deeter told CNBC. He pointed to OpenAI and Anthropic as examples, saying they're already generating billions in sales at a pace the software industry has never seen before. OpenAI is taking aim at Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) search dominance with ChatGPT, while Anthropic is leaning on its API model to drive business value.
Deeter, an investor in Anthropic, Perplexity and Canva, said the trillions pouring into AI infrastructure are justified. In his view, the market is so large that it could add a zero to traditional software benchmarks.
He acknowledged the disruption feels intense but argued it's no different in spirit from past industrial revolutions. AI, he said, will lead to more jobshigher-value, more interesting oneseven if the realignment comes faster than past shifts. Power shortages remain a challenge, but Deeter predicted big leaps ahead in energy and efficiency."

Gavin Newsom has signed SB 53, a first-in-the-nation bill that sets new transparency requirements on large AI companies.
SB 53, which passed the state legislature two weeks ago, requires large AI labs — including OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind — to be transparent about safety protocols. It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.
In addition, SB 53 creates a mechanism for AI companies and the public to report potential critical safety incidents to California’s Office of Emergency Services. Companies also have to report incidents related to crimes committed without human oversight, such as cyberattacks, and deceptive behavior by a model that isn’t required under the EU AI Act.
The bill has received mixed reactions from the AI industry. Tech firms have broadly argued that state-level AI policy risks creating a “patchwork of regulation” that would hinder innovation, although Anthropic endorsed the bill. Meta and OpenAI lobbied against it. OpenAI even wrote and published an open letter to Gov. Newsom that discouraged his signing of SB 53.
The new bill comes as some of Silicon Valley’s tech elite have poured hundreds of millions into super PACs to back candidates that support a light-touch approach to AI regulation. Leaders at OpenAI and Meta have in recent weeks launched pro-AI super PACs that aim to back candidates and bills that are friendly to AI.
Still, other states might look to California for inspiration as they attempt to curb the potential harms caused by the unmitigated advancement of such a powerful emerging technology. In New York, a similar bill was passed by state lawmakers and is awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature or veto.
“California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,” Newsom said in a statement. “This legislation strikes that balance. AI is the new frontier in innovation, and California is not only here for it — but stands strong as a national leader by enacting the first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.”
The governor is also weighing another bill — SB 243 — that passed both the State Assembly and Senate with bipartisan support this month. The bill would regulate AI companion chatbots, requiring operators to implement safety protocols, and hold them legally accountable if their bots fail to meet those standards.
SB 53 is Senator Scott Wiener’s second attempt at an AI safety bill after Newsom vetoed his more sweeping SB 1047 last year amid major pushback from AI companies. With this bill, Wiener reached out to major AI companies to attempt to help them understand the changes he made to the bill."

(GOOG) settling at $244.36, representing a -1.14% change from its previous close.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=23ea37e8b12cb981649483cddeee8a8b67fac2613f823b9cfd4e327292837ce1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-goog-stock-sinks-214505177.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-goog-stock-sinks-214505177.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-goog-stock-sinks-214505177.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"In the latest close session, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) was down 1.14% at $244.36. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.26%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.15%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.48%.
The company's shares have seen an increase of 15.76% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.4% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.87%.
Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, Alphabet Inc. is projected to report earnings of $2.3 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 8.49%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $84.53 billion, indicating a 13.39% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.
Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.97 per share and revenue of $334.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +24% and +13.38%, respectively, from last year.
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.25% lower. Alphabet Inc. currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
In the context of valuation, Alphabet Inc. is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 24.8. This denotes a premium relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 24.77.
We can also see that GOOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.67. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Internet - Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.67 at yesterday's closing price.
The Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 86, this industry ranks in the top 35% of all industries, numbering over 250."

The settlement disclosed Monday ends Trump’s long-running legal challenge to the suspension. The filing says $22 million will go toward construction of a new ballroom in the White House, a project near and dear to Trump. Google declined to comment.

Most Read from Bloomberg
Trump has managed since winning back the presidency in November to secure favorable settlements with other tech and media giants that he accused of mistreating him — in spite of courts having regularly ruled that social media companies have a First Amendment right to moderate content as they please.
Walt Disney Co.’s ABC News agreed in December to pay $15 million toward a future Trump presidential foundation or museum to end a suit claiming anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him in a statement about a court case against Trump.
In January, Meta Platforms Inc. agreed to pay a total of $25 million — including $22 million for a Trump library — to resolve Trump’s suit over his suspension from Facebook after the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters following his 2020 election defeat.
Trump ended his legal fight with Twitter over its Jan. 6 ban in February. Court filings didn’t reveal details on a settlement. The Wall Street Journal later reported, citing unidentified people, that X — the name that Elon Musk gave the platform after he bought it in 2022 — agreed to pay about $10 million to resolve the president’s claims.
In July, Paramount Global announced a $16 million settlement with Trump over his suit accusing CBS Broadcasting Inc. of deceptively editing its October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the presidential campaign.
The network, which had previously denied wrongdoing, released an unedited version and has agreed to release transcripts of presidential candidate interviews in the future. Although officially unrelated, the settlement was widely viewed as critical for Paramount to gain approval from federal regulators for its merger with Skydance Media.
When Trump separately sued Google, Facebook and Twitter over his deplatforming, he sought monetary damages to punish the companies and ensure other users can’t be banned or flagged by the tech giants. All three companies eventually dropped the bans, but by then Trump had largely shifted his social media commentary to his own network, Truth Social."

We recently published 15 Stocks Jim Cramer Mentioned As He Said Quantum Computing Worried Him. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
While Cramer did express worries about quantum computing in this episode, he still believes that International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a strong player in the industry. The CNBC TV host has recommended buying its shares to invest in quantum computing several times this year. This time, he discussed HSBC announcing that it had conducted a trial run of quantum-enabled algorithmic trading with International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM):
“I’ve met with Arvind Krishna and he said look, you want real quantum? We have real quantum. He also, by the way, said that Honeywell Quantinuum, that that’s real. Google we know is real. And then there’s all these companies that are development-stage companies. That may be development-stage companies for a very long time. And that’s IONQ, that’s D-Wave. Because they’ll tell you listen, we’re working very hard, but we’re nowhere near, they’re working hard. IBM actually has something right now that is pretty positive. IBM, David. It could reinvent finance.”
HSBC’s announcement with International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) covered algorithmic trading in the bond market. The bank shared that it had used quantum and classical computing to demonstrate a 34% improvement in predicting if a trade would fill at a quoted price.
While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

In other words, OpenAI might be on the path to reshaping who holds power in e-commerce.
OpenAI’s new “Instant Checkout” feature is available to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free logged-in users buying from U.S.-based Etsy sellers, with more than 1 million Shopify merchants like Glossier, Skims, Spanx, and Vuori “coming soon,” per OpenAI.
Instant Checkout builds on previous shopping features on ChatGPT that surfaced relevant products, images, reviews, prices, and direct links to merchants in response to shopping questions like “what should I get my friend who loves ceramics?” or “best sneakers to wear to the office.” Now, instead of having to leave the conversation, users can just tap “Buy” to confirm their order, shipping, and payment details (options include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or credit card) to complete the purchase.
Last year, Perplexity introduced a similar in-chat shopping and payments feature. Microsoft also offers merchants the ability to create in-chat storefront capabilities with the Copilot Merchant Program.
This type of frictionless experience has the potential to spark a new movement in how people shop online — one that moves away from search engines like Google and e-commerce platforms like Amazon toward conversational agents with curated recommendations, comparisons, and easy checkout experiences.
It’s also setting the stage for new power brokers to emerge in e-commerce. Google and Amazon have long been the gatekeepers for retail discovery. If more purchases start inside AI chatbots, the firms behind them will suddenly have more control over what products are surfaced and what commissions or fees they charge.
Both Amazon and Google have previously leveraged their dominance to favor their own products or preferred partners, pushing down competitors in search results or charging steep fees to sellers simply to maintain visibility. OpenAI said in a blog post that the product results it surfaces are “organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user,” and that it will charge merchants a “small fee” for completed purchases.
TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for more information."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-29T17:47:55,AI is transforming how software engineers do their jobs. Just don't call it 'vibe-coding',"“The essence of it is you’re no longer in the nitty-gritty syntax,” said Cat Wu, project manager of Anthropic's Claude Code.  Anthropic launched the latest version of its flagship Claude chatbot on Monday, boasting that Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be the “world's best” for coding and other complex tasks.  Large language models behind generative AI chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT and Google's Gemini are capable of many things, from homework help to organizing meal plans, but the “top use case” for most businesses has been in coding and software engineering, said Gartner analyst Philip Walsh.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=65e44f67fbcaa992ee2290e0763423f6d8ad9af6cec4e71be8b083c0c1b11798,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-transforming-software-engineers-jobs-174755497.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-transforming-software-engineers-jobs-174755497.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-transforming-software-engineers-jobs-174755497.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"One of the hottest markets in the artificial intelligence industry is selling chatbots that write computer code.
Some call it “vibe-coding” because it encourages an AI coding assistant to do the grunt work as human software developers work through big ideas. Others dislike that term. But there's no question that these tools are transforming the job experience for many tech workers amid an intense rivalry between leading AI companies to make the best one.
“The essence of it is you’re no longer in the nitty-gritty syntax,” said Cat Wu, project manager of Anthropic's Claude Code. ""You’re not looking at every single line of code. You’re more trying to communicate this higher-level goal of what you want to accomplish.""
Wu added, however, that ”vibe-coding"" is not a term she uses. ""We definitely want to make it very clear that the responsibility, at the end of the day, is in the hands of the engineers.”
Anthropic launched the latest version of its flagship Claude chatbot on Monday, boasting that Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be the “world's best” for coding and other complex tasks.
Large language models behind generative AI chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT and Google's Gemini are capable of many things, from homework help to organizing meal plans, but the “top use case” for most businesses has been in coding and software engineering, said Gartner analyst Philip Walsh.
“That is often the first thing large organizations go after,” Walsh said. “I think there’s broad recognition among these AI model providers that coding is really where they’re getting the most traction.”
And while Walsh said Anthropic's products are a favorite for software developers, it is hardly the only player in a rapidly growing and consolidating market.
San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area remain the center of the battle to make the best AI coder, home not just to fierce rivals OpenAI and Anthropic but startups like Anysphere, Cognition and Harness, as well as Microsoft-owned GitHub.
“This is the most competitive space in the industry right now,” said Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang, speaking by video call from the startup’s office in Mountain View, California.
Windsurf’s coding assistant launched less than a year ago, but as its popularity grew, hitting 200,000 users in its first two months, it found itself at the center of a bidding war between tech giants. OpenAI sought to acquire it. Then, Google scooped up Windsurf’s founders and research team, leaving a shell of a company that Cognition acquired in July.
“It’s been a really volatile time at Windsurf,” Wang wrote to employees in July as he announced the merger with Cognition, maker of the AI coding assistant Devin. Two months later, the two companies’ integration is “going really well,” Wang told The Associated Press from a conference room called New Kelp City, named for a setting in SpongeBob SquarePants."

This price target implies 17.7% upside from the current price of $11.89 per share.
The updated analysis centers on Cipher’s 10-year, 168 MW lease to Fluidstack (244 MW total capacity) that begins in October 2026, which carries $3 billion in contracted payments and extension options that could expand the deal value to $7 billion. Rosenblatt expects the contract to generate 80–85% adjusted EBITDA margins and yield about 14.8% against estimated capital spending of $9 million–$11 million per MW.
Get these headlines directly to your inbox: subscribe to Blockspace.
Google has agreed to backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack’s obligations to Cipher’s, a key feature of the deal that reduces financing risk and improves Cipher’s cost of capital. In exchange, Google will receive warrants on roughly 24.2 million Cipher shares, or about a 5.4% pro forma stake. Rosenblatt’s stipulates that Google’s support should help Cipher access debt on more favorable terms.
Rosenblatt also highlights Cipher’s extensive 2.4 GW development pipeline which could drive additional HPC contracts in the months ahead. Although the initial terms are slightly less attractive than those secured by peers, Rosenblatt believes Cipher had strong incentives to complete its first deal and establish market credibility.
On valuation, Rosenblatt raises its target from $9 to $14 based on a multiple of 15x its new 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate, a premium over peers reflecting Cipher’s expected stability of long-term hosting revenue and an improved financial profile. The firm reiterates a buy rating, citing the shift toward predictable, high-margin HPC revenue alongside growing bitcoin mining operations.

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, said in a recent program on CNBC that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned well to gain following the recent court ruling that the company will not need to sell its Chrome business. The analyst explained why he believes the stock is undervalued:
“First the core catalyst has got to be they got to maintain that double digit search revenue growth they’ve been at 11%, 12%, 13% for about two years now we think that we think that will continue because what’s underappreciated by the market is the quality of Google leads is actually rising and it’s kind of the law of unintended consequences you show people fewer paid clicks so that when they click on them, they’re less casual. They’re more they’re more conscious, determined, whatever it is. But the marketers we talk with, the advertisers are seeing higher quality leads coming from Google. That’s causing pricing to go up. That’s a good thing for Google. And then secondly, just like Meta, Google has been able to use Gen AI to improve its ad targeting, its ad selection. So, you’ve got a a search marketplace that’s getting better. That’s your core catalyst that that continues. Then you got what I call the amplification catalyst. That’s YouTube revenue that’s accelerating. That’s Google cloud revenue that’s accelerating. And then Waymo is coming to a town near you. And you put all that together, I think the stock’s worth more. You put a 25 multiple on this next year’s numbers. You get to like 275 on 2027 earnings numbers. You get to 325. So somewhere in between there is probably where the stock can go called 300 bucks.”
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe concerns around AI-related threats to Google search are overstated. Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. As of April, Google had over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews. Google’s competitor OpenAI failed to impress the market with its GPT-5 model, while Gemini is gaining traction with new features. Analysts believe the company is strongly positioned to start placing ads in AI search results, which means its core ads business will not be impacted despite the decline in traditional search.

Strategic Partnerships with Microsoft and Google Driving Enterprise Adoption
NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rezolve Ai (NASDAQ: RZLV), the enterprise AI-commerce company, today issued a statement to clarify recent misconceptions surrounding its latest SEC filing and to reaffirm the company’s strong financial position, strategic partnerships, and customer traction.
No Dilution in Recent F-3 Filing
On September 25, Rezolve filed a Form F-3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to re-register for resale certain shares that had previously been registered for resale on Form F-1, a more administratively burdensome form for the Company. The registered shares were already outstanding shares held by investors. No new shares were issued in connection with the Form F-3 and the Form F-3 is not an indication of imminent selling activity by these shareholders. This filing is an administrative requirement to allow prior investors flexibility and to ease the administrative costs of maintaining the registration statements imposed on the Company, and it does not create dilution for existing Rezolve shareholders.
As previously reported on September 26, Rezolve recently completed a $200 million capital raise, further strengthening Rezolve’s balance sheet and intended to fund its global expansion strategy. As previously disclosed and agreed in the definitive documentation, Rezolve intends to register for resale on Form F-3 the shares issued in connection with such capital raise to provide flexibility for the investors in the coming days. This filing is fully consistent with the Company’s previously disclosed plans.
Truly Strategic Partnerships with Microsoft and Google
Rezolve reaffirmed that its partnerships with Microsoft and Google go far beyond marketplace listings. Senior executives Nick Parker of Microsoft and Tara Brady of Google have publicly described Rezolve as a strategic partner in driving the future of retail AI (Microsoft video | Google video). These partnerships involve joint go-to-market commitments, deep technical integration, and coordinated customer engagements across global retail and enterprise sectors.
Addressing the Industry’s Hallucination Problem
One of the most critical challenges in AI adoption is the risk of hallucinations. Rezolve’s proprietary brainpowa™ LLM has been engineered to achieve zero hallucinations, delivering reliable, accurate outputs in enterprise deployments (see demonstration). This differentiator is central to building enterprise trust in Rezolve’s platform."

The platform said last week’s decision by the Karnataka High Court lets police issue “arbitrary” content removal orders through the online portal, called Sahyog. The ruling was in response to a petition by X, filed in March, that challenged the government and the system, which the company described in court as a “censorship portal.”
India launched Sahyog (“assistance” in Hindi) in late 2024 to automate content takedowns and allow government agencies to directly order social media platforms to remove content they deem unlawful. Companies including Google, Meta, and ShareChat have joined the portal, but X has so far refused to comply.
The portal “circumvents Section 69A of the IT Act, violates Supreme Court rulings, and infringes Indian citizens’ constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression,” X’s Global Government Affairs account wrote in a post on Monday.
Section 69A of the IT Act governs how the federal government can order content to be blocked online, and includes procedural safeguards such as written orders and judicial review.
“The Sahyog enables officers to order content removal based solely on allegations of ‘illegality,’ without judicial review or due process for the speakers, and threatens platforms with criminal liability for non-compliance,” X wrote.
In its ruling last week, the court rejected X’s “free speech” argument, saying that the social media platform, as a foreign company, does not have the constitutional right to freedom of expression under Indian law.
“We respectfully disagree with the view that we have no right to raise these concerns because of our incorporation abroad — X contributes significantly to public discourse in India and the voice of our users is at the heart of our platform,” the company said. “We will appeal this order to defend free expression.”
X’s fight with the Indian government comes as Elon Musk works to expand his business footprint in the country. The billionaire recently launched Tesla in India, and secured final regulatory approval to roll out his satellite internet service, Starlink."

AI could add an estimated $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030, according to PwC, as companies integrate AI into everything from cloud computing to virtual assistants and e-commerce.
With nearly every tech company attempting to ride the AI wave right now, it can be difficult to parse out which will truly benefit and which are just following the pack. Here are five that are leading the way and will likely be good investments for years to come.
1. Nvidia
There's one big reason why Nvidia (NVDA 0.07%) is on every AI stock list: The company's semiconductors are in an estimated 70% to 95% of artificial intelligence data centers. That gives Nvidia a massive advantage over other chip designers and ensures that as companies invest in AI, Nvidia will likely be one of the biggest winners.
AI data centers are Nvidia's bread and butter, and in the most recent quarter, sales from the segment jumped 56% to $41.1 billion. More growth could be on the way as companies continue to upgrade and expand their AI footprint, which is why Nvidia CFO Colette Kress estimates global data center spending could reach up to $4 trillion by 2030. With Nvidia's leading position in AI chips, the company's future continues to look bright.
2. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%) has a multi-pronged approach to benefiting from AI. Its early moves to integrate ChatGPT's platform into its suite of services have already paid off, with millions of users now using the company's Copilot AI services. That's helped increase Microsoft's total sales, which jumped 18% in Q4 to $76 billion and helped non-GAAP earnings rise 24% to $3.65 per share.
But the real long-term opportunity for Microsoft is likely its cloud computing business, Azure, which already has 20% of the public cloud market. As demand for AI services increases, companies need more powerful cloud computing platforms. Azure is already benefiting -- generating $75 billion in fiscal 2024, a 34% increase from last year. And with global AI cloud computing revenue estimated to reach $2 trillion by 2030, Microsoft should be able to tap this market for years to come.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.36%), also known as TSMC, is a semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse that produces some of the world's most advanced processors. The company has a near monopoly in the AI processor manufacturing market, with close to 90% of advanced processors made by the company.
That lead has been a boon to TSMC's bottom line. The company's earnings popped 67% in Q2 to $2.47 per American depositary receipt (ADR). And in case you're worried about demand slowing down any time soon, consider that Taiwan Semiconductor's management said that its artificial intelligence revenue will double this year, compared to 2024.
4. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 1.97%) may be one of the lesser-known names on this list, but it would be a mistake to overlook this AI powerhouse. The company designs application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for AI data centers that are used by Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%), Meta Platforms, and others, and management says AI sales will reach $6.2 billion in the current quarter, up 19% sequentially.
The company is benefiting from the AI boom and profits are rising quickly -- with non-GAAP earnings jumping 36% to $1.69 in Q3. Broadcom estimates that more growth from AI is on the way too, with AI revenue estimated to reach up to $90 billion annually by 2027 -- a 650% increase from last year.
5. Alphabet
Alphabet's artificial intelligence niche can be found in its increasingly popular Gemini chatbot, which has an estimated 400 million monthly active users. While there have been concerns that AI chatbots will take ad revenue away from the company, that doesn't appear to be the case yet -- Google ad sales were $71.3 billion in Q2, a 10% increase from the year-ago quarter.
Creating an advanced AI chatbot that helps keep Google users wrapped in the company's ecosystem is smart, but it's only one of Alphabet's opportunities. The other comes from its Google Cloud services, which has about 13% of the public cloud market. Like Microsoft, Google is benefiting from the increasing need for AI cloud services, which led to sales from Google Cloud rising 32% in Q2 to $13.6 billion in the most recent quarter.
With all of the tech companies on this list already carving out their niches in artificial intelligence, each one would be worth putting some of your $5,000 toward -- and holding for the long term."

The second edition of GlobalData’s ESG Executive Briefing states that carbon offset purchases are ramping up and that 2030 net-zero targets “are just about still achievable.” However, it adds that, while AI-fuelled emissions growth has begun to slow, Big Tech’s announced capital expenditure plans suggest this will be temporary, with data centre construction to accelerate.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
As such, the report says: “The key question for climate targets will be whether enough carbon offsets can be bought to match emissions in 2030 and beyond. In its 2024 reporting year, Microsoft massively increased its offset purchases, contracting an amount above its full-year Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.”
Microsoft is alongside Google, Meta and Apple in having committed to achieving carbon neutrality across their value chains by 2030. Its example demonstrates that purchasing carbon offsets at high volumes is feasible – but contracted offsets must still be delivered, and maintaining a pipeline of offsets to the high standards for purchasing set by Microsoft and Google poses a challenge.
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are another tool being employed by Big Tech in pursuing emissions targets. These allow firms to fund renewable projects in exchange for securing clean energy to help meet their sustainability goals.
“PPAs will continue, and there will be more for small modular reactors,” the report states. “Their ability to provide consistent power makes them a good match for data centres, which run 24 hours a day. Big Tech has already signed PPAs for small modular reactors, but most will not be up and running until 2030 or later.”
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataGlobalData adds that other barriers to PPAs are tariffs on equipment made in China and delays in connecting new plants to power grids.
The report states that the long-term challenge for Big Tech will be reducing Scope 3 emissions.
“Expanding net-zero strategies to companies across the value chain will be needed to reduce Scope 3 emissions,” it explains. “Big Tech must help smaller suppliers sign their own PPAs for low-carbon energy. Suppliers to Big Tech can expect procurement standards on emissions to tighten over time, requiring suppliers to achieve emissions reduction at or below a certain emissions intensity.”"

(Reuters) -Belgian chip research hub imec will appoint Patrick Vandenameele as its new chief executive with current CEO Luc Van den hove becoming chairman, the company told Reuters on Monday.
Belgium's imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has made the change to help it adapt to the changing demands of artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaking, Vandenameele said in an interview.
The rising influence of AI is reshaping the company's priorities as it seeks to deepen its ties with cloud computing providers.
Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta (META.O), and Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O), known as hyperscalers, control about half of the world's data‑center capacity and are rapidly expanding their market share as AI build‑outs surges.
This AI boom has created demand for new, more efficient chips to fill their multibillion-dollar data centres.
""They are screaming for solutions to scale up, scale out, and to do this at a sustainable power balance. Power is the key problem in this case,"" Vandenameele said.
Belgium's imec matches the most advanced and expensive tools of makers like ASML and Applied Materials, with chipmakers and designers like TSMC, Nvidia, Apple and Google.
VENTURE & CHIPS ACT
Vandenameele, 52, began his career at imec in the 1990s, co‑founding four startups—three based on imec technology before taking on senior leadership roles at firms like Qorvo, and Huawei.
Under his leadership, the company plans to launch more spin-offs based on its technology. It will give start-ups earlier access to its chipmaking lines and help European deep tech firms overcome its funding and manufacturing hurdles, he said.
""The barrier for these small companies to get access to leading-edge technology is usually very high because they need to compete with huge companies to get access to these fabs"", Vandenameele said.
The Belgium-based lab is building a sub-2 nanometer chip pilot line, using funding of 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) from the European Union's act, to give European tech firms access to manufacturing technology that would otherwise be economically unattainable.
The research organisation is closely associated with top lithography equipment maker ASML, which was founded the same year across the nearby Dutch border, in Veldhoven.

The severity of the drop probably changes the investment thesis on the stock. As the leading independent self-service platform for buying digital ad space, it offers a competitive advantage over large advertisers like Alphabet or Amazon, which hold biases toward their platforms.
Given the pace of its growth and the severity of its stock decline, investors have likely turned overly pessimistic on the stock, and here's why.
What happened to The Trade Desk
This year, The Trade Desk has become a tale of disappointing earnings reports. It started in February, when the stock lost most of its value after missing its own revenue estimate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
The stock plummeted, but a recovery accompanied by a favorable earnings report the next quarter helped it recover some of its lost value. However, The Trade Desk took another hit after announcing results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 in August. Concerns about tariffs pressuring large customers and rising competition from the likes of Google and Amazon weighed on the stock.
More recently, investors have found growing dissatisfaction with The Trade Desk's artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Kokai. A confusing interface and the removal of popular features from the old platform Solimar disappointed both users and investors. It was also unclear whether the company had forced users to adopt Kokai or would still allow them to continue using Solimar, making it more difficult for customers to do business with The Trade Desk.
Fortunately, The Trade Desk has moved to address this concern and has partially removed an unpopular interface from Kokai. The company has also moved to address the worries of investors, reporting that over 70% of client spend is now on Kokai as of the second quarter of 2025.
What the financials say
Nonetheless, the financials continue to point to unappreciated strength in The Trade Desk, though revenue growth has decelerated. In the first half of 2025, revenue of over $1.3 billion increased by 22% compared to the same period in 2024. While still a robust growth rate, the rise in revenue was down from the 27% increase it experienced in the previous year.
During that time, costs and expenses almost kept pace with revenue growth. Additionally, a much higher income tax expense resulted in $141 million in net income for the first half of the year, rising 21% yearly.
Indeed, the projected revenue increase of 14% for Q3 is down from prior quarters and could point to continued struggles with the platform. Nonetheless, analyst estimates point to 17% revenue growth in both 2025 and 2026, indicating the company has offered overly conservative guidance. Also, the aforementioned 60% decline in the stock price likely prices in the slowing revenue growth.
Still, the lower stock price has probably helped abate prior concerns about The Trade Desk's valuation. Although its 56 P/E ratio may seem high, it is down from 150 at the beginning of the year, placing its earnings multiple at a multiyear low. Moreover, with rising earnings pushing its forward P/E ratio down to 26, one could argue The Trade Desk is falling into value stock territory.
Buy The Trade Desk stock
Given The Trade Desk's valuation and the opportunity in the digital ad market, the stock looks increasingly like a buy.
Admittedly, the market had likely overvalued The Trade Desk stock at the beginning of the year. As a stock priced for perfection, it had nowhere to go but down as it missed a revenue target in Q4 and dealt with customer dissatisfaction over the Kokai rollout.
Nonetheless, The Trade Desk still stands at the forefront of an opportunity in the digital ad market. As it continues to address some of the competitive and operational concerns, its low valuation and continued growth appear to have made this stock a more compelling buy."

In some cases, these are relatively new companies, while in other cases, they are established big tech stocks.
Focusing on the big tech stocks (because they're better positioned for longevity in most cases), there's one stock that sticks out as one of the best AI bargains on the market: Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%). At the time of writing, Alphabet is trading at 26.3 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months -- which is the cheapest of all the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.
Valuation alone doesn't make a stock a buy, but it does give it more upside than downside. There isn't as much growth and expectation priced into the stock, which could help guard against sharp pullbacks if those expectations aren't met.
Aside from just its valuation, Alphabet sticks out because it operates in many critical parts of the AI pipeline. Its subsidiary, DeepMind, handles AI research. It owns and operates dozens of data centers (which are needed to train and scale AI), and it has consumer AI applications, such as its generative AI tool, Gemini, and Flow, its filmmaking tool.
Being involved in the various parts of the AI pipeline is beneficial for Alphabet, because it has more control over innovation and integration and is less reliant on others."

The quantum computing threat to Bitcoin may be more urgent than some think, according to Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko.
""I feel like 50/50, within five years, there is a quantum breakthrough,"" Yakovenko said at the All-In Summit 2025 earlier this month. ""We should migrate Bitcoin to a quantum-resistant signature scheme.""
The debate over quantum computing’s potential threat to Bitcoin has intensified recently, spurred by advances such as Google’s Willow. The fear is that quantum computers will soon be able to run Shor's algorithm, which is widely believed to have the potential to break encryption systems, such as elliptic curve cryptography. Elliptic curve cryptography secures Bitcoin wallets.

While some argue that the threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography remains distant, Yakovenko cautions that the rate of AI advancement suggests otherwise.
""I would try to encourage folks to speed things up,"" he said, stressing that ideas were moving from research paper to implementation at an ""astounding"" rate. He also pointed to Google and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) moving to quantum-resistant stacks as a sign of the times.
But it will likely not be as easy for Bitcoin to upgrade as it is for Google and Apple. Bitcoin does not have the centralized management of Google and Apple. The network also lacks an established governance structure and a recognized development team that can push upgrades like most other blockchains.
The network’s less structured governance means that determining consensus on upgrades is challenging. While this ensures that the network is more reliable and adds to its decentralization lore, it can arguably be a handicap in urgent situations.

While Yakovenko warned of the risks posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin, he still hailed the network for its resilience against current threats.
""I think Bitcoin is resilient to these entities collapsing,"" he said in response to questions raised about how a collapse of Bitcoin treasury firms such as MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) could affect the asset. These firms have accumulated substantial amounts of BTC using several leverage strategies, sparking sustainability fears and questions about the potential market impact if they collapse."

Globant has experienced a remarkable journey from its origins as a small Argentine startup in 2003 to a global digital services leader, only to face a sharp decline amid broader industry headwinds. Founded by four friends during Argentina’s economic crisis, the company leveraged local talent to serve international clients, achieving a landmark NYSE IPO in 2014. Its early growth was fueled by marquee clients such as Google, Electronic Arts, and Santander, alongside an innovative operating model built around “Studios” and “Pods,” allowing specialized, agile teams to deliver complex digital solutions. Over the years, Globant expanded into diverse industries finance, media, travel, gaming, and hospitality, offering services ranging from AI and cloud implementation to enterprise platforms and digital marketing, while maintaining a decentralized Argentine workforce and a distinctive corporate culture emphasizing innovation and employee engagement.
By 2025, however, the company’s meteoric growth has slowed dramatically, with Q2 revenues up only 4.5% year-on-year and industry-wide pressures, including economic uncertainty and post-pandemic normalization, weighing heavily. Generative AI, while offering efficiency gains through tools like Augmented Coding and AI Pods, poses a dual challenge by potentially reducing demand for human coders and compressing margins. Competition has intensified as peers such as EPAM, Endava, Accenture, and TCS aggressively invest in similar AI capabilities, eroding Globant’s differentiation. High stock-based compensation, once a tool to align employees, now exacerbates dilution amid tight margins, highlighting the tension between growth incentives and shareholder value.
Despite these challenges, Globant retains significant capabilities, a diversified client base, and a reputation for delivering high-value digital transformation projects. While short- to medium-term recovery is plausible, sustaining long-term differentiation and navigating AI-driven industry changes remain critical questions for investors assessing the company’s risk-reward profile.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Accenture plc (ACN) by Sanjiv in December 2024, which highlighted the company’s scale in consulting and managed services, strong free cash flow, operational efficiency, and leadership in cloud and generative AI adoption. The company's stock price has depreciated approximately by 32.62% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as ACN remains a defensive yet innovative player. Javier Pérez shares a similar perspective but emphasizes Globant’s Argentine origins and AI-driven challenges."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-28T22:36:00,Prediction: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia and Palantir Combined by 2030,Alphabet could become the largest company in the world in the next five years.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=279da7915e2c30b20fb2e2bdfc1b642815f9fa249b9ab4d3d3504ebf9f6ac98a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,fool.com,200.0,,"Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%) has become one of the world's most important artificial intelligence (AI) companies. What investors initially saw as a big potential risk has instead turned into a big tailwind.
And while Nvidia and Palantir Technologies get plenty of the hype these days, Alphabet has the opportunity to be worth more than both of them combined before the decade is out.
Nvidia currently sits at a $4.3 trillion market cap, while Palantir is around $425 billion. Alphabet is valued at roughly $3 trillion, but it has a real chance to grow significantly from here, while the other two face some risks.
Alphabet's opportunities
Alphabet's opportunities start with search and AI, which in some cases are melding into one. The company already owns the front door to the internet for billions of people, and most users don't even think about it because Google is just the default engine on most devices.
Its ownership of the Chrome web browser and Android operating system, together with its revenue-sharing agreement with Apple, gives it a huge distribution advantage.
AI, meanwhile, is not replacing search; it's enhancing it and complementing it. Alphabet says its AI Overviews are now being used by more than 2 billion people a month, and its new AI Mode, which is now just being rolled out globally, allows users to toggle between traditional results and chatbot-style answers without switching apps.
It has also added multimodal AI features like Lens and Circle to search. These are just leading to more queries, often with a commercial intent from shoppers, which feeds into its massive ad network.
This kind of seamless integration means the company doesn't need to rewire consumer habits the way competitors do; it only needs to make the products that people already use more useful. The fact that its Gemini app passed ChatGPT as the most downloaded app in the Apple App Store shows that the company is gaining real traction in AI on the consumer side.
Then there is Alphabet's biggest growth driver, its cloud computing business. The company is seeing both strong revenue growth and huge operating leverage as it scales up. This was seen last quarter when Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% and operating profit more than doubled.
What sets Alphabet apart in cloud computing is that it owns the full stack, from its world-class Gemini AI model to custom AI chips, to top-notch analytics and software, to one of the largest private fiber networks in the world. That vertical integration means better performance at lower costs. The company's pending acquisition of Wiz will also give it a huge opportunity to cross-sell leading cloud cybersecurity to its customers.
Investors should also remember Waymo, which could become one of its biggest growth drivers in the next five years. Robotaxis have been hyped for years, and with Waymo, Alphabet is currently building out a large fleet across the U.S.
It has a first-mover advantage with commercial services running in several major U.S. cities, while being tested in others. If autonomous driving takes off in the next five years, Waymo could become another huge business.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's stock is one of the cheapest among megacaps, at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of less than 23 times 2026 analyst estimates. Between its growth opportunities and the potential for multiple expansion, the shares could have a lot of upside in the next five years.
Palantir and Nvidia face risks
Now contrast that with Palantir. It has been executing well, with its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in high demand from U.S. commercial customers, while it is continuing to win big government contracts.
However, the stock's valuation is at nosebleed levels. With a forward price-to-sales multiple (P/S) of more than 100, the stock would still be expensive even if it that figure were cut in half. This is a valuation that leaves no margin for error; one slipup on growth, and the stock will get punished.
And then there is Nvidia. Undoubtedly, it has been the biggest winner in the AI boom, but investors should not forget it is still a hardware company. Hardware sales are not recurring revenue, since every chip sold has to be replaced by the next cycle of spending, and once customers find a cheaper or more efficient solution, the shift can happen fast.
We've seen this happen before. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) were once the primary chips used in Bitcoin mining until ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that did the job faster and cheaper came along. Practically overnight, mining Bitcoin with GPUs became irrelevant.
While ASICs aren't likely to completely replace GPUs for AI workloads, they are a rising threat, especially as the market moves more toward inference, which is a continuous cost -- and hyperscalers (companies that own large data centers) are highly motivated to lower computing costs. With inference not nearly as technically demanding as training, Nvidia's CUDA software moat is not as wide in this area, and more and more large companies have started developing their own custom AI chips.
Nvidia knows this, which is why its recently-announced $100 billion OpenAI partnership looks more defensive than offensive. OpenAI is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, but it has also been developing its own chips. With this investment, Nvidia is effectively paying to keep OpenAI tied to its GPUs, which is a risky kind of circular financing that echoes what Cisco did during the internet bubble.
Nvidia's dominance in AI infrastructure today is unquestioned, but the upside in the stock could be limited if customers keep moving toward in-house AI chips.
Put it all together, and Alphabet looks like the company best positioned to become the largest in the world by 2030, with a good chance of being bigger than both Nvidia and Palantir combined."

On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.
Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI
This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.
It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.
The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.
OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs."

Constellation Energy Group (CEG), headquartered in Baltimore, is the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in the U.S., with 32 GW of capacity—70% from nuclear and the balance from natural gas, hydro, wind, solar, and storage. Its nuclear fleet alone provides ~20% of all U.S. nuclear generation, making it the single largest source of carbon-free power in the country. CEG counts hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google among its key customers and recently announced a 20-year deal with Meta beginning in 2027.
The company also expects to close its acquisition of Calpine in Q4 2025 and has authorized a $400 million share repurchase program, reflecting strong capital allocation discipline. In Q2, revenue grew 11.3% to $6.1 billion, while GAAP EPS rose 3.5% to $2.67. Nuclear output declined modestly to 45,170 GWh due to unplanned outages, but CEG continues to operate at a 94% capacity factor, underpinned by heavy investment in digital optimization through AI dispatch systems and digital twin modeling, which are designed to enhance margins and operational efficiency.
Growth prospects are further supported by secular demand from AI, electrification, and reshoring, alongside favorable policy tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act. While CEG trades cheaply on sales, its 33.8x 2025 EPS multiple is elevated relative to peers like NextEra, Duke, and Southern, though its scale and carbon-free focus justify a premium. With EPS growth forecast at 9.1% in FY25 and 18% in FY26, CEG offers a compelling combination of stability, growth, and strategic positioning in clean energy despite near-term technical downside risks.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG) by jackandjillonthehill in March 2025, which highlighted margin expansion, strong ROE, and undervaluation despite nuclear power volatility. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 47% since our coverage. This is because rising demand and higher pricing played out. The thesis still stands as Oliver | MMMT Wealth shares a similar but emphasizes on strategic growth drivers.
Constellation Energy Corporation is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 79 hedge fund portfolios held CEG at the end of the second quarter which was 83 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

As enterprises rush to embed AI into their workflows — whether through vibe coding, AI agent integration, or new tooling — the attack surface is expanding. AI helps developers ship code faster, but that speed often comes with shortcuts and mistakes, creating new openings for attackers.
Wiz, which was acquired by Google earlier this year for $32 billion, conducted tests recently, says Luttwak, and found that a common issue in vibe coded applications was insecure implementation of the authentication — the system that verifies a user’s identity and ensures they’re not an attacker.
“That happened because it was just easier to build like that,” he said. “Vibe coding agents do what you say, and if you didn’t tell them to build it in the most secure way, it won’t.”
Luttwak noted that there’s a constant tradeoff today for companies choosing between being fast and being secure. But developers aren’t the only ones using AI to move faster. Attackers are now using vibe coding, prompt-based techniques, and even their own AI agents to launch exploits, he said.
“You can actually see the attacker is now using prompts to attack,” Luttwak said. “It’s not just the attacker vibe coding. The attacker looks for AI tools that you have and tells them, ‘Send me all your secrets, delete the machine, delete the file.’”
Amid this landscape, attackers are also finding entry points in new AI tools that companies roll out internally to boost efficiency. Luttwak says these integrations can lead to “supply chain attacks.” By compromising a third-party service that has broad access to a company’s infrastructure, attackers can then pivot deeper into corporate systems.
That’s what happened last month when Drift — a startup that sells AI chatbots for sales and marketing — was breached, exposing the Salesforce data of hundreds of enterprise customers like Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, and Google. The attackers gained access to tokens, or digital keys, and used them to impersonate the chatbot, query Salesforce data, and move laterally inside customer environments.
“The attacker pushed the attack code, which was also created using vibe coding,” Luttwak said.
Luttwak says that while enterprise adoption of AI tools is still minimal — he reckons around 1% of enterprises have fully adopted AI — Wiz is already seeing attacks every week that impact thousands of enterprise customers."

Time to Buy?,The tech titan's core growth engines are firing on all cylinders.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=19988235cc90a6a0b376225bc469f926082e4493a423e21ecb4ff1740a0d8469,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/microsoft-stock-keeps-beating-stock-market-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/microsoft-stock-keeps-beating-stock-market-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/microsoft-stock-keeps-beating-stock-market-buy/,fool.com,200.0,,"When Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as Microsoft's (MSFT -0.16%) CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, many investors dismissed the tech giant as a slow-growth stalwart with limited upside potential. But if you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft on Nadella's first day on the job, your investment would be worth $140,000 today and paying out nearly $1,000 in annual dividends.
That same investment in an S&P 500 index fund would only be worth about $38,000 today. Let's see why Microsoft crushed the market -- and if it's still a good stock to buy.
How did Microsoft become a growth stock again?
Under Ballmer, Microsoft struggled to keep pace with Amazon (AMZN -0.48%), Alphabet's Google (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in the mobile and cloud markets. Its Windows and Office products still relied on periodic desktop upgrades, and its Windows Phones couldn't keep up with iPhones and Androids.
But after Nadella took over, Microsoft adopted an ambitious ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy. It transformed its Office desktop software into cloud-based services, expanded its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, and integrated those upgrades into Windows. It also scrapped its Windows Phone program, launched iOS and Android versions of its top productivity apps, rolled out more Surface devices, and expanded its Xbox business with new products and bold acquisitions.
Microsoft launched more AI services to process all the data that flowed through that sprawling ecosystem. It also started to accumulate a big stake in OpenAI -- the creator of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications -- in 2019. It then integrated OpenAI's tools into its Bing search engine, Azure's cloud platform, and its Copilot AI services.
Microsoft's aggressive investments in the mobile, cloud, and AI markets initially squeezed its margins. But from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2025 (which ended this June), its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%, its gross margin expanded from 64.7% to 68.8%, and its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 5%. It maintained that momentum even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts rattled the global economy.
Most of Microsoft's recent growth was driven by its cloud-based services. Azure is now the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Office suite -- which was rebranded as Microsoft 365 in 2020 -- holds a near-duopoly in the productivity software market with Google Workspace.
Why will Microsoft keep growing?
From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 15% and 16%, respectively. That robust growth should be driven by the secular expansion of the cloud and AI markets. More companies should migrate their data to its public cloud, hybrid cloud, and edge deployments, while the expansion of its data centers should support the development of even more powerful AI applications across its ecosystem.
Microsoft still faces intense competition from Amazon and Google in the cloud and AI markets, but it will likely draw in big companies that compete against those two tech giants in the e-commerce, streaming media, and digital advertising markets. Its Xbox gaming business, which absorbed Activision Blizzard and many other top game publishers, could also generate more recurring revenues with its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming services. The company also still held $94.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2025. That gives it plenty of room to expand its business via more acquisitions or buy back more shares to boost its EPS.
Is it the right time to buy Microsoft's stock?
Microsoft's stock doesn't look cheap at 33 times this year's earnings, but the robust growth of its cloud and AI businesses might justify that higher valuation. Even if it trades at a more modest 30 times forward earnings and it merely matches analysts' expectations through fiscal 2028, its stock could still rise about 26% to $645 over the next two years.
That return might not dazzle growth-oriented investors, but it would likely keep Microsoft's stock ahead of the S&P 500, which has generated an average annual return of 10% ever since its inception. Therefore, I think it's still a great stock for long-term investors to buy, hold, and forget."

Here’s what went down 25 years ago that ultimately burst the dot-com boom
The comparison between today’s artificial intelligence frenzy and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s has become impossible to ignore. As AI companies command valuations reaching into the hundreds of billions—minting dozens of new billionaires in 2025 alone—and tech giants pour unprecedented sums into data centers, investors and analysts are asking a similar question: Are we watching history repeat itself?
The similarities are striking. Like the internet companies of two decades ago, AI firms today attract massive investments based on transformative potential rather than current profitability. Global corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to research from Stanford University, with the sector growing thirteenfold since 2014. Meanwhile, America’s biggest tech companies—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capital expenditures this year alone, much of it for AI infrastructure.
Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company is valued at approximately $500 billion despite launching ChatGPT just two years ago, acknowledges the parallels. “
Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”
But what actually caused the dot-com bubble to burst in March 2000, and what lessons does it offer for today’s AI boom? Let’s take a stroll down memory lane—or, if you weren’t born yet, some plain ole history.
The perfect storm of 2000
The dot-com crash wasn’t triggered by a single event, but rather a convergence of factors that exposed fundamental weaknesses in the late 1990s tech economy. The first critical blow came from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates multiple times throughout 1999 and 2000. The federal funds rate climbed from around 4.7% in early 1999 to 6.5% by May 2000, making speculative investments less attractive as investors could earn higher returns from safer bonds.
The second catalyst was a broader economic recession that began in Japan in March 2000, triggering global market fears and accelerating the flight from risky assets. This one-two punch of higher rates and global uncertainty caused investors to reassess the astronomical valuations of internet companies.
But the underlying problem ran much deeper: Most dot-com companies had fundamentally flawed business models. Commerce One reached a $21 billion valuation despite minimal revenue. TheGlobe.com, founded by two Cornell students with $15,000 in startup capital, saw its stock price jump 606% on its first day of trading to $63.50, despite having no revenue beyond venture funding. Pets.com burned through $300 million in just 268 days before declaring bankruptcy."

Nvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.
While Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.
In past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.
The extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.
In addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.
Tangled webs of investment
Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently.
The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back."

I suspect that Nvidia, ChatGPT creator OpenAI, or Google parent Alphabet would rank near the top of the list for many investors.
On the other hand, I doubt that Nebius Group (NBIS -1.74%) would be among the most common responses. But maybe it should. This underrated AI stock could be the best growth story of the decade.
""Exciting times""
Nebius' primary focus is on its AI cloud platform. It also operates two subsidiaries: autonomous vehicle technology developer Avride and leading education technology provider TripleTen. In addition, Nebius owns stakes in open-source database platform provider ClickHouse and AI data specialist Toloka.
Arkady Volozh, Nebius' founder and CEO, opened his latest letter to shareholders by stating, ""These are exciting times."" He declared: ""[W]e stand at the brink of the next great leap in technology. To achieve this, we need to build [an] entirely new infrastructure for AI."" Volozh believes that Nebius is one of only a handful of AI hyperscalers with the capability to meet the task at hand.
Nebius is expanding its capacity rapidly to meet the surging demand. In particular, the company is working to secure more than 1 gigawatt of power by the end of 2026. That's critical considering the importance of electricity to power-hungry AI data centers.
This rapid expansion requires a lot of money. Nebius is in a good position on that front as well. It has lined up more than $4 billion in capital. The company's balance sheet should also allow it to pursue additional financing options as needed.
Underrated?
Is Nebius really underrated? There's a good case that it is.
Nebius' share price has nearly quadrupled year to date. That's a much stronger performance than Nvidia has delivered. Nebius has also handily outgained fellow hyperscaler and IPO darling CoreWeave.
The sizzling returns are warranted. Nebius' revenue soared 625% year over year and 106% sequentially in the second quarter of 2025. Although Nvidia and CoreWeave are generating strong revenue growth, neither company is anywhere close to Nebius' pace.
Nebius has landed several marquee customers. Cloudflare and Shopify especially stand out. The AI cloud provider is also winning ground with lots of up-and-coming AI players, such as HeyGen, Lightning.AI, and Photoroom.
But Nebius isn't getting nearly as much attention as other AI leaders. For example, Google Search returns fewer than 1.6 million results mentioning Nebius so far this year. By comparison, CoreWeave has nearly twice as many results. Unsurprisingly, Nvidia has far more (around 119 million).
The best growth story of the decade?
Nebius is already one of the fastest-growing large-cap stocks in 2025. Could it really be the best growth story of the decade? Maybe.
I expect continued explosive demand for AI infrastructure as companies of all sizes scramble to build and deploy AI models. In particular, AI inference should be a huge opportunity. I agree with Volozh's view that Nebius is one of only a few hyperscalers positioned to be the biggest winners from these trends.
Don't overlook the potential for Avride and TripleTen to boost Nebius' growth. In particular, I think Avride has great opportunities in expanding its partnerships to use autonomous robots to deliver orders from restaurants and groceries to customers.
What about Nebius' valuation? The company isn't profitable yet, so we can't use earnings-based valuation metrics. However, Nebius' shares trade at 147 times trailing-12-month sales. But with revenue more than doubling from Q1 to Q2, that sky-high price-to-sales multiple doesn't look nearly as scary.
I won't go out on a limb and predict that Nebius will definitely be the best growth story of the decade. At this point, though, I think it could very well be a contender."

Instead of trying to develop another large language model (LLM), Palantir's platform was developed to make AI models more useful. It pulls together data from multiple sources, organizes it, and ties it to real-world assets. This clean data helps reduce AI hallucinations and makes it more actionable. In essence, AIP has become akin to an AI operating system.
The company is growing fast, with revenue jumping 48% year over year last quarter to hit $1 billion. U.S. commercial sales nearly doubled, while U.S. government revenue climbed more than 50%. Customers are spending more, too, with net dollar retention at 128%, which indicates the platform is sticky and becoming more valuable over time.
Palantir's execution and future opportunities are not the issue for investors; valuation is. The stock trades at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of over 100 times 2025 analyst estimates. Note that this is sales, not earnings, we are talking about. When a stock is priced like this, even the smallest miss on growth can hit shares hard.
I like the company, but that kind of multiple doesn't leave much room for error, and there are other tech names that give you strong potential upside without paying such a premium. Let's look at two to consider.
Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 1.86%) (GOOG 1.86%) is one of the best-positioned companies for AI because it already controls the front door to the internet for billions of people. Most of us already use Google search every day, and sometimes we may not even realize it, because it is the default search engine on most Android and Apple devices.
So while AI is changing the landscape, Alphabet's advantage is that it doesn't need to change consumer behavior, it just needs to make those products better with AI. That's exactly what it is doing with its new AI-powered search features, including AI Overviews, Lens, and Circle to Search. It is also just starting to roll out its new AI mode globally, which is more akin to a traditional AI chatbot. However, users can easily toggle between AI and search modes without having to switch apps. At the same time, its Gemini app recently became the most downloaded app on the Apple App Store, surpassing ChatGPT, showing the strides the company has made in this area.
Alphabet is also building one of the best cloud computing businesses on the planet. It is one of the few companies that owns the complete stack, with its own AI model, custom AI chips, leading data analytics and software, and even its own private fiber network. Its Waymo robotaxi also has huge growth potential as it rapidly expands across the U.S., and it even has made strides in quantum computing with its Willow chip.
The stock hasn't run nearly as far as some of the other AI plays, so you aren't paying up in the same premium as you are with Palantir.
GitLab
GitLab (GTLB -2.41%) is an underrated way to play the growth in AI-driven software development, but don't be mistaken: This is a high-growth company. In fact, it's grown its revenue by between 25% and 35% for eight straight quarters.
What started as a DevSecOps platform is now a full software development lifecycle solution that is helping developers save time. The company has leaned into AI with its Duo AI agent, which helps automate repetitive tasks, freeing up more time for developers to code. This matters because developers only spend around 20% of their time coding, so any tool that frees them up to write more code is going to drive productivity, and thus demand for its solution.
AI hasn't hurt GitLab; if anything, it has sped up the pace of software development, which benefits the company. If you look at the growth of cloud computing, much of that is around AI software development, which lands right in GitLab's wheelhouse. The company is partnered with both Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS), so it is benefiting from this growth. Enterprise clients are spending more, and its customers are also moving up to higher-tier plans.
What is most exciting about the GitLab story, though, is its shift to a hybrid seat-plus-usage pricing model. The usage component helps protect the company if AI eventually does lead to fewer coders, while at the same time giving it more growth potential. For investors looking for an AI play that is still reasonably priced with a long runway of growth, GitLab is worth a close look."

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the AI Stocks Every Investor Should Watch. On September 24, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan reiterated a Neutral rating and $201.00 price target on the stock. The rating update follows Alphabet’s recent strategic product launches.
In the three weeks since the remedy ruling, Google has unveiled several product launches and integrations aimed at boosting the adoption of Gemini. The most notable has been Gemini’s integration into Chrome for Mac and Windows desktop users. iOS support is also coming soon.
Given Chrome’s 4 billion monthly users, 70% market share on desktops, and 35% contribution to search revenue, it is going to be a major distribution channel for AI adoption.
Moreover, even though Gemini’s monthly active users are currently less than 10% of total Chrome users, the firm anticipates Alphabet to promote the AI assistant within the browser to drive adoption aggressively.

The firm also highlighted how data from OpenAI has shown that ChatGPT users perform an average of 3.5 queries daily. This is similar to the roughly 3 search queries performed on Google Search worldwide (excluding China).
This implies that AI assistants could achieve comparable engagement levels over time.
“With over 4B MAUs and 70% market share on desktops, Chrome has historically been a powerful distribution channel for GOOGL offerings. Chrome accounts for ~35% of total search revenue overall. This integration brings advanced AI experiences of Gemini, including agentic browsing, context search, and cross tab interactions, to search users directly from the Chrome browser. The discovery of the Gemini icon on the browser is still less than ideal, but we expect GOOGL to merchandise Gemini on Chrome aggressively – which should help adoption. Gemini MAU still represents <10% of the total Chrome MAUs. Additionally, recent data from OpenAI indicates an average WAU performs ~3.5 queries daily on ChatGPT, consistent with the average of ~3 search queries on GOOGL search worldwide (ex-China) – which indicates that AI assistants could achieve search type of engagement or higher over time. As such, we think GOOGL is well positioned to see search query acceleration over next few quarters from several factors, including coverage growth of AI overviews and Gemini integrations inside existing apps.”

During a recent conversation on The Tennessee Holler podcast, Cuban stated that tech moguls like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Michael Dell are embroiled in an AI rivalry. This competition is not just between US firms and China, but also within the Silicon Valley behemoths themselves.
“There is a war to win AI. There’s one war between us and the rest of the world, particularly China,” Cuban said.
He further contended that this rivalry is the driving force behind these tech leaders’ readiness to align with Trump, despite facing backlash.
“So why did all these guys — Zuckerberg, Elon, Michael Dell, etc. get on their knees, and why did they get especially gold-crusted knee pads when they went to the White House?” Cuban asked.
According to Cuban, while Trump’s term may be short-lived, AI supremacy could influence future generations. “Donald Trump, hopefully, is only going to be here less than four years, and he’s gone, but AI is going to keep on going,” Cuban expressed.
At a recent dinner in the White House Rose Garden, several tech leaders openly commended Trump. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman and Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai praised Trump’s pro-business approach, while Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook expressed gratitude for creating a favorable investment climate.
“Donald Trump, hopefully, is only going to be here less than four years, and he’s gone, but AI is going to keep on going,” Cuban added.
The race for AI dominance is a critical factor in shaping the future of technology and global power dynamics. As such, the support of Trump by Big Tech, as highlighted by Cuban, underscores the significance of this race."

Last month, the nation launched its most ambitious sovereign AI initiative to date, pledging ₩530 billion, (about $390 million), to five local companies building large-scale foundational models.
The move underscores Seoul’s desire to cut reliance on foreign AI technologies, hoping to strengthen national security and keep a tighter control over data in the AI era.
The organizations picked by the Ministry of Science and ICT to compete were LG AI Research, SK Telecom, Naver Cloud, NC AI, and the startup Upstage.
Every six months, the government will review the first cohort’s progress, cut underperformers, and continue funding the frontrunners until just two remain to lead the country’s sovereign AI drive.
Each player is bringing a different advantage to South Korea’s AI race. TechCrunch spoke with several of the selected companies about how they plan to take on OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and the rest on their home turf. NC AI declined to comment.
LG AI Research: Exaone
LG AI Research, the R&D unit of South Korean giant LG Group, offers Exaone 4.0, a hybrid reasoning AI model. The latest version blends broad language processing with the advanced reasoning features first introduced in the company’s earlier Exaone Deep model.
Exaone 4.0 (32B) already scores reasonably well against competitors on Artificial Analysis’s Intelligence Index benchmark (as does Upstage’s Solar Pro2). But it plans to improve and move up the ranks through its deep access to real-world industry data ranging from biotech to advanced materials and manufacturing.
It’s coupling that data with a focus on refining the data before feeding to the models to train. Instead of chasing sheer scale, LG wants to make the entire process more intelligent, so its AI can deliver real, practical value that goes beyond what general-purpose models can offer. “This is our fundamental approach,” co-head Honglak Lee told TechCrunch.
LG is improving its models via familiar tactics: offering them through APIs, then using the real-world data generated by users of those services to train the model to improve.
“As LG’s models improve, our partners can deliver better services, which in turn generate greater economic value and even richer data,” he said.
However, instead of chasing massive GPU clusters, LG AI Research is focusing on efficiency, getting the most out of every chip, and creating industry-specific models, he mentioned. The goal isn’t to outspend the global giants but to outsmart them with high-performing, yet more efficient, AI."

The move was driven by Donald Trump’s bombshell announcement that America’s H-1B visa programme would come with a new $100,000 (£75,000) fee, triggering panic among Silicon Valley bosses.
After the surprise move, Google, Microsoft and Amazon quickly sent emails to staff members urging them not to leave the country or to return immediately if they were abroad. That left staff seeking to remain on US soil or boarding flights overseas to return to America.
The White House later clarified that the fee would be a one-time payment only for new applicants, and would not be imposed on America’s 1.2 million existing H-1B holders and their dependants.
But the change is still seismic.
“I’ve never seen anything this big or impactful in terms of intentional government regulation or policy [for the tech industry], not even close,” says Ethan Evans, a former Amazon executive who now works advising start-ups.
Analysts warn it will hammer America’s start-ups, drive tech-hiring offshore and threaten growth in the sector that has become the key engine of the American economy.
Shantanu Gangal, the chief executive of Prodigal, an artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is already exploring the potential for hiring overseas.
He and his co-founder have contacted more than 120 applicants seeking jobs at Prodigal to tell them that their company is still hiring.
“We are reaching out to candidates who might consider going back from the US to India,” says Gangal.
For a few particularly specialised roles, the company may simply swallow the costs of the new visas, says Gangal. “But the $100,000 fee will eliminate some roles and make them completely unviable.”
Big tech’s big problem
H-1Bs are the most commonly used visas for companies bringing in highly skilled foreign workers and they are crucial for the tech industry.
In theory there is a cap of 85,000 on the total number of H-1Bs that can be issued each year, but non-profit educational and research organisations are exempt from this. Last year, the US issued 142,000 new H-1B visas and renewed an additional 257,000.
The vast majority are concentrated in Silicon Valley, with nearly two thirds of H-1B petitions in computer-related occupations.
This year, California has received more than double the number of approved H-1Bs than any other state.
More than 7,500 different companies in the state have used the scheme this year, according to US citizenship and immigration services (USCIS)."

With enough time, even modest sums invested regularly can grow significantly and help people become rich -- or at least significantly richer -- by the time they are ready to leave the workforce. However, it's crucial to invest your money in the right stocks, as many will destroy their shareholders' wealth or lag behind the broader market.
Two companies that are worth serious consideration are Shopify (SHOP 2.71%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%). These growth stocks could double in value over the next five years, delivering a compound annual growth rate of 14.9%. And even beyond the end of the decade, Shopify and Alphabet have excellent prospects.
1. Shopify
After a major pullback about four years ago, Shopify is back to its market-beating ways. The e-commerce specialist has outperformed broader equities since late 2022, and some signs suggest it could continue to maintain that momentum. Shopify established itself as a leader in its niche of helping merchants set up and run online stores. It has a market share of more than 12% by gross merchandise volume (GMV).
The e-commerce industry is expected to continue growing rapidly through the end of the decade, according to projections. Shopify generates revenue through subscription services, whereby merchants pay recurring fees for access to its platform. Then there is Shopify's merchant solutions, a suite of services it offers, including lending, payment processing, shipping, and others. As the company's ecosystem grows, it will generate more money through subscription fees. However, this will also lead to more transactions, higher GMV, and increased revenue from merchant solutions for the company.
Furthermore, Shopify has moved closer than ever to profitability, thanks to several key business changes that helped boost its margin. The company should achieve consistent profitability by the end of the decade.
These factors explain why Shopify is on a roll, and given its prospects, there is a good chance it can double investors' capital by 2030. What about the company's prospects beyond that? An important long-term tailwind for the company could be international expansion.
Shopify still generates the majority of its revenue from its U.S. operations. Nothing wrong with that, since the U.S. e-commerce market accounted for just 16.3% of total retail sales in the country as of the second quarter.
So, there is ample whitespace here, but there is less penetration into the industry in most of the 175 countries where Shopify has a presence. That should provide Shopify with ample growth fuel and help jump-start its goal of becoming a 100-year company. Investors who stick along for the ride could see massive returns over the long run.
2. Alphabet
Alphabet has recently eliminated one of its biggest threats. After a loss in an antitrust case, the company feared the worst possible outcome: A judge forcing it to divest its Chrome browser, which is central to its billion-dollar advertising business. Fortunately, Alphabet avoided that fate, and although there were some sanctions, in the grand scheme of things, they were pretty light.
Alphabet was underperforming the market this year, despite strong financial results, due to this risk hovering above its head. In the second quarter, Alphabet's revenue increased 14% year over year to $96.4 billion. The company's earnings per share increased by approximately 22% to $2.31.
The tech leader is now in an even better position to benefit from its work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), which should be powerful tailwinds in the next five years. In the second quarter, Google Cloud revenue grew much faster than the rest of the business, by 32% year over year to $13.6 billion. Strong demand for AI-related services is helping power that.
Meanwhile, Alphabet has strengthened its advertising business, also thanks to the use of AI. The company's AI overviews and AI mode in search are helping it compete with chatbots, and it is doing so successfully. Alphabet cloud and AI businesses should drive strong top-line growth in the next few years. And since it's early in the AI revolution, this could prove to be a powerful tailwind for Alphabet for years to come.
The company has several other long-term opportunities, including its autonomous vehicle business, Waymo. Although this segment is, for now, inconsequential to Alphabet's results, self-driving cars are slowly gaining traction and could, one day, become the norm, something that the tech giant will likely benefit from down the road. In short, Alphabet is a leader in advertising, cloud computing, and AI, three businesses that should help it perform well through the end of the decade and beyond, especially now that it won't have to deal with the loss of its Chrome browser.
Other potential growth opportunities, such as robotic cars, also contribute to its long-term prospects. The stock could double by 2030 and continue delivering excellent returns beyond that."

By identifying and investing in these companies, you can shift your focus to other stocks while just letting these safe choices do their thing. However, investors must identify a trend that allows these companies to succeed over the long term; otherwise, they could turn out to be losing picks.
Three stocks that I think are worth buying and holding forever are Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%), Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.48%). These three are all considered AI hyperscalers, but they're benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI) through another important business segment: cloud computing.
The boom in cloud computing
Cloud computing is a genius business model, and all three of these tech giants have a thriving operation in it. Most companies don't want to spend huge amounts on computing power or storage. And upkeep on this equipment can be expensive and require specialists. So instead of having to build huge computing capacity, many companies choose to rent it from cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The business model for cloud computing providers is extremely simple: build out capacity and rent it out for more than it costs to build and operate. All three companies have mastered this model and are seeing great results.
AWS is the largest cloud provider, although it's growing the slowest, so that gap is closing. In the second quarter, AWS grew 17% to $30.9 billion and made up 18% of Amazon's total revenue. However, it's a huge income source: It generated 53% of Amazon's total operating profits.
With AWS making up the majority of Amazon's profits while growing faster than its e-commerce business, the cloud segment will continue to become a larger part of the parent company with each year, further transforming it from an e-commerce play to a cloud computing play.
Google Cloud was the last of the three primary cloud services to enter that arena, so it's behind the other two. But it's still doing phenomenally well. Its revenue increased 32% year over year to $13.6 billion in the second quarter, and its operating margin increased to 21%.
Google Cloud is one of Alphabet's fastest-growing segments, and with huge computing demand still emerging, it's a trend that will boost the company's stock over the long term.
Microsoft, in second place in cloud market share with Azure, is growing the fastest of this trio. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending June 30), Azure's revenue rose 39% year over year.
Unfortunately for investors, Microsoft doesn't break out the exact revenue total for this division, so investors are kept guessing how much it generates. However, we still know it's less than AWS, as the divisions that Azure is within (Intelligent Cloud) produced $29.9 billion in revenue, below AWS' total. Still, with continued elevated growth, Azure could surpass AWS as the cloud computing leader soon.
Cloud computing is a quickly expanding business
Clearly, cloud computing is doing well right now, but will that continue?
Once a company has moved to the cloud, it's hard to go back. This creates high switching costs for clients, essentially locking them in for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, cloud computing is a huge part of how AI is being deployed. Few companies are building AI capacity on-premise, and these three are building huge AI data centers to meet computing demand from their clients.
With two major tailwinds blowing in cloud computing's favor (general workloads and AI workloads), it's no surprise that third-party market projections think the business will soar over the next few years. Grand View Research estimates that the cloud market in 2024 was about $752 billion. However, it's expected to rise to $2.39 trillion by 2030.
That's monster growth, and because companies are always launching new workloads, it means continued growth even after these five years.
Cloud computing is an excellent segment to invest in, and this trio is the best way to do it. I think buying all three and holding them forever is a smart idea since they have what it takes to provide long-term market-beating returns."

Even though the market is trading near all-time highs, there are still plenty of stocks with good upside from here.
Let's look at three stocks with huge growth opportunities still in front of them that could soar by 2028.
1. Broadcom
As the AI market starts to shift toward inference, Broadcom (AVGO 1.97%) is in great shape. Companies don't want to be totally reliant on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), so they are increasingly turning to Broadcom to help them develop custom AI chips. Custom AI chips are particularly useful for inference, given inference's comparative simplicity versus training and ongoing costs. This makes custom chips that can run inference workloads at a lower cost a great alternative for large hyperscalers (companies that own massive data centers).
Broadcom has already helped Alphabet (GOOGL 1.86%) (GOOG 1.86%) design its tensor processing units (TPUs), and that win led to Meta Platforms and ByteDance also becoming customers. Broadcom has said those three alone could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity by fiscal 2027, which is more than double the total revenue it will generate in fiscal 2025.
However, it doesn't end there. A fourth customer, widely believed to be OpenAI, has already placed a $10 billion order for next year. OpenAI and Oracle are talking about spending $300 billion on data centers in the coming years, so Broadcom has a big opportunity if it can win even just a small slice of this business. Apple is also reportedly working on AI chips with Broadcom, which could be another needle mover.
Given its massive opportunity in custom AI chips over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could trade much higher by 2028.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Another company poised to benefit from the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout over the next few years is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.36%). It's the only foundry that can consistently manufacture advanced chips at scale with strong yields. Intel has tried to catch up for years and is still losing money in its foundry business, while Samsung has stumbled with yields and even lost Google's Tensor G5 production to TSMC.
TSMC's success comes from its ability to manufacture chips at small node sizes while getting strong yields. Shrinking node sizes is important for advanced chips, like GPUs, as it increases the number of transistors that can fit on a chip, which makes them more powerful and energy efficient. Meanwhile, manufacturers need a high percentage of the chips they make to be defect-free. A higher yield means a lower cost per chip and a greater number of usable chips from each production run.
This ability has led TSMC to become a critical partner to chip designers and also given it strong pricing power. It currently projects that AI chip demand will grow at a more than 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. It will reportedly raise prices by up to 10% next year, which will be another growth driver on top of strong demand.
TSMC is the one company every major chip designer has to use to get chips made. It is basically selling shovels in a gold rush, which makes it a strong stock to own over the next few years.
3. Alphabet
Alphabet has managed to turn what many thought was a big risk into a growth driver. People worried that AI chatbots would hurt Google Search, but search growth actually picked up last quarter, and new AI features are leading to more search queries. Meanwhile, its Gemini AI chatbot is gaining steam, with the Gemini app recently becoming the most downloaded app on the Apple App Store, surpassing ChatGPT.
Meanwhile, the biggest risk the stock faced is now behind it. Despite losing its antitrust case to the Department of Justice, a federal judge allowed the company to not only keep its Chrome browser and Android operating system, but also the main tenets of its search deal with Apple in place. This means Alphabet still controls the main gateways to the internet for billions of users.
Google's biggest growth driver, though, is cloud computing. Alphabet is one of the few companies with its own AI models, custom chips, and cloud infrastructure, which should help margins over time. This vertical integration should become a significant advantage in the coming years.
Meanwhile, its Waymo robotaxi business is expanding rapidly throughout the U.S. and could become a big contributor over the next few years. This is a significant opportunity that often gets overlooked by investors.
Overall, Alphabet is set up well to see strong growth through 2028 and beyond, and its stock has a lot of potential upside over the next few years."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-27T08:14:00,"With Alphabet's Biggest Fear Relieved, Is Its Stock Due for a Big Rally?","Alphabet's stock looks relatively cheap compared to the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=aee26111330bd978229eeebfe45924926544a15276510183d5b926773633618c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/with-alphabets-biggest-fear-relieved-is-its-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/with-alphabets-biggest-fear-relieved-is-its-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/with-alphabets-biggest-fear-relieved-is-its-stock/,fool.com,200.0,,"Whenever a publicly traded business faces a big risk or unknown, that can weigh on its valuation. For Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%), the tech giant that owns Google and YouTube, the big concern recently was that antitrust lawsuits would result in it being forced to sell off key parts of its business.
Although Judge Amit P. Mehta did rule earlier this month that the company has operated a monopoly in search, he did not impose the most severe consequences that federal regulators had asked for. Alphabet still faces a different antitrust case involving its ad tech, but investors were most worried about the possibility of it having to sell its Chrome browser or Android operating system. With those remedies apparently off the table, the stock rallied over the past few weeks. But was that just the start? Can it soar even higher?
Alphabet is among the cheapest stocks in the ""Magnificent Seven""
For a while now, Alphabet has been trading at a discounted valuation relative to its earnings. It hasn't been uncommon for it to trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple below 20, which is low when you consider the average stock on the S&P 500 trades at more than 25 times its trailing earnings.
Alphabet has routinely been one of the most undervalued ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, and although it has been rallying recently, it's still the cheapest stock based on its P/E multiple, which currently sits at around 27.
Alphabet's relatively modest valuation could attract interest from investors who are looking for potentially underrated artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, especially when you consider its growth potential.
A terrific company with stellar growth prospects
Many investors have been worried about Alphabet's growth outlook, fearing the potential of AI chatbots to divert traffic away from websites and search products, which would cut into its ad revenue. Yet despite the rise of this new tech, its business has continued to generate solid results. Through the first half of 2025, Alphabet generated revenue of $186.7 billion, an increase of 13% from the same period last year. And its net income rose by 33% to $62.7 billion.
What's most exciting about the business, however, is what lies ahead. Its own AI chatbot, Gemini, has around 400 million monthly users. The huge advantage the company has over others in the AI space is that it can train its models on YouTube videos. Its video-generation model, Veo 3, features cutting-edge capabilities that make it easy to make AI-powered videos that are virtually indistinguishable from real videos. AI isn't a risk for Alphabet -- it's a massive opportunity.
And then there are its self-driving Waymo vehicles. Alphabet continues to expand its autonomous taxi business into new markets. Earlier this year, Waymo hit 10 million robotaxi trips, and there's a lot more growth to come. I've taken a couple of Waymo rides and can see that there's tremendous potential for this business.
Alphabet has a wealth of growth opportunities, which is why I believe that even if it had to sell off some parts of its business, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing for shareholders. Such a result could help it unlock a lot of value, and might result in investors looking more closely at the true worth of its individual business units.
Alphabet's market cap recently hit $3 trillion, and year to date, its shares are up over 30%. But there could be far more upside for the tech company in the long run, given how plentiful its growth opportunities are and how relatively undervalued it still is. For long-term investors, Alphabet should be a no-brainer growth stock to load up on right now."

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.
“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.
Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.
BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”
“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.
Deals are in the works
In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.
Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.
However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.
Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.
Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power."

You don't see them, yet they're the brains that power almost every electronic device that we interact with daily. And there's nobody better at manufacturing semiconductors than the appropriately named Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 3.33%), also known as TSMC.
TSMC is the world's leading semiconductor foundry by a large margin. It has around a 70% market share, while second-place Samsung's market share is only around 7%. The foundry model means that TSMC doesn't make chips for general sale. Instead, companies will design the chips they need for their products, and TSMC will use its manufacturing ability to bring them to life.
At the time of this writing, TSMC's market cap is around $1.4 trillion. To hit the $2 trillion mark by 2028, it would need to average around 14% annual returns over the next few years. You should never use past performances to predict future ones, but given the company's growth prospects and its 29% average annual returns over the past decade, I'm confident it can happen.
TSMC's role in the AI ecosystem
TSMC isn't your typical artificial intelligence (AI) stock in the sense that it has a generative AI app or other software people interact with. Yet its role in the AI ecosystem is as important as almost any stock you can name.
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Alphabet all design chips and other hardware that power data centers, which are essentially the backbones of training and developing AI models. Yet most of this wouldn't be possible without TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability.
When it comes to manufacturing advanced AI chips, TSMC is essentially the only go-to. Without it, you could make a valid argument that data centers would be less efficient, which means that AI training would be less efficient, which means many of the AI applications we interact with today would be less capable and scalable.
TSMC is improving its profit and margins
TSMC has long been an impressive moneymaker, but it has stepped it up a lot in the past few years. In the second quarter, it made $30 billion in revenue, which was up 44% year over year and close to 18% higher than the first quarter. If its third-quarter revenue falls between $31.8 billion and $33 billion, as it predicts, that will represent between 35% and 40% year-over-year growth.
In Nvidia's latest earnings report, it noted that it expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure through 2030. With TSMC being a key part of AI infrastructure, this should be music to the company's ears.
The revenue growth is impressive, but TSMC's expanding margins may be the most noteworthy. Since last year, its profit margin has expanded from 36.8% to 42.7%, gross margin has expanded from 53.2% to 56.8%, and operating margin has expanded from 42.5% to 49.6%.
These expanding margins are a testament to TSMC's ability to command premium pricing because of its advanced manufacturing ability, and its customers knowing that it's essentially their only choice if they want the most powerful chips.
TSMC is trading at a good value for long-term investors
TSMC is currently trading at around 23.5 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months. It's not ""cheap"" by most standards, but it also seems like a good value for a company that's as dominant as TSMC and has its growth potential.
TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability isn't something that can be easily caught up to and replicated because it takes many years of experience and billions invested into research and equipment. That gives it a competitive advantage that's likely to last for quite a while, especially because it's not easy for its customers to switch manufacturers without risking performance or reliability.
That edge gives me confidence that TSMC can enter the $2 trillion club within the next few years."

During an interview at Stanford Business School, Griffin proclaimed that Alphabet wields comparable levels of computational power as the fifth-largest country in the world.
This is not mere hyperbole. Griffin's remark underscores the vast scale of Alphabet's technological infrastructure and its dominance in shaping the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
For investors, this comment is more significant than a memorable sound bite. It highlights Alphabet's role at the center of AI's growth, where demand for compute power and data processing is only accelerating.
Ken Griffin just made a bold statement about Google
When most people think of Alphabet, Google Search and YouTube are usually the first properties that come to mind. But the company's influence stretches far beyond the internet.
Today, Alphabet operates across a diverse set of industries -- ranging from cybersecurity through its investment in Wiz, to cloud computing with Google Cloud Platform, consumer electronics with Android, autonomous driving via Waymo, and even custom AI hardware with its tensor processing units (TPUs). In effect, Alphabet has quietly engineered one of the most powerful computing backbones in the world.
By comparing Alphabet's resources to those of a nation, Griffin underscores the staggering scale of its capabilities in processing, storage, and advanced data workloads. For perspective, the world's fifth-largest country in terms of electricity consumption falls between Japan and Russia -- industrialized economies that power hundreds of millions of people.
If a single company like Alphabet commands that level of computational power, it signals just how central the company has become to the global digital economy.
Alphabet is purpose-built for the AI infrastructure era
At the heart of Alphabet's AI strategy is TensorFlow, its open-source framework for machine learning. TensorFlow is more than a toolkit -- it's an ecosystem powering advanced applications in natural language processing (NLP), robotics, computer vision, and more.
Griffin's observation ties directly to this computational muscle: Alphabet's vast infrastructure is the foundation for training and deploying AI models, at a scale few rivals can match. This isn't simply about producing isolated AI-powered products -- it's about providing the tools, frameworks, and cloud infrastructure that enable developers, enterprises, and entire global communities to innovate.
That network effect is what strengthens Alphabet's competitive moat. Just as Google Search became the default gateway to the internet two decades ago, Alphabet's AI backbone is positioning the company as an enduring platform on which the next era of computing is built.
The impact on investors
Griffin's comment underscores why Alphabet should no longer be seen merely as a cyclical play on digital advertising. Viewed through the lens of AI, Alphabet emerges as a long-term compounder -- an essential force powering the AI economy. For investors, the takeaway is clear. Griffin's perspective shines light on Alphabet's deeply entrenched position across various corners of the AI landscape.
The company's ability to marshal computational power on par with a nation highlights not only the durability of its entire business, but stresses the importance of its competitive advantages across both hardware and software -- domains with enormous capital requirements and high barriers to entry.
Yet despite its technological leadership, the stock continues to trade at a steep discount relative to other megacap tech peers based on forward earnings multiples.
This disconnect suggests that the broader market has yet to fully price in Griffin's astute insight -- leaving long-term investors with meaningful upside potential as Alphabet's position in the high ground becomes even more pronounced, while rivals scramble to keep pace."

Analysts at Morgan Stanley stated that they had previously been bullish on the stock expecting GenAI to accelerate growth in its Digital Media Business. However, Adobe’s revenue growth has failed to keep up the pace despite rolling out new AI features quickly.
Direct AI monetization has been slower than hoped as the company focused on adoption first. There is also considerable uncertainty regarding how much GenAI advancements will benefit Adobe’s business.
Overall, the firm still believes in Adobe’s core strengths and AI potential, but sees limited near-term catalysts amid competitive pressure from Meta and Google which could become material.

“Our prior OW thesis on Adobe was predicated on the ability for the company to successfully innovate on, deliver, and eventually monetize Generative AI functionality across the customer base, leading to an inflection in Digital Media ARR growth to the ~mid-to-high teens. Since that upgrade, we have seen the Digital Media ARR growth directionality diverge from the pace and quality of innovation being embedded within the product portfolio, leading us to the following conclusions: 1) Direct ‘Gen AI’ monetization has lagged initial investor (and our) expectations, explained by Adobe’s propensity to foster ubiquity and broad adoption of the technology ahead of monetization; and 2) there is relative uncertainty in a sizable portion of the Adobe ARR base where we lack confidence in Gen AI advancements being a net positive. Related to the latter, as we recently discussed (See Software: Checking the Software Pulse – “I’m Not Dead Yet”), the recipe for turning around sentiment on the legacy SaaS applications group necessitates vendors demonstrating a convergence of stabilization in the core business plus the ability for Gen AI capabilities to enhance and expand their addressable market opportunity. As such, decelerating Digital Media ARR growth despite 1) an accelerated pace of innovation, 2) ramping usage and adoption metrics against that innovation, and 3) the benefit from price action has left investors questioning Adobe’s ability to demonstrate this equation. To be clear, we continue to believe in both Adobe’s core value proposition and the expanded value capture opportunity Gen AI presents for complex, multi-channel marketers. However, given a lack of visibility into buckets of the base where competitive pressures (from both external Diffusion Engines and the likes of Meta/Google) could prove more material, we struggle to paint a clear catalyst path to DM ARR growth acceleration.”"

TeraWulf is aiming for one of the biggest fundraising rounds the crypto mining world has seen. The Bitcoin miner plans to raise roughly $3 billion to expand its data centersand it's got Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its corner.
CFO Patrick Fleury told Bloomberg the company is weighing whether to tap the high-yield bond market or use leveraged loans, with Morgan Stanley arranging the deal. If all goes smoothly, the transaction could launch as early as October.
Google has sweetened the plan with a $1.4 billion backstop, lifting its total support to $3.2 billion. For TeraWulf, that stamp of approval gives the deal serious weight, showing how major tech players are willing to back the infrastructure needed for both crypto mining and the AI boom.
If the raise goes through, TeraWulf would have fresh firepower to scale its operations at a time when miners are squeezed by rising energy costs and tougher competition. It's also another sign that the lines between crypto and Big Tech keep getting thinner."

Since the latest Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, compressing revenues across the mining sector, large operators have been searching for ways to stabilize income streams.
Increasingly, they are leasing their energy footprints to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing clients. The model is not speculative; it is already being written into multiyear contracts.
In September, Cipher Mining signed a 168-megawatt agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider. The deal runs for ten years and is valued at $3 billion. Google provided financing support worth $1.4 billion and also acquired a 5% equity stake in Cipher.
The arrangement allows Cipher to maintain ownership of its facilities while converting part of its power allocation into contracted AI revenue.
TeraWulf, another U.S.-based miner, followed a similar path. It announced hosting agreements that dedicate more than 200 megawatts to AI workloads at its Lake Mariner site. Analysts estimate the value of the deal could exceed $3.7 billion.
Contracts That Change Miner Balance Sheets
The financial character of these companies is beginning to change. Miner equity has historically traded with a high correlation to the price of Bitcoin. New long-dated contracts give investors a different risk profile to consider. Regular dollar-denominated payments from AI customers may reduce the exposure of miner stocks to Bitcoin cycles.
Iren, an Australian operator, provides an example. It recently expanded its AI cloud business by purchasing more than 12,000 GPUs. The company projects $500 million in annual AI revenue by early 2026. Analysts at Arete initiated coverage on Iren, Riot Platforms, and Cipher Mining with buy ratings, citing the stability of contracted AI revenue as a driver.
The case of CoreWeave and Core Scientific stresses the point. CoreWeave, once an Ethereum miner, shifted into GPU-based hosting. In 2025, it acquired Core Scientific in a transaction valued at $9 billion. The deal cemented its place as a supplier of computing power for AI firms, moving entirely beyond token mining.
Why the AI Shift Is Different
The entry into AI hosting is not simply diversification. It forces miners to rethink operations. Unlike Bitcoin mining, AI customers demand strict service level agreements. Data centers must offer redundancy, cooling efficiency, and long-term maintenance commitments. In practice, this means capital is redeployed from short-cycle ASIC purchases toward infrastructure upgrades that support higher-density workloads.
There is also the allocation question. Every megawatt committed to AI hosting cannot be used for Bitcoin mining. Operators will have to balance the immediate predictability of contracted revenue with the option value of a potential Bitcoin price rally.
From Hashprice to Lease Price
The mining business has long been tied to hashprice, the dollar value of one terahash of computing power per day. That metric is now being supplemented by what could be called lease price, the value of contracted power sold to external clients. In time, the lease price may become as influential for valuation models as the hash price itself.
This shift has implications for the broader network. If miners dedicate more capacity to external hosting, the growth of network hash rate may slow.
That could alter the competitive dynamics among remaining pure miners and impact difficulty adjustments. At the same time, the capital stability provided by AI contracts could keep some firms alive through periods of low Bitcoin prices, preventing sharp declines in total hash rate.
A Changing Capital Formation Cycle
The sector’s capital cycle is also adjusting. Past expansions were often financed during bull markets when high margins justified the rapid purchase of machines. Now, multi-year AI contracts provide the collateral base for raising capital in less favorable markets. That changes the rhythm of how mining infrastructure is built.
The long-term outcome is not that AI erases mining. Rather, it layers another economic activity on top of the same infrastructure. For investors, miner equities may look less like high-beta proxies for Bitcoin and more like hybrid firms that combine commodity-linked income with contracted service revenue.

The company’s AI division is using the app to quickly evaluate new features for Siri, Apple’s voice-powered assistant. That includes testing the ability to search through personal data, such as songs and emails, and perform in-app actions like editing photos, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative is private.
The software — code-named Veritas, Latin for “truth” — is meant for internal use, at least for now. Apple has no current plans to release it to consumers. The app essentially takes the still-in-progress technology from the new Siri and puts it in a form employees can test out more efficiently. The company also can gather feedback on whether the chatbot format has value.
Even without a public launch, the internal tool marks a new phase in Apple’s preparations for Siri’s overhaul, a high-stakes release that could reshape perceptions of its AI efforts.
The new Siri is now slated to debut as early as March after multiple delays. If the software works as promised, it could help propel Apple toward an AI comeback. If it falls short, the company risks slipping further behind smartphone rivals such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Samsung Electronics Co.
Competition over AI features is expected to ramp up next year, making it a more decisive factor in smartphone purchasing decisions. When Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 this month, the company notably avoided highlighting its in-house AI platform.
Apple had planned to release the Siri overhaul last spring but delayed the rollout after engineering problems caused the features to fail as much as a third of the time, Bloomberg News previously reported.
The internal Veritas app resembles most popular chatbots, letting users manage multiple conversations across different topics. It can save and reference past chats, follow up on earlier queries and support extended back-and-forth exchanges.
A spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.
The app is designed to test the revamped underlying system, code-named Linwood, that Apple has built to power the new Siri. That software relies on large language models — the technology underpinning generative AI — and combines work from Apple’s own Foundation Models team with a third-party model."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -An Amazon vice president helping to oversee one of the company's highest profile projects, artificial general intelligence, is stepping down on Friday, the online retailer confirmed after a Reuters inquiry.
Karthik Ramakrishnan, a 13-year veteran of Amazon, is stepping down, according to internal communications reviewed by Reuters. It could not be learned if he had another job lined up and Ramakrishnan did not respond to a request for comment.
Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is technology being developed that researchers believe could one day equal or even outperform human-level intelligence. AGI, if perfected, could help to further automate work done today by humans, potentially upending fields as diverse as warfare, healthcare and stock trading.
Ramakrishnan worked on the first iteration of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant and the associated Echo devices. He began his career at Netscape before moving to Tellme Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.
His departure is among several higher profile ones in recent months, including Vasi Philomin, a vice president guiding generative AI development; and Jon Jones, who led the AWS global startups and venture capital business.
Amazon is working to bolster its reputation for developing AI software and services as rivals like OpenAI and Google have captured market share. It has invested around $8 billion in startup Anthropic and uses its Claude AI model in products like Alexa and an internal chatbot known as Cedric.
On Thursday at an internal all-hands meeting, AWS chief Matt Garman pressed employees to meet timelines for releasing products, saying Amazon can ""lose some of that buzz"" when customers have to wait to try out new services, Reuters reported.

- Cipher Mining on Friday announced it had upped the price of its convertible debt offering.
- The Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner revealed a $3 billion AI hosting deal on Thursday, backstopped by Google.
- Bitcoin miners are increasingly delving into the world of AI computing, as both require immense computing power.
Bitcoin miner Cipher Mining on Friday announced it had upped the price of its convertible debt offering, one day after revealing a $3 billion AI cloud hosting deal backstopped by Google.
The Nasdaq-listed miner said its convertible senior notes were now priced at $1.1 billion after initially being offered for $800 million.
The notes will be for ""persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers,"" and will be due in 2031. Senior notes are a form of debt a company can issue to investors. Convertible notes can be turned into company equity by the buyer.
Cipher's stock (CIFR) was trading up by nearly 5% on Friday at a price around $12.20 a share, after falling sharply on Thursday following an initial spike at the start of the trading. CIFR has nearly pulled even on the week after being significantly down earlier in the day.
The company on Thursday announced that it signed a 10-year, roughly $3 billion high-performance computing colocation agreement with Fluidstack. The deal will see Cipher deliver 168 MW of critical IT load, supported by a maximum of 244 MW of gross capacity, at its Barber Lake site in Colorado City, Texas.
As part of the deal, Google said it would backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's lease obligations to support project-related debt financing. In return, the tech giant will receive warrants to acquire approximately 24 million shares of Cipher common stock, or a 5.4% pro forma equity ownership stake.
In the Bitcoin mining world, companies use warehouses full of computers to process transactions on the crypto network. Because they've amassed so much computing power, some miners have pivoted their infrastructure to address growing AI demand.
Experts previously told Decrypt that while both industries use data centers, it can be difficult to make the swing from AI to crypto mining.
Bitcoin miner TeraWulf announced in August that Google was providing an incremental $1.4 billion backstop to support project-related debt financing, upping its total stake to $3.2 billion."

Nearly 80% of consumer usage for Claude comes from outside the United States, with per-person usage in countries like South Korea, Australia and Singapore outpacing that of America, the company said.
Anthropic, valued at $183 billion and backed by Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon.com, has distinguished itself, in part, by building AI models that excel at coding.
Its Claude large language models are widely regarded as one of the most powerful frontier models on the market, and this has helped grow the company's global business customer base from under 1,000 to more than 300,000 in two years.
The company's run-rate revenue had grown to more than $5 billion by August from about $1 billion at the beginning of the year.
As international demand drives the company's momentum, Anthropic plans to hire for more than 100 new positions across Dublin, London and Zurich.
The company also plans to open its first Asian office in Tokyo, besides additional office locations in Europe.
The global expansion is led by Chris Ciauri, who recently joined as managing director of International following Paul Smith's appointment as chief commercial officer.
""The global demand for Claude is extraordinary—from financial services in London to manufacturing in Tokyo, enterprises are trusting Claude to power their mission-critical operations,"" Ciauri said.
Earlier this week, Microsoft signed a deal with Anthropic to integrate Claude models into its Copilot assistant, marking a shift for the generative AI chatbot that has primarily used OpenAI.

Instead, it involves buying stakes in high-quality businesses with durable moats, strong financials, and the ability to adapt to emerging trends -- and holding those stakes for the long term. These companies can reward shareholders across generations.
Here are two such stocks that have the potential to create generational wealth.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%) is currently targeting online search, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) -- three markets that are already worth hundreds of billions of dollars each, and that have all been expanding rapidly for several years. With a market capitalization of over $3 trillion, $95 billion in cash on its books, and $66.7 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow, Alphabet boasts exceptional financial strength. This enables it to build cutting-edge AI infrastructure, scale up its Waymo autonomous driving project, invest in other tech projects, and still have money to reward its shareholders with dividends and share repurchases.
AI is already helping Alphabet fend off competition for its flagship Google Search offering. With new features such as AI Overviews (AI-generated summaries with links to their sources) and AI Mode (an end-to-end AI search experience), the company is reshaping how its users look for information. AI Overview now reaches over 2 billion monthly users and generates nearly 10% more queries when shown. AI Mode -- which is still rolling out in other countries -- has quickly scaled to 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. and India.
YouTube, which has led the U.S. streaming market by watch time for over two years, has diversified Alphabet's revenue mix by combining a dominant advertising engine with a fast-growing subscription business across Premium, Music, and YouTube TV. With Shorts engagement exceeding 200 billion daily views and YouTube ads viewed on connected TVs that let viewers shop directly from the ads they see, YouTube is positioned to become an even larger driver of Alphabet's revenue.
Google Cloud is also emerging as a significant catalyst for growth. In the second quarter, Google Cloud's revenue grew 32% year over year to $13.6 billion, while operating margin expanded from 11.3% to 20.7%. With an annual run rate of over $50 billion and a $106 billion backlog at the end of the second quarter, Google Cloud is playing a crucial role in driving enterprise AI adoption. Alphabet has also integrated its Gemini-powered agents across its Cloud products, and many large enterprises are already using them to improve their efficiency, security, and software quality.
Alphabet's full-stack AI strategy is also proving to be a significant competitive advantage. The company offers GPUs, its own custom TPUs (tensor processing units), and advanced AI models and tools, such as the Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models on its leading global network of AI-optimized data centers.
Between those powerful businesses and the long-term growth potential of its Waymo business, its wearable AI devices, and its emerging subscription services businesses, Alphabet has built a robust and diversified ecosystem.
Despite the many pros, Alphabet trades at 21.4 times forward earnings, which is lower than the S&P 500's multiple of 23.7. Based on all these factors, Alphabet looks like a stock worth buying now and holding for the long term.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.07%) remains a dominant force in the social media and digital advertising landscapes. With over 3.4 billion people using at least one of its applications daily, the company enjoys unmatched reach, which is helping drive user engagement and monetization.
The strength of the business is all too obvious. In the second quarter, its revenues grew 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. Operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to 43%, while free cash flow was $8.5 billion. The company distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and spent $9.8 billion on share repurchases while continuing to invest aggressively in its AI initiatives.
Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming Meta's central growth engine. The company formed Superintelligence Labs, bringing together its Foundations team (focused on foundational AI models), product team, and the Facebook AI Research team to accelerate next-generation AI development. It is also investing heavily in building several multigigawatt-scale data center clusters to dramatically increase its capacity to train and deploy AI models. These include the Prometheus cluster, which is scheduled to become operational in 2026, and Hyperion, which is expected to scale up to 5 gigawatts within the next few years.
These efforts are also showing results. While its Andromeda model helps retrieve and display the most personalized and relevant advertisements for each user, the new Generative Ads Recommendation system (GEM) helps rank the best ads for users after retrieval. These AI-powered initiatives helped improve ad conversions by nearly 5% on Instagram and 3% on Facebook.
Besides offering them better ad targeting, Meta is also supporting advertisers with AI-powered creative tools. Approximately 2 million advertisers are now using Meta's generative AI features to create more impactful and efficient ad campaigns. Since these tools are especially valuable for smaller advertisers with limited budgets, they are helping to expand Meta's advertiser base.
Its virtual AI assistant, Meta AI, already has over 1 billion monthly users across its applications. Growing adoption of that software opens the door to new monetization avenues in content discovery, search, and messaging.
Meta currently trades at about 28.5 times forward earnings, which is not an inexpensive valuation. Additionally, the company is exposed to increasing regulatory and legal risks in Europe. Finally, some are concerned about its massive planned capital expenditures for 2025 and 2026. However, considering its scale, financial strength, and ambitious AI strategy, the stock could still prove to be an exceptional generational play for those who buy it now."

The next frontier -- quantum computing -- promises an even greater leap forward, unlocking efficiency and solving problems that strain the limits of today's classical machines.
Together, the fusion of AI and quantum computing is expected to create trillions of dollars in economic value over the coming decades. While many companies are dabbling in quantum systems at the margins, two of the industry's most influential players are already weaving this emerging capability into their broader strategies.
Let's explore how Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.86%) (GOOGL 1.86%) are positioning themselves to remain leaders at the cutting edge of AI's next transformation.
Nvidia: GPUs, CUDA, and infrastructure
Nvidia's rise throughout the AI revolution is deeply rooted in its dominance of the GPU market, where its chips have become the backbone of generative AI development. What investors may not fully realize yet is that the company's ambitions extend beyond supplying accelerators to train large language models (LLMs). Quietly, Nvidia has been laying the groundwork for a prominent role in the quantum era.
A key part of this strategy is Nvidia's software architecture, CUDA. CUDA includes tools designed to bridge classical computing systems with quantum-inspired research. At the moment, Nvidia's CUDA quantum (CUDA-Q) platform is used by a number of academic institutions, as well as integrated with existing developers such as IonQ and Rigetti Computing.
This is a savvy move, as Nvidia is doing all of this without committing massive capital expenditures (capex) to build quantum machines from scratch. Instead, the company is positioning itself as the connective backbone across both hardware and software supporting the next wave of advanced computing applications.
Alphabet: Willow, Cirq, and DeepMind
Alphabet has carved more direct inroads into quantum computing through its Google Quantum division.
A central focus is Willow, a processor built to scale quantum workloads more efficiently. To drive adoption, Alphabet introduced Cirq -- an open-source software framework that enables developers to design quantum algorithms and run them directly on Google's infrastructure. The company's internal research lab, DeepMind, adds another dimension that gives Alphabet the unique advantage to test quantum technologies in-house and refine them at a faster pace.
What makes this approach so compelling is that Alphabet weaves these efforts into a vertically integrated stack. The company's hardware, software, and research converge within a single ecosystem -- allowing emerging services like Google Cloud and Gemini to compete from a position of strength against entrenched rivals like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Are Nvidia and Alphabet good buys right now?
Nvidia and Alphabet are each building durable platforms optimized for the next phase of advanced computing.
For Nvidia, the company's GPUs and CUDA architecture are already indispensable to AI infrastructure. Moreover, the company's collaborations in quantum computing create additional tailwinds across both hardware and software for the data centers of tomorrow. Meanwhile, Alphabet is stitching quantum into a broader, diversified ecosystem that spans processors, software frameworks, cloud distribution, and research.
For both companies, quantum computing is not the ultimate destination, but rather a strategic layer that reinforces their long-term growth prospects -- positioning each as resilient, differentiated platform businesses in an increasingly competitive landscape.
I think that each company's early bets on quantum computing will look shrewd in hindsight as these applications evolve from research-driven environments into real-world value creation.
For investors with patience, owning shares of both Nvidia and Alphabet today offers exposure to two businesses not just benefiting from the AI boom, but actively writing the narrative of its next chapter. For these reasons, I see both stocks as no-brainer opportunities right now."

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Altimeter Capital’s Brad Gerstner, in late August, talked about the impressive results of Nvidia on CNBC and explained why the company is benefiting from AI inference. Gerstner said at the time that the world is supply-constrained when it comes to compute.
“Think about this stat a year ago: Google per month was doing about 9 trillion tokens a month in terms of inference generation, compute generation. Today it’s 980 trillion tokens. So from 9 trillion to 980, it’s a 100x increase in a year. You have to compute in order to do that. So the world is massively supply constrained when it comes to compute. They’re 50. You know, he said yesterday the world will continue to grow at 50%. So think about this. If you grow and people ask them, are you going to grow at 50%? He said, well, I think we’re going to maintain market share. So the consensus for next year is 250 billion of data center revenue. If they grow up 50%, that’s going to be closer to 300 billion or closer to eight bucks a share, right. And $200 at eight bucks a share. You know, is about 25 times. So below market multiples in terms of PE. So here’s a company that I think is hitting on all strides.”
Nvidia’s latest deal with OpenAI and Intel, along with Oracle’s partnership with OpenAI are showing signs that companies are continuing to spend a fortune on compute, and AI demand won’t slow down anytime soon. But can NVDA shares keep gaining?
Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Nvidia recently impressed the market by signing an AI infrastructure deal with Intel. Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel. Jensen Huang said the deal would open up $50B in TAM for both companies in the data center and PC business.
Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital
Analysts believe the deal would allow Nvidia to take market share from AMD in the data center and PC business and diversify away from Arm-based designs."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-26T13:00:05,Is Trending Stock Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) a Buy Now?,"Recently, Zacks.com users have been paying close attention to Alphabet (GOOGL). This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=98803ffe3f5974aacf944bfbd75e68642b3b0eca7dca4710e8f023e8a8e56001,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-alphabet-inc-googl-130005867.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-alphabet-inc-googl-130005867.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-alphabet-inc-googl-130005867.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this internet search leader have returned +16.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 16.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $2.30 per share, indicating a change of +8.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.2% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.97 points to a change of +24% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.63 indicates a change of +6.6% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."

Cramer has discussed nearly every aspect of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 2025, whether it’s related to the firm’s troubles with the Justice Department, its YouTube business, and quantum computing. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s scale allows it to aggressively invest in emerging technologies, and it generated a lot of hype about quantum computing in December 2025 after launching the Willow chip. The firm shared that Willow was able to perform a benchmark computation that would take a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years in just five minutes. Naturally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and quantum computing have caught Cramer’s attention as he believes that the firm is a top player in the space:
“Yes I am because I do ultimately believe in quantum but I believe in quantum . . .Second, with Alphabet. They are in quantum.”
Pixabay/Public Domain
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s journey in quantum computing has been quite long. For instance, the firm demonstrated in 2019 that some qubits could last long enough for complex calculations. The firm has also created a programming language library for quantum computing. Here are Cramer’s earlier thoughts about the subject:
“Alphabet has a facility dedicated to quantum computing. This is super fast computing using superconductors that require a specialized computer environment based in part on cryogenic technology. Sounds promising, the others burn too hot, right, the regular data centers. But it’s not a reason to buy Alphabet because it’s nothing that’s ready at scale. I like Alphabet, own it for the Charitable Trust, but that’s because we like their dominance in Search, progress in YouTube, and incredible strength of Google Cloud services, well ahead of what people think. Quantum computing is just a long-term project.”

TeraWulf Inc. (WULF, Financials) plans to raise about $3 billion in debt to expand its data center operations, with financial backing from Google (GOOGL, Financials), Chief Financial Officer Patrick Fleury told Bloomberg.
The debt will likely be issued through the high-yield bond market or leveraged loans. Morgan Stanley is arranging the potential transaction, which could launch in October.
Google has provided a $1.4 billion backstop commitment to support the deal, bringing the total financing package to $3.2 billion. The support comes as large technology companies continue investing in energy-intensive data centers to meet rising demand for artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure.
Shares of TeraWulf fell nearly 4% Thursday to $10.97, while Google's stock dipped 0.5% to $246.57. Investors will watch the progress of the debt issuance and details of how the expansion could affect TeraWulf's growth and balance sheet.

Well, the first thing you need to know is that the president signed an executive order last night declaring that his plan to sell Chinese-owned TikTok's US operations to US and global investors has got the green light from both Washington and Beijing.
The new US company will be valued at around $14 billion. That's well short of what many analysts had estimated. Some had said the value should be closer to $40 billion.
Now, the owners of the new group are thought to include Larry Ellison's Oracle, Michael Dell, and Rupert Murdoch.
Now, the next thing you need to know and keep an eye on is defense stocks, especially in Europe.
Why? Well, European diplomats warned the Kremlin this week that NATO is ready to respond to further violations of its airspace with full force, including by shooting down Russian planes.
Now, remember, three MiG-31 fighter jets flew over Estonia according to officials. Russia denies this and says it's not trying to test NATO.
All right, the third thing you need to know about is that Meta has had discussions with Google about the possibility of using its Gemini models to improve its ad business.

When it comes to US equities, the opposite happened. Foreign purchases rose to a record in the second quarter, according to Federal Reserve Board data. Demand has been so brisk that stocks now make up nearly 32% of foreigners allocations to US assets — breaking a record that’s been in place since 1968.
While data show that foreigners have scaled back on travel to the US along with some purchases of US-made products, the American stock market has proven too enticing to quit. Part of that owes to the dominance of firms chasing riches in artificial intelligence, which has swelled the share prices of Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., among others. And while they have been buying stocks, foreign investors have sent the dollar sharply lower, perhaps hedging exposure to the US.
“While tariffs have led many foreign consumers to boycott US products, US equities remained in high demand,” said Rob Anderson, US sector strategist at Ned Davis Research. Canadians, for example, have been buying US stocks while shunning American products.
Foreigners plowed $290.7 billion into the US stock market in the three months ended June 30, accord to the Fed data. Treasury International Capital (TIC) data showed that as of July, foreign holdings of US equities are on pace to rise by $2.8 trillion this year, said Elyas Galou, director of global investment strategy at Bank of America.
Foreign buyers hold some $18 trillion in US stocks, about 30% of the nearly $60 trillion market, the most in data going back to 1945, according to Fed data cited by Bank of America. The dollar value of their holdings has obviously appreciated with asset prices, though the percentage of the total has climbed.
“International investors are still buying US equities at a very strong pace,” Galou said.
While returns have been solid in 2025, at the index level, the purchases haven’t been as lucrative as they would have been if executed in other major stock markets. The S&P 500 has underperformed equity benchmarks in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and China, both in local currency and in US dollar terms."

Swimmer Michael Phelps won the 200- and 400-meter individual medley double at the Olympic Games in Athens. Terror Squad's ""Lean Back"" topped the U.S. music charts. And a young company named Google, which would later create a parent company named Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 1.86%), conducted its initial public offering (IPO).
If you had invested $10,200 on the day Google first traded publicly and never sold a share, your investment would have grown to roughly $1 million today. But is Google parent Alphabet still a millionaire-maker stock?
The path to the first $1 million
Before we attempt to answer that question, let's look at Google's path to the first $1 million. It started in 1996 with two Stanford University graduate students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, developing a search engine for the still-new World Wide Web. They founded Google in 1998. Their search engine quickly became wildly popular.
By the time Google went public in 2004, it dominated internet search. That allowed the company to generate fast-growing advertising revenue. Advertising still accounts for nearly three-quarters of Alphabet's total revenue.
Along the way, Google developed or acquired other products that became huge successes, including the Android mobile operating system, the Chrome browser, Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube. It also acquired DoubleClick in 2007, a deal that enabled the company to make money from ads run on other websites.
Google Cloud launched in 2008, just two years after Amazon (AMZN -0.48%) introduced its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. Today, Google Cloud is the fastest-growing major cloud services provider and generates 14% of Alphabet's total revenue.
We can't leave out Google's pioneering work in artificial intelligence (AI). The company began using machine learning for spell-checking search queries way back in 2001. Google acquired DeepMind, a leading AI researcher, in 2014. DeepMind's AlphaGo famously beat Lee Sedol, an 18-time world champion, in Go two years later. Google released a research paper in 2018 that introduced the transformer, a key component of modern large language models (LLMS) and the ""T"" in ChatGPT. Importantly, Google's AI work helped make its applications and Google Cloud more attractive to users.
New markets to conquer
Fortunately for investors, Alphabet still has new markets that it could conquer. There's a lot more to be done with AI. In particular, agentic AI holds significant near-term potential. The company is also working on artificial general intelligence (AGI), which could be a game-changing technology for the world.
Alphabet's Waymo unit is already a leader in self-driving car technology. Waymo operates autonomous ride-hailing services (robotaxis) in five cities, with more on the way.
Healthcare is another promising frontier. AlphaFold, an AI system that predicts the 3D structures of proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands, is so important to drug discovery and biological research that its developers won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Alphabet's Calico unit is attempting to extend human lifespan. Its Verily subsidiary focuses on precision health, which combines patients' genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors to create personalized therapies.
Last, but certainly not least, Alphabet's Google Quantum AI is a leader in quantum computing. Google Quantum AI has already achieved two major quantum computing milestones. It hopes to build a large-scale quantum computer that can be used in multiple applications by the end of the decade.
Could Alphabet still be a millionaire-maker stock?
Now for a reality check. Alphabet's market cap stands at roughly $3 trillion. For an initial investment in the ballpark of $10,000 to grow to $1 million would require the company to have a market cap of $300 trillion. That amount is roughly 14.6 times the current market caps of all the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks combined.
Is that kind of growth possible for Alphabet? Maybe. Is it probable? No.
That said, I think a higher initial investment in Alphabet (perhaps $100,000 or so) could make you a millionaire over the next 20 years. The promise of AI (especially AGI), robotaxis, and quantum computing is compelling and could open up massive growth opportunities for some companies. I fully expect that Alphabet will be among the biggest winners in all of these areas."

TeraWulf plans to raise about $3b to expand its data centers, in a deal supported by Google, according to its finance chief Patrick Fleury.
The debt is expected to be issued either through the high-yield bond market or via leveraged loans, Fleury told Bloomberg in a recent interview.
Morgan Stanley is arranging the potential transaction, which could be launched as early as October.
Credit rating agencies are still reviewing the deal, with expectations that it could fall between BB and CCC, the typical range for junk-rated debt. Google’s backstop could reportedly help secure a higher grade.
Negotiations are ongoing, and there is no guarantee the deal will move forward. TeraWulf didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time.
AI Boom Drives Demand For Data Centers, Puts Crypto Miners In Spotlight
The push comes as demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure has outstripped supply. The rapid rise of AI has created shortages of data center space, graphics processing chips and access to electricity.
Crypto mining firms like TeraWulf, already operating large-scale power-hungry facilities, have become attractive partners for companies seeking to expand into AI computing.
TeraWulf has already seen growing interest in its facilities. In August, Fluidstack, an AI cloud platform, expanded its use of a TeraWulf-run data center in New York. Around the same time, Google increased its backstop commitment to TeraWulf by $1.4b, taking its total to $3.2b and lifting its equity stake in the miner to 14% from 8%.
TeraWulf, Cipher Raise Capital To Expand Data Center Capacity
Meanwhile, another mining firm, Cipher Mining, has signed a colocation deal with Fluidstack and Google. Under the agreement, Cipher will supply data center capacity. In return, Google will backstop US$1.4 billion in obligations and take an equity stake. In addition, Cipher is expected to seek more debt financing, similar to TeraWulf.
Separately, in August TeraWulf said it plans to raise $400m through a private offering of convertible senior notes due 2031. The company explained that proceeds will partly fund capped call transactions. The rest will go toward expanding its data centers and other corporate needs.
If completed, this financing would be one of the largest debt deals by a crypto miner shifting into AI infrastructure. Furthermore, it shows how Google is expanding its role in building out computing power to meet surging demand from AI developers.

The move underscores the growing intersection of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence infrastructure.
The acquisition, announced Thursday, accompanies a $3 billion multi-year agreement for Fluidstack, an AI cloud platform that builds and operates HPC clusters for major companies, to lease computing capacity from Cipher’s Texas site.
Google Backs Major Texas Data Center Expansion
The deal highlights growing convergence between AI platforms and crypto mining. Cipher Mining will deliver 168 megawatts of computing power to Fluidstack, supported by up to 244 MW of gross capacity, at its Barber Lake site in Colorado City, Texas. The site can expand to 500 MW and spans 587 acres, offering space for long-term growth.
SponsoredUnder the terms, Google will guarantee $1.4 billion of Fluidstack’s lease obligations to Cipher. In exchange, it will receive warrants for roughly 24 million shares of Cipher common stock. This makes Google a significant minority investor while supporting financing for one of the largest AI-ready mining facilities in the U.S.
Cipher CEO Tyler Page described the partnership as a milestone for the company’s high-performance computing ambitions. “This collaboration allows us to scale our infrastructure while serving frontier AI workloads efficiently,” he said.
This move mirrors Google’s earlier investment in TeraWulf in August, when it secured an 8% stake in exchange for guaranteeing $1.8 billion of Fluidstack lease obligations for TeraWulf’s 200 MW AI hosting capacity. That deal helped TeraWulf shift from purely Bitcoin mining to high-performance computing, setting a precedent for Google’s dual focus on crypto and AI data centers.
Miners Accelerate Shift Toward AI Infra
Analysts suggest this investment could speed up AI and crypto mining blending. With Google’s backing, Cipher gains capital and credibility, which may encourage other miners to expand into AI hosting. The deal may also intensify competition in Texas, an attractive state for its low energy costs and deregulated grid.
The agreement includes two five-year extension options, potentially lifting total contracted revenue to $7 billion. As the AI industry grows rapidly, this move signals a new era of hybrid projects that merge financial, computational, and energy-intensive sectors.
A mid-September analysis by The Miner Mag showed that Bitcoin mining stocks extended their recovery and outperformed Bitcoin. The trend was partly explained by investors rewarding companies that pivot toward GPU and AI services.
Cipher Mining (CIFR) shares surged from $14 to $17 on the day. They later retreated to close at $11.66. Year-to-date, the stock has climbed about 151.3%."

He was not surprised. But he was dismayed.
“I can’t afford to pay $100,000,” Awadallah told TechCrunch. He’s hired one employee on an H-1B, and while the new fee only applies to new applications, he believes it’s too high for many startups and will price them out of hiring internationally.
The H-1B visa was created to allow companies to hire skilled talent from a worldwide market for such occupations as IT and engineering. On Friday, Trump announced that the fee hike, typically paid by the employer, would increase from $2,000-$5,000 to $100,000 per application, a change that will especially be felt with the new batch of visas available in March.
Immigration is a key issue for President Trump, who, even dating back to his 2016 campaign run, accused companies of using the H-1B to take jobs from U.S. citizens.
Critics of the fee hike note that this visa helped bring in people who have gone on to start or run multibillion-dollar companies. Former holders include Google’s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and Elon Musk. The visa has been more accessible than the O-1 visa for extraordinary ability, and quicker to obtain than a green card.
“The impact will be severe on the competitiveness and innovation of smaller startups compared to the hyperscales, the big businesses,” Awadallah said. While Big Tech can more easily afford such fees, he feels that startups will miss out. Pricing startups out, he said, “will impact innovation in very, very negative ways longer term.”
Could cost the tech industry $5.5 billion a year
More than 700,000 people live in the U.S. on an H-1B, and they’ve brought with them more than 500,000 dependents, such as spouses (who are permitted to work under this visa) and children, according to the immigration and criminal justice advocacy group fwd.us. Indian nationals are the largest recipients of the visa, followed by China and the rest of the world, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Only 85,000 new people a year can receive the visa (20,000 of them must have just graduated from a U.S. university), and demand outstrips availability, so H-1Bs are allocated at random, in a lottery held in March. Tech companies have lobbied for years for an increase in annual H-1B limits.
Critics allege that these companies are using H-1B holders to replace U.S. workers with lower-paid employees from overseas. Others say it exploits foreign workers, as the visa is tied to the employer, so workers can’t easily switch jobs and they face deportation if they lose their jobs."

Its graphics processing units (GPUs) power the backbone of generative artificial intelligence (AI), enabling large language models (LLMs) and driving advancements in next-generation use cases across autonomous systems and robotics.
While the notion of dethroning Nvidia in the chip realm might seem far-fetched, one ""Magnificent Seven"" rival is beginning to challenge its dominance. Enter Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 1.86%). Best known for Google and YouTube, the company is quietly building momentum through its artificial intelligence businesses.
In the discussion below, I'll examine how Alphabet is positioning itself to disrupt Nvidia's leadership in AI chips and consider whether the internet giant could soon deliver a ""checkmate"" to the market's biggest beneficiary of the AI boom.
Alphabet's secret weapon in cloud computing
At the center of Alphabet's push against Nvidia are its custom-designed, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) known as tensor processing units (TPUs). These chips have become a cornerstone of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) where they serve as a differentiator in an intensely competitive market dominated by Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
In recent months, Google Cloud has secured high-profile wins with companies such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms. Industry reports also suggest that TPUs have played a decisive role in attracting other AI leaders, including Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence, further reinforcing Alphabet's position in the AI infrastructure race.
How big of an opportunity is custom silicon for Alphabet?
By housing both research (DeepMind) and hardware (TPUs) under one roof, Alphabet has created a vertically integrated ecosystem capable of building, training, and deploying AI models and services through the Gemini and Google Cloud platforms.
In a recent research note, Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson estimated that if Alphabet were ever to spin off the DeepMind and TPU businesses, the combined value of these assets could approach $900 billion -- up from an estimate of $717 billion earlier this year.
While these figures are speculative, it implies that Alphabet may be sitting on a near trillion-dollar opportunity -- one that might otherwise have gone to Nvidia.
Is Alphabet about to dethrone Nvidia?
To assess whether Alphabet truly has Nvidia on the defensive, it's important to understand the difference between GPUs and TPUs.
GPUs are designed as highly versatile processors: They can handle parallel computations, which makes them ideal for rendering graphics or running large-scale AI workloads. Their flexibility is what has made them the backbone of AI development to date.
On the other hand, TPUs are far more specialized. They are optimized for neural networking applications, particularly deep learning and inference. This specialization allows TPUs to deliver high performance for machine learning models. Critically, though, they lack the broad utility of GPUs across more diverse workloads.
Another critical factor behind Nvidia's dominance is its CUDA software platform. The seamless integration of its GPUs with CUDA's parallel programming environment has given Nvidia a powerful competitive edge, creating a durable technological moat that makes switching to competing platforms highly unlikely.
Against that backdrop, Google's TPUs have certainly reshaped the competitive landscape, offering businesses a specialized alternative for certain applications. However, TPUs represent more of a complementary option to Nvidia's comprehensive services rather than a true substitute.
In other words, while Alphabet has placed an intriguing piece on the chess board, it has not maneuvered Nvidia into a checkmate position."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Cisco on Thursday announced a new software tool aimed at weaving together quantum computers from various makers into a single cloud, making it easier to develop useful applications.
Major tech firms such as Microsoft , IBM and Google are investing in building out their own quantum computers, which use properties of quantum physics to solve difficult computing problems faster than classical machines. Cisco, a major provider of networking gear for those classical machines, has taken a different track, aiming to create a new category of networking chips to connect quantum machines together.
In addition to quantum networking chips, Cisco is also working on the software that will be needed to connect quantum machines together. The tool announced on Thursday, which Cisco said it would make available for download next week, aims to analyze a quantum computing problem and then split it up across different machines - including machines that use fundamentally different approaches to achieving quantum computing.
Large tech companies and startups are still in heated competition around which kind of quantum computer will work best, but Cisco is aiming to take problems that software developers want to solve and break those problems up and assign them to whichever kind of computer might be best for that piece of the problem.
""You as the customer, as the quantum algorithm developer, should not worry about the kinds of technology that exist,"" Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president of Cisco's Outshift innovation incubator, told Reuters. ""We will handle that complexity.""

Before joining Coinspeaker, he wrote for Cointelegraph and TNW.
Key Notes
- Google obtains 5.4% ownership in Cipher through backstopping Fluidstack's $1.4 billion lease commitments in the deal.
- The infrastructure contract spans 10 years with potential extensions that could increase total revenue to $7 billion.
- Cipher's stock declined 12% despite the partnership as the company simultaneously seeks $800 million in debt financing.
AI infrastructure firm Fluidstack has entered a three billion dollar agreement to provide 168 MW of critical IT load to cryptocurrency mining company Cipher.
Under the arrangement, Google will backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack’s lease obligations in exchange for approximately 24 million shares of Cipher common stock, giving the Mountain View company a 5.4% stake.
Google Expands Crypto Mining Infrastructure Investments
The deal is for 10 years with provisions for two five-year extension options. According to a Sept. 25 press release, the contract represents approximately $3 billion in revenue over the initial 10-year term, but if the extensions are activated that figure would rise to about $7 billion.
This is the second Fluidstack deal Google has backstopped in as many months. In August, as Coinspeaker reported, data center infrastructure firm TeraWulf signed a HPC colocation agreement with Fluidstack worth at least $3.7 billion. Google backstopped TeraWulf’s obligations which gave it an 8% ownership stake.
At the time, TeraWulf saw its stock surge by as much as 38% off of Google’s involvement. Cipher doesn’t appear to be getting the same Silicon Valley bump. As of the time of this article’s publication, it’s down nearly 12%.

The negative movement could be related to Cipher’s other Sept. 25 news. The firm has announced a proposed private offering of $800 million in senior notes. According to the press release, it intends to use a portion of the funds to accelerate the build-out of its 2.4 GW pipeline.
These notes would mature in Oct. of 2031 and initial buyers would be given the opportunity to purchase an additional $120 million bringing the total on offer to approximately $920.

On Thursday, Cipher Mining announced that it was leasing a data warehouse it owns in Colorado City, Texas, to an AI computing startup. The Bitcoin miner projects the contract to net the company $3 billion over its initial 10-year term and $7 billion if two five-year extensions are exercised.
Cipher Mining struck the deal with Fluidstack, an AI computing startup based in the U.K. Google has agreed to backstop $1.4 billion in the startup’s lease obligations, and, in return, receive 5.4% in equity in Cipher Mining.
“We believe this transaction represents the first of several in the HPC space,” Tyler Page, CEO of Cipher Miner, said in a statement, referring to high-performance computing, an industry term that generally refers to AI.
Under the deal, Cipher Mining will repurpose its Bitcoin mining data center in Texas for AI services—and potentially expand its existing campus to accommodate increased demand.
This isn’t the first deal Google has helped broker a deal with a Bitcoin miner. In August, TeraWulf announced that it had struck a $3.7 billion deal to lease out a data center it owns in western New York to Fluidstack. Google agreed to backstop $1.8 billion of the deal and received 8% in TeraWulf equity.
Bitcoin to AI
Google’s tie-ups with Cipher Mining and TeraWulf come as AI developers look to amass more and more computing power to stay competitive in an industry arms race. On Monday, OpenAI announced a plan with the chip developer Nvidia to build AI data centers that would consume as much electricity as the entirety of New York City and San Diego combined.
But AI giants like OpenAI or Google aren’t just tapping established chipmakers. They’re also looking for help from Bitcoin miners.
Bitcoin mining refers to the act of solving complex mathematical puzzles to process transactions between holders of the cryptocurrency as well as introduce new Bitcoins into circulation. The largest Bitcoin miners own fleets of specialized computers in large data warehouses to compete for new tranches of the cryptocurrency.
While AI data warehouses have different servers and require different networks, the similarities between mining Bitcoin and powering AI haven’t been lost on crypto companies.
CoreWeave, for example, pivoted from mining the cryptocurrency Ethereum to building out AI data warehouses. Its customers include OpenAI, Google, Cloudflare, and a suite of Big Tech firms. The company went public in March and is worth about $65 billion, as of Thursday afternoon.
Other Bitcoin miners have tried to replicate CoreWeave’s pivot, including Core Scientific, which CoreWeave agreed to acquire in July for $9 billion. Core Scientific shareholders have since pushed back on the deal, arguing that the purchase price undervalues the Bitcoin miner.

AI Meets Bitcoin: The Stargate Factor
The timing couldn't be better. OpenAI, SoftBank and partners just unveiled a $400 billion Stargate data center initiative spanning nearly 7 GW, with two of its newest Texas sites landing right next to existing mining hubs. Shackelford County sits near IREN Ltd's (NASDAQ: IREN) 2 GW Sweetwater facility, while Milam County neighbors Riot Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ: RIOT) 700 MW Rockdale complex. SoftBank already owns ~2.65% of Cipher, tying another thread between AI buildouts and crypto infrastructure.
This geographic clustering matters. Texas offers cheap power, a deregulated grid and a political climate welcoming to both AI and crypto. The overlap could create operational synergies and capital flow tailwinds for miners like Riot, IREN and Cipher as investors begin to view them less as pure bitcoin proxies and more as energy-intensive infrastructure players.
Cipher's New Profile
What sets Cipher apart now is credibility. Google's equity exposure isn't just financial — it's a vote of confidence Cipher can deliver reliable hosting capacity at scale. That separates it from peers, giving the company access to long-duration capital while positioning it as a dual-track play: Bitcoin upside on one side, AI infrastructure on the other.
For a stock that's often traded in lockstep with Bitcoin price swings, this marks a potential rerating catalyst.
Investor Takeaway
Cipher Mining is no longer just a high-beta Bitcoin miner — it's a call option on AI infrastructure growth in Texas. With Google and SoftBank on the cap table, and Stargate bringing massive data centers into the same energy ecosystem, the stock sits squarely at the intersection of two of the market's hottest narratives.
Investors betting on Cipher Mining aren't just buying crypto exposure — they're buying into the AI-energy land grab.

(Reuters) -Google and app developer Flo Health will pay $56 million to settle a class action claiming they violated the privacy of millions of Flo app users by collecting information about their menstrual health cycles and using it for targeted advertising.
Settlement terms were disclosed late Tuesday in San Francisco federal court, and require approval by U.S. District Judge James Donato.
Google, a unit of Alphabet, would pay $48 million, while Flo would pay $8 million. Flurry, a now-defunct mobile analytics company, settled for $3.5 million in March.
A fourth defendant, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, did not settle, and was found liable by a jury on August 4 after a two-week trial.
Meta is expected to appeal the verdict. A hearing to consider damages is scheduled for September 30. Google settled two weeks before the trial began, and Flo settled shortly before the trial ended. Both denied wrongdoing.
Flo app users alleged that between November 2016 and February 2019 Flo shared personal information related to their menstrual periods and pregnancies with the other defendants, despite promising to keep it confidential.
They said this violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act, which carries statutory penalties of $5,000 per violation, theoretically justifying billions of dollars in damages.
Google said in a statement on Thursday that no data were used for ads, and customers are prohibited from using Google Analytics to collect health information protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Meta declined to comment. Flo and lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Under the agreement between xAI and the General Services Administration (GSA), federal agencies will be charged 42 cents to use xAI’s chatbot Grok for a year and a half. OpenAI and Anthropic are offering their enterprise and government versions of ChatGPT and Claude, respectively, for $1 for a year.
The steep discount for federal agencies includes access to xAI engineers to help integrate the technology.
The price point is either part of a running joke Musk has of using variations of 420, a marijuana reference, or a nod to one of Musk’s favorite books, “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” which references the number 42 as the answer to the meaning of life and the universe.
Earlier this year, xAI had been close to being approved as a GSA vendor, but after Grok began generating antisemitic posts and calling itself “MechaHitler” on X, the planned partnership reportedly fell through. In late August, internal emails obtained by Wired revealed the White House had instructed the GSA to add xAI’s Grok to the approved vendor list “ASAP.”
The company was also one of several AI firms, including Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, to be selected for a $200 million contract with the Pentagon.
After President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Musk formed and led the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in a rampant cost-cutting spree that has seen mixed results. During that time, Musk placed several aides at the GSA and other government agencies responsible for regulating or awarding government contracts in industries in which Musk has business."

- Google is backstopping a deal between AI compute company Fluidstack and Bitcoin miner Cipher.
- The deal will give Google the right to buy a 5.4% stake in Cipher.
- This isn't the first time Google has invested in the Bitcoin mining space.
Google is diving deeper into the Bitcoin mining world after backing a deal that gives the tech giant a more than 5% stake in Nasdaq-listed miner Cipher.
Cipher announced Thursday that it signed a 10-year high-performance computing colocation agreement with AI cloud platform Fluidstack, a premier AI cloud platform. The deal will see Cipher deliver 168 MW of critical IT load, supported by a maximum of 244 MW of gross capacity, at its Barber Lake site in Colorado City, Texas.
Google said it will backstop $1.4 billion of Fluidstack's lease obligations to support project-related debt financing and will receive warrants to acquire approximately 24 million shares of Cipher common stock—or 5.4% pro forma equity ownership stake.
""We are thrilled to be working with Fluidstack to develop HPC data centers, and we look forward to welcoming Google as an investor in Cipher,"" Tyler Page, the Bitcoin miner's CEO, said.
""This transformative transaction reinforces our HPC momentum as we continue to attract attention for our large and growing pipeline of sites. We believe this transaction represents the first of several in the HPC space as we continue to scale our capabilities and strengthen our position in this rapidly growing sector.""
Cipher's stock (CIFR) was trading 9% lower on Thursday at $12.81 per share, per YahooFinance data.
Google did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.
The Bitcoin mining space, which uses huge amounts of energy, is increasingly intertwined with HPC data centers.
Both crypto mining and the AI industry use huge amounts of energy, and when Bitcoin's price falls and minting new digital coins isn't generating enough revenue, some miners have pivoted their infrastructure to address AI demand.
Last month, the tech giant Bitcoin miner TeraWulf announced that Google was providing an incremental $1.4 billion backstop to support project-related debt financing, upping its total stake to $3.2 billion.
In exchange, Google would receive warrants to buy 32.5 million shares of the sustainable Bitcoin miner, the announcement said at the time."

Google Search for Royal Restrooms
SAVANNAH, Ga., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After 62 days of an unexplained suspension from Google's local listings, Royal Restrooms is taking action to resolve the issue and raise awareness about what it sees as systemic problems within Google's platform. The company, a pioneer in the portable restroom trailer industry for over two decades, has been suspended for ""deceptive practices"" without clear explanation, effectively erasing its local search presence.
While Royal Restrooms has followed Google's appeals process, its local Business Profiles remain in a ""systems check"" limbo. This digital purgatory has not only caused significant financial strain but has also revealed what the company believes are critical breakdowns in Google's ecosystem, including issues with intellectual property protection and fair business practices.
In response, Royal Restrooms is launching a campaign to bring attention to the issue and advocate for changes that would benefit all businesses that rely on local search. This includes a public call for Google to provide a clear path to resolution and to address two key concerns:
-
The Brand-Name Betrayal: Despite investing millions to build its brand, Royal Restrooms is seeing its trademarked name actively used by Google’s suggestion algorithm to promote competitor ad campaigns. This allows competitors to capitalize on the brand's name recognition, an issue the company says goes beyond Google's stated advertising policy.
-
The Inequitable Local Ad Ecosystem: Royal Restrooms believes Google’s local advertising platform prioritizes ad revenue over user relevance by allowing service-based businesses to advertise as ""local"" regardless of their physical location. This practice, the company argues, misleads users and undermines genuine local businesses.
""We've spent over two decades building the Royal Restrooms brand and investing in this platform,"" said David Sauers, Co-founder of Royal Restrooms. ""The irony is not lost on us: while our organic visibility has been stripped away, we're forced to spend more on ads just to be seen, all while our competitors can bid on our trademarked name with Google's encouragement. We are taking action to not only get our business back online but to challenge Google to create a more equitable and transparent system for all businesses.""
The company is committing to raising these issues with the media and relevant industry groups, hoping to initiate a broader conversation about fair business practices in the digital advertising landscape."

Key Notes
- Naver Financial is set to acquire Dunamu, operator of Upbit.
- Following the acquisition, the company reportedly wants to debut a stablecoin.
- Naver’s 40 million users could streamline Upbit sign-ups, boosting adoption.
South Korea’s fintech and tech giant Naver is reportedly preparing to acquire Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, the fourth-largest crypto exchange by volume.
The deal, expected to be executed via a stock swap, would bring Upbit under the umbrella of Naver Financial, expanding the group’s influence from internet services to crypto.
Strategic Expansion into Crypto and Stablecoins
Naver, often called South Korea’s Google, has built a vast ecosystem spanning search, e-commerce, digital payments, and global content platforms.
Industry sources revealed that Naver plans to launch a Korean won-backed stablecoin following the acquisition, leveraging Dunamu’s blockchain infrastructure and Upbit’s dominant role in crypto trading.
Interestingly, South Korea’s crypto industry has exploded under President Lee Jae-myung, who has advanced pro-crypto legislation, including steps toward stablecoin regulations.
Users, Payments, and Blockchain Infrastructure
Naver boasts over 40 million monthly active users, a base that could dramatically simplify and expand Upbit registrations through integrated authentication and streamlined KYC.
Naver Pay, already one of South Korea’s largest payment platforms, could incorporate stablecoins to improve efficiency and cut fees, while Dunamu would capture blockchain-related revenues through its GIWA Chain and transaction infrastructure.
Upbit’s current 10 million users, when merged with Naver’s reach, could accelerate adoption across payments and crypto services, according to Tiger Research Reports.
The integration would not only reduce frictions in crypto sign-ups but also establish a unified ecosystem where stablecoins become a practical part of daily commerce, both online and offline.
The report stated that Upbit could play the role of an on/off-ramp since stablecoins and cryptocurrencies have yet to go mainstream for payments.
Beyond Finance: Content and Global Reach
Naver Webtoon, which generates billions in revenue, could leverage Dunamu’s blockchain technology for on-chain intellectual property management, fan economies, and new monetization models, noted Tiger Research Reports.
Beyond Webtoon, platforms such as Poshmark and Naver’s advertising arm could also see blockchain-driven innovations, from programmable payments to tokenized assets.
The market has already reacted strongly, with Naver’s stock jumping over 11.4% following the reports. Both companies have denied finalizing the acquisition, while market participants compare the deal to Google acquiring Coinbase, the leading American exchange.

The US company reiterated its opposition Thursday to the sweeping rules, which the EU implemented last year to protect consumers and ensure that big tech firms don’t abuse their dominance of internet spheres from mobile apps to search engines. In a blog post, the iPhone maker stressed it was complying but urged regulators to look more closely at their impact on people and companies across the region. Apple went further in remarks submitted separately to the European Commission, asking the watchdog to repeal or scale back the regulation.
Apple has previously made clear its opposition to the Digital Markets Act, which lays out a series of dos and don’ts for the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google Search, Apple’s Safari, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook among others. It’s intended to head off competition violations by tech firms before they take root, and fines for violations can be as much as 10% of global revenue — or as much as 20% in the case of repeated breaches.
“It’s become clear that the DMA is leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU. It’s exposing them to new risks, and disrupting the simple, seamless way their Apple products work together,” Apple wrote in its blog post. “The DMA also isn’t helping European markets. Instead of competing by innovating, already successful companies are twisting the law to suit their own agendas — to collect more data from EU citizens, or to get Apple’s technology for free.”
Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Tariffs: QuickTake
Apple singled out the danger to users from being forced to host external payments services and allow sideloading — or the downloading of apps from third-party marketplaces. That may expose iPhone users to malware or scams, it argued. Allowing other companies to request user data — as stipulated under the Act — may compromise sensitive information, it said.
The commission said it will not repeal or change the DMA in response to Apple’s complaints.
“Apple has contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application,” the European Commission’s spokesperson for tech sovereignty, Thomas Regnier, told reporters on Thursday. “We get it that companies want to defend their profits at all costs, but that’s not what the DMA is about — the DMA is about giving consumers in the EU more choice and giving our businesses the possibility to compete fairly.”"

Two that stand out to me right now are Alphabet (GOOGL 1.86%) (GOOG 1.81%) and Toast (TOST -1.20%). Both have attractive valuations given where these businesses are headed over the next few years.
Alphabet
Alphabet has put a lot of the bear arguments to bed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is not disrupting Google Search; instead, it is a complement that is helping drive growth. Search revenue growth accelerated last quarter as Google's AI Overviews and AI Mode are bringing in more queries, as are features such as Lens and Circle to Search.
The Department of Justice decision was another major win because Alphabet gets to keep its distribution edge with Chrome and Android, and its Apple deal stays largely intact. Billions of people still start their internet sessions with Google, and most users stick with the defaults they are given.
Cloud computing, meanwhile, continues to be one of Alphabet's most exciting opportunities. Google Cloud revenue surged 32% last quarter and segment profits more than doubled, as the business is showing strong operating leverage as it scales. Demand for AI infrastructure is so hot that Alphabet said capacity constraints may last into next year. As a result, it upped its capital expenditures (capex) for this year by $10 billion to $85 billion to capture this growing opportunity.
What sets Alphabet apart, though, is that it is vertically integrated, which gives it a cost advantage and more upsell opportunities. Gemini has become one of the best foundation large language models (LLMs) out there, while it is also a leader in other areas such as data analytics and Kubernetes, which are software packages that bundle apps with everything they need to run. Its also developed its own highly regarded custom AI chips, and even owns one of the largest private fiber networks in the world. Its pending acquisition of Wiz, meanwhile, will help establish it as a leader in data center security.
But that's not Alphabet's only big shot on goal. Its Waymo robotaxi business has a big head start in the U.S. and is expanding quickly. Meanwhile, its quantum computing team is making progress on error rates with its Willow chip. Put all of that together and Alphabet has a lot of growth opportunities in the years ahead. Best of all, the stock is still attractively priced, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 times 2026 analyst earnings estimates.
Toast
Toast has been growing quickly, but the stock has come under pressure after analysts at Baird noted that the maker of gross profits -- is nearly $13,000 per location, so these cuts on a small subset of its business aren't going to have a huge impact.
recently slashed prices for its starter kits. However, these price cuts need some context. These are generally starter packages for smaller restaurants. Toast's annual recurring revenue (ARR) -- which is its software revenue plus payment processingHowever, the price reductions do give it a better chance to get into newer restaurants that are just opening up, and if it can help make them successful, it will benefit down the line. Its payment processing fees, also notably, haven't changed. This gives it the opportunity to grow with new customers over time, both through payment processing and as restaurants need more modules as they grow.
The company just added a record 8,500 new locations in the last quarter, so it's not suddenly slashing prices because business has fallen off a cliff. Meanwhile, it continues to benefit from the trend of households continuing to spend more money on food away from home. Toast is also gaining traction with enterprise chains, grocery stores, and in international markets, which gives it multiple new growth levers outside its core U.S. restaurant base.
With the pullback, the stock now trades at an enterprise value-to-ARR multiple of 9 times my 2025 ARR projections of $2.1 billion based on company estimates, which is inexpensive given that ARR is growing close to 30% a year. This sell-off looks way overdone, and now is a great time to pick up the stock on this pullback."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-25T14:00:00,3 Top Bargain Stocks Ready for a Bull Run,These three tech stocks are cheap and have plenty of growth ahead.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=59a827b1cf47631c3577614fa11588348ddee80e22896f19807acfa033858b2b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/3-top-bargain-stocks-ready-for-a-bull-run/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/3-top-bargain-stocks-ready-for-a-bull-run/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/3-top-bargain-stocks-ready-for-a-bull-run/,fool.com,200.0,,"Markets are back near all-time highs, but that doesn't mean that bargains can't still be found, even in the tech sector. There are still tech stocks trading at attractive valuations with strong long-term growth runways ahead of them.
Let's look at three to buy right now.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Even though its stock is up about 35% this year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.33%) still trades at an attractive valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 24 times 2026 analyst earnings estimates. This is a bargain for a company that is arguably the most important one in the semiconductor space. Without its technological expertise and scale, there would be no artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom.
TSMC manufactures almost all of the world's most advanced chips, as competitors have not been able to match its ability to consistently produce chips at smaller nodes with high yields. For advanced chip technology to advance, manufacturers need to consistently shrink node sizes, which is the number of transistors that can fit on a chip. This allows new generations of advanced chips, like graphics processing units (GPUs), to become more powerful and energy-efficient.
TSMC is the only foundry that's been able to continually shrink nodes while maintaining high yields. That has made it the go-to partner for chipmakers and a critical cog in the semiconductor value chain. It's also given it strong pricing power and a long runway of growth. Management expects AI chip demand to grow at a more than 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028.
Between its growth and valuation, TSMC looks like one of the smartest ways to invest in AI right now.
Alphabet
Despite its strong run this year, Alphabet (GOOGL 1.86%) (GOOG 1.81%) is still cheap at about 24 times 2026 earnings estimates. That's a discount to most of its mega-cap peers, despite its business being more diversified and arguably more durable.
The market is worried that AI would eat into Google Search, but search revenue growth has actually accelerated as Alphabet has rolled out new AI features like AI Overviews and Circle to Search. These tools are driving more engagement and helping the company monetize even more queries.
The recent Department of Justice decision also removed a major overhang, letting Alphabet keep its search deal with Apple and retain control of Chrome and Android. That allows the company to keep its huge distribution edge. Chrome still dominates the browser market, and Android runs nearly three-quarters of smartphones, which means most users continue to access the internet through Google by default.
Alphabet also has one of the fastest-growing cloud computing platforms, with Google Cloud revenue up 32% last quarter and profits more than doubling. Cloud demand remains strong as companies continue to rush to build AI tools and models on cloud infrastructure. This is lifting all boats in the space, but Alphabet has an advantage with its own custom AI chips and Gemini models, which help with both performance and cost.
Between search, cloud, and emerging bets like its Waymo robotaxi business, Alphabet has multiple ways to keep growing, and the stock's current valuation doesn't reflect that upside.
Pinterest (PINS 0.57%) is another bargain stock in the tech space that has been benefiting from AI. The stock trades under 16 times 2026 earnings, which is very cheap for a company growing revenue in the mid-teens and expanding operating margins. The photo-sharing site has been transformed under CEO Bill Ready, becoming far more shoppable and much more attractive to advertisers as a result.
The company has built its own multimodal AI model, which it is using to power visual search and help personalize recommendations. This is giving users a better experience and helping them find things they want to buy more easily. Advertisers are also seeing better results thanks to automation tools like Performance+, which handle campaign creation, targeting, and bidding.
That is helping Pinterest grow average revenue per user (ARPU), where it has historically lagged. Meanwhile, a partnership with Alphabet is helping it better monetize emerging market users.
Last quarter, its international ARPU grew 26% in Europe and 44% in the rest of the world, but the company still has a long way to go until it closes the gap with its peers. Its site has also been attracting new users, with monthly active users also growing 11% to 578 million, led by strength in emerging markets.
The company also has a partnership with Amazon and a new one with Instacart that is making it easier for users to shop directly from its site.
Overall, Pinterest looks poised for several more years of strong growth, and the current valuation allows plenty of room for multiple expansion as those gains show up in earnings."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google said it has urged the U.S. Supreme Court to halt key parts of a judge's order that would force major changes to its app store Play, as it prepares to appeal a decision in a lawsuit brought by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games.
Google called the judge's order unprecedented, and said it would cause reputational harm, safety and security risks and put the company at a competitive disadvantage if allowed to take effect, according to a filing provided late on Wednesday by Google, which said it had submitted it to the court.
Epic sued Google in 2020, accusing it of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and pay for transactions within apps in violation of U.S. antitrust law, and won a jury trial in San Francisco in 2023.
The injunction issued in the case by U.S. District Judge James Donato last year requires Google to allow users to download rival app stores within its Play store and make Play's app catalog available to competitors. It also compels Google to allow developers to include external links in apps, enabling users to bypass Google's billing system.
Google in its Supreme Court filing said that the changes will have enormous consequences for more than 100 million U.S. Android users and 500,000 developers. It asked the court to decide by October 17 whether to put the order on hold.
Google said it plans to file its appeal to the Supreme Court by October 27, which could allow the justices to take up the case during their nine-month term that begins on October 6.
Epic in a statement said Google is relying on what it called ""flawed security claims"" to justify its control over Android devices.
""The court's injunction should go into effect as ordered so consumers and developers can benefit from competition, choices and lower prices,"" Epic said.
The jury, siding with Epic in the trial, found that Google illegally stifled competition. Donato subsequently issued the order directing Google to make changes to its app store.
Google has denied wrongdoing.
In July, a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, ruling that the record in Epic's lawsuit was ""replete with evidence that Google's anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance.""
The full 9th Circuit on September 12 declined Google's request to review the panel's decision.
Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, in a post on social media, praised the 9th Circuit's decision and said developers and consumers would soon benefit from it."

Collaboration to demonstrate breakthrough water harvesting technology at test facility in 2026
RONAN, Mont., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AirJoule Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRJ) (“AirJoule Technologies” or the “Company”), the leading technology platform that unleashes the power of water from air, today announced that the AirJouleTM system was named as one of three winners of the Net Zero Innovation Hub for Data Centers competition. The program, backed by Google, Microsoft, Data4, Vertiv, Schneider Electric, and Danfoss, connects European data center operators and suppliers to accelerate the industry’s path to net zero.
“Being selected as a winner by some of the world’s largest technology and infrastructure leaders is a powerful endorsement of the AirJouleTM platform,” said Matt Jore, Chief Executive Officer of AirJoule Technologies. “This collaboration allows us to demonstrate how AirJouleTM can both reduce water stress and improve cooling efficiency at scale—two of the most critical challenges facing the global data center industry.”
The competition requested proposals from companies across three themes: Next-Generation Data Center Technologies, Sector Coupling Technologies and Business Models, and Backup Power and Renewable Energy Storage. More than seventy companies applied, and AirJouleTM was ultimately chosen as one of three winners. AirJouleTM was the only winner focused on water usage in data centers, reflecting the unique potential of its platform to address water sustainability in mission-critical facilities.
As a winner, AirJoule Technologies has been invited to join the Net Zero Innovation Hub in early 2026 and to work with the group’s partners (Google, Microsoft, Data4, Vertiv, Schneider Electric, and Danfoss) to demonstrate AirJouleTM’s ability to utilize waste heat from data centers to produce pure water at a data center test facility. The results from this demonstration project will be used to inform further policy recommendations and net-zero reference designs for data centers.
“The Net Zero Start-Up Hub is designed to de-risk and accelerate breakthrough solutions. By supporting these winners and selected companies, we are helping them move from pilot to scalable deployment,” said Alberto Ravagni, CEO of the Net Zero Innovation Hub.
AirJouleTM’s selection as a winner of the Net Zero Innovation Hub competition underscores the growing importance of improving water sustainability in data center operations. Data centers use millions of gallons of water per day in their cooling systems, placing enormous stress on local watersheds. AirJouleTM’s technology platform can utilize waste heat from data centers to cost-effectively access the abundant water resources available in the atmosphere. Water harvested by AirJouleTM can be used for evaporative cooling, to replenish line losses in closed loop systems, or for local water replenishment programs."

This $7 Trillion Clue May Reveal The Truth.,"Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are trading at lofty valuations, causing some investors to worry that a bubble is about to burst.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=470cbf28d61e8ef2b3ba73a991c3d2000e32b3b1ff72cf03e5172372a84adf22,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,fool.com,200.0,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution fueled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to repeated all-time highs in recent years.
Much of this momentum can be traced to a small basket of companies. Relentless demand for AI vaulted Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%), Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing into the trillion-dollar club. Established giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla have each enjoyed a new wave of investor enthusiasm.
Yet with valuations stretched to historic levels, some investors may worry that the AI trade is drifting toward bubble territory. A new report from consultant firm McKinsey & Company, however, offers a different perspective: a $7 trillion clue that could reshape how skeptics view the future of AI.
Data center capacity is just getting started
According to McKinsey's forecast, global data center capacity is set to nearly triple by 2030 -- climbing from 82 gigawatts today to 219 gigawatts at the start of the next decade.
Crucially, roughly 70% of this growth will be driven by AI workloads, while the remainder will be tied to traditional cloud and information technology (IT) applications.
In total, McKinsey projects that capital expenditures to fund this infrastructure expansion could approach $7 trillion over the next five years.
Why do these trends matter for AI valuations?
During the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco traded at peak price-to-sales (P/S) multiples between 30 and 40. Today, skeptics contend that some AI leaders are exhibiting similar signs of excess -- with some trading at elevated P/S and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios relative to historic norms. Tesla and Palantir Technologies, in particular, stand out with valuations that may be stretched to unsustainable levels.
But the comparison to the dot-com era overlooks some critical differences. At the height of internet euphoria, many technology darlings had minimal sales traction, persistent cash burn, and valuations built on metrics such as clicks and user growth.
By contrast, AI already enjoys enterprise-grade adoption across industries ranging from cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research to autonomous systems, retail, and robotics.
What's more, McKinsey's data indicates that companies can count on continued cash flow as data center spending continues.
Put simply, as AI infrastructure continues to increase rapidly, the revenue and profits generated by companies powering this accelerated transformation are likely to translate into sustained premium valuations over time.
$7 trillion of opportunity suggests long-term upside
History's prior bubbles were primarily supported by hope, which can be fleeting. However, continuous spending on chips, servers, networking gear, and efficient energy systems is converging on the next generation of products and services that can be measured and benchmarked against financial growth.
Far from signaling a bubble, the upcoming $7 trillion investment marks the first wave of an infrastructure supercycle reshaping entire economies. In other words, this is the foundation for the next technology roadmap.
For investors, the takeaway is clear: Volatility is inevitable, but structural demand from AI is locked in. Semiconductor designers and manufacturers, cloud hyperscalers, and energy innovators sit at the center of this demand -- positioned to capture powerful secular tailwinds over the coming years.
Viewed in this context, today's investments represent early entries into a historic growth narrative that continues to expand. For long-term investors, megacap AI stocks remain some of the most compelling buy-and-hold opportunities in the modern AI infrastructure boom."

PERTH, Australia, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Locafy Limited (Nasdaq: LCFY, LCFYW) (“Locafy” or the “Company”), a global software-as-a-service technology company specializing in location-based digital marketing solutions, including AI-powered search engine optimization (AI SEO), today announced that LoHi Digital, a Denver-based digital marketing firm, has launched a new AI-driven marketing platform built on Locafy’s advanced technology suite, targeting U.S. Insurance brokers.
LoHi Digital is delivering Locafy’s Localizer solution, Locafy’s flagship product designed to help businesses secure top visibility in local search results. Localizer leverages proprietary technology to consistently deliver top three rankings in Google’s Map Pack, improved placement in organic search results and increased prominence in AI Search engines such as Grok, ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini. These outcomes directly drive leads and customer engagement. For agencies, Localizer offers a scalable, recurring-revenue product that delivers measurable ROI to their clients across competitive categories like insurance, home services, and healthcare.
Within its first week of adoption, 50 independently owned and operated State Farm agencies across the U.S. have adopted the platform, with hundreds more expected to join in the coming weeks and months as campaign results become evident. An additional 24 agencies have signed on in the first few days of the second week of adoption, bringing total participation to 74 agencies and currently representing more than US$51,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR), or over US$613,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR).
The platform combines Locafy’s proprietary technology, which accelerates visibility in both Google Map Pack and AI search rankings, with advanced campaign management, SEO tools, and localized lead generation. Leveraging Locafy’s AI-driven search capabilities, participating agencies are already beginning to achieve top rankings for competitive insurance-related searches in their local markets in both Google Map results and in AI search engines.
“This platform is built to scale with agency owners, reshaping how they market themselves by harnessing AI to deliver strategies that are efficient, powerful, and results-driven,” said Danielle DeFrances, founder of LoHi Digital.
Locafy CEO Gavin Burnett added, “Our mission is to make local businesses visible where customers are searching—whether on Google or AI platforms. Seeing the first 64 insurance agencies come on board so quickly underscores the demand for smarter, AI-driven marketing and validates the impact of our technology in highly competitive industries, such as insurance. We believe that the pace of adoption also highlights the ease of implementation and measurable ROI, creating a strong foundation for broader national rollouts.”"

- Global ad spending will be more robust than previously anticipated in 2025, with full-year growth now expected to increase 7.4% to $1.17 trillion, according to a Q3 update from WARC.
- The upward revision, the first WARC has issued in over a year, marks a 1.2 percentage-point jump from prior estimates published in June. Driving momentum are digital-first ad platforms, which will snap up nine in 10 dollars of incremental market growth, and what WARC described as a “pre-tariff windfall.”
- Social media is attracting a plurality of new ad dollars at 40.6% market share, while non-retail search and retail media will take up 22.2% and 21.5% of spend, respectively. Just three companies — Google owner Alphabet, Amazon and Meta — are positioned to take over half (55.8%) of global ad spend this year, excluding China.
Dive Insight:
As other industry watchers slash their ad-spending outlooks for 2025, WARC foresees more robust growth than anticipated just a few months ago. The researcher’s Q3 report, which takes a global versus U.S.-specific view, highlights how the digital triopoly of Amazon, Google and Meta continues to entrench its dominance amid a period of deep economic uncertainty. The findings also indicate that marketers enacted a blitz of activity in the second quarter, a “pre-tariff” period where many brands rushed to stockpile inventory and promote value ahead of expected price hikes.
On the latter point, social media spending spiked 20.2% year over year in Q2, well above prior projections of 12.4% growth and the equivalent of about $4.9 billion in additional value. WARC tracked “sharp” increases in spending from retailers on social media in Q2, with the category pouring more dollars into Meta-owned Instagram (18.8% growth) and TikTok (56.8% growth), whose future in the U.S. is still being sorted out. Retail is now the largest category on both of those platforms, per WARC monitoring assisted by Nielsen. Technology and consumer electronics, other verticals vulnerable to tariffs, recorded notable lifts in spending on those sites as well.
“Despite economic headwinds, including disruption to global trade and reduced purchasing power among consumers, brands are doubling down on Meta, Alphabet and Amazon, while emerging players like TikTok are growing fast but from smaller bases,” said James McDonald, director of data, intelligence and forecasting at WARC, in a statement. “The global market is set to nearly double in value since the pandemic, underscoring the resilience of advertising in a tougher economic climate.”
Retail media is on track to grow 13.7% in 2025, achieving $175 billion in spend, or a 14.9% share of the total global market. Like other pockets of digital, just a few companies loom large in retail media, with Amazon primed to account for over a third (35.4%) of its advertising pie. That said, retail media’s upward climb is set for a “marked slowdown,” with an average rate of growth of 12.6% over the next few years.
By contrast, traditional media channels, including newspapers, broadcast TV and radio, remain on the wane. A big upshot from WARC is that digital has firmly entrenched itself as the leading advertising engine in the post-pandemic world despite repeated fits of macro volatility. The firm estimates that the nominal value of the global ad market will effectively double by 2027 compared to 2020 figures, reaching about $1.36 trillion.
Not everyone is as optimistic about 2025’s prospects as the impact of tariffs are more strongly felt by brands. U.S. automotive and retail spending on digital ads is sharply retreating due to the trade war, eMarketer said in a report published earlier this week that somewhat conflicts with WARC’s assessment. Total digital spending in the U.S. is forecast to grow 9.5% YoY to $338.27 billion, per eMarketer, a revision two percentage points lower than earlier estimates.
Informa, which owns a controlling stake in Informa TechTarget, the publisher behind Marketing Dive, is also invested in WARC. Informa has no influence over Marketing Dive’s coverage."

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.29%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.37%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.34%.
Shares of the internet search leader have appreciated by 21.49% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.98%, and the S&P 500's gain of 3.08%.
Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Alphabet in its upcoming release. On that day, Alphabet is projected to report earnings of $2.3 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 8.49%. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $84.53 billion, indicating a 13.39% upward movement from the same quarter last year.
In terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $9.97 per share and a revenue of $334.62 billion, indicating changes of +24% and +13.38%, respectively, from the former year.
Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Alphabet. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the business performance and profit potential.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.
Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.29% downward. As of now, Alphabet holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
In terms of valuation, Alphabet is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 25.25. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 25.29, which means Alphabet is trading at a discount to the group.
It's also important to note that GOOGL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.7. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Internet - Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.7 as trading concluded yesterday.
The Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 100, which puts it in the top 41% of all 250+ industries."

The rating follows Google’s announcement of major AI integrations into Chrome.
Google has introduced the “next Chrome era,” which it believes is the “biggest upgrade to Chrome in its history.” Google AI has been integrated in Chrome across multiple levels, the firm noted.
Gemini in Chrome will be made available to AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in the US, with the firm anticipating its broader expansion to all users as agentic-driven costs start to come down.
“AI features include the ability to use Gemini in Chrome to schedule a booking (e.g., a haircut) or order items (e.g., groceries), and to compare and summarize information across tabs or other Google apps like Calendar, YouTube, and Maps. Additionally, AI Mode search results can be generated from the Chrome address bar (called the “omnibox”), while questions can be asked of details on a web page with contextually relevant answers. Simply put, this is the first step toward agents beginning to help internet browsers complete actions and find and summarize information at the browser level, enabling AI to bring tasks and information instead of the other way around. By Google leaning into distribution, we think it can win AI search.”
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company wholly owning the internet giant Google, amongst other businesses.

Another policy that lands hardest on the people least able to absorb it: entrepreneurs and small businesses. Last week, the President issued a proclamation requiring a $100,000 payment for each new H-1B visa petition. The intent is to protect American jobs. That’s a worthy goal, but if you subtract out politics and look at this from the ground level, the effect is devastating for smaller, fast-growing companies outside of major metro areas.
For Apple, Microsoft, or Google, $100,000 is peanuts. These companies already pay engineers $200,000 or $300,000 a year. Adding another $100,000 to bring on a skilled worker doesn’t move the needle for them. But if you’re running a small technology company in a city like Raleigh, Austin, Atlanta, or Denver, it’s a completely different story. The average salary for a software engineer in these places is closer to $130,000 to $150,000. Adding another $100,000 is like doubling the cost of an engineer. For a startup, that makes the H-1B untenable. It’s crippling. It’s the difference between hiring and not hiring.
I’ve lived this so I can say with certainty that for smaller, entrepreneurial ventures, every dollar matters. One new tax, one new rule, one new fee could knock these smaller companies out. That’s the daily reality for small business owners all over the country.
This is why the H-1B proclamation will have unintended consequences. It doesn’t just make life harder for entrepreneurs. It tilts the playing field further in favor of the biggest companies. They can keep hiring. They can keep attracting the best global talent.
And the irony is that small businesses are the real job creators. They are where new ideas come from. More than 60% of new jobs are created by small businesses, not large ones. They are the ones taking risks, building teams and creating opportunities in communities outside Silicon Valley. Here’s yet another example of a policy written as if the entire economy looks like San Francisco. It doesn’t.
There’s a simple fix here. Scale the fee based on company size or revenue. Let large companies pay the full amount. Let smaller companies pay less. That way, you discourage abuse of the visa system without shutting small businesses out of the talent pool. Because, at the end of the day, we want policies that protect American jobs, yes. But we also want policies that protect American entrepreneurs and American innovation, our most important strategic asset over the past 250 years.
If we keep building walls that only the biggest can climb, we’ll get an economy dominated by a few giants. Less competition leads to less innovation. Entrepreneurs deserve better. And, if we want the next generation of great American companies to come not just from Silicon Valley but from Raleigh, Atlanta, or Austin, we don’t need even more policies that crush them before they even get off the ground."

(Reuters) -AI startup Modular said on Wednesday it raised $250 million in a funding round valuing it at $1.6 billion, as it aims to challenge Nvidia's software stranglehold on the AI computing market.
The funding, which nearly tripled the company's valuation from two years ago, was led by U.S. Innovative Technology fund. DFJ Growth and all existing investors, including GV, General Catalyst and Greylock also joined the round.
Founded in 2022 by veteran engineers at Apple and Google, Modular's platform is designed to allow developers to run their AI applications across a variety of computer chips without having to rewrite code for each one. It now serves cloud providers such as Oracle and Amazon, as well as chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.
Nvidia controls over 80% of the high-end AI chip market, partly thanks to its proprietary CUDA software, which locks over 4 million global developers into its ecosystem.
Modular says it has adopted what it calls a ""Switzerland"" strategy to be a neutral software layer.
Chris Lattner, co-founder and CEO of Modular, said the goal is not to defeat the market leader. ""What we're focused on is not like pushing down Nvidia or crushing them. It's more about enabling a level playing field so that other people can compete,"" he said.
It plans to sell the software directly to enterprises on a consumption basis and through revenue-sharing partnerships with cloud providers.
The company's strategy has attracted investors betting on a multi-vendor future for AI hardware. Sam Fort, partner at DFJ Growth, compared Modular to ""VMware for the AI era"", which supported companies to work across CPUs.
""Modular is trying to create the AI hypervisor that will allow you to port workloads across different vendors,"" Fort said.
The company, with about 130 employees, plans to use the new capital to expand its engineering and go-to-market team. The funds will also help the company expand from its current focus on AI inference into the AI training market.

Meta last disclosed Instagram's user figures in 2022 when Zuckerberg said the app had hit more than 2 billion monthly active users.
Meta, previously known as Facebook, bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, a move that had raised questions about the company's strategy as the social media app had begun with just photo-sharing without significant revenue.
Since then the app has grown astronomically and some firms have estimated it will make up more than half of Meta's U.S. ad revenue this year.
A major factor contributing to Instagram's success is the Reels feature which launched in 2020 and allows users to create short-form content - a market that faces fierce competition from rivals such as TikTok and Google-owned YouTube shorts.
TikTok, owned by Chinese technology behemoth ByteDance, has more than 1 billion users globally who visit monthly, a company spokesperson said earlier this month.

The White House’s announcement Sept. 19 of a $100,000 fee sparked panic among employers and workers, particularly in the tech sector, which uses it to bring in trained engineers and programmers. A separate proposal released Tuesday would overhaul the annual lottery for H-1B visas, giving applicants with higher-paying job offers a better chance of being chosen.

Together, the changes amount to one of the most sweeping shifts for a program that’s long served as a pipeline for global talent to the US.
The initial frenzy has eased after officials clarified the fee wouldn’t apply to existing visa holders or renewals. But unease persists ahead of the 2026 lottery, even with a White House proposal for a national-interest exception that could cover doctors and certain other workers.
For businesses, one advantage of the wait-and-see approach is to avoid drawing the ire of the Trump administration, said Kathryn Wylde, chief executive officer of the Partnership for New York City.
“The president has the business community spooked with regard to any public criticism of his policies,” she said. The concern isn’t just the price tag, she added. “It’s the whole question of, ‘Is America withdrawing from the global economy?’”
Behind the scenes, companies including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have advised current H-1B holders and employees with pending petitions to return to the US immediately and avoid foreign travel.
The $100,000 fee, which took effect Sept. 21, and the new wage-based visa selection process are likely to face legal challenges. If the fee survives, it’s likely to reallocate visas toward higher-wage positions in sectors such as technology, finance and health care, while pushing out lower-wage positions in areas like education, Bloomberg Economics said in a report.
“Immigration has always been and will continue to be a very politically charged topic,” said Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business. “Wading into these waters carries incredible reputational risk, which is why companies don’t do it.”"

No longer do younger Americans turn to mom or dad to help set up their 401(k), understand their paycheck, or get investment advice—that’s because AI has become their new financial friend.
While AI has taken on roles ranging from break-up coach to health expert, tools like Open AI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini are now guiding younger generations to tackle their financial woes, from credit card debt to picking their latest stocks and ETFs.
In fact, two-thirds of adults who’ve used AI for financial advice say they’ve actually followed it—and 80% of those say it helped their finances, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by Intuit Credit Karma.
But here’s the catch: it’s far from foolproof. Over half of respondents who used AI for financial advice made a “poor financial decision or mistake” based on what it prompted them to do.
Unsurprisingly, those at pivotal points in their financial literacy journey are the most frequent users of AI, with around 82% of Gen Z and millennial AI users turning to it the most for money guidance.
They’ve turned to AI for financial guidance on a wide spectrum of topics, from basic personal finance and financial education to more complex matters like tax filing and investing. The most common areas of interest among AI users include goal setting and action plans (35%), budgeting and expense management (34%), optimizing savings (33%), and stock market investing (32%).
It’s also saving them the embarrassment of not knowing all the financial jargon. Three in four of those who used AI say that it allows them to ask the financial questions they’re too embarrassed to ask others.
People are turning to ChatGPT for more extreme scenarios like becoming a millionaire—but not without risk
Using AI for budgeting and investment plans may even be a modest use of the tool. Some are taking it much further, asking ChatGPT how to become a millionaire.
On TikTok, a creator even dubbed it “the 90-day millionaire challenge,” guiding her viewers to use the advice ChatGPT generated for her as a pathway to financial freedom.
Separately, another report from GoBankingrate turned to ChatGPT for advice on how to become a millionaire from a $60,000 salary.
“Becoming a millionaire on a $60,000 salary is absolutely possible, but it requires discipline, time, and smart financial decisions,” responded ChatGPT. The report broke down how you can “realistically” build a millionaire life, with steps including maximizing savings, growing your income, and more.
But experts warn it’s not all perfect, and advice should be left to human experts instead."

BofA hosted a call with Ben Legg, former chief executive of Ad Parlor, to assess recent sector trends. Analysts said, “Growth in 3Q has accelerated vs 2Q across most platforms and is tracking a few points above expectations.”
They added that “AI capabilities (including automated campaign management, AI-generated creative, and deeper data integration)” are supporting momentum.
Legg noted that AI-powered search is reducing search engine optimization traffic to third-party websites, but that shift is “benefiting sector (incl. Meta) as advertisers redirect more spend into paid channels.”
He is also said to have pointed to TikTok’s weakness as a near-term positive: “Declining spend on TikTok has been a sector tailwind, which could reverse if a TikTok U.S. sale deal is completed.”
Google Search is among the biggest beneficiaries. Legg observed that advertisers are seeing “expanded data & CRM integrations, along with native AI ad formats (like overlay and overview ads)” boost conversions and lift cost-per-clicks.
Looking ahead, he suggested Google could eventually “transition from a CPC to a transaction-based CPA model, optimizing for outcomes.”
Meta is also seeing “relatively strong” growth, according to Legg, who cited AI-driven targeting, adoption of overlay ads, rising Reels usage, and one-click shopping formats. He added that WhatsApp for Business is gaining traction following July’s pricing change.
On YouTube, Legg said growth has been “healthy (but in-line with expectations),” helped by Alphabet’s Gen-AI video creation tools, which lower barriers for advertisers and accelerate adoption.

The Alphabet-owned self-driving vehicle unit has launched “Waymo for Business,” a new service designed for companies to set up accounts so their employees can access robotaxis in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco.
Waymo announced Wednesday in a blog post it is inviting organizations to sign up for Waymo for Business. The new service will let businesses subsidize their employees’ rides or purchase promo codes in bulk, which can be handed out to clients, customers, or workers. The Waymo for Business rides will cost the same as its regular service.
One of Waymo’s first customers is Carvana, the Phoenix-based online used car marketplace.
While riders already use Waymo’s robotaxis to commute to work, this is the company’s first coordinated commercial effort to target corporations and other organizations. Waymo has said nearly one in six of its local riders in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix rely on Waymo to commute to work or school.
Today, users open the Waymo app (or in some cities like Austin, the Uber app) to hail a ride. That process won’t change for employees whose companies have signed up for Waymo for Business. What does change is the control companies can exert over the service.
Through the Waymo for Business service, companies have access to a business portal that gives the organizations control over their ride programs. Corporate customers can dictate the geographic area in which their employees use the robotaxis, set pickup and drop-off locations, monitor ride activity, and track their budget.
Waymo said it plans to bring its new business service to other cities like Washington, DC and Miami, once it has launched commercial operations in those markets.
Waymo has ramped up operations over the past 18 months making it the dominant robotaxi service provider in the United States. The company has expanded its commercial service from Phoenix to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, and Atlanta. More cities are slated for 2026.
But it’s also sought other means to attract customers beyond expanding its geographic footprint. Waymo has gained access to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, the San Jose Mineta International Airport, and soon the San Francisco Airport, unlocking a critical service that directly competes with ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft; it has also partnered with public transit services company Via, and even opened its robotaxis to teens (with a parent’s account)."

Launched in 2018, Google’s Data Commons organizes public datasets from a range of sources, including government surveys, local administrative data, and statistics from global bodies such as the United Nations. With the release of the MCP Server, this data is now accessible via natural language, allowing developers to integrate it into AI agents or applications.
AI systems are often trained on noisy, unverified web data. Combined with their tendency to “fill in the blanks” when sources are lacking, this leads to hallucinations. As a result, companies looking to fine-tune AI systems for specific use cases often need access to large, high-quality datasets. By publicly releasing the MCP Server for its Data Commons, Google aims to tackle both challenges.
Data Commons’ new MCP server bridges public datasets — from census figures to climate statistics — with AI systems that increasingly depend on accurate, structured context. By making this data accessible via natural language prompts, the release aims to ground AI in verifiable, real-world information.
“The Model Context Protocol is letting us use the intelligence of the large language model to pick the right data at the right time, without having to understand how we model the data, how our API works,” said Google Data Commons head Prem Ramaswami in an interview.
First introduced by Anthropic last November, MCP is an open industry standard that enables AI systems to access data from various sources, including business tools, content repositories, and app development environments, providing a common framework for understanding contextual prompts. Since its launch, companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google have adopted the standard for integrating their AI models with various data sources.
While other tech companies explored how to apply the standard to their AI models, Ramaswami and his team at Google began investigating how the framework could be used to make the Data Commons platform more accessible earlier this year.
Google has also partnered with the ONE Campaign, a nonprofit organization focused on improving economic opportunities and public health in Africa, to launch the ONE Data Agent. This AI tool utilizes the MCP Server to surface tens of millions of financial and health data points in plain language."

The company’s client base includes prominent industry leaders such as Apple, Samsung, Broadcom, Lumen, AT&T Inc. T and several others.
Corning is witnessing healthy traction in the consumer electronics segment. Apple, Inc. AAPL is set to invest $2.5 billion to develop all of iPhone and Apple Watch’s cover glass in Corning’s Kentucky manufacturing facilities. The investment is part of Apple’s broader strategy, a $600 billion multiyear investment plan in the United States. GLW is steadily expanding its Kentucky facility to create the most advanced glass production line and match Apple’s requirements. Apple’s competitor and another major smartphone manufacturer, Samsung, has also deployed Corning’s most advanced Gorilla Glass across its flagship smartphones. The company’s comprehensive client base also includes prominent players like OnePlus, Google, Xiaomi and others.
Major telecom company Lumen has accelerated the deployment of its network infrastructure in the United States. The company is leveraging Corning’s next-generation fiber optic cable in the venture. AT&T is also utilizing Corning’s next-generation fiber, cable and connectivity solutions to support its fiber network expansion across the United States. Corning has also entered into a multi-year collaboration with semiconductor giant Broadcom, Inc. AVGO. Broadcom is set to integrate GLW’s optical components for Broadcom’s Bailly CPO system. This will allow Broadcom to match the fast-growing connectivity and power efficiency requirements of large-scale AI Clusters.
Its U.S.-made solar products are also gaining solid market traction. T1 Energy Inc. recently opted to deploy Corning’s solar components to boost the reliability of its solar supply chain with U.S.-made solar components.
Corning has a strong manufacturing footprint in the United States and it has been steadily expanding its U.S. manufacturing capacity. The company is now reaping the benefits of this strategy. Amid growing geopolitical volatility and trade uncertainties several companies are looking to source domestically produced components to reduce supply chain uncertainty.
Other Tech Companies Benefiting From a Diverse Portfolio
Jabil, Inc.’s JBL focus on end-market and product diversification is a key catalyst. The company’s target that “no product or product family should be greater than 5% operating income or cash flows in any fiscal year” is commendable. Despite weakness in the network, electric vehicle and renewable energy end markets, Jabil is benefiting from strength in AI data center infrastructure, capital equipment and warehouse automation markets. Such diversifications increase reliability of Jabil’s earnings and revenues, thereby driving returns for investors in the long haul.
International Business Machines Corporation IBM also boasts a comprehensive portfolio. Its leading-edge innovations, hybrid cloud and AI solutions are utilized by clients across 175 countries in the world. IBM has a strong presence across multiple industries, including financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, retail and more.

The service competes with Pinterest’s collage feature, where users create mood boards using their favorite Pins and other images.
With Mixboard, however, there’s no need to have an established image collection to pull ideas from. Instead, users can start their own project using text prompts to have AI fill in the ideas. (Pre-populated boards you can edit are also available if you need a little help in the creativity department.)
The service is initially available as a public beta in the U.S. via Google Labs.
After you create images using AI, you can then ask the AI to make edits and other small changes, or even combine images. This leverages Google’s new image editing model, Nano Banana, which has been enthusiastically received for its ability to handle more complex edits and make realistic images.
Following its launch, Google’s Gemini AI app pushed ChatGPT out of the top spot on the U.S. App Store.
With Mixboard, Google is catering to user demand for Nano Banana by incorporating it in its own product, which it suggests could be used to brainstorm ideas involving home decor and design, event themes, DIY projects, and more, with both images and text.
Younger users have shown some interest in making digital mood boards.
Pinterest found viral success with a standalone collage-making app, Shuffles, which Gen Z users used to make creative TikTok videos. The app’s features were later integrated into Pinterest itself. Other startups have also explored this space, like Landing (now shuttered), the AI-powered creative app Verse (which seems to have inspired Mixboard), and more. Depop today also launched a collage-making tool to help its users to style and sell their fashion collections.
Mixboard’s mood boards can also be reimagined, Google says, using options that let you “regenerate” the images to get more ideas, or to ask the AI to generate “more like this.” Plus, the AI can generate text based on the images on users’ boards.
To try Mixboard, U.S. users can visit labs.google/mixboard to get started. A Discord community is also available."

The concern is straightforward: As consumers increasingly turn to chatbots to answer queries, Alphabet's long-standing dominance in Google Search could face disruption.
Since the bulk of the company's revenue comes from advertising fees tied to search, any erosion in Google's market share seemingly poses an existential threat to Alphabet's financial engine. On the surface, this bearish narrative is compelling. But the reality is far more nuanced.
Alphabet's financial resilience, strategic partnerships, and product evolution suggests that the company is not only prepared to defend its turf but may also emerge stronger in the face of rising competition.
Analyzing Alphabet's financial fortress
In the table below, I've summarized Alphabet's advertising revenue from Google Search over the past year:
| Category | Q3 2024 | Q4 2024 | Q1 2025 | Q2 2025 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Google Search revenue (in billions) | $49.4 | $54.0 | $50.7 | $54.2 |

Given the profile above, there is little evidence that ChatGPT or other large language models (LLMs) represent material headwinds for Google's dominance across the internet. The figures above suggest that advertisers continue to view Google as one of the most effective channels for capturing engagement and attention online.
What's even more critical to recognize is that Alphabet's advertising business operates at exceptionally high profit margins. This profitability provides the company with a powerful buffer. What I mean by that is if LLMs eventually chip away at Google's market share, Alphabet is still well-positioned to absorb the impact by reinvesting this cash flow into next-generation products -- a strategy the company is already executing today.
In recent years, Alphabet has poured significant resources into expanding its cloud infrastructure platform to better compete with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the heart of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is its custom-built hardware, Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These are specialized chips designed to handle advanced artificial intelligence (AI) workloads such as machine learning and deep learning.
In a striking development, OpenAI signed on as a major GCP client. The irony here is hard to dismiss: Even if ChatGPT diverts some internet traffic that might otherwise flow to Google, Alphabet still benefits financially on the back end by powering the very company allegedly threatening its leadership position.
Turning Google into an LLM
Alphabet's defensive posture extends well beyond monetization. The company has also integrated its own AI model, Gemini, across its ecosystem.
Within Google Search, users can now toggle into ""AI Mode"" -- effectively transforming the search experience into an LLM-powered interface. By embedding a ChatGPT-like experience natively into Google, the company layers its own generative AI capabilities into the familiar query box.
This approach delivers two major advantages. First, it preserves ingrained user habits -- making switching to other platforms less appealing. Second, it allows Alphabet to maintain robust advertising economics -- albeit in a reimagined format.
Together, these moves underscore a dual positioning: defending the core search business while simultaneously profiting from the very companies seeking disruption. Put differently, Alphabet isn't treating LLMs as a binary threat. Instead, the company has created a hedge that few can match -- making money whether users type a query into Google or send a prompt to ChatGPT.
Is now a good time to buy Alphabet stock?
While OpenAI currently commands much of the cultural and technological AI spotlight, Alphabet's response is more than simple defensive insulation. The company is actively reshaping its narrative -- repositioning itself as a business woven together by AI-powered services.
The valuation expansion outlined above suggests that investors are now just beginning to recognize the breadth of Alphabet's AI story. Yet, based on forward earnings, the market has not assigned the same premium to Alphabet as other beneficiaries of the AI revolution.
Alphabet may not have declared a ""checkmate"" against OpenAI, but it has clearly moved past a stalemate. With its shares trading at a steep discount to its peers, I see Alphabet stock as a compelling opportunity as the company's AI investments continue to bear fruit."

Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said in a latest program on CNBC that he believes Alphabet will have the “best app” in terms of AI. Niles said Alphabet’s biggest edge is the user data it has because of YouTube.
“I look at Google for the long term and I go, I think they’re going to have the best app in terms of AI,” Niles said, “Because if you think about it, what makes an AI app smart? It’s data. Well, they’ve got the most free data in the world because of YouTube. And so if you think about what’s the most expensive thing to create, it’s video. You combine that with the fact that it’s trading at a market multiple at 25 times.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe concerns around AI-related threats to Google search are overstated. Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. As of April, Google had over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews.
Google’s competitor OpenAI failed to impress the market with its GPT-5 model, while Gemini is gaining traction with new features. Analysts believe the company is strongly positioned to start placing ads in AI search results, which means its core ads business will not be impacted despite the decline in traditional search.
Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is successfully executing on its vast AI potential. The company’s key advantages – stemming from industry-leading models, a full-stack approach to technical infrastructure (including proprietary chips), access to high-quality data, rapidly improving product launch velocity and a robust distribution ecosystem of seven different apps with over two billion users each – are beginning to meaningfully widen Google’s moat and competitive differentiation in AI."

Data scientists and engineers leverage AI models from Google and AWS to scale small business lending
NEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biz2Credit, the parent company of Biz2X, which is an AI-powered small business lending platform, announced a partnership with Columbia University to tackle one of the toughest challenges in financial services: automating and scaling funding access for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The effort aims to apply artificial intelligence to transform SMB loan portfolios into a mainstream, investable asset class for private credit funds.
The initiative will be formally introduced at a private Biz2Credit/Biz2X-hosted Thought Leadership Forum in New York City during UN Assembly Week (September 22). Jeffrey Sachs, Professor at Columbia University and President of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network will provide remarks to a gathering of financial leaders, dignitaries and policymakers. Further event dates to be announced in the coming weeks.
The Biz2Credit/Biz2X-Columbia partnership has three core elements:
-
An AI Research Program with Columbia University faculty and graduate students from the School of Engineering and Data Science Institute.
-
Development of proprietary Biz2X AI models, guided by the research, leveraging Google and AWS AI solutions, Biz2X’s proprietary SMB lending data.
-
Thought Leadership Forums to showcase research and practical insights to the financial community.
“Small businesses are the growth engine of economies worldwide, but they remain systematically underfunded,” said Rohit Arora, CEO of Biz2X. “By combining Columbia’s research leadership with Biz2X’s long-standing expertise and data, we can democratize and transform SMB finance into a scalable, investable asset class and unlock new private credit flows to business owners globally.”
Jeffrey Sachs, University Professor at Columbia University, added: “This partnership demonstrates how cutting-edge research and advanced technologies can promote economic inclusion and economic growth. Improved access to finance for small businesses fosters innovation, job creation, and long-term resilience in both high-income and emerging economies.”
Projected impact: Lenders who adopt the AI features that Biz2X has developed could see loan approval times cut in half and a 30% increase in lending volumes. Biz2Credit projects over $500 million in additional small business credit unlocked annually in its own portfolio. At scale, the model could close the SME financing gap to unlock up to $750 billion in private credit for U.S. small businesses, and boost GDP by as much as $1.3 trillion annually. In emerging markets like the Middle East, the approach could generate an incremental $250 billion in SME financing and support up to 16 million new jobs."

MIAMI, September 24, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TelevisaUnivision, the world’s leading Spanish-language media company, today announced the launch of its nationwide advertising campaign, ""Do the Right Thing Google."" The campaign calls attention to Google’s YouTube TV and its plan to discriminate against Hispanic viewers by removing Univision from its main programming bundle on September 30. YouTube TV will force millions of Hispanic viewers to pay an 18% premium – a ""Hispanic tax"" – to maintain access to trusted Spanish-language news, sports, and entertainment.
The campaign will run in USA Today and major metropolitan newspapers including Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, San Antonio, Austin, Richmond, Arizona, Las Vegas, Orlando, and Newark, as well as The Hill in Washington, D.C.
""Google’s planned removal of Univision from YouTube TV on September 30 is an unacceptable threat to millions of Hispanic households who rely on our programming for trusted news, vital information, and cultural connection,"" said Daniel Alegre, CEO of TelevisaUnivision. ""Stripping access to Univision at such a critical time shows a blatant disregard for the communities we serve. We call on Google to respect its Hispanic subscribers and keep Univision within its core programming bundle.""
The threat to drop Univision also comes at a critical time for Hispanics, a major voting segment that will be decisive in redistricting battles in Texas and California, gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, and next year’s midterm elections in battleground states like Florida and Georgia where control of Congress is at stake. Univision is a trusted voice for Hispanic Americans, especially in times of emergencies, elections and for other critical news and events. Google’s decision to relegate Univision and its audience to second class status will have consequences at the expense of the Hispanic community. This campaign is to raise awareness among Hispanics, elected officials and the general public to ensure this does not happen.
TelevisaUnivision remains committed to fighting discrimination, advocating for a level playing field for Hispanics and their access to programming, and ensuring the voices of its Hispanic audience are heard and respected.

WACO, Texas, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VoIP-Pal.com Inc. (OTCQB: VPLM) announced it has filed and served two amended antitrust lawsuits—one individual and one nationwide class action—against Apple, Google, and Samsung. These filings expand the Company’s litigation portfolio to four active cases, joining earlier actions against AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Link to all complaints.
The suits allege a common Sherman Act § 2 violation—tying cellular calling and texting to Wi-Fi Calling in order to lock out competition and inflate profits. The actions are pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and can be viewed through the following links: 1:24-cv-03051; 1:24-cv-03054; 1:25-cv-01843; and 1:25-cv-01970 (two direct actions and two nationwide class actions).
According to the filings, carriers provide the “key” (SIM/eSIM entitlements and IMS/E911/QoS profiles) while Apple, Google, and Samsung enforce the “lock” through operating-system and firmware rules. Native Wi-Fi Calling only works when validated by a carrier key, preventing subscribers from using independent providers on their own devices. Rivals like VoIP-Pal are denied parity—unable to trigger the default dialer, appear in call logs, or access emergency and quality-of-service functions—leaving consumers stuck with degraded “app-mode” alternatives.
The impact is nationwide. More than 373 million U.S. mobile subscribers already fund broadband and Wi-Fi capable of carrying these calls, yet still must buy tied bundles to unlock native calling. A family of four may pay about $220 per month under the current structure, compared to a potential stand-alone alternative as low as $20 per month. Plaintiffs allege this “no bundle, no native” rule preserves over $560 billion in annual gross profits for defendants while foreclosing competition.
Emil Malak, CEO of VoIP-Pal, said:
“Our 6,000 shareholders and millions of mobile subscribers want something simple—choice and fairness. Families shouldn’t have to pay twice. Since beginning this journey in 2005, we’ve secured more than 40 patented technologies in the VoIP field. We intend to responsibly monetize those innovations while protecting our shareholders’ rights and every consumer’s right to choose stand-alone Wi-Fi Calling.
By commandeering subscribers’ own devices and Wi-Fi, defendants are enforcing a ‘no bundle, no native’ rule that denies consumers true choice. Through this litigation, we are standing up for consumers, defending our investors, and working to restore real competition in the marketplace. We have been engaged in litigation for more than a decade, and we sincerely hope the Defendants and their directors will join us in pursuing a fair solution that benefits consumers and shareholders alike.”"

Alphabet Investment Narrative Recap
Owning Alphabet means believing that ongoing innovation in AI, YouTube, and Google Cloud will outpace risks from regulatory pressure and ad market shifts. The latest antitrust trial puts Alphabet’s digital advertising dominance under a microscope and introduces significant near-term uncertainty, as court-ordered remedies could alter the company’s most critical business line; this risk currently outweighs positive momentum from AI-driven growth or margin gains. For now, scrutiny around ad tech remains the biggest short-term catalyst and the major risk to watch.
Among recent announcements, the Magnite lawsuit over Google’s ad technology stands out for its direct connection to regulatory scrutiny. As legal outcomes unfold, potential changes to Alphabet’s ad stack or market position could influence its revenue mix and impact how quickly new AI or Cloud initiatives offset any headwinds.
Yet in contrast to the current optimism, investors should recognize the real possibility that regulatory intervention could force structural change to Alphabet’s business model and...

Since launching in 2011, the 661,000-square-meter development has evolved into one of the country’s most significant innovation hubs. It’s home to more than 1,800 startups, research centers, and global tech firms, all packed into a district that feels more like a laboratory for South Korea’s future than a suburb of Seoul.
Big names are everywhere in Pangyo Techno Valley, including Naver, often described as Korea’s Google, and Kakao, the country’s everything app. Gaming powerhouses Nexon and NCSoft anchor the district alongside industrial heavyweights like shipbuilder HD Hyundai and cybersecurity pioneer AhnLab. Samsung Electronics, semiconductor giant SK Hynix, and Hyundai’s autonomous vehicle division 42dot all maintain significant presences. Yet despite this concentration of tech talent and capital, industry insiders question whether Pangyo truly deserves its Silicon Valley comparison.
“Pangyo is absolutely Korea’s most concentrated hub for software, gaming, platforms, and AI,” says Hyoungchul Choi, CEO of Portologics, who founded his company there five years ago. But he’s skeptical of the Silicon Valley label. “The nickname is convenient, but we shouldn’t overstate our global influence. Silicon Valley isn’t just about density — it’s built on decades of international capital flows, risk-taking culture, and its ability to attract talent worldwide. We’re not there yet.”
The statistics back up this more modest assessment. As of a year ago, Pangyo Techno Valley was predominantly home to smaller players, with approximately 91.5% of its companies being small and midsize businesses, with Big Tech accounting for just 3.6% and the remaining 4.9% made up of public or government organizations, according to PTV’s official website.
Janice Sa, a principal at Z Venture Capital, who has been working in Pangyo for more than a decade, sees the district’s influence waning.
“With giants like Kakao, Naver, Nexon, and NCSoft all in one place,” the PTV’s title of Korea’s Silicon Valley “still makes sense,” she says. But compared to 10 years ago, the district doesn’t feel quite as dominant as the country’s go-to tech hub, Sa said. “Back then, startups were flocking to Pangyo. Today, many are heading back to Gangnam [in Seoul].” The reasons, she added, boil down to talent and capital. “Young developers and engineers still gravitate toward Gangnam, and most venture capital firms are packed along Teheran Street, the city’s main tech corridor lined with startups, Big Tech offices, and investors. For hiring and fundraising, that makes Gangnam the easier choice.”"

Cloudflare and Coinbase are launching the x402 Foundation to establish a universal standard for AI-driven payments, enabling machines to pay for web resources without human intervention automatically.
The protocol converts the HTTP “402 Payment Required” error code into a functional payment system, enabling AI agents to purchase data, services, and content directly.
Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, called x402 “a big step forward” that allows AI agents to “transact value, not just exchange info.”
The protocol addresses a fundamental problem in the current payment systems, which were designed for humans clicking “buy” buttons, not machines making millions of automated transactions.
Every day, websites send over one billion HTTP 402 error codes to bots trying to access content, but these payment requests go unanswered because no standard exists for machines to respond.
The x402 protocol solves this by creating a common language for automated payments.
The initiative comes as Google recently announced similar stablecoin support for AI payments, partnering with Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation.
Google’s James Tromans said stablecoins represent “probably one of the most important payment upgrades since the SWIFT network.”
Revolutionary Payment Flow Changes Everything for AI
The x402 protocol creates a simple four-step process that transforms how machines handle payments online.
When an AI agent tries to access restricted content, the server responds with payment instructions, including the amount and recipient details.
The agent then sends the payment authorization header along with its request.
A payment facilitator verifies the transaction and settles it automatically. Finally, the server delivers the content with confirmation that payment succeeded.
This system enables entirely new business models that were impossible with traditional payment systems.
An AI assistant could automatically buy Halloween costume accessories from multiple merchants.
Autonomous trading bots could pay per request for real-time market data feeds, rather than monthly subscriptions.
Cloudflare is proposing a “deferred payment scheme” that allows batch settlements at the end of each day rather than immediate transactions.
This approach accommodates crawlers that access thousands of pages before receiving a single aggregated bill through traditional payment methods or stablecoins.
The protocol supports both immediate blockchain settlements and delayed payments through credit cards or bank accounts. This flexibility ensures compatibility with existing financial infrastructure while enabling the implementation of new automated workflows.
Stablecoin Infrastructure Powers Machine Economy Growth
The timing coincides with explosive growth in stablecoin adoption for AI applications.
According to a report covered by Cryptonews in June, as of 2024, bots already account for 70% of stablecoin transfer volume, indicating machine-driven transactions are becoming dominant.
Traditional payment rails, such as wire transfers and credit cards, cannot handle the micropayments and instant settlements that AI agents require.
Stablecoins solve these limitations by providing programmable money that settles within seconds at minimal cost.
The stablecoin market has grown from $4 billion in 2020 to over $280 billion today, with monthly settlement volumes reaching $1.39 trillion in the first half of 2025. Major stablecoin issuers now rank 17th globally in U.S. Treasury holdings.
Cloudflare has created a live demonstration called the x402 playground, where visitors receive testnet USDC on the Base blockchain.
The demo shows agents automatically paying for computational tools while free services remain accessible without payment.
Amazon Web Services is exploring x402 integration for cloud compute payments, potentially transforming the $1.9 trillion cloud computing market expected by 2030.
Web3 storage platform Pinata uses x402 for pay-per-file storage, while AI platform Heurist leverages it for research payments.
In fact, Circle co-founder Sean Neville recently launched Catena Labs with $18 million in funding to create the first fully regulated AI-native financial institution.
The project positions stablecoins as “AI-native money” essential for autonomous economic systems.
While stablecoin adoption is growing massively, banking industry groups are pushing for stronger regulations, warning that the growth of stablecoins could trigger $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from traditional banks.
However, earlier this month, Coinbase Research argued that most stablecoin activity occurs internationally, strengthening dollar dominance without impacting domestic deposits.

New integrations with Google Display & Video 360, StackAdapt, and tvScientific measure the impact of connected TV, linear TV, and online video brand campaigns on business outcomes.
SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Sept. 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Invoca, the leader in revenue execution platforms, today announced a new AI-powered solution for agencies and marketing teams to measure and optimize how CTV, linear TV, and online video campaigns drive appointments, sales, and revenue.
Despite being a critical element of the marketing mix, advertisers still struggle to understand how brand-focused TV and video campaigns influence revenue, including how they improve conversion rates of lower-funnel performance marketing channels. This is especially true for considered-purchase industries like automotive, healthcare, home services, and financial services, where consumers research online, but seek advice from experts in contact centers or local retail stores before making a final purchase decision.
Now with Invoca, agencies and marketing teams can quantify the impact their CTV, linear TV, and online video campaigns have on leads, appointments, and sales. Invoca's AI connects the entire buyer journey, from the TV or video ad a consumer viewed to the digital ads they clicked to their website visit and phone call, capturing intent and outcome data that advertisers use to prove and improve return on ad spend across every channel.
""With Invoca, CMOs can understand the revenue impact of media spend across all major marketing channels,"" said Gregg Johnson, CEO of Invoca. ""By making CTV, linear TV, and online video as measurable as lower-funnel channels like paid search, Invoca enables advertisers to maximize the value of every incremental dollar of media spend.""
As TV and Video Engagement Grows, So Does Ad Spend and Pressure on Advertisers to Prove ROAS
Driven by the surge in popularity of streaming and online video, overall TV and video viewership in the US is growing. On average, consumers now spend 5 hours watching digital video and 3 hours watching TV every day. Advertisers have responded accordingly – TV and video ad spending is expected to exceed $124 billion in 2025, accounting for over 20% of total media spend.
This rise in digital video engagement has also increased the number of authenticated, logged-in viewers, making TV and video advertising more measurable and optimizable. Advertisers now have the opportunity to target the right consumers with the right ad at the right time and prove ROAS by measuring direct business outcomes instead of relying on less impactful metrics like audience reach and impressions."

In a post on X, O'Leary said companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google — all of which started in garages — might never have taken off under today's immigration rules.
He argued that Trump's new H-1B policy risks forcing promising entrepreneurs to launch businesses in other countries.
""I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term,"" the “Shark Tank” star wrote, adding that the U.S. should not spend resources training top foreign students only to ""kick them out.""
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
He suggested that graduates of schools like MIT and Harvard should automatically be allowed to stay in the country, marry and build companies. ""Why train them and kick them out?"" O'Leary asked.
Trump Administration Defends The Policy
The Trump administration announced Friday that companies would now be charged $100,000 for each H-1B visa petition, a sharp increase from current fees.
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the charge is a one-time filing fee for new applicants, not an annual tax. Renewals and existing visa holders will not be affected.
Administration officials say the move will prioritize American workers and reduce reliance on immigrant labor. They also announced a new $1 million ""gold card"" residency program for wealthy investors.

The company's trapped ion technology and deep integrations with major cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) have earned IonQ a loyal following.
Over the past year, its stock price has soared an eye-popping 812% -- propelling its market capitalization to roughly $22 billion. While IonQ will likely continue to grab headlines, investors seeking the next breakthrough opportunity may want to look elsewhere.
That brings us to Quantinuum -- a rising star in the space that recently secured $600 million in funding from an impressive roster of backers including Honeywell (HON -2.90%), JPMorgan Chase, Amgen, Mitsui, and, most notably, Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%). Following its recent capital raise, Quantinuum is now valued at $10.6 billion.
Let's explore why Quantinuum could become the next monster company defining the quantum artificial intelligence (AI) market -- and how investors can gain exposure today.
Quantum computing has trillion-dollar potential
Quantinuum's lineup of investors underscores the broad reach of quantum computing. Honeywell contributes industrial scale, JPMorgan represents financial services, Amgen highlights breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals, and Nvidia provides the bridge between accelerated computing and quantum AI. Together, these partners illustrate how quantum technology impacts nearly every major economic sector.
The potential applications are vast -- spanning fraud detection, risk modeling, logistics optimization, energy efficiency, drug discovery, molecular simulation, AI model training, and generative application design.
With such transformative use cases on the horizon, it's no surprise that McKinsey & Company projects quantum computing could generate trillions of dollars in economic value over the coming decades.
How to invest in Quantinuum
Since Quantinuum remains a private company, investors cannot buy its stock directly. However, there is still a practical way to gain exposure: by investing in the publicly traded companies that already own equity stakes in Quantinuum.
This approach not only provides passive, insulated access to quantum computing's growth potential, but it also delivers diversified exposure through established blue chip stocks.
By owning shares of companies like Nvidia, Amgen, JPMorgan, and Honeywell, investors can participate in multiple industries that stand to benefit as quantum AI moves from research labs to tangible commercialization at scale. In other words, this strategy offers a balanced path to profit from the next computing evolution while staying anchored in some of the market's most durable, resilient, and profitable industry leaders.
Why quantum AI is such an important opportunity
AI has already transformed global computing demand. In just a few years, companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have ascended into the exclusive trillion-dollar market cap club. In fact, Nvidia's meteoric rise during the AI revolution has even made it the most valuable company in the world.
Now, quantum technology is positioned to extend this digital transformation by tackling problems that even today's most advanced supercomputers have trouble solving. When paired with AI, quantum computing has the potential to unlock unprecedented efficiencies and reshape industries that will define the next technological frontier.
Quantinuum's rise to a $10 billion valuation, backed by some of the biggest names across multiple industries, underscores that the shift to quantum applications is not merely hypothetical or experimental -- it is real and already under way.
For investors, the message is clear: You don't need to wait for Quantinuum's initial public offering (IPO) to participate in its upside. By building a basket of quantum-adjacent stocks -- established blue chips investing beyond their core platforms -- you can ride the near-term wave of AI upside while securing long-term tailwinds fueling the quantum era."

The collaboration gives Japanese publishers a proven pathway to global growth and provides international publishers with a seamless entry into one of the world's most important gaming markets.
Around the world, game publishers are moving beyond closed app store ecosystems. Players want more choice and value, while publishers seek stronger direct connections with their communities. Regulatory changes are accelerating this shift. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which took effect in March 2024, designates Apple and Google as gatekeepers and requires them to allow alternative payment methods and third-party marketplaces. In the United States, antitrust scrutiny and landmark cases have fueled debate on app store competition. South Korea's Telecommunications Business Act amendment (2021) became the first law to require support for alternative billing systems, while Japans's Act on Promotion of Competition for Specified Smartphone Software will come into effect in December 2025.
These changes are creating a more open environment where publishers can adopt out-of-app and web-based monetization models. By selling content directly, publishers avoid the high fees charged by primary app stores. The savings can be reinvested into new user acquisition, loyalty programs, new content, and more competitive pricing, delivering greater value to players.
At the center of this model is Coda's Merchant of Record (MoR) framework, which allows publishers to scale globally with confidence. Acting as the legal seller in each market, Coda manages payments, compliance, fraud protection, tax settlement, and billing across more than 65 markets and over 400 payment methods. This simplifies operations for publishers and allows them to focus on creating content while Coda ensures seamless global execution.
The partnership with Digital Garage combines Coda's international scale with AppPay's trusted domestic reach. Japanese gamers will benefit from a broader catalogue of international titles, more payment options, and loyalty programs that enhance player experiences. For Japanese publishers, the collaboration offers a clear pathway to global expansion, with Coda providing the MoR model and Digital Garage adding domestic services such as marketing, multilingual support, website development, and analytics. For global publishers entering Japan, AppPay offers a familiar and reliable platform backed by Digital Garage's payments infrastructure, which handles more than ¥7.5 trillion annually, enabling secure and efficient entry into the market."

The computer chip company is now the largest stock in the world by market capitalization, quickly joining the $3 trillion club along with Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Investors are betting with their wallets that the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power will drive huge earnings growth for the likes of Nvidia.
They are forgetting one company that will be an underrated beneficiary of AI growth: Amazon (AMZN -0.48%). The company has a cloud and computer chip deal with start-up Anthropic, as well as numerous ways to benefit from AI in its media business.
At a market cap of $2.5 trillion today, I think it is an easy hurdle for Amazon to surpass a $3 trillion market cap by sometime in 2026, if not by the end of this year.
Here's why.
AWS and Anthropic
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the original cloud computing juggernaut. In the age of AI, the market is feeling like it is left behind. Alphabet has its own AI infrastructure to build with Google Cloud, while Microsoft won a huge partnership with OpenAI to drive growth for its cloud business. Now, even Oracle is winning contracts from OpenAI in a reported $300 billion deal.
While it would have been nice to see AWS win some of these deals, the division is much more focused on generating positive return on investment than other players, which is likely why Oracle won the recent deal from OpenAI.
Anthropic is AWS' bet as an AI partner, and it is currently flying under the radar. Anthropic is an AI software provider focused on the enterprise and coding markets. Its revenue is exploding higher, growing from annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 billion at the start of this year to $5 billion as of its latest update. AWS is Anthropic's key cloud partner, where it plans to spend billions of dollars to train and run its AI systems. The partnership is so deep that Anthropic is now working with Amazon to build custom computer chips to compete with Nvidia.
Revenue at AWS grew 17% year over year last quarter to an ARR topping $123 billion, although it is growing slower than competition like Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. However, with Anthropic hitting a growth inflection, AWS' revenue should start to accelerate in the coming quarters. With fat operating margins of 37% over the last 12 months, AWS can be a strong contributor to Amazon's consolidated earnings growth through the next few years.
Bringing AI to e-commerce
Not only will AWS earnings benefit from AI, so too will Amazon's e-commerce and media business. Specifically, it will help with its fast-growing advertising segment. Advertising revenue is currently growing 22% year over year and likely has fantastic profit margins.
This week, Amazon released a new agentic AI tool for building advertisements. In the creative studio, even small businesses can now build robust advertisements that will go on the Amazon marketplace, Prime Video, and other Amazon partner platforms. This will greatly expand the addressable market for Amazon's advertising services. With so many small businesses around the world selling on the platform, Amazon is the perfect advertising platform that can connect sellers to willing buyers of its products.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Amazon can deploy AI for robotics, delivery systems, and customer search to improve the value proposition and efficiency of its e-commerce ecosystem. Altogether, it should help retail expand its profitability, which still has a lot of room to grow with just 7.5% profit margins over the last 12 months.
Why Amazon will join the $3 trillion club
Amazon's market cap will surpass $3 trillion shortly because of the huge potential for earnings growth in the next few quarters. The company's EBIT -- earnings before interest income and taxes -- shot up to $77 billion in the last 12 months on margin expansion. As revenue growth at AWS accelerates and margins keep expanding in North American retail due to advertising, investors should see trailing-12-month EBIT cross $100 billion at some point in 2026.
For a high-quality business like Amazon, a multiple of 30 times its trailing EBIT is entirely reasonable. It actually trades at a higher multiple than that right now. Thirty times EBIT on $100 billion in earnings is a $3 trillion market cap. That is the math behind my Amazon prediction, and why I think it is now the best AI stock to add to your portfolio today."

Nextgov, in this regard, reported that the White House is drafting up to three executive orders focused on quantum information sciences and the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Quantum Insider noted that these actions would extend the momentum from the 2018 NQIA, which expired in 2023, thereby setting migration timelines for agencies and contractors.
For listed quantum specialists such as IonQ IONQ, Rigetti RGTI and D-Wave QBTS, this signals new opportunities. Government mandates for PQC migration and rising R&D funding could accelerate agency adoption, moving startups beyond research pilots into applied deployments.
GovCIO Media’s report from last week stated the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Director Michael Kratsios’ five-priority plan, which includes commercialization, supply chain security and workforce growth, all areas that open channels for federal funding and public-private partnerships.
For tech heavyweights like IBM IBM, Google and NVIDIA NVDA, which are already investing heavily in quantum, these directives validate their strategy, strengthen procurement pipelines and position them as backbone providers for a government-led quantum-secure transition.
In 2025, IBM advanced its roadmap and announced plans for the “Quantum Starling,” a fault-tolerant system targeted by 2029. Google unveiled its Willow quantum chip, demonstrating scalable error correction and reiterated its expectation for commercial quantum applications within five years. NVIDIA deepened its quantum bet in 2025 by announcing the NVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Research Center in Boston. Meanwhile, its venture arm NVentures backed players such as QuEra and PsiQuantum and partnered with Quantinuum as a founding collaborator at the new center.
Reflecting this optimism, quantum-related stocks have rallied in recent days, with the Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM) gaining 12.2% month to date as investors price in stronger federal support and accelerated adoption cycles across the network.

D-Wave: In 2025, D-Wave advanced both hardware and market adoption. Its Strategic Development Initiative for Advanced Cryogenic Packaging aims to scale annealing and gate-model processors through multichip packaging and superconducting interconnects with NASA’s JPL. On the market side, APAC bookings rose around 83% year over year, with pilot projects in Japan and South Korea. The roadmap targets larger multichip systems and its Advantage2 system is now generally available, offering improved connectivity and coherence. Government PQC and quantum security mandates could drive agencies to obtain D-Wave’s hardware and software."

Formerly of GitHub and Microsoft, he’s now responsible for tools like Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist, nudging developers into the new world of agentic programming.
His team released new third-party research on Tuesday showing how developers actually use AI tools — and how much progress is left to make. I sat down with Salva to talk about the report and his personal experience with AI coding tools.
This interview was edited for length and clarity.
Every year, Google does a survey of developer trends — but this year’s report really focuses on AI tools, and specifically how agentic developers are willing to get in their approach to programming. Was there anything in the research that surprised you?
One of the really interesting findings was the median date when developers started using AI tools. They found it was April 2024, which corresponds fairly neatly to Claude 3 coming out and Gemini 2.5 coming out. This is really the dawn of the reasoning or thinking models, and around that same time, we got much better at tool-calling.
For coding tasks, you really need to be able to leverage external information in order to problem solve, so it may need to grep, it may need to compile the code. If the code compiles it may want to run that unit test, and that integration test. I think that tool-calling really is the important piece that gave models the ability to self-correct as they move along.
How are you using AI coding tools personally?
Most of my coding these days is for hobby projects, and I spend most of my time using command line-based tools. So that includes Gemini CLI. Then there’s a little bit of Claude Code, little bit of Codex in there. And you don’t ever really use a terminal-based tool by itself, so I’m really heterogeneous around the IDEs that I use. I use Zed. I use VS code. I use Cursor. I use Windsurf, all of them, because I’m interested in just seeing how the world works and how the industry is evolving.
On the professional side, product managers tend to live in documents, so the first thing is using AI to help me write the specification and requirements docs.
I’m curious how that works. You’re using Gemini CLI to build Gemini CLI, but I would imagine it doesn’t just run itself.
A development task will usually start as an issue, maybe it’s a GitHub issue that someone’s dropped with a bug. Often, if I’m really being honest, it’s a fairly under-specified issue. So I’ll use Gemini CLI in order to create a more robust requirement doc in Markdown. That will usually create probably about 100 lines of fairly technical, but also outcome-driven specification. Then I will use Gemini CLI to write the code based on that specification and the general preferences in the team documents."

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said the AI space is already being ruled by a group of “big four” players.
The 69-year-old investor said OpenAI, Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and Google’s Gemini are competing for dominance—and the competition is fierce. She noted, ultimately, the four current competitors could be narrowed down to two.
“The number of companies competing, truly competing, in the large language model space has shrunk,” she told Bloomberg.
The recent “acquihires” conducted by OpenAI and Meta, which is not in Wood’s big four, are also examples of the AI space getting smaller and of “other companies not making it,” she said.
ChatGPT maker OpenAI has been one of the most prolific buyers in the startup space this year. In 2025 alone, the company shelled out $6.4 billion to acquire io, the hardware startup from former Apple designer Jony Ive, as well as $1.1 billion to buy product-development platform Statsig. These deals come as the company has also “acquihired” top talent from startups, including the team behind coding assistant company Alex.
Meta, for its part, conducted its own high-profile acquihire earlier this year when it committed about $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in startup Scale AI and brought on its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, as its first-ever chief AI officer.
When it comes to AI consolidation, “the process has started,” said Wood, but the final result is still not in.
“Let’s see over time how they leapfrog one another, and they are doing that regularly,” she said.
ARK Invest’s star ARK Innovation ETF is up 47% year to date as of Tuesday, thanks in part to the stellar performance of its top holdings in 2025, including Roku, Coinbase, and Roblox. Its top holding, Tesla, is up a comparatively lower but solid 8% over the same period despite tumult earlier this year.
Wood, who earlier this year warned of stalling growth, has changed her tune and pointed to the possibility that inflation rates could drop to zero in the coming years as AI-driven productivity increases push inflation down. These productivity increases, however, have come hand in hand with higher unemployment and a Fed rate cut last week, which Fed Chairman Jerome Powell justified partly because younger people are struggling to find jobs.
Wood countered that these productivity increases could be good for the AI sector as a whole since companies are cutting back on employees but also increasing the money they put into AI services.
“They’re willing to pay $20 a month. Some are willing to pay $200 a month, and those who are replacing PhDs, they’re willing to pay $2,000 a month or more,” she said.

SINGAPORE, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ELD Asset Management positions Oracle Corporation’s latest numbers as a defining moment in the AI infrastructure cycle, with the enterprise group’s cloud engines gathering force while capital requirements climb. For Q1 FY2026, the quarter ended August 2025, total cloud revenue advances 27% year on year to $8.11 billion and cloud infrastructure revenue rises 54% to $3.72 billion, presenting momentum that institutional allocators can calibrate against near-term cost pressures.
Oracle’s multi-cloud database services tied to Amazon, Google and Microsoft expand 1,529% in Q1 FY2026, reinforcing the strategy of placing workloads alongside customers’ preferred platforms. Group revenue increases 12% in USD terms to $16.78 billion for the quarter, although non-GAAP earnings per share register $1.65, a shortfall of $0.01 relative to consensus. GAAP earnings per share stand at $1.13, with net income of $3.30 billion as operating expenses reach $7.03 billion.
The forward book intensifies. Remaining performance obligations are now disclosed at approximately $455 billion for Q1 FY2026, signalling contracted revenue to be recognised across coming periods. Capital expenditure accelerates to $9.57 billion in the quarter, nearly four times the $2.58 billion invested in the comparable quarter a year earlier, underlining the build-out required to meet AI workloads. Jason Harrison, Senior Vice President at ELD Asset Management, notes that “the substantial contract backlog provides revenue visibility, though execution capabilities will determine long-term returns on these significant investments.”
Contract concentration is central to the investment debate. Market intelligence highlights a multi-year agreement with OpenAI estimated at about $300 billion across five years commencing in 2027, anchoring demand for compute capacity. The scale enhances strategic clarity while introducing dependency on a single counterparty’s technology roadmap and funding cadence. Harrison comments that “fulfilling large, dated commitments requires disciplined cash allocation before revenue recognition, so portfolio sizing should reflect both the growth optionality and the liquidity profile.”
Valuation signals reflect the AI trade’s breadth. In September 2025, a single-day share price rise of 36% lifts Oracle’s market capitalisation intraday to roughly $1.25 trillion, later settling near $1.01 trillion as trading consolidates. The forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 45.3 sits well above peers such as Amazon near 31.3 and Microsoft near 31 for 2025 year-to-date. Across the index, AI-centric leaders account for close to 30% of S&P 500 weight in 2025 year-to-date, with research houses attributing roughly half of the index’s 11% gain this year to the theme and identifying an “AI premium” of about 14.2% on valuations. The broader narrative includes the transformation of champions such as Nvidia, whose capitalisation has approached roughly $4.51 trillion in 2025, underscoring the market’s willingness to capitalise infrastructure winners."

Micron to Report Q4 Earnings: Buy, Hold, or Take Profits Now?
After the closing bell on Sept. 23, Micron Technology, Inc. is set to report its much-awaited fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 (ended on Aug. 31) results. Similar to the previous quarter, will Micron be able to provide an insightful update on its high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and is the stock a worthwhile investment now? Let's analyze
Micron's Q4 Earnings in Sight: What's on the Table?
For the fiscal third quarter, Micron generated revenues of $9.3 billion, up 15% quarter over quarter and up 37% year over year. The majority of the revenues were generated by the compute and networking business segment, which included a nearly 50% sequential jump in HBM as well as growth in high-capacity DRAM.
Management believes that revenues also increased in the fiscal fourth quarter and expects total sales of $10.7 billion, a 38% rise year over year. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter were $1.91, a significant 208% increase from the previous year. However, the company anticipates EPS to improve further in the fiscal fourth quarter and reach $2.50, representing a 112% increase from the same period last year, citing investors.micron.com.
Management expects low inventory and significant demand for products to help the company improve pricing and strengthen product mix, thereby increasing revenues and operating margins in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, on average, Micron's trailing four-quarter earnings surprise is a positive 9.7%, signifying that the stock may deliver fiscal fourth-quarter growth.

Global EdTech and Smart Classrooms Market
Dublin, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Edtech and Smart Classrooms Market by Solution (Projection & Display Systems, Adaptive & Personalized Learning, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) & Simulations), End User, and Deployment Type - Global Forecast to 2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The edtech and smart classrooms market is estimated at USD 197.3 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 353.1 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 12.3%.
Governments worldwide are playing a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of edtech and smart classrooms. Public sector investment in digital education infrastructure, policy frameworks, and funding support has given momentum to this market. For instance, India's PM eVidya initiative aims to provide multi-mode access to online education for all students, while the European Union's Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) focuses on fostering high-performing digital ecosystems. Similarly, the US invests heavily in programs supporting STEM education and broadband access to rural schools.
Governments are making technology-enabled learning more inclusive by subsidizing hardware such as tablets, digital boards, and Wi-Fi access. These initiatives also promote the use of emerging technologies like AI, AR/VR, and cloud platforms in classrooms. Beyond schools, vocational training and upskilling programs are also supported by government funding, ensuring a broader learner base. Such initiatives not only bridge the digital divide but also ensure long-term growth opportunities for edtech players.
AR, VR & Simulations segment will witness the fastest growth during the forecast period

The social-media giant recently introduced new tools and features for Indian businesses to drive engagement. Small businesses can now offer a secure and convenient payment option (QR codes) directly within the WhatsApp Business app. Users can now call large businesses directly from the app with a single tap, or receive calls from businesses they have requested to hear from.
Meta Platforms launched a feature in July that streamlined all marketing campaigns across WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram in one centralized place, Ads Manager. The company is now offering this feature to Indian businesses. Businesses now can either select marketing messages as an additional placement or can use Advantage+, while Meta’s AI systems will then optimize budgets across placements to boost performance. Moreover, Meta Platforms is creating ways for businesses and creators to grow their presence in the WhatsApp Updates tab, which is currently used by 1.5 billion people daily.
Business messaging and more engaging experiences are two of the five basic opportunities that Meta Platforms is pursuing to drive growth. In the second quarter of 2025, Family of Apps Other revenues jumped 50% year over year to $583 million, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. The company is using Llama to power Meta AI, an infusion of which into WhatsApp is driving user queries. AI push is helping Meta Platforms offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Meta Platforms’ focus on enhancing safety for WhatsApp users is expected to further boost user engagement.
These factors are expected to drive advertising revenues, Family of Apps Other revenues, and total revenues. Our model estimate for 2025 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $190.29 billion, indicating 18.5% growth over the figure reported in 2024. Family of Apps Other revenues are pegged at $2.30 billion, suggesting 33.7% growth from the figure reported in 2024. Our model estimate for 2025 total revenues is currently pegged at $194.66 billion, indicating 18.3% growth over the figure reported in 2024.
META Faces Tough Competition for Advertising Dollars
Meta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN for advertising dollars.
Alphabet is leveraging AI to boost search dominance with the launch of Gemini 2.5. Search revenues are driven by improving engagement with features like AI Overview, which now has 2 billion users per month and is available in more than 40 languages across 200 countries. Alphabet is advancing visual and contextual search capabilities. The Circle to Search feature is now active on more than 300 million devices.
Amazon’s advertising business is noteworthy. Amazon’s ability to harness its vast retail media presence, proprietary shopping data and expanding connected TV (CTV) footprint is a key catalyst. The global rollout of Prime Video ads adds a high-value, premium channel that may lift revenues. Amazon’s ad ecosystem reaches over 300 million ad-supported users in the United States alone, spanning retail, Prime Video, Twitch and Fire TV."

This vertically integrated owner and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure, purpose-built to support bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, inked a deal with Fluidstack, a premier AI cloud platform that builds and operates HPC clusters. The deal represents roughly $6.7 billion in contracted revenues, with total contract revenues expected to hit $16 billion.
As per the deal, TeraWulf will deliver more than 360 MW of critical IT load at its Lake Mariner data center campus in Western New York. The Lake Mariner facility can expand up to 500 MW in the near term and up to 750 MW with targeted transmission upgrades. The deal is supported by Alphabet, which is backing Fluidstack’s lease obligations. Alphabet is also providing $3.2 billion of credit support, and its total pro forma equity ownership in TeraWulf increases to approximately 14%.
TeraWulf is on track to deliver 72.5 MW of HPC colocation capacity under its data center lease agreements with Core42 Holding for GPU compute workloads. The WULF Den and CB-1 leases with Core42 are expected to start generating revenues in the third quarter of 2025.
WULF Faces Tough Competition
TeraWulf faces stiff competition from the likes of IREN Limited IREN and Applied Digital APLD in the bitcoin mining and HPC markets.
IREN Limited has doubled its AI cloud capacity to 23k GPUs through the purchase of an additional 12.4k GPUs for roughly $674 million. This comprises 1.9k NVIDIA H100s and H200s, 19.1k NVIDIA B200s and B300s, 1.2k NVIDIA GB300s and 1.1k AMD MI350Xs. IREN now expects to achieve $500 million in AI Cloud annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) by the first quarter of fiscal 2026. IREN is on track to achieve $1.25 billion in annualized revenues, with roughly $1 billion coming from bitcoin mining, and $200-$250 million from AI Cloud (by December 2025). IREN expects to scale from 1.9k to 10.9k GPUs in the coming months.
Applied Digital is benefiting from robust demand for data center infrastructure, and the growing focus on energy efficiency is a noteworthy development in the data center industry. Strong spending by hyperscalers, which is expected to exceed $350 billion in 2025, bodes well for APLD. Applied Digital’s Data Center Hosting business provides energized infrastructure services to crypto mining customers. The company currently operates sites in Jamestown and Ellendale, ND, with a total hosting capacity of approximately 286 megawatts (MWs).

Inspired by the success of the project, three devs who worked on NotebookLM since its inception are now building an audio-first app called Huxe, which can similarly help users dive deep into topics by generating a “podcast” with multiple AI hosts. The startup said on Tuesday that it had raised $4.6 million in funding from Conviction, Genius Ventures, Figma CEO Dylan Field, and Google Research’s chief scientist, Jeff Dean.
The app launched on an invite-only basis in June, and is now available to everyone on iOS and Android.
Raiza Martin, along with Jason Spielman and Stephen Hughes, left Google in December 2024 to explore their own ideas. They initially launched a chatbot slanted toward more B2B use cases, but decided to focus on the consumer market and built a personal assistant in March 2025 that could generate personalized images, videos, and audio.
“During this phase, we realized that people liked having the ability to generate audio for different topics. We also observed that people often used the app at specific times to get their daily brief or catch up with news while getting ready,” Martin told TechCrunch.
That insight led the three to lean into audio and build Huxe.
Huxe essentially gives you a daily briefing based on the emails you receive and by connecting to your calendars to understand your schedule. It also lets you explore topics, and like NotebookLM, it will generate a podcast with AI hosts discussing the topic. You can interact with the AI hosts at any point in time, ask questions about the topic, or request them to explain points in a different way.
What’s different here is that Huxe lets users build a “live station” of any topic, like tech news, sports, or even celebrity gossip. After you listen to a station, the app will give you updates by tapping different sources — helpful for following developing news. There’s also a personalized interest feed, which automatically generates audio content that might interest you.
Martin said that during the early NotebookLM days, a cohort of power users drove the product feedback, and Huxe is seeing similar signs.
“This is a well-suited product for people who spend all day on their screens with tons of tabs open on their browser. People who might want to catch up on their email, schedule, and news can do that without looking at their screen,” she said.
Huxe currently is suited to the information market, but entertainment can be a possible use case, too. India-based audio companies like Pocket FM and Kuku FM, for example, tap AI to let users create content. And Huxe is not the only one using audio as a medium. Startups like ElevenLabs and Oboe are leveraging audio, too, as are Google and Meta."

Now, let's break down why adding this one exceptional stock, highlighted below, to your portfolio could be a recipe for success.
Why You Should Pay Attention to Alphabet (GOOGL)
Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with roughly 90% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.
On May 19, 2025, GOOGL was added to the Zacks Focus List at $166.19 per share. Shares have increased 51.95% to $252.53 since then.
Four analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.09 to $9.97. GOOGL boasts an average earnings surprise of 16%.
Earnings for Alphabet's are forecasted to see growth of 24% for the current fiscal year as well.
Since stock prices respond to earnings estimate revisions, it can be very profitable to buy stocks with an increased earnings outlook. By buying a Focus List stock like GOOGL, then, you're likely getting into a company whose future earnings estimates will be raised, potentially leading to price momentum.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Chicago Federal Reserve said on Tuesday it had combined government and private data into a new estimate of the unemployment rate that would give policymakers faster-moving, twice monthly updates of a statistic central to the central bank's current interest rate debate.
The new ""real-time"" set of labor market statistics, relying on the government's Current Population Survey along with data from sources including payroll processor ADP, online job site Indeed, and Google, projects the unemployment rate most likely stayed stable in September at 4.3%.
The hiring rate for unemployed workers increased slightly, a bank press release said, but that was offset by a rise in layoffs and other job separations.
The estimate comes nearly two weeks before the next employment report on October 3, covering payroll job growth and the jobless rate for September.
While Fed officials study an array of indicators to gauge the health of the labor market, the unemployment rate is paramount. Under the current data release timetable, Fed officials would receive the September official unemployment rate only before their next policy meeting at the end of October. The Chicago data would now supplement that with an early estimate of the October jobless rate, and possibly show whether the labor market was weakening or had stayed stable, a central issue in any decision to further cut interest rates.
“One of the hardest things a central banker has to do is get the timing right in moments of transition, and that's why real-time data can be so important,” said Austan Goolsbee, president and CEO of the Chicago Fed.
The Fed cut the benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point at its meeting last week, and Fed chair Jerome Powell speaks later today in comments that may shed more light on the debate over whether rates should fall again at the October meeting.
Since the pandemic and through the early months of the new Trump administration, when government policies shifted fast, Fed officials have looked for reliable outside indicators that could show how the economy is shifting at a tempo faster than the government's often lagged statistical reports.
Outside data can also help validate or serve as a check against official sources at a time when the government has canceled some data reporting and moved to fire officials at statistical and scientific agencies.

It's time now for today's trending tickers. Well, let's start with a big headline this morning. Boeing is getting a lift after taking center stage in US-China negotiations. Shares are up in pre-market now. Let's have a quick look at that chart. That's up, yeah, up over 2%. That's after the US Ambassador to China, David Perdue said that the two countries were in advanced negotiations for a quote huge deal to buy Boeing planes. Bloomberg has reported the order could involve up to 500 aircraft, which would be Boeing's first major Chinese sale since before the pandemic. The American plane maker has lost ground to its European rival Airbus in recent years.
Next up, Orsted is rallying after a federal judge lifted the Trump administration's ban on its massive wind project off Rhode Island. And the Danish wind company's shares listed in Copenhagen, which have been in free fall in recent weeks, shot up by more than 12% at one point and now standing at over 4% higher. The offshore wind farm is 80% complete, so this is a big relief for the investors worried about Orsted losing several billions of dollars if the project was canceled.
Now, there's another renewable energy stock you need to watch today. Plug power. Shares of the hydrogen cell fuel maker continue their remarkable run after soaring 21.6% in regular trading. The stock is adding another 20 another, whoa, another uh large amount in pre-market. This has a lot to do with artificial intelligence. Investors are looking at potential of hydrogen storage in data centers which will have sky high energy needs.
On to healthcare stocks now. and Tylenol maker Kenvue is bouncing back from a steep sell off following President Trump's statement linking Tylenol to autism and ADHD. Kenvue's New York listed shares gained about 6% in after hours as many doctors rejected Trump's claim and Kenvue reiterated there's no scientific evidence that Tylenol causes autism when taken by pregnant women.
Finally, Alphabet is seeking to avoid the breakup of its ad tech business in a new anti-trust trial that threatens to upend its business. Former FTC chairman William Kovacic talked with Yahoo Finance's Miles Udland about what's at stake.
So this case focus is on Adtech on its advertising services, the ad exchange and the operation of the ad exchange. So this case seeks uh in the Justice Department's view to loosen Google's control over this critical element of the advertising stack and to give uh publishers and advertisers more freedom to choose alternative strategies for dealing with each other.
Now, I'm curious in in your view based on the ruling that we got uh last month, um how this maybe impacts uh the you know, the government's case going in, the government's thought around the case, Google's case going in. Like is there a relationship here, um you know, in your view of how the company um and the government may approach these proceedings given uh what we saw, you know, handed down in late August.
We can be sure that the judge in the Adtech case is going to study, has studied that earlier decision very carefully. Both to look at the framework that Judge Meta used in the search case and to assess how it might be applied in her own circumstances. So, that's going to be a very informative framework. The key difference is that Judge Brinkema's case involving Adtech involved different facts, somewhat different arguments, and she has considerable discretion to decide how she will apply that legal framework. So, the the lighter touch treatment that Google received in the search case does not necessarily predetermine a similar outcome in the remedies case in Adtech.
Now, I'm curious though, we've seen kind of the, let's say the environment towards antitrust, the enthusiasm that some corners of government have around uh enforcing certain statutes or, you know, interpreting them certain ways, has changed in the time since this case was first brought and then we actually go to trial. How do, you know, how do either side, how does either side think about that in the run-up um to a proceeding that is, you know, this kind of high profile, especially around a company like this with the potential, you know, remedies that I think some thought could be handed down depending on uh which way the judge breaks?
One area of continuity that we've seen across the Biden and Trump administrations is a commitment to pursue these big tech cases. The leadership of the Department of Justice has been emphatic in saying that their approach is full speed ahead, that the broader aim of structural relief, which would involve some element of a divestiture is still front and center in their remedial aims, so that the Trump administration and Biden administration, although they're not fond of saying they have much in common, seem to have common cause on this case."

The Irish-based company continues to strengthen its position in the $5.9 billion interactive voice response market
NEWARK, N.J., September 23, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Klearcom, a leading provider of global contact center testing solutions, today announces that it has established its first physical base in the US with the opening of a new office in New Jersey. To facilitate this growth, Klearcom will hire 20 new team members in the US. The announcement has been welcomed by Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment of Ireland.
Headquartered in Waterford, Ireland, Klearcom is currently pursuing aggressive growth in the US market. The new base will enable Klearcom to acquire more US-based customers and strengthen relationships with existing clients, such as Google, Mastercard and Visa. This will help the company to grow its share in the interactive voice response (IVR) market, currently valued at $5.9BN and growing at a rate of 7% per annum.
The new hires, to be appointed across sales and customer service over the next 12 months, represent a significant investment from Klearcom. They, and the New Jersey base, will be central to enhancing service delivery and providing on-the-ground support to Klearcom’s growing US customer base.
As the IVR market continues to grow at pace, the expansion will ensure Klearcom stays ahead of market challenges and seizes new opportunities. At the same time, Klearcom will continue to deliver reliable and quality testing for businesses’ automated voice systems, especially within critical customer service channels. The expansion will facilitate faster onboarding, greater support and a more personalized service, enabling the company to align more closely with US business priorities, time zones and escalation needs.
Mark Rohan, co-founder and chief operating officer, Klearcom, said: ""The US market is vital to Klearcom’s growth strategy. As such, this announcement is not only a mark of our success in the US to-date, but also our commitment to businesses there. And, while this is our first office in the US, it will not be our only one.
""For us, the expansion comes at the perfect time as businesses increasingly demand cutting-edge technology over outdated legacy systems. Our AI-driven IVR testing is the fastest in the world, enabling enterprises to quickly identify and resolve issues within their telecom system infrastructure, and cementing our position as the leading provider of contact center testing solutions."

Trump signed an executive order Friday imposing $100,000 fees on new H-1Bs, creating confusion and frustration for companies that rely on the program to bring in global talent in computer programming, engineering and other roles.
The fee is a significant opportunity for Canada, according to some tech industry players, at a time when the country is seeking answers to low productivity growth and the economic drag of US tariffs.
“Cities like Vancouver or Toronto will thrive instead of American cities,” Garry Tan, CEO of famed San Francisco startup incubator Y Combinator, which has helped start Airbnb Inc. and Stripe Inc., said in a post on X. Trump’s policy is a “massive gift to every overseas tech hub” by erecting a “toll booth” for smaller US firms to hire talent, he said in the post, which was later deleted.
Companies including Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. already maintain offices in major Canadian cities and could accelerate hiring there to skirt the US fee — while also paying lower salaries than those south of the border. Amazon had more than 8,500 corporate and technology employees in its tech hubs in Vancouver and Toronto as of a year ago, according to information disclosed by the company. Microsoft had 2,700 staff in a development hub in Vancouver as of April.
During a speech in New York on Monday, Prime Minister Mark Carney observed that Canada’s universities are some of the biggest producers of talented graduates in artificial intelligence and quantum computing, but “most of them go to the United States.”
Then he added: “I understand you’re changing your visa policy here, so we’re going to hang on to a few of those.”
Currently, the world’s top computer science schools funnel graduates into American tech hubs, thanks in part to H-1B sponsorships. Canadian citizens in many professions have an easier route through so-called “TN visas” under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
Higher salaries and better weather are part of the attraction for Canadian-educated engineers. The median tech worker earns 46% more in the US than in Canada, according to a 2023 report from The Dais, a public policy and leadership think tank at Toronto Metropolitan University."

But another business has poured over $22 billion into tech infrastructure in the second quarter alone to support its AI ambitions.
That company is Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL 2.13%) (GOOG 1.81%). Its shares hit an all-time high the week ending Sept. 19 after climbing nearly 35% in 2025. Here are some of the factors that make it a leading AI stock.
Alphabet's many AI strengths
Alphabet's business escaped relatively unscathed from legal penalties related to its Google search engine being declared an illegal monopoly. After the presiding judge delivered the verdict this month, the tech giant's appeal as an AI stock has taken off, and it's understandable why.
The company's AI enhancements to its search engine resulted in increased consumer usage, enabling the company's second-quarter sales to soar 14% year over year to $96.4 billion. More importantly, the additions demonstrate Google's ability to maintain its users in the face of stiff competition from AI rivals such as OpenAI and Perplexity. Alphabet is just getting started. Its AI-powered robotaxi service, Waymo, is quickly expanding across the U.S. thanks to partnerships with businesses such as Uber and Lyft. Waymo has logged over 100 million miles on public roads as of Q2.
Alphabet stock maintains a reasonable valuation despite its share price increase. This is evident when comparing its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio against AI superstar Nvidia, and AI competitor Microsoft, which also challenges Google in search, cloud computing, and digital advertising.
Alphabet's P/E multiple remains well below the others', indicating a better value for investors. With an attractive valuation, and its AI investments yielding rising revenue, Alphabet stands out as a strong AI stock."

McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), one of the most recognizable fast food brands in the world, operates more than 40,000 restaurants across over 100 countries, making it the second-largest chain by store count. Its winning formula has long been tasty food served quickly, but what truly differentiates McDonald’s is its ability to consistently offer meals at an affordable price.
McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is leaning into that advantage by reintroducing its Extra Value Meals, which save customers up to 15% compared to buying items separately. These value-focused promotions played a big role in boosting the company’s second-quarter revenue by 5% and earnings per share by 11%.
Beyond value, technology is becoming a key driver of efficiency. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is planning to increase its investments in AI, partnering with Alphabet’s Google Cloud to bring advanced edge computing to more than 44,000 locations. These AI-powered systems are designed to improve order accuracy, reduce equipment downtime, and ease administrative work for managers.
In addition, McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a solid dividend payer, increasing its payouts for 48 consecutive years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.77 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.34%, as of September 20.

The White House announced Friday that Trump had signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. In response, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reportedly emailed their employees telling those with H-1B visas to stay in the United States and avoid foreign travel for now — and if they’re already traveling, to try to return before the proclamation takes effect at 12:01am Eastern on Sunday.
Business Insider published the memos from Amazon and Microsoft, while Sources published a similar memo from Google. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to Amazon and Google.
According to government data, Amazon employees have received the most H-1B visas so far this fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, then Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, with Google ranked sixth.

But among leading tech giants, Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 2.13%) stands out.
The stock is up over 75% since hitting a 52-week low in April, but it still trades at a reasonable valuation. With 2 billion users and one of the best enterprise cloud services available, Alphabet is well-positioned to help investors outperform the market.
How Google is benefiting from AI
Earlier in the year, some investors were concerned about Google's competitive position as more people started using ChatGPT and other models to look up information. This overlooked the power of Google's Gemini AI model, which has emerged as one of the best models out there.
Gemini powers all the company's consumer services, like Search, and it is making a difference in the company's financial performance. Revenue from Search -- the company's largest business -- grew 12% year over year in the second quarter. This momentum reflects increasing search queries with AI Overviews.
Google is also competitively positioned in cloud services. The number of new customers using Google Cloud jumped 28% quarter over quarter in Q2. Management credits this momentum to its global base of AI-optimized data centers, custom AI chips, storage, and software offerings.
It can't be emphasized enough that Google's AI capabilities are only possible because of the company's substantial free cash flow. It generated $67 billion in free cash flow over the last year, while spending $67 billion in capital expenditures for technology and AI infrastructure.
Google has the resources to deliver the best AI experiences for its users, yet Alphabet stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 25. That's a reasonable multiple to pay for a company that just reported a 22% year-over-year increase in earnings last quarter."

Companies that operate AI infrastructure like Amazon and Alphabet are racing to build new data centers that are powered by renewable energy. The main challenge isn't in building new data centers, but in scaling up the required amount of renewable energy.
This is where hydrogen fuel comes into play. Hydrogen fuel has long been a promising power source for the renewable economy. But high costs have prevented the technology from being adopted at mass scale. The massive buildout of infrastructure to enable the AI revolution could change all of that. Does that make Plug Power stock a buy? You might be surprised by the answer.
Artificial intelligence is creating a huge surge in power demand
The world's energy systems are about to be transformed thanks to a huge surge in demand for AI technologies, a surge that is expected to be sustained for decades to come. Energy use by data centers -- critical infrastructure that is largely powering the AI revolution -- has historically grown by 12% or more annually. The sharp uptake in AI demand more recently should see that growth rate rise even higher.
Not only will we see a sharp increase in power demand, but the type of power that will be demanded is expected to change. That's because many technology companies have internal mandates that require high levels of renewable energy. The existing grid isn't transitioning to renewable energy fast enough, causing some companies to build out their own energy supplies. Google, for example, is funding the development of three new nuclear sites in the United States to maintain its position as a carbon neutral business.
According to data from the International Energy Agency, electricity demand from data centers will more than quadruple by 2030. The organization believes that this transition has the ""potential to transform how the energy sector works."" In other words, expect major shifts in how energy is created, stored, and used in the future. This will include a massive build-out in renewable energy, but also a shift toward private energy generation versus simply tapping into the grid. Companies like Google will create energy generation facilities designed mostly for its own use.
Plug Power has already recognized the opportunity to supply the AI industry with localized, renewable energy. Companies may build out their own hydrogen solutions, but grid operators can also turn to hydrogen in order to compensate for highly variable demand. The company said in a blog post:
As AI demand grows, power grids are struggling to keep up. Hydrogen steps in to help when the grid is under pressure. Hydrogen production systems can quickly adjust how much energy they make based on real-time needs. This helps reduce power costs and prevent blackouts.""
For years, the primary issue with hydrogen adoption has been cost competitiveness. But much of hydrogen's high costs come from a lack of scale. Tech giants armed with big budgets could change all of that. After all, nuclear power in the U.S. was long deemed ""dead"" due to the related exorbitant costs. The rise of AI could finally tip the scales for the world's hydrogen buildout.
Is Plug Power stock a buy due to rising demand for AI?
Expect big things when it comes to hydrogen's potential to power the AI revolution. Does that make Plug Power stock a buy? Surprisingly, no.
The challenge with Plug Power stock today isn't necessarily the viability of hydrogen power -- though there are still legitimate questions related to that issue as well. Instead, at least from an investor's perspective, the problem is the company's mounting losses.
In recent years, Plug Power has been posting net losses of around $200 million to $300 million per quarter. That's more than 10% of the company's entire market cap every 90 days. To compensate, the company has turned to government loans and share dilution. Over the past three years, for example, the company's total share count has nearly doubled.
While the AI revolution shows promise for hydrogen power over the long term, heavy share dilution means that Plug Power shareholders today will see their gains diluted heavily, possibly leading to minimal or even negative gains over the long haul. Additionally, there are concerns that Plug Power's technology -- which focuses on proton exchange membrane fuel cells over more efficient and adaptable solid oxide fuel cells -- isn't even the best fit for AI applications. So while hydrogen has the potential to power part of the AI revolution, Plug Power stock in particular still isn't a buy for wise investors."

Of the 10 largest American companies by market cap, the top seven are technology sector companies, specializing in hardware, software, e-commerce, internet search, cloud services, or social media.
Nevertheless, investors shouldn't be confused -- many of these tech giants have plenty of room to grow. Today, three Motley Fool contributing analysts will explore the case for some of their favorites: Meta Platforms (META 1.09%), Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%), and Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%).
Meta is leveraging its lucrative business model to invest in AI
Jake Lerch (Meta Platforms): Not only is Meta Platforms a big tech stock with ample room to grow, but this social media giant could one day become the largest of them all.
It comes down to three simple factors:
- Meta's enormous reach
- The company's lucrative business model
- Meta's artificial intelligence (AI) investments
Let's start with its reach. Meta boasts nearly 3.5 billion daily average users (DAUs) -- roughly 43% of the population of Earth. The scale here can be tough to wrap your head around, but needless to say, it's enormous. Accordingly, the company can leverage this vast network to generate staggering sums of revenue and profit.
Case in point: As of Meta's most recent earnings report (for the six months ending on June 30, 2025), the company generated nearly $90 billion in revenue and $35 billion in net income. That works out to about $500 million in revenue and almost $200 million in net income each and every day.
To put this in context, Domino's Pizza records about $5 billion in revenue each year -- Meta generates a similar amount of revenue every 10 days. What's more, Meta's revenue is growing at an astounding rate of more than 21%.
Finally, we must discuss what Meta is doing with all this money. To summarize, it's pouring tens of billions into AI investments. It has secured hundreds of thousands of high-end GPUs to power the latest AI models, it has extended lucrative signing bonuses to AI researchers, and it's poured tens of billions into projects ranging from the metaverse to wearable augmented reality (AR) glasses.
In summary, Meta is leveraging its enormously profitable social media business to construct an AI empire. In my view, that is a wise investment that could fuel decades of future growth.
Despite unprecedented gains, this AI growth story is far from over
Will Healy (Nvidia): Looking at the trajectory of Nvidia over the last few years, one cannot blame some investors for thinking the bull market in Nvidia has played out. The stock has risen by nearly 1,200% since its November 2022 low. Additionally, with a market cap of $4.1 trillion, rapid growth is unlikely to occur as easily.
However, Nvidia has benefited precisely because it has created and dominated the market for AI accelerators. The company, which was once known best for its gaming chips, derived 88% of its revenue from the data center segment (which designs AI accelerators) in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended July 27).
Also, with Grand View Research forecasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip market of 29% through 2030, its growth is not on track to stop anytime soon.
Although growth rates have slowed in recent quarters, Nvidia's performance far exceeds this estimate. In the first half of fiscal 2026, its $91 billion in revenue increased by 62% from year-ago levels, an impressive feat for a company of its size.
Still, even with that gain, rising demand has spiked production costs, leading its cost of sales to increase by 131% during the same time frame. Consequently, its $45 billion in net income for the first two quarters of the fiscal year amounted to a 43% increase, a more modest rise that keeps Nvidia in a growth mode.
Over the last three years, profits have grown so rapidly that its P/E ratio is at 49 despite the stock's massive gains, and a 38 forward P/E ratio confirms its continued growth trajectory. Considering the 54% yearly revenue increase Nvidia has forecast for fiscal Q3, investors should expect its stock to climb for the rest of this year and beyond.
Alphabet is up 40% over the past three months, but there is still time to buy
Justin Pope (Alphabet): Technology juggernaut Alphabet continues to rip higher, but I'm still calling this winner a buy. What investors have seen is simply a metaphorical coiled spring that has now unleashed its pent-up energy following the company's favorable outcome in its antitrust litigation.
The stock felt selling pressure for months as Wall Street worried that the courts would take drastic measures to rectify Alphabet's anticompetitive practices in its search engine business. Rumors suggested potential forced sales of key assets, such as the Chrome web browser or Android smartphone operating system. It appears that those worst-case scenarios are out of play.
Now, investors can focus on all the things going right at Alphabet. The company's Gemini AI app has climbed to the top of smartphone app stores, and Google Cloud is thriving as AI demand drives more cloud consumption in Alphabet's direction.
Last but not least, Alphabet's Waymo autonomous ride-hailing service is steadily expanding across the United States. Meanwhile, Tesla's robotaxi, its primary competition, remains confined to a fixed area in Austin, and has reportedly gotten into a few accidents already despite the safeguards in place.
The stock has surged over the past few months, but shares remain valued at roughly 25 times estimated 2025 earnings. That's still a solid deal for one of the world's most prominent technology companies and an emerging leader in AI infrastructure and software, especially if the company can meet Wall Street's expectations of 15% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years."

Stay tuned to discover how you can stay ahead of evolving narratives surrounding Alphabet’s stock.
What Wall Street Has Been Saying
Analyst sentiment on Alphabet remains generally positive, though a degree of caution is evident following the company’s recent rally. The balance of views highlights where Wall Street sees the greatest opportunities, as well as the most immediate risks, surrounding Alphabet’s valuation, execution, and near-term growth potential.
🐂 Bullish Takeaways
-
Many analysts view the recent favorable antitrust court ruling as eliminating longstanding regulatory overhangs. Several have upgraded their price targets as a result. For instance, analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their target to $265, citing reduced risk to core distribution agreements and minimal threat of severe remedies.
-
Performance across Alphabet’s AI, cloud, and YouTube divisions continues to impress. Analysts highlight advances in AI technology, growing demand for Tensor Processing Units, and ongoing progress in YouTube and core Search monetization as critical drivers of projected earnings upside.
-
Potential partnerships, such as rumored collaborations with Apple for deeper AI integration and PayPal for payment solutions, are seen as further building Alphabet’s competitive moat and supporting long-term ecosystem evolution.
-
Bullish reports from Oppenheimer and Goldman Sachs point to Alphabet's improved cost control, strategic execution, and commitment to transparency as supporting factors for multiple expansion and sustained growth. Both firms maintain “Buy” ratings with modest upward adjustments to price targets.
🐻 Bearish Takeaways
-
A vocal minority of analysts express concerns about Alphabet’s valuation, noting that much of the company’s recent AI-driven upside may already be reflected in the share price. Jefferies downgraded Alphabet to “Hold,” maintaining a $220 target and emphasizing potential for short-term downside if momentum cools.
-
Reservations persist regarding Alphabet’s ability to maintain growth in the face of evolving competitive threats, most notably from new AI-driven search competitors such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as regulatory scrutiny outside the US.
-
Berenberg and HSBC caution that while the court ruling reduces fundamental downside risk, the magnitude of positive surprises from operational improvements could diminish from here, especially if digital ad demand softens or partnerships fall through.
-
Some neutral-rated analysts highlight near-term risks tied to macroeconomic uncertainty, evaluating Alphabet’s risk-reward as more balanced after the recent share price appreciation."

However, investors don't need to invest in one or the other; some of the quantum computing pure plays are dabbling in both spaces. This could open up a huge investment opportunity over the next few years and deliver shareholders market-crushing returns.
The standard they'll be judged by is whether they can outperform traditional big tech companies, as they have long led the market to new heights. Additionally, some of them, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), are also competing in the quantum computing arms race alongside the AI buildout.
I've got three stocks that fit the bill that could outperform traditional tech companies, with one of them potentially coming as a surprise.
IonQ and D-Wave Quantum
IONQ (IONQ -6.04%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 3.09%) are two of my favorite quantum computing pure plays to follow. Each is taking a unique approach to the quantum computing industry, potentially giving them a leg up if their novel solutions work.
IonQ utilizes a trapped-ion approach, which has a few key advantages over the more popular superconducting approach. Instead of needing to cool a particle to nearly absolute zero, a trapped-ion computer can perform its tasks at room temperature. This reduces input costs, making it easier to deploy. Additionally, a trapped ion calculation is far more accurate than a superconducting one at this time. IonQ holds multiple world records for the most accurate quantum computers, and this could make it a top pick by potential clients.
D-Wave Quantum uses a quantum annealing approach, which isn't intended for broad use like a trapped ion or superconducting quantum computer might be. Instead, it works by finding the lowest energy state in a system, which represents the optimal solution. This makes it ideal for tasks like statistics or logistics networks, which represent a massive use case for quantum computing.
Each company is also looking at deploying its solutions for AI. IonQ's researchers have utilized several existing large language models and improved them by incorporating quantum computing. This cut down on energy cost and provided better-performing models. D-Wave Quantum is also involved with integrating quantum computing applications with AI, specifically focusing on applications where pre-trained AI could assist businesses and researchers.
Both companies are approaching integration with quantum computing in a hybrid approach, which involves using quantum computers to enhance what traditional computers are already doing. Currently, the king of traditional AI computing is Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%), and it's also dabbling in the AI realm.
Nvidia
Nvidia isn't developing a quantum processing unit to replace its graphics processing units (GPUs). Instead, it's evolving its popular CUDA software to include quantum computing plug-ins, morphing the platform into CUDA-Q.
This is a smart approach by Nvidia, as it allows it to continue focusing on the AI arms race while capturing the upside of quantum computing. This approach will ensure that Nvidia's GPUs are needed in a hybrid computing application, which will continue to be the vast majority of use cases that deploy quantum computing.
While some may argue that Nvidia could be classified as a ""traditional"" tech company, I don't think it falls under this classification, as it's only a computing hardware provider that just happens to be the largest company in the world due to extreme demand. Nvidia is making a ton of money from its GPU sales to traditional big tech companies, and I think it's well-positioned to outperform in the current environment as well as in the future, when quantum computing potentially becomes a commercially viable technology."

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes the network’s long-term sustainability may depend on an unlikely hero: low-risk decentralized finance protocols.
Key Takeaways:
- Vitalik Buterin sees low-risk DeFi as a stable revenue source that could support Ethereum’s ecosystem without compromising its values.
- He likens it to Google Search, arguing it can fund Ethereum’s growth while keeping the network ideologically grounded.
- Buterin also advocates for basket currencies and flatcoins to reduce reliance on the US dollar.
In a blog post published Saturday, Buterin compared low-risk DeFi to Google Search, calling it a potential revenue anchor that could fund Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, much like ad revenue from Search props up Google’s other ventures.
Vitalik: Ethereum Can Balance Profit and Principles
The model, he argues, would allow Ethereum to maintain economic strength while preserving its cultural values through nonfinancial apps.
“The revenue generator does not have to be the most revolutionary or exciting application of Ethereum,” Buterin wrote. “But it does need to be something that is at least not actively unethical or not embarrassing.”
Buterin pointed to Aave’s stablecoin lending rates as a concrete example, blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC yield around 5%, while higher-risk assets offer over 10%.
These returns, he suggests, could be a reliable base layer of income without compromising the ecosystem’s principles.
The Ethereum community, he said, has long been divided between speculative products like NFTs and memecoins, and applications that align with the network’s founding values.
The former generates high fees but little ideological satisfaction, while the latter often lacks revenue to sustain itself. Low-risk DeFi, Buterin argues, can bridge that gap.
Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has recently rebounded, with total value locked (TVL) crossing $100 billion for the first time since early 2022.
Though TVL lagged during the 2022–2023 bear market, recent regulatory momentum, including the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, has revived interest.
A survey from the DeFi Education Fund found that over 40% of Americans would consider using DeFi under stronger regulatory frameworks.
Buterin also took aim at Google’s business model, noting that despite valuable open-source contributions like Chromium and Gemini AI models, the company’s reliance on advertising compromises user privacy.
In contrast, Ethereum’s decentralized design offers a path to align financial performance with ethical outcomes.
“Ethereum has the potential to do much better,” he wrote.
Beyond low-risk lending, Buterin also promoted the development of basket currencies and flatcoins, digital assets pegged to consumer price indices or multiple fiat currencies, as another way to stabilize Ethereum’s economic layer without leaning too heavily on dollar-denominated tools.
Ethereum Revenue Falls 44% in August Despite Price Surge
Ethereum’s on-chain revenue plummeted 44% in August to $14.1 million, down from $25.6 million in July, even as ETH surged to a new all-time high of $4,957.
Network fees also dropped 20% month-over-month, largely due to the long-term effects of the Dencun upgrade, which slashed layer-2 transaction costs but cut into Ethereum’s base-layer revenue.
The decline has raised concerns about Ethereum’s economic sustainability, with some analysts calling the August figures among the weakest since early 2021.
Critics argue that shrinking fee revenue could threaten ETH’s value proposition, while others believe Ethereum is evolving into a foundational layer for global decentralized finance, with lower costs helping fuel broader adoption.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-21T11:05:00,What Are 3 Great Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now?,"Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are all riding the AI wave.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c5dbbedaf744ba0d0ee662fd6296d949c97aa75824f174f26925aada5f24b40a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/what-are-3-great-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/what-are-3-great-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/what-are-3-great-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,fool.com,200.0,,"The market keeps hitting new highs, and technology stocks continue to lead the charge. One of the big reasons for this is artificial intelligence (AI), which has gone from a buzzword to a full-blown spending boom. The development of AI is still in its early stages, so the winners today could continue to win for years to come.
If you've got cash to put to work, here are three tech stocks that still look like buys even after solid runs.
1. Nvidia
Everyone talks about Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%), and for good reason. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for training large language models (LLMs), which has helped it take over 90% market share in the space. This lead, meanwhile, isn't going away anytime soon, mostly because of its software platform CUDA.
Companies have spent years building on Nvidia's software platform, and ripping it all out to switch to something else would be a nightmare. That's why Nvidia owns the lion's share of the AI GPU market and is still growing like crazy.
But Nvidia is more than just chips. It has also built out a powerful networking portfolio. Its proprietary NVLink interconnect system helps its chips to act as a single unit, while it also has other networking components that allow it to deliver complete turnkey AI factories to customers. This is also one of the reasons why even as the market shifts more toward inference, it's still very well positioned.
CEO Jensen Huang thinks AI infrastructure spending could hit $3 trillion to $4 trillion in the next several years. If he's even close, Nvidia should stay one of the biggest AI infrastructure beneficiaries.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.09%) has quietly become one of the biggest AI winners. The company is using the technology to keep users glued to Instagram and Facebook, with its AI recommendation engines feeding users content they are more interested in. This is keeping people on its sites longer, which is giving Meta more opportunities to feed them ads.
On top of that, Meta is also using AI to help advertisers improve their creative and ad targeting, getting them better results. That's a powerful combination, and last quarter, its ad revenue soared 22% year over year to $46.6 billion, driven by higher ad impressions and better pricing.
The really exciting part is what comes next. WhatsApp and Threads are just slowly starting to get ads, which is a nice growth lever Meta hasn't even fully pulled yet. Meanwhile, the company continues to invest in emerging ideas, including the metaverse and ""personal superintelligence."" Meta also just recently launched its first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. If any of these bets hit, the upside in the stock could be huge.
3. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.13%) (GOOG 1.81%) was supposed to be the company most at risk from AI, but it has flipped that narrative on its head. Search growth has actually accelerated as Google rolls out new AI features such as AI Overviews, AI Mode, Circle to Search, and Lens. The recent court decision letting Alphabet keep its search deal with Apple and preserve control of Chrome and Android was another major win, keeping its distribution edge intact. Billions of users still start their internet journeys with Google, and most people stick with defaults.
Alphabet's cloud computing business is also on fire. Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% last quarter and profits more than doubled. AI demand is a huge driver, and Alphabet is one of the few players with an end-to-end AI stack. Its custom AI chips and Gemini models give it both a cost and performance advantage.
Not to be overlooked is the fact that Alphabet also has some big emerging bets in other areas. Waymo is scaling its robotaxi business city by city, and Alphabet's quantum computing team is making progress toward reducing error rates and making the technology commercially viable. These bets will take time, but they could add entirely new growth drivers down the road.
Alphabet's stock has finally started to get the respect it deserves, but there is more potential upside ahead."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-21T08:15:00,2 Top AI Growth Stocks to Buy in September,These stocks offer attractive growth prospects at a reasonable price.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=14cf73b690444fa1603ed3c00123fbccfd5c414dd7db9b155b55e96f5ae876cf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/2-top-ai-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,fool.com,200.0,,"Tech giants continue to announce more capital investment in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Demand remains strong from large enterprises looking to gain better insights from their data using AI-powered services in the cloud.
Two companies that are benefiting from these trends are Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 2.13%) and Amazon (AMZN -0.48%). These companies are in a strong competitive position to bring AI innovation to consumers and enterprises, and better yet, their stocks are reasonably valued relative to their earnings potential.
1. Alphabet
Shares of Alphabet have surged in 2025 as investors begin to recognize Google as an AI juggernaut. Google's Gemini AI model powers intelligent features across all the company's services, including Search, Google Cloud, and other apps. With 2 billion people using services like Google Search and Gmail every day, that makes Google one of the top consumer brands profiting from AI.
Google Search is having a strong year, all thanks to AI. Search revenue grew 12% year over year in Q2. New features like AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving more search frequency and new use cases for Search that is fueling more advertising revenue.
On the enterprise side, Google Cloud is seeing tremendous demand for AI services. Businesses are migrating their data to leading cloud platforms to access AI-powered analytics and application-building tools. This drove an impressive 32% year-over-year increase in cloud revenue last quarter, while the segment's operating profit more than doubled.
AI is also bringing internal improvements to Google's operations, such as automating more than 30% of its code. This frees up time for Google's engineers to work on new ideas that can speed up its product development. This has the potential to accelerate its growth over the next decade, which isn't reflected in the stock's valuation.
Management plans to spend $85 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, up from the previous estimate of $75 billion. This is to meet the growing demand for cloud and other services, signaling that Google's future growth is undervalued.
Even after the recent climb, the stock still trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23 based on 2026 estimates. This is attractive for an AI-first company that should deliver double-digit annualized earnings growth over the long term.
2. Amazon
Amazon is another tech juggernaut that would make a solid addition to any investor's portfolio right now. Its financial results have been solid this year, with improving sales and profitability in its largest business, e-commerce. But Amazon is also the leading cloud services provider, which is raking in billions in annualized revenue for enterprise AI services.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) generates $116 billion in annualized revenue. This represents 18% of the company's total revenue, but produces most of the company's profit. While AWS is facing greater competitive pressure from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, it continues to sign major deals with global brands. Last quarter, AWS signed new agreements with PepsiCo, Peloton, and Warner Bros. Discovery, among others.
Demand for AI is so great it is stretching AWS' computing capacity. Specifically, generative AI solutions are experiencing triple-digit year-over-year growth. This means as Amazon invests in bringing more compute capacity online, AWS revenue could accelerate in 2026.
AI is also benefiting Amazon's e-commerce operations through more intelligent delivery routing, inventory placement, and faster order processing, with more than 1 million robots at its warehouses. This shows a valuable synergy taking shape where AI improves the efficiency of the e-commerce business, while higher revenues from e-commerce help fund more investment in research and development for AI innovation in cloud services.
In many ways, Amazon has become an AI-first business, making it a solid choice for investors looking for a relatively safe business to invest in AI for the long haul.
The stock is trading at a forward P/E of 30 times, using next year's earnings estimate. This is reasonable for a business that just posted a year-over-year earnings increase of 33%, partly driven by AI-driven cost efficiencies in e-commerce. Analysts expect the company to deliver 17% annualized earnings growth, which could double the stock by 2030."

This joint effort aims to establish a global open protocol that ensures secure, transparent, and auditable payments for AI agents. By combining Questflow's expertise in AI-driven workflows with Google's leadership in infrastructure, the partnership sets the stage for a trusted and scalable agent-powered ecosystem.
AP2 is the result of a collaborative effort led by Google and over 60 leading global organizations. These partners span across blockchain, fintech, and payments, as well as major financial players.
Traditional payment systems are primarily designed for human users. However, in emerging scenarios where AI agents autonomously conduct transactions, existing systems face significant challenges in authorization, authenticity, and accountability.
AP2 addresses these challenges through its innovative Task Authorization mechanism, which establishes a secure and tamper-proof transaction flow by:
-
Generating digitally signed contracts for every transaction;
-
Recording the user's initial intent, authorization, and final payment with a comprehensive audit trail;
-
Ensuring transactions are verifiable and traceable, fostering trust and security.
The introduction of AP2 paves the way for a new era of commerce, enabling experiences such as intelligent shopping, personalized offers, and cross-platform task collaboration, while supporting multiple payment methods including stablecoins and cryptocurrencies.
As an early contributor, Questflow will continue to work closely with Google and its global partners to advance the AP2 protocol and accelerate the development of infrastructure for the AI-driven economy.

The rating affirmation follows the firm’s GenAl Public Cloud Survey.
The 2025 GenAI Public Cloud Survey has revealed that Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is the second-place choice for companies considering additional cloud providers.
Survey results demonstrate that Google Cloud Platform, or GCP, had a solid showing. However, there is still a gap between GCP and market leaders Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure.
GCP awareness remained in third place in this year’s survey at 80%, compared to 94% overall for AWS and 93% for Azure. The metric was strongest in the Enterprise group, with 88% of respondents, as opposed to 70% to 80% for all other business groups.
Blackledge also noted that Google’s Gemini was the second most popular generative Al large language model, or LLM, providers.
“We asked respondents which companies provide underlying LLMs for their GenAl tools, and Google was the 2nd most commonly-used provider (54% of respondents, rising from 50% in our 2024 survey). Meanwhile, OpenAl was the top choice (73% of respondents), but declined somewhat vs 82% in our prior year’s survey, perhaps indicating a shift towards a wider array of LLM providers.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook wants you to know that tariffs have nothing to do with the iPhone 17's higher prices.
""There's no increase for tariffs in the prices to be totally clear,"" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer from Apple's Fifth Avenue store as the iPhone 17 launched worldwide [1].
Cook's statement comes just months after President Trump took to Truth Social to threaten Apple directly with tariffs: ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple"" [2].

The iPhone 17 Pro Max with 2TB of storage costs exactly $1,999, coming in more expensive than most laptops. It's the first time any iPhone has reached this shocking price point. And while Cook says it's not about tariffs, his own company's moves suggest otherwise.
Cook's tariff defense doesn't add up
Cook insisted the price hikes have nothing to do with President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. But Apple's own numbers tell a different story.
During the June quarter, Apple took an $800 million hit from tariff costs, Cook revealed during the company's earnings call. For the September quarter, that number could jump to $1.1 billion, Cook said.
To avoid these costs, Apple has been moving iPhone production out of China. The company now makes phones in India and Vietnam, countries with lower tariffs. Cook also announced Apple will invest $600 billion in U.S. manufacturing over four years.
""We can't be everywhere. I wish we could, but we are putting $600 billion to work in the next four years,"" Cook told CNBC. ""And so it is an extraordinary commitment"" [1].
He called this a ""domino effect"" that would bring more companies to build in America. But experts doubt Apple will ever make iPhones in the U.S. The math just doesn't work on pricing alone, not to mention logistics.

Both blockchains provide faster, cheaper, and more secure financial transactions than traditional SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) transfers, and they both support cross-border transfers, automated payments, integrations with third-party digital wallets, and tokenized assets.
That announcement might alarm Ripple's users and XRP's investors, but is Google really trying to kill XRP? Let's review the key similarities and differences to find out.
The similarities and differences between GCUL and XRPL
GCUL and XRPL are both designed to facilitate faster financial transactions, but there are three key differences.
First, GCUL is a centralized private platform that is only open to vetted and approved institutions. It's geared toward regulatory compliance, stability, and institutional control, with Google Cloud initially managing its governance and infrastructure services.
XRPL is a decentralized public platform that anyone can access. Its validators are spread out across the world instead of being corralled within a single company. That can be a double-edged sword: It can be more freely accessed than GCUL, but the lack of a vetting and approval process exposes it to more illegal transactions.
Second, GCUL doesn't have its own native token. XRPL has a native token, XRP, which is mainly used to satisfy its settlements, fees, and reserve requirements. XRPL's fees are low, but its fees rise as its network activity increases. GCUL charges predictable monthly fees instead of relying on volatile fees driven by the blockchain system's ""tokenomics.""
XRPL also has its own native stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD 0.02%), which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Both Ripple USD and XRP are frequently used for bridge currency transfers -- in which two volatile or illiquid currencies are directly converted to the native token as a ""bridge"" instead of being converted to a third fiat currency (like the U.S. dollar) in a slower and pricier transaction. Without its own tokens, GCUL will likely underperform XRPL in those bridge currency transfers.
Lastly, GCUL natively supports smart contracts, which are used in the development of blockchain-based applications. XRPL only natively supports lightweight ""hooks"" for developing simpler programs, but it's reportedly been mulling the development of ""sidechains"" to integrate more Ethereum (ETH -2.94%)-based smart contracts into its ledger.
Is GCUL a threat to XRPL?
Google's GCUL could be an appealing option for larger banks, clearinghouses, and asset managers who prefer a tightly regulated platform with predictable fees. It could also be a natural fit for large enterprise customers that are already locked into Google's cloud-based services.
However, XRPL's decentralized approach, resistance to regulators, and lower fees should make it more appealing to individual users and smaller financial institutions who don't want to lock themselves into Google's ecosystem. Google is also approving GCUL's customers on a strict case-by-case basis, which could drive more customers to XRPL due to the sluggish process.
Moreover, Google doesn't plan to officially launch GCUL until 2026. Before that happens, a few major catalysts could spark XRPL's near-term expansion: the increased adoption of Ripple USD as an alternative to the U.S. dollar; the approvals of XRP's first spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in October and November, and the rollout of more sidechains to support the development of decentralized apps (dApps) and other crypto assets.
XRPL has already partnered with more than 300 banks worldwide, so there could plenty of room for both of these blockchains to flourish without trampling each other. XRPL and GCUL certainly have plenty of overlapping interests, but it's premature to call the latter -- or any other newcomer -- an ""XRP killer"" before it even launches."

As a result, investors are wondering what the best approach to quantum computing is.
There are publicly traded quantum computing investments, like IonQ (IONQ -6.04%), that have massive upside if they work out. However, they also come with big risks if their technology isn't adopted. Multiple big tech companies are also involved in the quantum computing arms race, like Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 2.13%). These companies have nearly unlimited resources compared to the start-ups, but don't have near the upside. This makes them safer picks, but investors might be worried they're leaving too much potential on the table by not taking some risk.
So, between the two, which is the best quantum computing investment right now?
Investors must pay a premium for IonQ
There is a significant size difference between the two companies. Alphabet is a tech behemoth with a market cap of $2.9 trillion, while IonQ is a comparatively small $17 billion company. However, despite Alphabet's size, the stock is far cheaper than IonQ. Let me explain.
Currently, IonQ isn't making a ton of money. It's relying on various research partnerships and contracts that it has signed to generate revenue. In Q2, it recognized revenue of $21 million, which is a rounding error compared to Alphabet's results. Alphabet generated $96.4 billion in revenue during Q2, making IonQ's revenue 0.0218% of Alphabet's total. That's a huge difference.
With Alphabet, you're paying about 8 times sales for the stock, or for every dollar of sales over 12 months, you're paying $8. IonQ trades for 242 times sales, so it's quite a bit more expensive.
This mismatch is because the market is far more excited about IonQ's future than Alphabet's. Should both companies develop commercially relevant quantum computing systems, the effect it will have on each company's growth is quite different. For Alphabet, it will likely contribute a few extra percentage points each quarter. For IonQ, a major system sale could cause its revenue to double or triple year over year. That explosive growth is what excites investors the most with IonQ, although it's far from guaranteed.
Buying both stocks allows investors to balance risk
There's no guarantee that the approach Alphabet or IonQ is taking will be a winning one. There may be a hidden flaw in each company's design that doesn't appear for a few years, which could eliminate them from contention in the quantum computing arms race.
While this would be disappointing for Alphabet, it wouldn't be the end of the world. It would continue down its path of AI dominance and also thrive on the advertising revenue generated by the Google search engine.
Unfortunately, if this happens to IonQ, the stock would likely go to $0, losing investors a ton of money. This scenario is probably more likely for IonQ than quantum computing success, and investors must be aware of this risk.
So, which one is the better buy? I'd say if you're afraid of a stock going to zero, then IonQ is one to avoid, and Alphabet is more attractive. However, I think there's a better approach. By devoting no more than 1% of your portfolio positioning to a quantum computing long shot like IonQ, you can capture some of the upside if it makes it big while limiting downside risk. Additionally, by purchasing shares of Alphabet to balance this risk out, investors can get two impressive quantum computing plays. This basket approach is a smart way to invest in an emerging field like quantum computing, as it balances out risk by investing in multiple companies."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-20T10:30:00,5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Far Better Buys Than Palantir,"The market is full of reasonably priced AI investments, but Palantir isn't one of them.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7fef5ef4ba3388cbd9ac8c192a74b9747df4f63de181b1c316198b0ef30a80a5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,fool.com,200.0,,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.48%) has been on an impressive run over the past few years. The stock is up 2,570% since the start of 2023, making it an even better performer than Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%) over that timeframe. While that share price performance is great, the business is note growing at quite that pace and Palantir's stock may have gotten ahead of itself. As a result, there are plenty of stocks that look like far better buys than Palantir right now.
I've identified five companies that investors might want to consider before Palantir, and there's one glaring reason why any of this group of five stocks is a far better investment.
Palantir's stock has gotten ahead of itself
Palantir's AI software has seen significant growth recently, driving Palantir's 48% year-over-year revenue increase in Q2. I wouldn't be surprised to see the growth rate accelerate through the end of the year, but it will take a lot more than that to justify Palantir's stock price.
Although the stock price has increased 25-fold since the start of 2023, its quarterly revenue has only risen by 81%. This suggests that nearly all of Palantir's stock performance can be attributed to its valuation rising, which becomes evident when examining its valuation multiples.
At 126 times sales and 267 times forward earnings, Palantir is one of the most expensive stocks in the market.
It's rare for any stock to trade in the triple-digit price-to-sales (P/S) ratio range, let alone one that isn't doubling or tripling its revenue year over year, yet that's where we find Palantir. Palantir's stock has years of growth baked into the stock price, which will impede future returns. As a result, I think AI investors should consider other options, especially those with more reasonable valuations.
The market is full of promising AI investment opportunities
There are multiple ways to invest in the AI arms race, but my preferred approach is through companies that provide the computing hardware necessary to power AI computing. Chief among these are Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO 1.93%). Nvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), which are utilized for training and running AI models. Its GPUs are responsible for almost all of the AI technology we utilize today, and it will remain a top choice in the future.
Broadcom is also making a name for itself in two areas. First, its networking switches help stitch back information that is calculated across multiple computing units. Second, its custom AI chips, which are designed in collaboration with an end user, are starting to challenge Nvidia's computing dominance. Both companies will continue to be excellent AI investments as AI infrastructure spending ramps up.
Another important field in the hardware space is chip fabrication. My favorite fabricator by far is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.33%). TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, as they lack the in-house capabilities to do so. It has a long track record of continuously innovating and producing the world's most powerful chips, and an investment in TSMC is a bet that we're going to need more advanced chips in great quantities in the future (which is a safe bet).
Another company along the same lines as TSMC is ASML (ASML 2.39%). ASML manufactures extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are required in the chip manufacturing process. ASML is the only company in the world with this capability, making it a technological monopoly. As more chip foundries are built to handle the massive demand for AI-related equipment, ASML is expected to continue growing.
Lastly, I like Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 2.13%), which is both a hardware player (through its cloud computing service) and an AI developer (with its leading AI model, Gemini). The market has doubted Alphabet since it fell behind at the start of the AI arms race, but it has quickly found its running legs and is back in the AI race, and is a strong bet to continue being a market leader.
A look at their valuations shows that all five of these companies are far better buys than Palantir, and investors should consider this group first."

According to the firm, Apple is “the gateway to the Intelligence Revolution,” and it is well positioned to benefit from artificial intelligence advancements.
It noted how the recent Google remedies decision have eliminated an overhang for Apple and also paved way for the company to leverage Gemini’s AI technology.
“We are positive on Apple to continue to drive strong EPS growth from its expansion of its user base and share buybacks but note significant risks ahead, notably in AI and in new devices. That said, one of the key risks – the Google DOJ remedies – has reached a resolution favorable to Apple, eliminating an overhang and potentially clearing a path for partnerships in AI.”
Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-20T06:25:49,"Google isn’t kidding around about cost cutting, even slashing its FT subscription",These cuts may save Google mere thousands; they also come as Google faces increasingly strained relationships with news publishers.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0f85034611fa992d273df3da49bd390e7a26f01bff115335f6a2802f192b1f84,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-isn-t-kidding-around-052549029.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-isn-t-kidding-around-052549029.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-isn-t-kidding-around-052549029.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"Google is ending its enterprise subscription to the Financial Times, and it’s not the only enterprise media subscription on the chopping block, sources say. The cuts reflect broader cost-reduction efforts at the search giant, even as the company reports strong financial performance.
Google has been implementing cost reductions across 2025, including eliminating 35% of managers who oversee teams of three people or fewer, and offering voluntary exit programs across multiple divisions since January. Finance chief Anat Ashkenazi signaled late last year that the company would continue to push cost cuts “a little further,” a mandate that appears unchanged despite Alphabet reporting strong Q2 2025 results with $96.4 billion in revenue.
These cuts may save Google mere thousands; they also come as Google faces increasingly strained relationships with news publishers. August data from the trade association Digital Content Next showed median referral traffic from Google Search to publishers fell 10% between May and June of this year, with non-news brands experiencing 14% drops.
Major outlets, including CNN, Business Insider, and HuffPost have reportedly seen even sharper traffic declines (of 30%, 40%, and 40%, respectively), according to data from SimilarWeb.
Publishers attribute these declines largely to Google’s AI Overviews feature, which has reduced click-throughs to external websites from 56% to 69% since its launch, according to Pew Research. This spring, Pew analyzed data from 900 U.S. adults, six in ten of whom conducted at least one Google search in March 2025 that produced an AI-generated summary.
The traffic decline comes as Google has largely resisted content licensing, unlike rival OpenAI, which has signed deals with numerous major publishers including The Financial Times, News Corp, and Axel Springer. So far at least, Google has struck few deals, including one with the Associated Press and an annual Reddit agreement reportedly worth $60 million per year. (According to a new Bloomberg report, Reddit is now looking to renegotiate its contracts with both Google and OpenAI, with Bloomberg suggesting that Reddit sees its prominent role in search results and generative AI training as even more valuable than it first understood.)
Google reportedly began exploratory talks with 20 outlets about more content licensing deals this summer. Still, some might see Google canceling its FT subscription as akin to a plagiarist refusing to buy the textbook they’re copying from.
At a Fortune event earlier this month, the CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the U.S. — Neil Vogel of People Inc. — didn’t hold his punches, calling Google a “bad actor” and accusing it of using the same bot to crawl websites for its search engine as it does to support its AI features."

(GOOG) closed at $255.24 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.15% move from the prior day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.49% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.38%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.72%.
Shares of the company witnessed a gain of 25.77% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 6.81%, and the S&P 500's gain of 2.99%.
The investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.32, indicating a 9.43% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $84.53 billion, up 13.39% from the year-ago period.
Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.98 per share and revenue of $334.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +24.13% and +13.38%, respectively, from last year.
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.
Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.14% lower. At present, Alphabet Inc. boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
In terms of valuation, Alphabet Inc. is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 25.29. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 25.26, so one might conclude that Alphabet Inc. is trading at a premium comparatively.
We can additionally observe that GOOG currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.7. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.7 as of yesterday's close."

Under the multiyear deal, Oracle would provide the social media giant with computing power for training and deploying artificial intelligence models, according to people familiar with the talks. The total commitment amount may increase and other deal terms could still change before a final agreement, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.
The contract would add to a series of wins for Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business. Last week, the company reported a huge increase in bookings that vaulted its stock price to an all-time high. Oracle has previously disclosed cloud business with Meta and other companies that train AI models, including Elon Musk’s xAI.
Oracle shares climbed 4.1% to $308.66 at the close Friday in New York. The stock, fueled by the company’s cloud success, has jumped 85% this year.
Known for its database software, Oracle is emerging as a key provider of AI computing capacity, competing against cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
Meta declined to comment. Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
In August, Bloomberg reported that Oracle was in talks with Meta for additional cloud capacity.
Still, investors have voiced concern over how much of Oracle’s booked cloud deals are attributable to a single customer, OpenAI, which is the leading AI company. Earlier this year, Oracle won a deal to provide the AI company with 4.5 gigawatts of computing power, an unprecedented sum.

(Reuters) -Oracle is in talks with Meta for a multi-year cloud computing deal worth about $20 billion, underscoring the social media giant's drive to secure faster access to computing power, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Oracle would provide Meta with computing capacity for training and deploying AI models, in addition to Meta's existing cloud computing providers, the person said.
Meta declined to comment, while Oracle did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters.
Oracle offers integrated cloud technologies along with flexible deployment models, enabling it to meet a range of customer demands.
The potential deal comes just a week after a Wall Street Journal report on OpenAI signing a contract to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years from Oracle, marking one of the biggest cloud contracts ever signed.
The company has struck deals with Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft to let their cloud customers run Oracle Cloud Infrastructure alongside native services. The revenue from these partnerships rose more than sixteen-fold in the first quarter.
Oracle unveiled four multi-billion-dollar contracts last week, amid an industry-wide shift, led by companies such as OpenAI and xAI, to aggressively spend to secure the massive computing capacity needed to stay ahead in the AI race.
The enterprise software maker said it expects to sign up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in the next few months, and that booked revenue at its OCI business would exceed half a trillion dollars.

PayPal and Google plan to collaborate on
""All banks will need to look at how they support this emerging channel for payments,"" Zachary Aron, principal at Deloitte Consulting LLP, told American Banker.
Big payment moves
PayPal and Google's partnership covers several areas, including agentic shopping and commerce, embedding PayPal technology in Google's platforms, expanded payment processing and collaborating on cloud-delivered technology.
Google and PayPal will cooperate on AI-supported shopping experiences and standards for agentic AI that the two companies hope will be adopted by the broader payments industry. PayPal will contribute its payment processing systems, data-driven personalization and identity technology.
Google will add its own AI tech,
In an unrelated project, Mastercard is also pushing agentic commerce and plans to dramatically scale availability of the technology. By Nov. 28 (Black Friday), all Mastercard cardholders will be enabled for Mastercard Agent Pay in the U.S., with global deployment coming shortly after.
Mastercard additionally released Agent Sign-Up, which lets the card network's Agent Toolkit users identify AI agents and access AI-enabled Mastercard products. Other products are Insight Tokens, which enable security for agentic commerce, and agentic consulting services. Citi and U.S. Bank are the first announced bank partners for Mastercard's expanded AI shopping tools, which will lead to new services for the banks' Mastercard cardholders.
The announcements from PayPal, Google and Mastercard are about building the infrastructure for agentic commerce when it arrives, Aaron McPherson, principal at AFM Consulting LLC, told American Banker, noting there is not a lot of consumer demand for agentic commerce at this point, but there are ""numerous problems to be solved.""
This includes who is responsible when an agent buys the wrong thing, how merchants make their catalogs readable by agents and the possibility of an agent being hijacked by a malicious website and being instructed to do things that violate a user's intent or privacy.
""Remember, AI can't tell a sketchy website from a legitimate one, so there is a lot of opportunity for shenanigans,"" McPherson said.
Big work for banks
While using agentic AI is
""Commerce is the best example of how a bank is present in the everyday life of its customers through embedded payments,""
For banks, agentic AI can lower operational costs by 20%, McKinsey senior partners Pradip Patiath and Ido Segev wrote in
The McKinsey partners also said banks will need to upgrade their technology, operating models and fraud prevention, adding expense to technology budgets. ""If that's not enough, agentic AI could also cut into revenues and profit margins,"" Patiath and Segav wrote. ""For example, AI agents could autonomously open new savings accounts and move money on consumers' behalf to find them the best rates. Or agents could optimize credit card lending balances and take advantage of zero balance-transfer offers, threatening margins.""
As payments and technology companies adopt agentic AI, banks will need to determine a strategy based on developing their own solution, partnering or integrating their products with a solution provided by a merchant or nonbank, Deloitte's Aron said, adding considerations include the degree to which banks can capture wallet share for the transaction, and insight that can help them better serve their customers or strengthen their pitch to merchants.
""While we believe the technology will evolve rapidly and customer-facing solutions will be introduced quickly into the market, a big determinant of whether the solutions are widely adopted and scale will be determined by merchant adoption,"" Aron said. ""Solutions which make it easier for merchants to offer their goods and services through an agentic solution or create a personalized, contextual experience for the customer will drive greater adoption.""
Complicated processing
Agentic commerce creates a number of challenges across the payment value chain, including banks, merchants, and consumers, Aaron Press, research director for worldwide payment strategies for IDC, told American Banker.
""Understanding the data that will be needed and the implications of this data is in the early stages, though it is encouraging that concepts like fraud and security are being considered from the beginning,"" Press said. ""The mechanisms and data management process for all of this, however, are in the early stages.""
Banks will need the ability to confirm that the agent is owned and controlled by the account holder, and that the account holder intended for the transaction to take place.
""The process will also look different depending on the payment type, with card-based payments requiring a different model than DDA-based [demand deposit account] payments,"" Press said. ""This becomes even more complex as you move around the world and try to incorporate the huge number of local and regional payment schemes.
""It's also likely that tokenized credentials and digital wallets will be critical to this process, according to Press. ""Banks would be well advised to understand the implications of token management anyway, but it will be more important in an agentic commerce world,"" Press said."

Google and PayPal partner in preparation for agentic commerce
Google and PayPal want to “help advance the intelligent agent revolution” by making the next generation of digital commerce more accessible to a broad swath of consumers.
The two companies announced Wednesday that they had entered a multi-year partnership focused on upgrading consumers’ transaction experience for evolving AI systems. One of the goals of the partnership is to solidify the necessary cogs for future agentic commerce by leveraging PayPal’s data capturing, identity verification and payment solutions and using Google’s AI savviness. While the two companies have a vested interest in pushing agentic commerce forward, they also highlighted the need for reliable, safe transactions, particularly with AI’s involvement. The partnership announcement comes just one day after Google unveiled its Agent Payments Protocol, which is intended to foster trustworthy transactions led by agents.
Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said the partnership will have far-reaching implications for the technology and e-commerce industries, if executed as planned.
“In this emerging world of agentic commerce, trust and innovation are key,” Chriss said in a statement. “Together with Google, we are leading the way for digital commerce, ensuring greater opportunities for merchants and users worldwide. We are bringing PayPal’s products and services to billions of Google users and redefining what’s possible at global scale.”
The move comes a few months after major payment providers Visa and Mastercard announced that they had teamed up with some of the world’s largest AI companies to enable agentic commerce securely and without sacrificing consumers’ sensitive information.
While the work stemming from those partnerships has not yet come to life at scale, the hope is that linking payment systems with existing AI shopping applications can allow for a truly autonomous experience that would see assistants purchasing items on consumers’ behalf based on a specific inquiry.
Uber Freight upgrades TMS with AI
Uber Freight announced at Deliver 2025, its annual conference, that it had upgraded the AI capabilities available on its platform in an effort to make logistics simpler and more efficient.
Uber Freight’s transportation management system (TMS) has been leveraging AI for some time, but this week, Uber announced that clients can now use the platform to track and handle the order-to-cash journey of shipments in full. That means that, where operators may previously have needed separate, disconnected systems, they can now leverage a single platform that helps them decision quicker and identify issues sooner.
Uber said the platform gives operators “greater control of freight spend and more accurate forecasting across the network.” The company’s hope is that clients use the TMS for real-time information, rather than treating it as a source for completed transactions and freight runs.
In addition to its spend upgrades, Uber has added more features to its procurement platform. The company said it can now automate the data-gathering and modeling behind bid awards. Rather than having a human spend days or weeks finding the information, requesting quotes and evaluating the options against one another, Uber Freight’s platform can generate a real-time comparison of costs, carriers, available services and more. What’s more, the system can project financial and performance metrics ahead of an operator choosing a specific carrier or plan.
The logistics player hopers that, in doing so, it can help clients cut costs and make faster decisions relying on data.
Steve Barber, vice president of product at Uber Freight, said it has already been leveraging agentic AI in its operations with customers, and noted that it expects to provide tangible improvements with these new capabilities.
“From procurement to payment, shippers face constant complexity across the freight lifecycle. Through continued investment in platform innovation, Uber Freight delivers the tools, automations and integrations that simplify the work and unlock meaningful outcomes such as faster decisions, smarter cost control, and more resilient supply chains,” Barber said in a statement.
Seattle-based startup secures pre-seed for in-store feedback
Seattle’s Ethosphere announced Tuesday that it has raised a $2.5 million pre-seed round. Point72 Ventures led the round, with additional participation from AI2 Incubator, Carya Ventures, Pack VC, Hike Ventures and J4 Ventures.
Ethosphere uses microphones to anonymously and securely capture real conversations between in-store retail associates and customers. It then parses through the key parts of the conversation, generates a transcript and passes feedback to both the employee and their manager.
Evan Smith, CEO and co-founder of Ethosphere, said the technology brings a unique use case for AI into companies’ stores and creates a proactive learning opportunity for employees as they go through their normal days.
For instance, Ethosphere might tell a manager that a particular associate is excellent at greeting and interacting with customers, but often shares incorrect product information about a newly stocked product line. The system may then recommend that the manager review the descriptions with that employee to ensure future accuracy.
“AI is bringing change to every industry, and retail is no exception, but there is a significant gap in how the technology can be applied in a useful, human-focused manner,” Smith said in a statement. “Ethosphere wants to bridge that gap by empowering retailers to invest in their people, recognizing that a well-supported and knowledgeable team is the key to building exceptional customer experiences. This human-centric approach not only enhances brick-and-mortar purchasing but also directly impacts a company’s bottom line by fostering loyalty and driving sales. We’re partnering with major brands to achieve this goal.”
The startup plans to use the funding to scale up the pilots it has already started with undisclosed “major retail brands.” Its site also shows that it’s hiring a senior software engineer, who would “lead a squad of two to four engineers” and build various systems to support the continued development of Ethosphere.
Ralph Lauren introduces Microsoft and OpenAI-powered shopping assistant
Ralph Lauren announced last week it had introduced a new, conversational AI chatbot it calls Ask Ralph.
Ask Ralph can handle consumer styling questions and provide recommendations on matching existing items, finding the right outfit for an occasion and more. For instance, a consumer might tell the chatbot that they need to attend an important business meeting and would like to purchase an outfit that matches their favorite navy blue blazer. For the brand, the idea is that consumers can work with the chatbot “just as they would with a stylist in a Ralph Lauren store.”
David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, said allowing consumers to have richer e-commerce experiences will allow the brand to foster an even deeper connection with its shoppers.
“Whether getting ready for a first day of a new job, or creating the perfect look for a night out, Ask Ralph is about more than just discovery—it is about engaging consumers with what they love most about Ralph Lauren: our iconic, unique take on style, providing timeless head-to-toe looks that inspire them to step into our world,” Lauren said in a statement.
Ask Ralph is available only in Ralph Lauren’s app for U.S. users. The brand partnered with Microsoft to leverage its Azure OpenAI platform to enable the technology.
Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president of global industry solutions at Microsoft, said the partnership felt like a natural step for the brand and the technology provider, especially in a moment where consumers are changing their shopping and discovery habits.
“AI is transforming the way consumers get inspired, educated and purchase from fashion brands around the world,” Bransten said in a statement. “We’re proud to bring the combination of our trusted generative AI capabilities through Azure OpenAI together with Ralph Lauren’s iconic brand to pave the way for an entirely new conversational commerce experience.”
Inspectorio introduces intelligence layer Paramo
Supply chain intelligence firm Inspectorio announced Thursday it is introducing Paramo, which it calls “an AI-native ‘intelligence layer’ that is embedded across Inspectorio‘s entire supply chain platform.
Today, some AI solutions are deployed in pieces—for instance, a company might have one provider’s technology running to streamline inventory management and another platform leveraging different data to aid with insights on risks impacting their shipments. Because those two systems are not integrated with one another—that is to say, they don’t leverage the same data sources and don’t have the same baseline for external information—they cannot effectively interact one another, nor can they make parallel recommendations informed by context from the other.
But Inspectorio wants to change that with Paramo. The company said it has built a unified system that uses structured data from retailers and suppliers, with the intention of creating a single source of truth that underlays the recommendations an AI model provides to a user. That system then employs copilots and agentic AI to handle myriad tasks inside an organization. Inspectorio said it has trained the copilots to handle risk detection, document scanning and more. The agents, meanwhile, are meant to independently handle tasks that streamline brands and retailers’ sourcing, compliance and traceability strategies. If the system is deployed as designed, it could help the technology provider’s clients lower their technology and sourcing spends, upgrade compliance protocols and expedite sourcing.
Chirag Patel, CEO at Inspectorio, said supply chain management needs to be able to evolve effectively alongside technology.
“As retailers and brands navigate an increasingly complex supplier landscape, high-quality data and production chain visibility fuels more trustworthy outputs and decision making,” Patel said in a statement. “Organizations must evolve their operations by increasing agility and automation, and Paramo enables brands and retailers to transform this disruption into stability and growth. Embedded operational intelligence is the only way to future-proof operations. Paramo sets the industry standard for the future of supply chain management.”"

Quantum computers are the next innovation in computing. While the foundation of computers is bits, the most basic unit of information, quantum computers use qubits, which can process data with more complexity and therefore solve much more complex calculations in a much more efficient manner.
According to Google's quantum team, quantum computers have the potential to help create more effective drug treatments and the ability to provide key insights that could be used to identify and develop new sources of clean energy.
One company that has benefited from the quantum trade is Rigetti Computing (RGTI -0.43%). In July, the company announced that its 36-qubit system had achieved 99.5% median two-qubit gate fidelity, which is a measure of accuracy. Rigetti also hopes to achieve the same accuracy with its 100-plus-qubit system before year's end -- more qubits means a more powerful system.
If you'd invested $1,500 last year
If quantum computers can be commercialized and do what researchers believe is possible, then the sector has the same kind of unlimited potential as AI. The AI trade likely opened investors' eyes, which is why some quantum stocks like Rigetti have been over 20-baggers in the past year.
As of this writing on September 16, if you'd invested $1,500 one year ago, you'd have a whopping $36,500 today! Returns over the past year have been phenomenal, but keep in mind that Rigetti is still losing money, generates very little revenue, and now trades at a nearly $6.5 billion market cap anyway. Investors should understand that Rigetti is a very risky investment. The commercialization of quantum computing could still be far away, and it's hard to know just how advanced these machines will actually be."

Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko urged Bitcoin to accelerate quantum-resistant upgrades, warning there’s a 50% chance of a quantum breakthrough within five years that could compromise existing cryptographic security.
Speaking at the All-In Summit 2025, Yakovenko said Bitcoin should migrate to quantum-resistant signature schemes as AI acceleration makes the timeline from research to implementation “astounding.”
His warning aligns with growing industry concerns about quantum computers’ ability to break elliptic curve cryptography, which protects Bitcoin wallets.
Current quantum machines have around 1,000 qubits, but experts estimate thousands or millions would be needed to threaten crypto security.
Tech giants, including IBM, Google, and Microsoft, are pushing massive development timelines with some targeting millions of qubits within the coming decade.
Vulnerable Bitcoin Holdings at Risk
Cybersecurity experts estimate approximately 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, roughly 6-7 million BTC worth hundreds of billions of dollars, remains vulnerable to potential quantum attacks.
These coins sit in older Pay-to-Public-Key addresses or reused Pay-to-Pubkey-Hash formats that expose public keys directly on the blockchain.
In an interview with Cryptonew, David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol and a former ethical hacker, warned that adversaries may already be implementing “harvest now, decrypt later” strategies.
These attacks involve collecting encrypted blockchain data today for future decryption once quantum computers become capable enough.
In response to the growing threat of this technology, El Salvador took proactive steps in September, splitting its 6,284 BTC national reserve across 14 separate addresses to reduce exposure to quantum attacks.
The redistribution followed security experts’ recommendations to avoid single-address storage that concentrates risk when public keys become visible through transactions.
Major financial institutions have also begun acknowledging quantum risks. BlackRock highlighted quantum computing threats in Bitcoin ETF filings, while Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino warned about inactive wallet exposures.
Industry Timeline Estimates Converging on Late 2020s
Multiple quantum computing experts have narrowed their estimates for when quantum computers could break Bitcoin’s security to the late 2020s or early 2030s.
Dating back to 2017, researchers, including Divesh Aggarwal and Gavin Brennen, initially warned that elliptic curve cryptography could be broken “as early as 2027.”
However, Gavin Brennen from Macquarie University recently updated his assessment, noting that required quantum computer sizes have dropped from 10-20 million qubits to around one million.
“Quantum computers pose a threat to blockchains, primarily by attacks on digital signatures, and cryptocurrencies should get started sooner rather than later to upgrade their systems to use post-quantum cryptography before their asset valuations are threatened,” Gavin said.
Gavin also shared that “French startup Alice & Bob estimates that specialized [quantum computers] with just 126,000 physical qubits could crack 256-bit elliptic curve signatures.”
According to a Cryptonew interview in April, John Lilic, CEO of Telos and an early Ethereum contributor, has stopped making deals involving tokens after 2027 or 2028 based on his quantum timeline research.
He warned that quantum attacks will appear innocuous initially, resembling dormant wallets becoming active rather than obvious security breaches.
The convergence of AI with quantum computing has accelerated development timelines beyond earlier predictions.
Microsoft’s recent chip breakthroughs prompted claims that quantum computing is now “years, not decades” away.
Amazon and Google have also reportedly made similar aggressive timeline commitments with their respective quantum initiatives.
IBM is also planning to build 100,000-qubit chipsets by decade’s end, while PsiQuantum targets one million photonic qubits within the same timeframe.
These developments have prompted Yakovenko and others to emphasize the urgency of preparing cryptographic defenses before quantum capabilities mature.
Migration Challenges and Post-Quantum Solutions
Upgrading Bitcoin to quantum-resistant cryptography requires enormous coordination challenges for decentralized networks.
Unlike centralized institutions that can update SSL certificates overnight, blockchain networks require consensus from all participants, including inactive users and legacy wallet holders.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology finalized three main post-quantum digital signature standards in 2024: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+.
However, implementing these algorithms requires hard forks, which Bitcoin’s decentralized governance structure makes it difficult to coordinate quickly.
Quantum-resistant algorithms typically require larger key sizes and more processing power, which can slow transaction times and increase computational requirements for mining operations.
These performance tradeoffs complicate the transition while quantum threats loom closer.
However, Carvalho recommends phased migration approaches, including dual-signature transactions that combine current ECDSA signatures with post-quantum proofs.
This allows testing quantum-safe infrastructure while maintaining compatibility with existing systems until full transitions become necessary.
As it stands now, the immediate focus remains on defensive preparations, rather than speculations on when.

Wedbush analyst Scott Devid, who has an outperform rating on Amazon and an underperform on Instacart, writes that the Win Dixie tie up is a quote incremental step forward in Amazon's broader strategy to capture share in the category.
Instacart and traditional grocer shares took a hit last month after Amazon rolled out same day grocery delivery in 2300 US cities.
And finally, Alphabet. The Google parent will meet the European Union's deadline to propose changes to its advertising technology business. That's according to Bloomberg. Google was fined $3.5 billion earlier this month by the EU over what it views as dominance in that ad tech business. Google had previously considered selling parts of the business to resolve anti-trust concerns, but those were at the time not deemed to have met the bar required by regulators.
This month's penalty pushed the US tech giant's EU anti-trust bill close to 10 billion euros over the past decade. The company has vowed to appeal it.

The company's recent announcement to expand its Wisconsin datacenter plan to $7 billion underscores a broader commitment to building the computational backbone necessary for AI and cloud services dominance.
The scale of Microsoft's datacenter ambitions is staggering. Operating over 300 datacenters across more than 60 regions globally, the company has positioned itself as one of the world's largest datacenter operators. This extensive network directly translates into revenue potential, as evidenced by the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, where Azure and other cloud services revenues grew 29% year over year, driven largely by AI services demand that relies heavily on this infrastructure.
The Wisconsin expansion, building upon earlier investments, reflects Microsoft's strategic bet that datacenter capacity will become the limiting factor in AI adoption. This $7 billion commitment alone could generate thousands of jobs while providing the computing power necessary to serve enterprise AI workloads at scale.
Microsoft's datacenter investments create multiple value streams beyond direct cloud revenues. These facilities enable the company to offer lower-latency services, improve data sovereignty compliance for international customers, and maintain competitive advantages in the rapidly growing AI-as-a-service market. With capital expenditures in datacenter infrastructure exceeding $50 billion annually, Microsoft is essentially building a moat that few competitors can match, positioning the stock for sustained growth as digital transformation and AI adoption accelerate globally.
How Amazon and Google Stack Up in the Datacenter Race
Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services operates approximately 105 availability zones across 33 geographic regions, with Amazon continuing to expand its infrastructure footprint through multi-billion dollar investments. Amazon's datacenter strategy focuses on maintaining its cloud market leadership, with the company announcing plans for additional regions in Malaysia, Mexico, and New Zealand.
Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform runs 40 regions and 121 zones globally, with Google investing heavily in subsea cables and edge locations to differentiate its infrastructure. Google's recent commitment to invest $3.3 billion in South Carolina datacenters demonstrates its determination to close the gap. While Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader by market share at roughly 31%, Google has accelerated its datacenter buildout to capture more enterprise AI workloads, though both companies trail Microsoft's geographic reach of more than 300 datacenters worldwide."

Meta says it has sold 2 million of the first-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and earlier this year, Meta unveiled its latest AI-powered smart glasses with Oakley, which were designed for athletes. Silicon Valley is leaning heavily into AI wearables, and Meta seems to be one of the companies leading the charge.
What happened at Meta Connect 2025
With Meta looking to regain its footing in the AI race and sell more hardware, the company had a lot at stake during Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Connect 2025 keynote. Overall, Meta showcased some pretty impressive technology — the Meta Neural Band, the wristband controller that comes with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, is a particular highlight.
And yet, in a twist that felt reminiscent of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Zuckerberg’s demo of the AI capabilities on the Ray-Ban Metas failed. Whoops!
While sharing a live video feed of the cooking content creator Jack Mancuso at Meta HQ, Zuckerberg asked the chef to demonstrate how his Ray-Ban Meta glasses could help him whip up a Korean-inspired steak sauce.
“I love the setup you have here, with soy sauce and other ingredients. How can I help?” asked the chipper Meta AI voice.
Mancuso asked for a recipe for a Korean-inspired steak sauce, and the AI voice began to list the ingredients that he would need — but Mancuso knows he needs to keep the demo succinct, so he interrupts and asks, “What do I do first?”
After a moment of silence that dragged a bit too long, Mancuso repeated, “What do I do first?”
“You’ve already combined the base ingredients, so now grate a pear to add to the sauce,” the AI said. But he had not yet combined the base ingredients, because he had not started making the recipe, hence the question of what to do first.
Mancuso asked the same question again, and the AI gave the same response. The audience laughed.
“I think the Wi-Fi might be messed up — back to you, Mark!” Mancuso said.
“You know what? It’s all good. The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making the technology, and then the Wi-Fi of the day kind of … catches you,” Zuckerberg said. “Anyway, we’ll go check out what he made later.”
The whole interaction was a bit awkward, especially since the issue did not seem to be with the Wi-Fi. But even when things are going according to plan, these presentations can feel a bit hokey … like the end of the keynote, when Zuckerberg and Diplo quite literally ran into the sunset together, wearing their Meta Oakley Vanguards. It had to be a busy day for Mark, so maybe he just needed an excuse to build some cardio into his schedule."

The company, which owns Facebook, filed an application with US regulators this week seeking authorization to do so. A Meta representative said it was a natural next step to participate in energy markets as it looks to power operations with clean energy.

Buying electricity has become an increasingly urgent challenge for technology companies including Meta, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. They’re all racing to develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems and tools that are notoriously resource-intensive. Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft are already active power traders, according to filings with US regulators.
While big tech companies consume huge amounts of electricity, they also have contracts for power that they can flip around and sell when prices are high.
“There will be opportunities to sell electricity into the wholesale markets and make a little extra money doing that,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James.
Plus, tech companies that have batteries or on-site generators at data centers can sell power from those back to the grid when prices spike, said Andy DeVries, a utilities and power analyst at CreditSights Inc.
Power demand from data centers used to build and run AI models is set to quadruple in 10 years, based on projections from BloombergNEF. At the same time, power prices are rising amid this surge in electric demand. In fact, capacity payments — which generators get in some US markets — hit a record in an auction held this year by the country’s biggest grid, which stretches from Washington to Chicago.
The demand is so robust that some tech firms that touted their climate goals are now considering natural gas a key source to help power their data centers. Last month, for instance, Louisiana regulators approved utility Entergy Corp.’s plan to build three natural gas plants to power Meta’s data center there.
Meta’s application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks authorization “to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services.” It didn’t identify, however, where in the US it would seek to trade power. The company would be required to file for membership in order to trade in one of seven competitive power markets, such as the Texas grid or the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which encompasses the Louisiana data center."

Earlier this year, Apple introduced its Foundation Models framework during WWDC 2025, which allows developers to use the company’s local AI models to power features in their applications.
The company touted that with this framework, developers gain access to AI models without worrying about any inference cost. Plus, these local models have capabilities such as guided generation and tool calling built in.
As iOS 26 is rolling out to all users, developers have been updating their apps to include features powered by Apple’s local AI models. Apple’s models are small compared with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta. That is why local-only features largely improve quality of life with these apps rather than introducing major changes to the app’s workflow.
Below are some of the first apps to tap into Apple’s AI framework.
Lil Artist
The Lil Artist app offers various interactive experiences to help kids learn different skills like creativity, math, and music. Developer Arima Jain and Aman Jain shipped an AI story creator with the iOS 26 update. This allows users to select a character and a theme, with the app generating a story using AI. The developer said that the text generation in the story is powered by the local model.
Daylish
The developer of the Daylish app is working on a prototype for automatically suggesting emojis for timeline events based on the title for the daily planner app.
MoneyCoach
Finance tracking app MoneyCoach has two neat features powered by local models. First, the app shows insights about your spending, such as whether you spent more than average on groceries for that particular week. The other feature automatically suggests categories and subcategories for a spending item for quick entries.
LookUp
The word learning app LookUp has added two new modes using Apple’s AI models. There is a new learning mode, which leverages a local model to create examples corresponding to a word. Plus, the example asks users to explain the usage of the word in a sentence.
The developer is also using on-device models to generate a map view of a word’s origin.
Tasks
Just like a few other apps, the Tasks app implemented a feature to suggest tags for an entry using local models automatically. It’s also using these models to detect a recurring task and schedule it accordingly. And the app lets users speak a few things and use the local model to break them down into various tasks without using the internet.
Day One
Automattic-owned journaling app Day One is using Apple’s models to get highlights and suggest titles for your entry. The team has also implemented a feature to generate prompts that nudge you to dive deeper and write more based on what you have already written.
Crouton
Recipe app Crouton is using Apple Intelligence to suggest tags for a recipe and assign names to timers. It also uses AI to break down a block of text into easy-to-follow steps for cooking.
Loving Foundation Model access on iOS 26, so many possibilities. Here are a few simple features that we’ve added in Crouton so far

Signeasy
Digital signing app Signeasy is using Apple’s local models to extract key insights from a contract and give users a summary of the document they are signing.
Dark Noise
Background sound app Dark Noise has used Apple’s local models to let users describe a soundscape in a few words and generate one based on that. You can adjust the levels of different elements of the soundscape once it is created.
Lights Out
Lights Out is the new app to track the F1 season and grand prix from Shihab Mehboob, developer of Twitter client Avery and Mastodon client Mammoth. The app uses on-device AI models to summarize commentary during a race.
Capture
Note-taking app Capture is using local AI to show category suggestions to users as they type in their notes or tasks.
Lumy
Sun and weather-tracking app Lumy now shows neat weather-related suggestions on the app using AI.
CardPointers
CardPointers is an app that helps you track your credit card expenses and gives suggestions on the best way to earn points from the cards you have. The app’s new version is using AI to let users ask questions about their cards and offers.
Guitar Wiz
Guitar Wiz is a guitar learning app using the Apple Foundation Model framework in a few ways. Users will see an explanation of a chord while learning it. The app is showing advanced players’ insights based on time intervals. Plus, the AI model is helping the developer support over 15 languages.
SmartGym
SmartGym app uses local AI to convert the description of a workout to a step-wise set with rep counts, intervals, and equipment. It also gives users workout summaries with monthly progress, routine breakdowns, and individual exercise performance.
Stoic
Journaling app Stoic is using Apple’s models to give personalized prompts to users based on their mood logging. The models can also help users summarize posts, search past entries, and organize them.
SwingVision
This app helps players of racquet sports such as tennis and pickleball improve their form based on the video recordings. The app makers are now using Foundational models to give actionable and specific feedback.
Zoho
India-based productivity suite company Zoho is using local models to power summarization, translation, and transcription across its apps like Notebook for documents and Tables for spreadsheets.
TrainFitness
The workout app is using on-device models to suggest an alternative for an exercise when you don’t have particular equipment available to you.
Stuff
The to-do app has a listen mode that uses Apple’s AI models to listen to the user and convert the voice to individual tasks.
We will continue updating this list as we discover more apps using Apple’s local models."

Philip G. Palumbo, Founder, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Palumbo Wealth Management, said in a program late July on Schwab Network that AI-related concerns about Alphabet’s search business are overdone and the company’s cash flow generation is “not going to stop.”
“Google for us is a company where I really do believe the whole death of search which is most investors believe is happening is not happening. If you look at Google’s earnings yesterday, they were really terrific. They really nailed it in terms of search.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe concerns around AI-related threats to Google search are overstated. Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. As of April, Google had over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews.
Google’s competitor OpenAI failed to impress the market with its GPT-5 model, while Gemini is gaining traction with new features. Analysts believe the company is strongly positioned to start placing ads in AI search results, which means its core ads business will not be impacted despite the decline in traditional search.
Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is successfully executing on its vast AI potential. The company’s key advantages – stemming from industry-leading models, a full-stack approach to technical infrastructure (including proprietary chips), access to high-quality data, rapidly improving product launch velocity and a robust distribution ecosystem of seven different apps with over two billion users each – are beginning to meaningfully widen Google’s moat and competitive differentiation in AI."

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein commented about Broadcom’s potential deal with OpenAI a few weeks back during a program on CNBC. Rasgon said AVGO’s revenue ramp reminds him of Nvidia.
“You know it’s been speculated that it’s OpenAI. It’s plausible. Whoever this is is moving very, very quickly seems to sort of fit with their persona,” the analyst said. “Now this is really important. You have to remember Broadcom had three customers that were shipping these AI chips. It was Google and Meta and ByteDance. They had four others that were prospects. So one of those prospects this one is now converted into a customer. And it is a tremendous amount of revenue. They said $10 billion next year, which is a very fast ramp relative to anything we’ve seen before. And they’re I mean, they’re implicitly guiding, you know, effectively their AI revenues next year. Well over $40 billion. It was like $30 billion as of last quarter. And I don’t know that it stops in 26 either. They sounded fairly positive that it would continue into the years beyond. And so, you know, if it starts to remind me a little bit of the revenue ramp we started to see for Nvidia, like, like several years ago when this really started to kick off.”
For the fiscal fourth quarter, AVGO expects $6.2 billion in AI revenue, up 66% from a year earlier. The company said it secured $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer. Many analysts believe this customer is OpenAI. Some media reports said the two companies co-designed a chip that will be launched next year.
What’s Broadcom’s moat? It makes ASIC, chips designed for specific applications and tasks. As major companies look for custom chips to break Nvidia monopoly and lower costs, Broadcom is positioned well to thrive. Many top AI spenders are teaming up with Broadcom to develop these chips, which are expected to be high-margin, high-volume products, potentially driving substantial growth in both revenue and profits.
Renaissance Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was the largest contributor to our portfolio performance in the second quarter after reporting strong operating results and guidance. The stock benefited from continued invest tor enthusiasm for high growth momentum stocks, as well as from companies with exposure to artificial intelligence. Importantly, Broadcom has been growing its hyperscale and connectivity product portfolios, resulting in increasing revenue exposure to faster growing artificial intelligence applications and offsetting a slowdown in its legacy semiconductor business.”"

Such a gadget could eat into the markets of Apple and other consumer electronics makers by offering an alternative to users for interacting with AI, challenging the dominance of smartphones and traditional hardware.
Luxshare and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
OpenAI bought hardware startup io Products, founded by former Apple designer Jony Ive, earlier this year in a $6.5 billion deal, underscoring its push to move beyond software into consumer hardware.
Luxshare, a major assembler of Apple's iPhones and AirPods, would bring large-scale manufacturing capabilities to OpenAI's effort.
OpenAI has also approached China-based Goertek (002241.SZ), a supplier that assembles AirPods, HomePods and Apple Watches, to provide components, including speaker modules, for its planned devices, the Information report said.
The project marks one of the boldest bets yet by an AI company to build a dedicated device rather than relying solely on smartphones and PCs. The goal is to create an ""AI-native"" product, hardware designed from the ground up to work with AI models, rather than bolted onto existing platforms.
This, according to analysts, could open new markets and give OpenAI a foothold in consumer electronics, an arena still dominated by Apple, Samsung and Alphabet's Google.

But turn your attention across the pond, and there is not a single European company that is worth over $1 trillion, or even half that amount.
Here's why Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML 2.66%) is the best-positioned company to surpass $1 trillion in market cap within the next decade.
Why leading European companies are much smaller than top U.S. companies
The European stock market is highly fragmented. Instead of being viewed as European Union companies, Siemens is a German company, Novo Nordisk is a Danish company, and Shell is a British company. It would be like if U.S. investors viewed Oracle and Tesla as Texas companies versus Microsoft and Amazon as Washington companies.
There are also different regulations in Europe and more conservative pension and funding rules. Companies tend to be more specialized, although there are some conglomerates, like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, that united French luxury brands in the 1980s.
Most importantly, European stock markets simply haven't benefited from technology as much as the U.S. Many of Europe's largest companies aren't tech enterprises. In contrast, the U.S. stock market is dominated by tech-focused companies like the ""Ten Titans"" that continue to make up a larger share of the S&P 500. The U.S. is the tech capital of the world, and the tech sector makes up around a third of the S&P 500 -- illustrating its importance in the U.S. market.
ASML is an anchor in the AI industry
ASML popped 6.5% on Monday after a sell-side analyst who had been neutral on the stock upgraded it to a buy. The move pushed ASML's market cap to $341 billion -- making it the most valuable European company, even ahead of LVMH. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years, ASML would need a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% -- which seems reasonable for a cutting-edge technology company that heavily benefits from artificial intelligence (AI).
There's no contest that ASML is my top AI stock to buy now and hold for the long term. Holding a stock for years or even decades takes a lot of conviction. For ASML, the essential ingredient in the investment thesis recipe is its monopoly over the most complex part of the semiconductor manufacturing process. ASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems use lenses to print features on microchips.
There are plenty of companies that make DUV machines, including Nikon and Canon, which specialize in camera lenses. However, what sets ASML apart is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. These machines use mirrors to reflect light because EUV light has a wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers (almost X-ray range), which is too small to pass through glass. At a wavelength that small, a glass lens would absorb the light instead of bending/refracting it.
Achieving such a small wavelength unlocks untold efficiency improvements, allowing ASML's machines to pack more transitions per chip by printing more precise features (narrower lines, smaller spacing, etc.). It's an incredible engineering feat, and one that is driving advancements in AI.
EUV's smaller wavelength, fewer steps, and high efficiency make it a must-have for fabs like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung Electronics, and Intel to handle increasingly sophisticated designs from Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.
Steady growth at a great value
Despite the long-term potential, ASML warned investors during its last quarterly earnings release that it may not grow in 2026 -- which sparked a steep sell-off in the stock. However, ASML reaffirmed its 2030 targets. The high end of its guidance range calls for doubling revenue relative to 2024 levels. Additionally, ASML expects its gross margin to expand to the high 50% range, likely because high-margin EUVs are expected to make up an increasingly larger percentage of its sales mix compared to DUVs.
Even after its run-up, ASML sports a reasonable 31 forward price-to-earnings ratio, which is far cheaper than many other fast-growing AI stocks, especially considering ASML's strong moat in EUV technology. What's more, the company has a strong dividend. Currently yielding 0.8%, the quarterly payout is a nice cherry on top for investors seeking to add some passive income to their long-term holdings.
Round out your AI portfolio with ASML
ASML isn't a high-flying AI stock that is heavily disrupting cloud computing or making next-generation chips. Nor is it a tech conglomerate like Microsoft and Alphabet, which have a lot of moving parts in addition to their AI focus. However, ASML is well positioned to grow earnings by double digits over the long term, in lockstep with fabs expanding their manufacturing capacity to meet AI demand.
The stock is an especially attractive buy for investors who have valuation concerns about the current market, especially leading S&P 500 tech stocks. However, it's important to understand that ASML's results can swing based on its order volumes from key customers, as well as geopolitical tensions and trade policy.
Although ASML is a Dutch company, it is heavily influenced by U.S. trade actions. So, ASML's growth could stall in the near term due to factors outside of its control. Therefore, it's best to approach the stock with a long-term mindset, especially as a balanced play bridging the gap between growth and value.
In sum, ASML will benefit from higher chip demand, especially from AI. The stock may be a perfect buy for investors with exposure to other aspects of the value chain, such as the chip designers, fabs, or cloud computing plays. Adding an equipment supplier like ASML, rather than doubling down on just one part of AI, is a great way for investors to build a diversified portfolio."

This is an interesting time in tech. We saw the Nvidia Intel news.
Is this a good thing to see these tie-ups like this?
Well, there's some good in this, always. Look, the United States, as we know,
has to become a chip manufacturer. We cannot be dependent on the rest of the world for chips. Look, we came out of COVID
understanding the supply chain better than we ever did before. We understood that without chips being imported to the United States,
our economy, our manufacturing economy shut down. You literally could not buy most of the things that we want in this country, even simple things as toasters today, somehow have to have chips.
We got to connect to your phone, Gary. I need to know when my toast is done.
I I guess you have to hit your phone in bed to put the toast down in the morning so you you can do that. So, look, we now are in an economy where everything we buy has a chip in it.
We can't be beholden to the rest of the world. So, to the extent that the federal government is getting involved and encouraging chip manufacturing in the United States. And this started in the last administration with the chips Act and we continue to press on this independence of vital necessity goods in this country, I do think is a good thing.
Do you view it as the administration picking winners and losers?
I hope the administration is not picking winners and losers. It's not their job to pick winners and losers. What it is the the federal government's job is is to protect the citizens, protect our safety, protect our well-being. And we know that chips are a vital part of protecting our our our country. You know, simple missiles today have 300 plus chips in them.
So to be to be able to defend ourselves, to be able to build military equipment, we need to be in the chip manufacturing business here. So that I do applaud that we understand the risk of not having chip manufacturing in the United States.
IBM investing uh just billions of dollars in in AI and its own infrastructure. Where do you think we are in the AI CAPEX build out?
You know, look, it's it's the AI CAPEX build is pretty transparent. There's an enormous amount of money being spent in data centers. These data centers will come on
sort of over the next three to four to five years. You know, we'll continue to see more and more use of AI. What what what's going on right now is, you know, people are using AI, but they're using sort of independent software, independent programs to solve a specific AI problem.
Like an agent. Yeah.
Yeah, like an agent.
Do my payroll.
Oh, do my payroll, uh handle my HR, read my, read my documents, help me with my tax return, help me with my tax returns.
Where I believe this is going, where IBM believes this is going, this is going to an enterprise-wide solution where all of these AI programs, these in these these, um, AI facilities will work together. They'll be more coherently, more cohesively related and they'll have a big infrastructure behind that.
And look, that's going to lead us into a really interesting world as people get their data and databases in a more coherent place, and that's what it takes to make I I work. It's going to lead us into a quantum quantum revolution. We think by the end of this decade, we're going to have quantum, you know, be a major part of this equation."

(BAC)strategists.
A BofA team led by Michael Hartnett studied 10 equity bubbles since the start of the previous century, finding that these periods of extreme overvaluation produced average trough-to-peak gains of 244%. That suggests that, after rising 223% from their March 2023 low, the so-called Magnificent Seven cohort has “more to go,” the strategists wrote in a note.

Current valuations also support the notion of further gains for the group, the strategists said. Past stock bubbles typically ended with trailing price-to-earnings ratios of 58, with the benchmark of these stocks 29% above its 200-day moving average.
The seven — Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) — have a trailing P/E ratio of 39 and are still only 20% above their 200-day DMA. This renders them the “best bubble proxy today,” Hartnett and his team wrote.
Appetite among investors for US tech megacaps has driven stocks to all-time highs this year and shows no signs of abating. The Magnificent Seven group recovered swiftly from the shocks caused by the Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek and the turmoil around Trump Administration trade-tariff announcements.
The S&P 500 Info Tech Index has surged 56% from its low in April, with investors buying into every dip along the way.
A positive macro-economic backdrop, the sustained frenzy around AI, along with expectations of further Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts are acting as tailwinds for the sector. In fact, the BofA fund manager survey released this week showed that “Long Magnificent Seven” was regarded as the most crowded trade for the second month running by 42% of respondents.
Hartnett and his team noted that bubbles tend to be short and very concentrated. Back in 2000, as internet-related stocks rallied to extreme levels, the tech sector rose 61% in six months to its peak, while every other S&P 500 sector was down that year.
Meanwhile, investors should also “barbell” their exposure to the Big Tech bubble with some holdings in “distressed value,” as these spurts of hyper-valuation boost economic growth as they unfold. Hartnett said current potential examples of such plays included Brazil, the UK and global energy stocks."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-19T11:07:00,2 Bargain Stocks For Investors on a Budget,There's more to a bargain stock than just a low price.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=efb73694d04ec15d7be7dc6411783679a9d01709adf965886dacec6b2a9abf80,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-bargain-stocks-for-investors-on-a-budget/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-bargain-stocks-for-investors-on-a-budget/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/2-bargain-stocks-for-investors-on-a-budget/,fool.com,200.0,,"$8,000.
That's what the typical American has in the bank, according to the Federal Reserve. Most people need to use the money in their bank accounts to cover everyday expenses. However, some people, particularly those with more than $8,000 in the bank, may be able to invest a portion of their savings as a way to grow their money.
Let's examine two stocks that investors on a budget may want to consider.
AT&T
First, there's AT&T (T -0.27%).
The telecommunications giant fits the bill as a bargain stock for several reasons. Let's start with the most obvious: Its stock recently cost less than $30 -- meaning most investors can afford to own a decent number of AT&T shares.
However, it's not just AT&T's low stock price that makes it appealing for investors looking for a bargain. There's also the fact that AT&T's valuation is affordable. AT&T's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares its stock price to its earnings per share, is around 17x.
In comparison, the S&P 500 market index has a P/E ratio of about 30x. Moreover, many high-flying tech stocks sport P/E ratios north of 100x. Media-streaming veteran Spotify, for example, has a P/E ratio of 164x, as of this writing.
Finally, AT&T is a bargain buy for another reason: Its business model is solid, if not all that exciting. The company has refocused its efforts on delivering wireless and fiber service. It divested its media assets, spun off its WarnerMedia holdings, and sold its stake in DirecTV.
As a result, the company is better positioned to pay down debt -- it still has more than $141 billion in net debt on its balance sheet -- and return value to shareholders through dividend payments. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.2775, which works out to an annual dividend amount of $1.11 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 3.75%.
AT&T offers a solid value, making it a name that investors on a budget should consider.
Alphabet
Next, there's Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 2.13%).
At first blush, Alphabet might seem like a strange stock for bargain-seeking investors to consider. After all, shares of Alphabet recently were trading at around $249 each.
However, bargains aren't only found in low-priced stocks. Indeed, with the widespread availability of fractional share trading, the market price of a stock no longer matters the way it did in the past.
What makes Alphabet a stock for bargain-seeking investors is its wonderful mix of business segments. Alphabet is no one-trick pony.
Let's start with its most profitable and best-known operation: Google Search. The company's search business is its crown jewel. It generates more than $200 billion in annual revenue. What's more, this online behemoth is still growing like a weed. Search revenue increased 12% year over year in the recent second-quarter report, despite concerns that ChatGPT and other AI-powered chatbots would eat away at Google's search engine dominance.
In addition to its powerful search segment, Alphabet has other powerful divisions. Its Google Cloud segment, the third-largest player in the red-hot field of cloud services, racked up $13.6 billion in revenue last quarter (the three months ended June 30, 2025). That's a year-over-year growth rate of 32%. The company also recorded more than $17 billion in quarterly ad revenue from its YouTube division and its Google network (Gmail, etc.).
All in all, Alphabet's mix of business segments and solid growth make it a stock that investors on a budget should strongly consider."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-19T10:25:00,The Rise of Amazon Ads: Who the Winners and Losers Are,Amazon's growing ad business and its partnership with Netflix could reshape connected TV advertising.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3bc505b6a646206e55e44a59fe985ed35f9029e94864c42771760d71d8c8c38d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/the-rise-of-amazon-ads-who-the-winners-and-losers/,fool.com,200.0,,"Amazon (AMZN -0.48%) has quietly built a digital advertising business that's now too big to ignore. In 2024, Amazon Ads generated more than $50 billion in revenue, making it one of the fastest-growing segments of the company.
The company's recent partnership with Netflix only underlines Amazon's growing role in the space. By selling Netflix's advertising inventory through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), Amazon has solidified its position as a must-use platform for marketers. For investors, the question is no longer whether Amazon Ads is a real contender, but which players will win and which ones will lose as its influence expands.
Winners: Amazon, premium streamers, and advertisers
The most obvious winner here is Amazon itself. The company has a combination of advantages in the digital ad space that most of its rivals can only dream of: authenticated user data, purchase intent signals, and premium inventory across retail, video, and streaming. By combining these assets inside its demand-side platform, Amazon makes it easy for advertisers to reach high-value audiences with measurable outcomes.
The Netflix deal adds even more muscle. Streaming has become the new frontier of advertising, and Netflix is the crown jewel of connected TV inventory. By bringing Netflix ads into its DSP, Amazon gives marketers access to premium content and simplifies the buying process. For advertisers, that's efficient and measurable. For Amazon, it's a flywheel: more data, more inventory, and more ad dollars staying inside its ecosystem.
Advertisers also come out ahead -- at least in the short term. With Amazon, they get better targeting and closed-loop attribution, tying impressions directly to purchases. The flip side is concentration risk: The more marketing budgets shift into Amazon, the less leverage advertisers may have down the road, echoing what's already happened with Alphabet and Meta.
Premium streamers like Netflix (and Roku) also benefit. They gain access to Amazon's massive advertiser base and infrastructure, and they don't have to build their own sales machines from scratch. This ensures they can compete with traditional broadcasters and newer entrants alike.
Losers: Independent adtech companies, smaller publishers, and other ""walled gardens""
The rise of Amazon Ads is not good news for everyone. Independent demand-side platforms, especially The Trade Desk, could face more competitive pressure. For years, The Trade Desk positioned itself as the independent alternative to Google and Meta, offering neutrality, transparency, and cross-channel reach. However, if advertisers can purchase premium streaming inventory directly through Amazon's DSP, The Trade Desk's leverage could slowly diminish.
That said, neutrality still matters. Some advertisers may resist relying too heavily on Amazon, preferring to use independent platforms that can span connected TV, retail media, and the broader open web. The Trade Desk's relationships with Disney, Roku, and other publishers give it some weight, but it's too early to say whether such relationships will be enough to preserve the company's moat.
Smaller publishers also risk losing ground. If ad dollars consolidate into Amazon, Netflix, and other large platforms, independent websites could struggle to attract marketing spending. AI-driven search further complicates this picture, reducing traffic to traditional publishers and shrinking the open web ad supply.
Even Alphabet and Meta will feel the heat. While they still dominate digital advertising, Amazon is steadily taking more share in two critical areas: retail media and streaming video. Meta's performance ads look less differentiated when brands can advertise right at the point of purchase on Amazon. Alphabet faces pressure as product searches increasingly begin on Amazon rather than Google, while its YouTube unit must contend with Netflix and other streaming platforms selling ads through Amazon's DSP.
The bigger and longer-term picture
Amazon isn't just another player in digital advertising -- it's building a vertically integrated ecosystem. From retail data to Prime Video and now Netflix, Amazon controls both the data advertisers crave and a large slice of the available ad inventory. This integration makes it one of the most powerful ad businesses in the world.
For the industry, the trend is clear: Scale and data are driving consolidation. Advertisers increasingly want major partners that can deliver both reach and measurable results. Amazon checks both boxes, and that creates structural challenges not only for independents like The Trade Desk but also for giants like Alphabet and Meta.
What does it mean for investors?
Amazon Ads is a clear long-term winner. The Netflix deal strengthens Amazon's position in connected TV, expands its already rich inventory pool, and makes its DSP more indispensable to advertisers.
For rivals like The Trade Desk, the challenge is differentiation. Its neutrality, transparency, and ability to bridge multiple channels remain valuable, but the fight for premium streaming inventory is heating up.
In other words, Amazon isn't just competing in advertising anymore. It's setting the rules of the game. It's a great time to be bullish about Amazon stock (and to an extent, major publishers like Netflix or Roku), but less so on independent platforms like The Trade Desk."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-19T10:00:00,4 Top Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in 2025,The quantum computing arms race is heating up.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=902b4c319185f1fa3895383a2f3e24aea74fc3097691f794f8f7db288856b4bc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/4-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/4-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/4-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,fool.com,200.0,,"Quantum computing is slated to become the next big tech investment trend following artificial intelligence (AI). We're still in the early innings of this exciting technology, but most companies agree that 2030 will be a turning point in this space. However, waiting until 2030 to start investing in this field after the winners are established is a mistake. Many of these companies will likely have dramatically increased in value by then, causing investors to lose out on massive returns.
By investing today, it's possible to pick some of the winners in this space before they've become too large to provide substantial returns. I've identified four options that appear to be excellent investments in quantum computing, ranging from startups to established big tech players. By staying balanced in this opportunity, investors can capitalize on the trend while ensuring positive returns.
Pure plays: IonQ and D-Wave Quantum
The stocks that most investors consider in reference to the quantum computing arms race are pure-play investments, such as IonQ (IONQ -6.04%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 3.09%). These companies are startups that have no other goal besides developing commercially viable quantum computing technologies, and their upside could be immense if they achieve their goals.
IonQ and D-Wave only have market caps of $16.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. This makes them relatively small companies in general, although they could grow to be monsters if their technology becomes widespread.
The primary reason I prefer these two over many of the other quantum computing pure plays is their approach to quantum computing. The most popular quantum computing technique is superconducting, which involves cooling a particle to near absolute zero to utilize its quantum mechanics to perform calculations. This is an incredibly cost-intensive process, and may be cost-prohibitive in deploying quantum computing at scale, especially in the early years.
IonQ doesn't use this approach; its quantum computing technology is known as trapped ion. This provides several key advantages, namely cost (because it doesn't require cooling a particle to absolute zero, it can be done at room temperature) and accuracy. IonQ holds world records in quantum computing accuracy and with the largest concern surrounding quantum computing being how accurate it is, I think IonQ's technology could be a popular pick.
D-Wave isn't taking the same approach as many companies. Instead of creating a general-purpose quantum computer, it's developing a quantum annealing platform. This approach cannot be applied to every quantum computing application, but it excels at optimization problems, which can be solved by finding the lowest energy state in a system. D-Wave's technology will be useful in determining logistics networks and statistical models, which represent a large chunk of quantum computing use cases. D-Wave doesn't have to capture the entire market; it just needs to secure enough business to make it viable.
Both of these two stocks are high-risk, high-reward investments, and balancing them out with more established players is a smart idea.
Legacy tech companies: Microsoft and Alphabet
Both Microsoft (MSFT -0.45%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 2.13%) are developing quantum computing technologies in-house for their cloud computing divisions. Currently, Alphabet and Microsoft are paying a substantial premium to their current primary computing hardware supplier, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). If they can develop a viable quantum computing option for these platforms in-house and not have to purchase them from a third party like IonQ or D-Wave, they will save a ton of money and become more profitable.
This makes quantum computing a highly lucrative field to invest in, and both companies have already announced significant breakthroughs in the realm of quantum computing. Furthermore, these two companies have nearly unlimited resources to deploy compared to IonQ and D-Wave, and it may become too cost-intensive for them to compete against Microsoft and Alphabet in the long run.
However, David versus Goliath stories exist for a reason, and IonQ and D-Wave may ultimately prevail against their larger competitors, but there's no way to know that right now.
By purchasing all four of these stocks, investors are taking a balanced approach to the quantum computing investment trend. This gives them the upside of pure plays like IonQ and D-Wave, while also investing in established players like Microsoft and Alphabet, which continue to benefit from the ongoing AI arms race. I believe this cohort has a great chance to outperform the market, and if IonQ or D-Wave achieves significant success, this group could crush the broader market."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-19T09:55:00,3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all riding the AI wave.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=492af7f12bffcc8a8f2842ef3667be3e5e9a6b0585ed0ff6f93d21b1d94cad2e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-right-now/,fool.com,200.0,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is in full swing, and there are no signs of it letting up. With the technology looking to be a game-changer that could reshape the world we are living in, it is a place you want to be invested.
Let's look at three top AI stocks to buy right now.
1. Nvidia
No company has captured the AI infrastructure wave like Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%). Its graphics processing units (GPUs) went from powering video games to becoming the must-have hardware for training AI models, and it hasn't let go of that lead.
The company built a deep moat with CUDA, as most code for optimizing GPUs was written using its proprietary software platform. Switching off CUDA would mean rewriting code and retraining engineers, which is why Nvidia controls over 90% of the AI GPU market.
Nvidia also smartly moved early into networking. Its NVLink technology lets its GPUs work together as a single system, which is critical for running AI workloads. Its acquisition of Mellanox, meanwhile, gave Nvidia a major presence in data center networking. Last quarter, its networking revenue nearly doubled to $7.3 billion.
Nvidia sees the AI infrastructure market growing to be between $3 trillion to $4 trillion in the next several years from around $600 billion today. With AI infrastructure spending still booming, Nvidia looks well-positioned to continue to be one of AI's biggest winners.
2. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.13%) (GOOG 1.81%) has quickly turned what was seen as a threat into a growth driver. A year ago, many investors thought AI would cannibalize Google Search, but search revenue growth has actually picked up. Features like AI Overviews, Lens, and Circle to Search are driving more queries, and many of those have commercial intent, which feed into Alphabet's massive ad network. The recent federal court decision letting Alphabet keep not only Android and Chrome, but also the key parts of its Apple search deal intact, was another big win, preserving its distribution advantage.
AI is also giving Alphabet's cloud computing business a boost. Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% last quarter and profits more than doubled, with demand for AI infrastructure leading the way. Alphabet is one of the few players with a fully integrated AI stack. It not only owns the infrastructure, but it also has one of the top AI models in Gemini and its own custom AI chips. The company's impending acquisition of fast-growing cloud computing security company Wiz only further fortifies its cloud offering.
In addition to search and cloud computing, Alphabet has other bets that could pay off in the future. At the top of this list is its Waymo robotaxi business, which is expanding quickly around the country. The company needs to lower the costs of its vehicles and gain scale, but this is another big potential long-term growth driver. The company is also investing in quantum computing, having made strong progress in reducing error rates with its Willow chip. Quantum computing is years away from being commercialized, but it could be another big opportunity.
Between its strong, growing core business and the potential of its emerging bets, Alphabet is a stock to own for the long haul.
3. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.45%) moved quickly to make AI a core part of its strategy, starting with its big investment in OpenAI. That deal gave it early access to OpenAI's most advanced large language models (LLMs) and allowed it to roll out AI assistant copilots across its productivity suite. Those copilots are now gaining traction with enterprise customers.
The even bigger driver has been with its cloud business, as customers have flocked to Azure to gain access to OpenAI's models. This growth was still going strong last quarter, with Azure revenue jumping 39%. Revenue could have been even higher if not for capacity constraints. Microsoft is ramping up capital spending to add GPUs and servers directly tied to AI workloads, which should support continued growth.
Microsoft and OpenAI recently announced that they have come to an agreement to change their relationship to allow OpenAI to restructure into a for-profit company. While terms were not disclosed, it should allow Microsoft to gain preferred access to OpenAI's technology and share in its revenue growth.
Microsoft was firing on all cylinders last quarter, with strong growth across its segments, driven by AI. Given its leadership in workforce productivity tools and cloud computing, the stock looks like it will be a long-term AI winner."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-19T08:07:00,"Did Nvidia Just Help Amazon, Microsoft, and Google at CoreWeave's Expense?",Nvidia's decisions can have huge ripple effects through the AI world. But probably not this time.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c1446191a5f0ef1cd75cd1bb048419e4260edc2564ba00049c5bf329249d154e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,fool.com,200.0,,"Nvidia (NVDA -0.49%) enjoys great relationships with some of the biggest tech companies on the planet. Its customer base includes the three largest cloud service providers: Amazon (AMZN -0.48%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.45%), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 1.81%) (GOOGL 2.13%).
However, Nvidia's reach isn't limited to the biggest of the big. It also works closely with many rising stars. CoreWeave (CRWV 3.80%) is arguably the most prominent example, especially considering that Nvidia has a multibillion-dollar stake in the AI-focused hyperscaler.
It stands to reason that Nvidia wants all these partners to succeed. But did the GPU giant just help Amazon, Microsoft, and Google at CoreWeave's expense?
Nvidia's retreat
Nvidia launched DGX Cloud in 2023. The company billed the new platform as a way for enterprises to get immediate access to Nvidia's AI supercomputers so they could train generative AI and other advanced AI models.
But Nvidia appears to be retreating from this market. The Information, a website that focuses on technology industry news, recently reported that Nvidia is primarily using DGX Cloud for internal use now instead of marketing the platform to customers.
Is there other evidence that supports the view that Nvidia is shifting its strategy? Maybe. In the past, Nvidia highlighted its DGX Cloud services when discussing cloud spending commitments in its quarterly 10-Q filings. In the company's update for the second quarter of 2025, though, DGX Cloud wasn't mentioned in this context.
Instead of marketing the DGX Cloud platform to customers, Nvidia appears to be focusing now on its Lepton GPU rental marketplace. CEO Jensen Huang explained in the May 2025 announcement of Lepton that the new service ""connects our network of global GPU cloud providers with AI developers.""
Helping the ""big three,"" hurting CoreWeave?
Some industry observers saw DGX Cloud as a move for Nvidia to compete against the major cloud service providers. But Nvidia rented GPUs from CoreWeave to use with DGX Cloud. Could the company's reported move to back away from marketing DGX Cloud help Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud while hurting CoreWeave? The short answer is ""no.""
For one thing, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud host DGX Cloud. Although AWS didn't, there's no solid proof that Nvidia's cloud platform hurt its business.
A retreat from DGX Cloud wouldn't hurt CoreWeave, either. CoreWeave recently disclosed that Nvidia will purchase $6.3 billion of its unused cloud computing capacity through April 13, 2032.
Perhaps most importantly, though, Nvidia might not be retreating from DGX Cloud as reported by The Information after all. According to Data Center Dynamics, Alexis Bjorlin, who is Nvidia's vice president and general manager for DGX Cloud, said, ""DGX Cloud is fully utilized and oversubscribed, and we are expanding its scale.""
Winners all around
Whatever Nvidia's strategy with DGX Cloud is, I don't think CoreWeave has anything to worry about. My view is that all of these stocks -- Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and CoreWeave -- are poised to be big winners over the long run.
The AI boom doesn't appear to be slowing down. That's great news for Nvidia because more of its GPUs will be needed. It's great news for Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and CoreWeave because their cloud platforms will continue to enjoy tremendous demand.
It's possible that the momentum could even accelerate. I think Nvidia's technological advances will play a key role, if so. For example, the company plans to launch Rubin CPX, a new class of GPUs built for massive-context inference, in late 2026. This new technology could pave the way for an explosion in the use of AI in software development and long-form video creation.
As the smallest of the group, CoreWeave might have the most room to run. However, I expect all five of these top AI stocks will deliver tremendous gains over the next 10 years and beyond."

Data from the US Department of Agriculture show China hadn’t booked a single cargo as of Sept. 11, almost two weeks into the new marketing season — the first time in records going back to 1999. Last year, the US made up a fifth of China’s soybean imports, worth more than $12 billion, and accounting for over half of total US soy export value.
Beijing, with healthy stockpiles in hand, is signaling it has the patience and capacity to wait — and that it’s willing to use commodities as a bargaining chip in broader trade talks. President Xi Jinping is set to speak with Trump on Friday, as the two countries spar over restrictions on semiconductors and rare earths. In the run-up, China has ratcheted up pressure by announcing that a preliminary probe found Nvidia Corp. in violation of anti-monopoly laws.
“China’s approach on soybeans is similar to its approach on rare earths, in that it reflects years of careful game-planning since the last trade war,” said Even Pay, an agriculture analyst at Trivium China, a policy consultancy in Beijing.
“Buyers are responding not just to the high tariffs that remain on US beans, but also to the extremely high degree of uncertainty regarding the short term outlook for those tariffs, and the very clear political signals that Beijing does not want purchasing to happen without officials giving the go-ahead,” she said.
That strategy appears to be paying off. US farmers, flush with bumper harvests, are coping with prices near the lowest levels in years. The soy growers, who constitute a key voting bloc for Trump, have warned of a “trade and financial precipice,” urging the administration to cut a deal with China that removes tariffs. US soybeans going into China currently face duties of more than 20%.
Across the Pacific, the mood is calmer. Chinese crushers, pig farmers and feed producers, bruised by the first trade war, have secured months of supply from Brazil. Some have doubled their inventories, while the state’s vast reserves provide an additional buffer. Soybeans are primarily crushed in China to produce soymeal for its massive pig feed industry and soyoil for cooking."

“The promise of glasses is to preserve this sense of presence that you have with other people,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the Meta Connect 2025 keynote. “I think that we’ve lost it a little bit with phones, and we have the opportunity to get it back with glasses.”
In reality, Meta wants its own hardware to eat into the marketshare of Apple and Google so that it doesn’t have to keep siphoning profits to them via app stores. But nevertheless, this is the angle Meta is taking to sell its most sophisticated smart glasses yet, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which the company hopes could one day eclipse the market share of smartphones.
Meta’s Reality Labs division burns cash at an alarming rate, which has concerned investors over the years. But Wednesday’s event finally showed us a glimpse of what the division’s $70 billion in losses since 2020 have gone toward.
Meta has had its fair share of flops, like the entire promise of its social metaverse. (Remember when they announced that metaverse avatars would finally get legs?) But with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta has created a remarkable piece of technology, unlike any other consumer-facing product on the market — we have yet to test it ourselves, so we can’t quite say just how groundbreaking this really is, but it looks promising.
Like Meta’s existing smart glasses, which have sold millions of pairs, the new model has cameras, speakers, microphones, and an on-board AI assistant. The display on the glasses, which is offset so as not to obstruct one’s sightline, can display Meta apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, as well as directions and live translations.
What most sets the Meta Ray-Ban Display apart is the Meta Neural Band, a wristband that uses surface electromyography (sEMG) to pick up on signals sent between your brain and your hand when performing a gesture.
Meta’s keynote didn’t get into the specifics of how Zuckerberg was writing these texts, but according to Reality Labs’ research on sEMG, users can write out messages like this by holding their fingers together as if they were gripping a pen and “writing” out the text.
While some live AI demos at the keynote failed — Zuckerberg blamed the Wi-Fi — we at least got to see the wristband in action, which is more novel. Zuckerberg quickly wrote out text messages, then sent them on his Ray-Bans.
“I’m up to about 30 words a minute on this,” Zuckerberg said onstage at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters. “You can get pretty fast.”"

""The United States, as we know, has to become a chip manufacturer,"" Cohn, who served as director of the National Economic Council during President Trump's first term, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. ""We cannot be dependent on the rest of the world for chips.""
His remarks come after Nvidia (NVDA) said it would take a $5 billion stake in Intel (INTC) this week. As part of the investment, the two tech giants will co-develop chips for PCs and data centers. The tie-up also makes Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, potentially giving Intel the lift it needs as it falls behind in the global chip race.
Currently, Intel is America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer. In late August, the federal government agreed to invest $8.9 billion in the company in exchange for a 9.9% stake.
Cohn, now IBM (IBM) vice chairman, described the Nvidia-Intel deal as having ""some good,"" noting that it highlights a larger push to bolster domestic chip production.
He pointed to lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We understood that without chips being imported to the United States, our economy, our manufacturing economy [would] shut down,"" he said.
He added that the federal government encouraging domestic chip manufacturing is a ""good thing,"" referencing the CHIPS Act, which was signed in 2022 during the Biden administration.
Still, Cohn stressed the government's role isn't to pick winners and losers, but to protect national security and the economy. ""To be able to defend ourselves, to be able to build military equipment, we need to be in the chip manufacturing business here,"" he said.
Even so, the comments come amid a $42 billion US-UK tech agreement dubbed the ""Tech Prosperity Deal,"" a major catalyst for AI chip demand in the UK. Big Tech players like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Google (GOOG), and OpenAI (OPAI) are part of the investment.
More broadly, Cohn highlighted the long-term infrastructure investments required for AI, particularly new data centers, which he estimates will come online in three to five years.
He is bullish on AI's potential, expecting it to expand beyond the software used today. He cited AI agents as an example of tools that currently ""solve a specific AI problem.""

The tech giant also announced that it’s bringing agentic capabilities to Chrome in the future, adding its AI Mode search feature to the address bar, launching new Gemini features, using AI to combat AI-generated scams, rolling out automatic password resets, and more.
U.S. users who have their language set to English can now ask Gemini to clarify complex information on any web page they’re reading using the Gemini icon in the top-right corner of their Chrome window. For example, you could open up a page that features a banana bread recipe and ask Gemini to make the recipe gluten free.
Gemini can now work across multiple tabs, allowing users to quickly compare and summarize information across multiple websites. For example, you could be planning your flight, hotel, and vacation in multiple tabs and work with Gemini to organize your trip. Or, you might be shopping for a new mattress and want to compare all of the different models you’re looking at in multiple tabs.
Gemini will soon be able to retrieve web pages you’ve previously visited, making it easier to return to past browsing sessions without sifting through your browser history. That means you will be able to ask something like “On which site did I see the walnut desk last week?” or “What was that blog I read on back-to-school shopping?”
Additionally, Google is launching a deeper integration between Gemini in Chrome and other Google apps, like Calendar, YouTube, and Maps. Google says this will allow users to do things like schedule meetings, see location details, and more without having to leave the page they’re on. For example, if you’re trying to find a specific spot in a YouTube video, you can ask Gemini to take you there.
Google notes that the AI assistant will be able to complete tedious tasks, like booking a haircut or ordering weekly groceries. Gemini will navigate to the site, add things to your cart, and let you take the final action by checking out with your payment option.
Google says the new agentic capabilities will be available in Chrome in the coming months. It’s worth noting that OpenAI launched Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously, earlier this year.
Google is also bringing AI Mode, its advanced search feature, directly into the Chrome address bar. With AI Mode, users can ask complex questions with follow-ups to dig deeper into topics. For example, instead of searching for “best mattress,” you could type out “I’m a side sleeper with occasional lower back pain. Make me a table comparing the different mattress types” directly in the address bar. From there, you could ask follow-up questions and keep your search going with queries like, “How long do memory foam mattresses typically last?”"

The latest trend in earnings estimate revisions may not translate into further price increase in the near term.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1f7ae84ee3def34bb7fdaef6ba67c9a93394bd60adb77319e58ffd85e9b4cb7e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-lyft-surges-13-1-162200580.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-lyft-surges-13-1-162200580.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-lyft-surges-13-1-162200580.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"Lyft (LYFT) shares soared 13.1% in the last trading session to close at $22.84. The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 29.7% gain over the past four weeks.
The upside can be attributed to Lyft’s recently announced partnership with Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo, aimed at launching Waymo’s fully autonomous ride-hailing service to Nashville in 2026.
This ride-hailing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.30 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.5%. Revenues are expected to be $1.72 billion, up 12.6% from the year-ago quarter.
While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For Lyft, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on LYFT going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.

China has decided to call off its antitrust investigation into Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL, Financials) Google, while at the same time opening a new front against Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financials), according to the Financial Times.
The move is being read as a calculated shift. By dropping the Google case, Beijing signals some flexibility in its dealings with Washington. But by targeting Nvidia instead, it keeps pressure on one of the most important U.S. tech firms as trade talks grind on.
China's market regulator had launched its probe into Google back in February, accusing the company of potential monopoly violations. That case is now over, though sources said Google has not yet been formally notified. The company declined to comment.
Nvidia, meanwhile, faces fresh allegations of violating China's antitrust laws after a preliminary review of its business practices. The timing comes as the U.S. and China continue to spar over tariffs, technology access and the fate of TikTok. President Donald Trump cut tariffs from initial steep levels to 30%, while Beijing responded with its own 10% tariffs and scrutiny of American tech giants.
For investors, the takeaway is that U.S. companies remain caught in the crossfire. Google gets a reprieve, but Nvidia could find itself at the center of the next stage in the trade dispute."

Shares of online community and discussion platform Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) jumped 5.5% in the morning session after bullish analyst price target hikes and growing optimism over its AI data licensing strategy improved market sentiment.
JMP Securities reiterated its Market Outperform rating and lifted its price target on the stock to $300 from $225. Similarly, Piper Sandler maintained an ""Overweight"" rating and raised its price target to $290 from $210. The positive sentiment stemmed from reports that Reddit was in discussions with partners like Google and OpenAI. The company looked to shift away from flat-fee content licensing deals, which currently brought in about $60 million annually from Google.
Instead, Reddit aimed for a new structure where it would get paid based on how much its content is used to train artificial intelligence models. This potential for a new, more lucrative revenue stream excited investors. A broader market rally, fueled by a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, also provided a supportive backdrop for tech stocks.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $279.33, up 4.8% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Reddit’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 63 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 1.3% on the news that Needham raised its price target on the stock to $300 from $215, while maintaining a Buy rating.
The research firm cited generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and rising labor productivity as key reasons for its increased confidence and revised estimates for fiscal years 2025 and 2026. This positive analyst action follows a period of strong business performance for the social media platform, which saw advertising revenue grow 84% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by a 50% increase in active advertisers. Other firms have also recently expressed bullish sentiment, with Jefferies raising its price target to $300 and Deutsche Bank increasing its target to $205, both maintaining Buy ratings.
Reddit is up 68.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $279.33 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Reddit’s shares at the IPO in March 2024 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,538.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

Shares of social network Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) jumped 3.8% in the morning session after an analyst note from JMP Securities highlighted positive feedback from major marketers about the platform's performance.
JMP Securities maintained its Market Perform rating on the company, citing strong advertiser sentiment. For example, a performance marketing manager from Nike told the firm that Snap delivered the most incremental reach to younger consumers after Meta and Google. The manager also noted they did not hold Snap to the same return on ad spend requirements as other platforms due to this unique reach.
Furthermore, feedback from Spotify indicated that Sponsored Snaps were 'highly performant,' a success the music streamer attributed mainly to the 'very low' cost-per-thousand impressions (CPMs) for these ad units. This positive commentary followed the company's recent announcement of its new fifth-generation Spectacles and Snap OS 2.0.

The news created positive buzz and signaled progress toward the launch of Snap's first consumer smart glasses, which are expected next year. The Spectacles device was limited to developers.

For Alphabet, analysts boosted their target to $285 from $220, citing a recent U.S. antitrust ruling and stronger advertising trends.
“Google will likely be required to share some data with competitors and outright competitive exclusions disallowed,” Piper Sandler said, but crucially, the ruling avoided major remedies such as divestitures of Chrome or Android.
The firm argued that the outcome removes a long-standing overhang and “warrants a multiple re-rating.”
Ad spending is also said to look encouraging. Piper Sandler’s Ad Buyer data points to “a further acceleration into 3Q25E,” with YouTube spend expected in the low double digits and Search in the mid-single digits.
The bank also noted that Google has a more than 75% chance of exiting 2025 with the top large language model in Gemini, which it believes “is enough to drive multiple expansion.”
On Reddit, Piper Sandler lifted its price target to $290 from $210 after checks showed stronger advertising performance and promising product momentum.
Ad Buyer data revisions have been “most positive for RDDT compared to the group,” with August spend up 5.7%. Monthly active users on Ads Manager rose 3% in August, driven by higher Conversation engagement.
The firm also highlighted the potential upside from data licensing, particularly in light of a recent Anthropic lawsuit that set a precedent for AI companies paying content providers.
Piper Sandler estimates Reddit could generate well above the $150 million in licensing revenue currently expected by the Street.

In January 2021, Parler was wiped out overnight accused of “inciting violence” and tied to January 6th. The punishment was catastrophic: more than 20 million voices silenced, with Amazon Web Services pointing to a mere 98 flagged posts as justification.
Fast forward to 2025: Bluesky, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Meta, and Discord are flooded with thousands of posts celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk and inciting violence against conservatives. Yet none of these platforms face bans, removals, or even warnings. “This is the very definition of a diabolical double standard,” said Elise Pierotti, Co-Founder and Sr. VP of Business Development at Parler.
Even industry leaders are calling out hypocrisy. On September 14, 2025, Elon Musk endorsed an X post stating that Parler was removed from Apple’s App Store for “0.1% of the extremist vitriol now rampant on Bluesky and Reddit,” replying simply: “True.” U.S. Senator Mike Lee has also demanded answers: “What does Apple’s targeting of Parler—but not Bluesky or Reddit—reveal about its political bias and monopolistic control over app store markets?”
Parler asks the question Big Tech refuses to answer:
“Why was Parler obliterated without due process over 98 posts, while platforms hosting thousands of violent threats remain untouched?”
Our Stance on Speech
Parler has always stood unapologetically for free expression. We reject the censorship of so-called “hate speech,” a subjective label that is selectively enforced. At the same time, we recognize clear constitutional boundaries: direct calls for violence and unlawful threats are not protected speech—and Parler enforces against them. Our standard is simple: open discourse, yes. Incitement to violence, no.
The Hidden Hand of Government Influence
Recent reports revealed that USAID funded Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, which produced reports later weaponized to justify Parler’s deplatforming. This raises serious questions: Why are taxpayer dollars being used to silence lawful speech in America?
Parler Returns Stronger
Despite every effort to erase us, Parler has returned bigger, stronger, and untouchable. Today, Parler operates on decentralized hosting, a rewards system, and integrations with more than 20 platforms —ensuring no single gatekeeper will ever silence us again. “Against every attempt to destroy us, we are still here,” Pierotti said. “Our ecosystem is unshakable, and our voice is louder than ever.”"

In a move that looks more symbolic than strategic, Beijing has shelved its antitrust probe into Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android platformjust days before President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping are expected to speak. First announced in February, the case against Alphabet's mobile OS came right after the US imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese goods. Now, with no real commercial teethgiven Google's limited presence in Chinathe decision could be read as a goodwill signal meant to ease tensions, especially as trade negotiations remain delicately poised.
But the real heat is elsewhere. China is now zeroing in on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), just as the AI chipmaker becomes the nerve center of Washington's tech sanctions. According to reports, China's cyberspace regulator has directed firms like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) to suspend orders for Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D workstation chips, citing concerns the hardware could be repurposed for artificial intelligence. That crackdown follows Beijing's ruling that Nvidia violated antitrust rules with its $7 billion Mellanox acquisition back in 2020an acquisition already under scrutiny in the US and Europe, but now becoming a point of leverage in Beijing's own semiconductor playbook.
Adding to the pressure, China has also launched an anti-dumping investigation into certain US semiconductors, directly impacting companies like Texas Instruments. While letting Google off the hook may offer a low-cost diplomatic chip, the escalated action against Nvidia suggests Beijing is playing a different gameone focused on reshaping the AI hardware landscape. With chip exports already constrained under US rules, China's latest moves look less like retaliation and more like repositioning. The message? Symbolic concessions may be on offer, but critical tech supply chains are now the main theater."

Well, we kick off with another tech firm impacted by US-China trade talks.
This time in a positive way. China is ending an anti-trust probe into Google.
This all comes as trade talks between Beijing and Washington are ramping up with TikTok and Nvidia's business in China getting caught in the cross hairs.
Google's parent Alphabet shares are up in pre-market.
The investigation into Google started back in February and centered on the dominance of Google's Android operating system, which most Chinese phone makers use.
China's move suggests that Beijing is focusing its regulatory firepower on Nvidia as part of its leverage in talks with the US.
Okay, next up, Donald Trump's state visit to the UK continues.
Some titans of US industry accompanied the president at last night's dinner, Apple's Tim Cook, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Open AI's Sam Altman among those in attendance.
Well, after all the pomp and pageantry and some big investment announcements, it's time to get down to more trade talks.
The president is meeting PM Kier Starmer. High up on the agenda will be the finalization of the UK US trade deal.
There's also the contentious issue of 25% tariffs on British steel and aluminium.
The UK wants that number down to zero.
And remember, this state visit has yielded $204 billion of inward investment into the UK.
Finally, time to talk about the Fed.
No surprise that rates were cut yesterday, the first time this year.
It was a unified Fed board in the main, all voted for a 25 basis point cut, except for President Trump's pick, Stephen Myron.
He voted for a jumbo 50 basis point cut.
The much watched quarterly dot plot showed that policy makers are predicting another two cuts this year."

The question isn’t whether Google made money for investors (it absolutely did), but whether realistic investment amounts could have generated retirement-level wealth.
The Real Numbers
Let’s work with actual figures. In late 2015, Google stock (GOOGL) closed around $37 (split-adjusted). As of late 2025, Alphabet trades around $251. That’s roughly 6.7x growth over the decade.
Here’s what different investment amounts from 2015 would be worth today:
| Initial Investment | Today’s Value (≈6.7x) |
| $1,000 | $6,700 |
| $5,000 | $33,500 |
| $10,000 | $67,000 |

What It Takes To Retire
The retirement question depends entirely on your lifestyle, as well as your other income sources. Financial advisors typically suggest you need 25 times your annual expenses to retire safely using the 4% withdrawal rule.
If you need $40,000 annually in retirement, you’d need about $1,000,000 saved. To reach that from Google stock alone, you would have needed to invest roughly $150,000 in 2015. If you need $60,000 annually, you’d need about $1,500,000 saved, requiring about $225,000 invested in Google in 2015.
The Reality Check
Most people don’t have $100,000+ sitting around to invest in a single stock.
Even if someone had invested their entire $5,000 portfolio in Google stock, they’d have about $33,500 today. That’s nowhere near retirement money for most people.
Where Google Investors Stand Today
A more realistic scenario involves someone who bought smaller amounts of Google stock as part of a diversified portfolio. Someone who invested $2,000 in Google in 2015 would have about $13,400 today. It’s a nice gain, but not life-changing money.
These investors likely benefited more from Google’s consistent growth than from any single windfall. The stock provided steady returns over the decade rather than explosive overnight wealth.
What About Dividend Income?
Google/Alphabet doesn’t pay dividends, choosing instead to reinvest profits into growth. That means the only way to access your gains is by selling shares; you can’t live off dividend income from Google stock."

The agreement, unveiled Wednesday, will see PayPal integrate its Branded Checkout and Enterprise Payments across Google products, including Ads, Play, and Cloud.
In return, PayPal will use Google’s AI capabilities to improve payment services and build new commerce experiences.
Morgan Stanley welcomed the move, writing: “We’ve consistently said we like partnerships that expand and enhance capabilities while scaling product reach with limited incremental investment.”
The bank noted PayPal is wisely leveraging Google’s AI to reduce shopping friction without the heavy costs of building tools from scratch.
Still, analysts cautioned against overestimating the impact. “Integration as a payment provider might help investors build more conviction in medium-term targets, but we think the partnership is unlikely to meaningfully move the needle near-term,” Morgan Stanley wrote.
The firm estimates PayPal’s share of Google’s processing will grow slowly, with economics “likely to be lower than average (~15 bp gross profit take rate for Braintree overall).”
PayPal is targeting Branded Checkout growth of 8–10% by 2027, up from mid-single digits today, which management expects to support high single-digit gross profit growth. But Morgan Stanley said it does not expect the Google tie-up to accelerate results this year.
On the tech side, Morgan Stanley said PayPal’s partnership with Google Cloud to modernize its infrastructure is “a step in the right direction,” though it may also reveal that its technology limitations “are worse than feared.”
Taking a more positive view of the partnership, analysts at Baird said they believe the deal ""should enhance agentic commerce opportunities for both companies, integrate PayPal Checkout and processing across Google services, and expand PayPal’s use of Google Cloud.""
""We expect the partnership to provide an incremental growth opportunity for PayPal in addition to accessing advanced AI technology from Google that PayPal would unlikely develop on its own,"" Baird added.

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-18T11:30:00,Alphabet Is Becoming the Walt Disney of Big Tech. Here's What It Means for Investors,"Alphabet is embracing generative AI, even if it means Google Search may no longer be as dominant as it once was.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8f3d68c3f99259075f33fa32f3192dc8bf0d8dc2072474d2f6c1ae274aac354d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/alphabet-walt-disney-big-tech-buy-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/alphabet-walt-disney-big-tech-buy-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/alphabet-walt-disney-big-tech-buy-stocks/,fool.com,200.0,,"Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.13%) has been one of the most fascinating megacap growth stocks this year. In June, it was badly underperforming the S&P 500 and many of its peers. But the stock has rallied nearly 50% since that point, and is up over 18% in the last month -- closing in on $3 trillion in market cap.
Alphabet's rally showcases the power of changes in investor sentiment. The investment thesis didn't change; rather, the perception of Alphabet's role in the age of artificial intelligence (AI) shifted from negative to positive.
Here's why Alphabet's bold push into AI is somewhat similar to what Walt Disney (DIS 0.50%) is doing in the entertainment industry, and what that means for investors interested in either stock.
Out with the old, in with the new
One of the hardest adjustments a company must make is realizing that a former cash cow simply isn't what it used to be. Businesses evolve and industries change. Companies that pivot can use their financial muscle to make inroads in new markets; others that are slow to adjust may see their seemingly impenetrable moats vanish.
Walt Disney's history is riddled with change. The company began as an innovator -- releasing the first feature-length animated film, Snow White, in 1937. It was a huge gamble, but it paid off. Other risks included opening Disneyland in 1955 and Walt Disney World in 1971; providing DVDs for home entertainment in the late 1990s; and acquiring Pixar in 2006, Marvel Entertainment in 2009, and Lucasfilm in 2012. Those gambles paid off.
But Disney's last decade hasn't gone as well -- the stock is up just 11% over the past decade, compared to a 236% return for the S&P 500. Its acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox in 2019 was costly and leveraged its balance sheet. Then came the pandemic in 2020, which disrupted the parks and movie business.
The company released Disney+ in 2019, which got off to a great start but took a while to become profitable. Today, Disney+ is performing much better, but Disney's traditional cable business (linear networks) is suffering major declines. However, the parks business is booming, and so is Disney's growing cruise fleet.
The history of Disney is chock-full of moments where it realized it couldn't rely on what was working and focused instead on what would work in the future. The company is cannibalizing its linear networks business because it realizes that streaming is here to stay.
That's even more true lately with its launch of an ESPN streaming app, which will unlock revenue but also further erode its cable business. Disney is investing heavily in what's working, such as doubling its earlier forecast for its experiences segment to $60 billion in capital expenditures over the next decade.
So while Disney isn't a pure-play, high-margin cash-cow streaming giant like Netflix, it's far more innovative and diversified than other traditional media companies such as Comcast. In this vein, Disney shares many similarities with Alphabet.
Alphabet has become a leader in AI
In an age when technology changes quickly, it's amazing to look back at the resiliency of Google Search, which has held a virtual monopoly on internet search for at least the last 15 years. Now, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are transforming the way people search for and interact with information.
Alphabet has a lot of moving parts, from Google Search to YouTube, Google Cloud, Google One, Android, Google Pixel, Google Play, and ""other bets"" like Waymo and Google Fiber. But despite the diversification, there's no denying that the company still depends heavily on Google Search -- this segment provided a staggering 56% of revenue in Alphabet's latest quarter. It's like how Disney used to heavily depend on blockbuster animated and live-action films before its parks business and linear networks took off.
Alphabet isn't looking at generative AI as a passing fad, it's embracing it. Gemini, powered by the research lab Google DeepMind, has become one of the most advanced multimodal generative AI models. That means it can process text, audio, images, video, and code. Google has embedded Gemini into its regular search function, offering ""AI Overviews"" for Google Search, which provide a summarized answer to a query rather than requiring the user to rely on webpage-based answers.
The Gemini app takes it a step further by allowing users to engage with information in a completely different way; it includes a basic free version (Gemini 2.0 Flash), more advanced versions, and even AI tools for businesses. Adoption of the app is surging, and there are even reports that Gemini could power the next version of Apple's Siri.
Gemini may be Alphabet's most innovative breakthrough in years, but it remains to be seen whether Alphabet can monetize it as effectively as Google Search, which relies heavily on ads. Google could offer native ads for Gemini in the future, which could be a clever way to use an existing business model for a new platform. But unlike Google Search, which is free, Gemini has far better pathways toward subscription revenue from users and enterprises.
There's a similar transition for Disney in the streaming space. Disney realizes that having its complete library of intellectual property available for a low monthly fee is cannibalizing its at-home entertainment and linear networks. But building a powerhouse streaming segment is the right long-term move, even if it takes time to pay off.
Two balanced buys for long-term investors
Disney and Alphabet are legacy companies that are both doing a good job of embracing change rather than resisting it. That's a quality that investors seeking a balance of growth and value are likely to appreciate.
Alphabet isn't as cheap as it used to be, but it's still the least expensive of the ""Ten Titans"" stocks. Despite a major slowdown in many consumer discretionary companies, Disney has held up well and is growing earnings; the stock is a great value at under 20 times forward earnings.
All told, Disney and Alphabet stand out as balanced buys for long-term investors, especially those looking for companies that aren't just betting on one theme or idea to pay off."

Pilot programs have begun with capital markets players, and broader trials are slated ahead of its planned 2026 launch.
Given the niche being targeted by Google with the GCUL, the immediate question is whether holders of XRP (XRP -2.51%) should worry. Let's take a closer look at what the plans are and how they compare to what Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL) is trying to do.
What Google's going to launch
GCUL's stated mission is to be institutional-grade financial plumbing for tokenized assets and transaction settlement, with interoperability for various legacy systems and smart contract support in the Python programming language. That ambition immediately suggests that it will be a direct competitor to XRP, but there's still a long journey from today to the new chain having durable liquidity and functioning features that the target market wants.
Historically, Google Cloud's crypto work has been infrastructure and tooling for other chains, such as its managed Blockchain Node Engine. That's very different from operating a blockchain and corralling users to develop on it, but it indicates that there is a base of experience in the sector to build on rather than starting from a blank slate. In other words, GCUL aims to move Google from being a niche crypto vendor to a mainstream blockchain provider.
Whereas Google Cloud already serves financial institutions with computing, enterprise storage, and regulatory compliance frameworks, it is not itself a regulated financial services provider. At this juncture, it's unclear whether it will seek that designation. Institutions will thus, at least for now, still need their usual roster of custodians, banks, and other services to make GCUL production-grade.
It's also not yet known if the GCUL will launch with a native token. If it does, that token will likely be used to pay the equivalent of the chain's gas (user) fees, and it will also likely sap capital from elsewhere in the crypto sector. But it's also entirely possible that Google will opt to make fees payable in stablecoins, which would abrogate the need for a native token. Taking such a route would additionally make the chain look more like a professional piece of financial infrastructure rather than a platform for speculation, so with all things considered, it's fairly probable that investors won't be able to invest in the GCUL directly.
One potential issue is that Alphabet's sketchy reputation for sunsetting products could chill mission-critical adoption at the margin. Simply put, many users and developers feel that Alphabet has a long-standing habit of launching ambitious new services only to abandon them a couple of years later after a sub-maximal effort to make them succeed. Financial institutions do not want to have to switch over key pieces of their infrastructure because their provider got bored.
None of this means GCUL will fail. It means investors should calibrate their expectations about its competitive impact. New venues can take years to earn trust and scale.
XRP's moat isn't going anywhere
As things stand today, the GCUL is not an existential threat to XRP, though it could slow its growth somewhat.
XRP's investment thesis has always hinged on being useful plumbing for cross-border money transfers, payments, and managing tokenized assets with institution-friendly compliance controls. And Ripple is currently seeking a national bank charter in the U.S., which could give it key legal capabilities to expand and market the XRPL as a platform -- so it's ahead of the game relative to GCUL on that front. That matters because it lowers the integration friction for banks, brokers, and asset issuers that have specific reporting requirements.
Could GCUL contest XRP's market share as the value of the payments, transfers, and asset tokenization markets grow? Yes, especially if Google pairs the ledger with incentives, seamless on-ramps for its cloud customers, and interoperability that reduces switching costs. Even if its experience in fintech is minimal, and even if app developers have many quibbles about its product strategy, the Google brand is globally known, far more so than XRP and Ripple combined.
In practice, incumbents often keep winning while newcomers try to find their footing, even when they're backed with vast resources. XRP is positioned to keep courting asset issuers that want tight, protocol-level controls and cheap, fast transaction settlement. It also has a highly committed investor base, and a clear roadmap for how to develop its financial infrastructure value chain further to capture more value over time.
In contrast, GCUL must first prove staying power, recruit and retain real capital, and survive procurement committees that remember Google's limited patience with non-core products. Until those boxes are checked, XRP's long-run thesis is intact, and near-term disruption from a new competitor preparing to enter the scene looks to be limited."

Wall Street expects Alphabet to generate a record $394 billion in total revenue during 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. Google Search is likely to account for more than half of that figure on its own, so it's the company's most important segment by far.
When AI chatbots like ChatGPT went mainstream two years ago, investors feared they would drive internet traffic away from Google Search because they offered a faster, more convenient way to find information online. However, Alphabet mounted an aggressive response to protect its golden goose.
The company developed a family of large language models (LLMs) called Gemini -- and its own chatbot, which bears the same name -- to compete with start-ups like OpenAI. And those LLMs also power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews, which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to create more comprehensive answers to search queries.
Overviews appear above the traditional Google results, so users no longer have to spend time sifting through web pages to find the information they need. Over 2 billion people are using them every month, and Alphabet says they generate advertising revenue at roughly the same rate as regular Google Search outputs, so they aren't hurting the company's core business.
Google Search's revenue growth actually accelerated from 9.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to 11.7% during the second quarter, suggesting the business is building momentum, not slowing down. This offers some proof that AI Overviews are having the desired effect.
Google Cloud is Alphabet's growth engine
Google Search might be Alphabet's biggest business, but Google Cloud is the fastest growing. It generated a record $13.6 billion in revenue during the second quarter, which was up 32% year over year. That growth rate accelerated from 28% in the first quarter.
Google Cloud operates state-of-the-art data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers such as Nvidia, and it rents the computing capacity to developers, which use it to build AI software. The platform also offers access to hundreds of ready-made LLMs, including Gemini, which developers can use to accelerate their progress. Over 85,000 organizations are now using Gemini to create AI software.
This business still has plenty of room to grow because it had a $106 billion order backlog at the end of the second quarter, from customers waiting for more data center capacity to come online. That was up 38% year over year, so based on Google Cloud's revenue growth during the quarter, demand appears to be increasing even faster than supply.
The stock still looks cheap
The U.S. Department of Justice won a lawsuit against Alphabet last year, which determined that the company used monopolistic practices to safeguard its market share in the internet search industry. For example, Alphabet paid Apple enormous annual fees to make Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone, making it almost impossible for other search engines to compete.
Lawmakers sought to break up Alphabet by forcing it to sell certain assets, which could have significantly disrupted the company's ability to generate revenue. Its valuation has been suppressed for the last couple of years while this saga played out, as investors braced for the worst.
But earlier this month, the judge in the case handed down a rather lenient decision that will allow management to continue paying partners like Apple, as long as the deals aren't exclusive. He also declined to support the Justice Department's proposed breakup.
Alphabet stock has surged by almost 20% since the ruling, which catapulted the company into the $3 trillion club. But with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 26.8, it's still the cheapest stock in the ""Magnificent Seven"" (a group of peers operating at the forefront of the AI industry), as shown in the chart below.
For that reason, I think Alphabet stock still has plenty of room to run."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-18T09:57:00,Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Quantum Computing 3 Years From Now,These two small-cap stocks look poised for gains over the next three years.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4186f22c0dbb5efdc66e934620d614b7a52177914dba0d5cccd4fedc575ae81d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/predict-stocks-worth-more-quantum-computing/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/predict-stocks-worth-more-quantum-computing/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/predict-stocks-worth-more-quantum-computing/,fool.com,200.0,,"Quantum computing stocks have soared over the last year as investors' hopes have mounted that it will be the next big transformative technology.
The momentum began last December, when Alphabet unveiled its Willow quantum chip, which it said could do a calculation in less than five minutes that would have taken a traditional supercomputer 10 septillion years. This year, quantum computing stocks have moved higher, as the technology has been endorsed by the likes of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and some pure-play quantum computing stocks seem to be delivering real progress, and as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has primed demand for the next big technology breakthrough.
Of the four pure-play quantum computing stocks, Quantum Computing (QUBT -2.39%) is the smallest. In the second quarter, revenue came in at $61,000, which was down from $183,000 in the second quarter a year ago. Quantum Computing differentiates itself from other quantum companies by using integrated photonics and quantum optics to create machines for quantum computing and related applications.
Quantum Computing now has a market cap of $2.7 billion, but as you can see from its revenue, that valuation is based almost entirely on hopes for the future, even though it's likely to take years for the company to deliver material revenue. At that valuation, some smaller stocks are better bets than Quantum Computing. Let's take a look at two that look primed to outperform Quantum Computing over the next three years.
1. Sweetgreen
Sweetgreen (SG -2.08%) might be a restaurant chain, but the fast-casual salad-focused operator is also making its own effort to tap into technology through its Infinite Kitchen. The Infinite Kitchen is an automated system that preps, measures, and dispenses ingredients for its salad bowls, and the company is rolling them out to new locations and retrofitting existing ones to include them.
Sweetgreen also looks like a good buy right now because the stock has plunged this year on what seems to be primarily short-term challenges. Comparable sales have fallen through the first half of the year due to difficult comparisons, a change in its loyalty program, and broader headwinds on discretionary spending.
However, Sweetgreen still has a long runway ahead of it, as the company only has about 250 locations currently and aims to open more than 1,000 over time. Sweetgreen's restaurants are also popular, as it has an average unit volume, or average sales per restaurant, of $2.8 million, which is close to what Chipotle restaurants, the industry standard-bearer, bring in.
Currently, Sweetgreen is valued at a market cap of just $1 billion, and the stock is trading down 74% this year. If it can recoup just part of those losses over the next three years, the company will top Quantum Computing's current market cap of $2.7 billion.
2. Innodata
Investors have been hungry for AI stocks, but small-cap AI opportunities are hard to find. Innodata (INOD 9.03%) is one of the rare ones. The company provides data labeling services, helping companies organize their AI data and best deploy it, making it a competitor of Scale AI, a start-up that was valued at $29 billion in a deal with Meta Platforms. That shows the market for data labeling is substantial.
Innodata currently has a market cap of $2 billion and is growing quickly. Revenue in the second quarter was up 79% year over year to $58.4 million, and it's profitable, with a net income of $7.2 million, up from breakeven in the quarter a year ago.
Innodata stock has broken out in the last few weeks, a sign that investors may be starting to recognize the opportunity in this investment. From its current market cap of $2 billion, topping Quantum Computing in the next few years looks achievable."

Chicago, IL – September 18, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights AppLovin APP, Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL.
AppLovin Stock Hits an All-Time High: Buy, Hold or Take Profits?
One stock that has seen a very strong resurgence amid subdued tariff concerns and hopes of an interest rate cut is AppLovin.
Attributed to bullish strategic moves, financial performance, and market momentum, the mobile app technology provider has seen its stock rebound and soar over +100% in the last six months, and is up +80% year to date.
More astonishing, since going public in April of 2021, AppLovin stock has now skyrocketed +800%. Hitting an all-time high of $613 a share in Wednesday’s trading sessions, it’s certainly a worthy topic of whether investors should buy, hold, or take profits in APP.
AI Ad Dominance & International Expansion
Reigniting optimism for AppLovin stock has been the company’s AXON 2.0 platform, a machine learning engine for mobile ad delivery that has been outperforming business expectations.
Determining when and which ads to display and to whom, AXON 2.0 optimizes advertisers' reach, engagement, and monetization, especially in the mobile and e-commerce sectors. Furthermore, AppLovin is fueling its growth by rolling out its ad tech globally, targeting markets in Europe and Asia with offices in Tokyo, Berlin, and Seoul.
Most importantly, this international expansion has dramatically increased AppLovin’s total addressable market and has reduced reliance on U.S. gaming revenue.
AppLovin’s Shift Beyond Gaming
Notably, AppLovin divested its mobile gaming division for $400 million in June to Tripledot Studios, also receiving a 20% equity consideration in the company at the time of closing.
The strategic move will allow AppLovin to streamline its operations and focus entirely on its high-growth ad tech platform. To that point, AppLovin is positioned as the third-largest ad platform provider in the U.S. behindMeta Platforms and Alphabet.
AppLovin’s Explosive Financial Growth
Speaking to AppLovin’s high-growth ad tech platform, its annual sales are now expected to increase 17% this year to $5.5 billion from $4.71 billion in 2024. Plus, fiscal 2026 sales are projected to climb another 26% to $6.93 billion.
Echoing the excitement for AppLovin stock is that since the pandemic, its top line has stretched over 200% with annual sales at $1.45 billion in 2020.
S&P 500 Inclusion & Analyst Upgrades
Further boosting investor sentiment and institutional credibility is that AppLovin's stock will be added to the S&P 500 next Monday, September 22."

The move signals a tactical shift by Beijing, redirecting regulatory focus to Nvidia as leverage in the U.S.-China trade talks and sending a message of flexibility to Washington by ending the probe into Google, the newspaper said.
China's State Administration for Market Regulation, which opened the investigation against Google in February, has now decided to drop it, the report said citing two people briefed on the decision.
Google declined to comment to the FT. The company, China's State Administration for Market Regulation and China's State Council did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The regulator had earlier said that Google was suspected of violating the country's anti-monopoly law, without providing further details on the investigation or on what it alleged Google had done to breach the law.
Google has not been formally notified of the decision to drop the probe, the FT report said.
Earlier this week, China accused Nvidia of violating its anti-monopoly law, following a preliminary investigation into the California-based firm's business practices.
The two countries have traded barbs over the past six months since U.S. President Donald Trump hit China with massive tariffs, before lowering them to 30%, and threatened to shut down popular social media app TikTok.
China responded with 10% tariffs and antitrust probes against the likes of Alphabet's Google, signalling more regulatory scrutiny on U.S. firms.

One Stock to Sell:
SolarEdge (SEDG)
One-Month Return: +10.1%
Established in 2006, SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) creates advanced systems to improve the efficiency of solar panels.
Why Do We Avoid SEDG?
-
Number of megawatts shipped has disappointed over the past two years, indicating weak demand for its offerings
-
Waning returns on capital from an already weak starting point displays the inefficacy of management’s past and current investment decisions
-
Depletion of cash reserves could lead to a fundraising event that triggers shareholder dilution
SolarEdge is trading at $34.30 per share, or 1.5x forward price-to-sales. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than SEDG.
Two Stocks to Watch:
Alphabet (GOOGL)
One-Month Return: +23.6%
Started by Stanford students Larry Page and Sergey Brin in a Menlo Park garage, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the parent company of the eponymous Google Search engine, Google Cloud Platform, and YouTube.
Why Is GOOGL a Good Business?
-
Alphabet’s dominant Google Search sits on the pantheon of the best businesses ever. This is reflected in its robust long-term revenue growth and elite operating margin.
-
The company’s profit margins have become even higher over time, speaking to its scale advantages and operating efficiency not only in its core Search business but also in Google Cloud Platform and YouTube.
-
Revenue growth and increasing operating margins are the key ingredients for strong EPS growth. Google has these, and when also factoring in its share repurchases, you can see why EPS has exploded over the long term.
Alphabet’s stock price of $251.55 implies a valuation ratio of 26x forward price-to-earnings. Is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it’s free.
Warby Parker (WRBY)
One-Month Return: -3%
Founded in 2010, Warby Parker (NYSE:WRBY) designs, manufactures, and sells eyewear, including prescription glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses, through its e-commerce platform and physical retail locations.
Why Are We Positive On WRBY?
-
Bold push to open new stores demonstrates an ambitious strategy to establish itself in underpenetrated territories
-
Collection of products is difficult to replicate at scale and results in a best-in-class gross margin of 54.9%
-

Riders can initially hail driverless cars through the Waymo app, with plans to integrate the fleet into Lyft’s platform later in 2026.
The collaboration is significant given that Waymo also has deals in place with Lyft's rival Uber (UBER) for its robotaxis in Atlanta and Austin. Uber shares were down about 5% following the announcement on Wednesday morning.
The robotaxi race has accelerated this year. Tesla (TSLA) began testing its service in Austin this summer, with plans to eventually expand to Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. Zoox, backed by Amazon (AMZN), also has limited testing in San Francisco and Las Vegas. Waymo has been leading the race, providing paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin.
Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a press release that the deal was part of a gradual rollout as the company continues to scale Waymo's ride-hailing service ""to more people and more places.""
At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently. It could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.
For Lyft, the Waymo partnership could help the company better compete with Uber and Tesla as it sidesteps building the autonomous technology in-house — a costly and risky prospect, particularly if AV expansion stalls.
Still, Lyft faces other challenges. In a note to clients, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated an In Line rating after Lyft's mixed second quarter results, calling the key question ""the company’s ability to sustain top-line growth while ramping profitability.""
""We see LYFT’s valuation as very reasonable,"" Mahaney said. Even so, the firm ""would like to see positive fundamental trends sustained over time to become constructive on the shares.""
Lyft stock is up 70% year to date versus Uber's 48% rise during the same period. Uber's market cap, however, is $195 billion, dwarfing Lyft's $9 billion valuation.

Lyft (LYFT) shares soared Wednesday after the ridesharing firm and Google’s Waymo announced a partnership to launch a robotaxi service in Nashville starting next year.
Shares of Lyft jumped over 13%, while rival Uber (UBER) dropped 5%. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock slipped less than 1%.
Waymo said it will use Lyft’s fleet-management services, including “vehicle maintenance, infrastructure and depot operations.” Lyft will build an AV fleet management facility with charging and vehicle service capabilities as part of the deal. The robotaxis will be first available on the Waymo app, then on the Lyft app later next year, the companies said.
Waymo has struck deals with Uber in the past as well, launching robotaxi services in Atlanta and Austin this year. The robotaxi space has also become more crowded, with Tesla (TSLA) launching its autonomous driving service in Austin in June.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is among the Stocks That Could 10X in the Next 3 Year. On September 9, Reuters reported that Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud has lined up around $58 billion in new revenue for the next two years.
This comes as the company’s cloud unit continues to expand rapidly, becoming a significant contributor to Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) total revenue. The company reported that its cloud business exceeded $50 billion in annual revenue run rate as of July 2025, signalling strong future sales. Moreover, Unit Chief Thomas Kurian told investors at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference that the backlog of non-recognized sales contracts is growing even faster than its revenue. He noted that 55% of this $106 billion backlog is expected to become revenue within the next two years.
Similarly, the new customer growth for Google Cloud also remains strong with a 28% increase quarter-over-quarter. Management also noted that 9 out of 10 leading artificial labs are now its customers.
While cloud computing accounts for only 14% of Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) total revenue, which is much less than its dominant ad business, it is one of the fastest-growing segments.
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a holding company with three main segments, including Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.

Shares of ride sharing service Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) jumped 14.7% in the morning session after the company announced a new partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in Nashville in 2026.
The collaboration planned to use Lyft's Flexdrive subsidiary for comprehensive fleet management, which handled vehicle maintenance and depot operations for Waymo's self-driving cars. This deal represented a significant move for Lyft, helping it to better compete against its rival, Uber, in the race to scale autonomous rides. The rollout plan indicated that rides would first be available through Waymo's app, with a planned integration into Lyft's own platform later in 2026. The announcement sent a jolt of excitement through the market, pushing Lyft's shares sharply higher while shares of its rival, Uber, declined.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Lyft’s shares are very volatile and have had 25 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Lyft and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 23 hours ago when the stock dropped 2.2% on the news that competitor Waymo received approval to operate its autonomous vehicles at San Francisco International Airport (SFO).
The development signals intensified competition in the ride-sharing space, particularly from tech giants with significant investments in self-driving technology. This news appears to be the primary driver for the decline in both Lyft and its main competitor, Uber. The negative sentiment was compounded by a broader market downturn, with major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also trading lower during the session. While Lyft is involved in autonomous driving initiatives, the immediate competitive threat from Waymo's expansion in a key market is weighing on investor confidence.
Lyft is up 66.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $22.69 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Lyft’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $726.24.
Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

Coursera (NYSE: COUR) has emerged as a leading global E-learning platform, connecting over 168 million registered learners with 350+ universities and corporate partners, including Yale, Google, and the University of London. The platform spans Consumer and Enterprise segments, offering everything from short courses and professional certificates to full degrees, now consolidated under Consumer for reporting clarity.
Coursera’s Consumer segment continues to drive growth, posting $123 million in revenue in Q2 2025—up 10% year-over-year—with 7.5 million new learners, while gross margins rose to 61% due to favorable content agreements and localization strategies. Enterprise revenue also grew, reaching $64 million with a 70% margin, supported by government, corporate, and campus clients, and engagement with AI-driven tools like Coursera Coach.
Financially, Coursera is debt-free, holding $775 million in cash and equivalents, with manageable liabilities tied to operations and deferred revenue. Operating losses are narrowing, with Q2 2025 net loss down to $7.8 million, highlighting improving unit economics, cost efficiencies, and operational leverage. Free cash flow is accelerating, hitting $29 million in Q2, while stock-based compensation is declining, mitigating dilution risks. The platform benefits from upfront subscription and enterprise payments, giving flexibility to invest in AI, content, and product improvements.
The broader online learning market remains large and growing, with corporate e-learning alone exceeding $100 billion globally. While competition from Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, and DataCamp is meaningful, Coursera’s mix of university-backed content, global reach, and career-aligned offerings creates differentiation.
With improving margins, a debt-free balance sheet, and robust free cash flow, the company is positioned for profitability, offering upside potential as AI adoption and enterprise expansion continue. Key risks include pricing pressure, partner revenue-share adjustments, and potential dilution, but the setup presents a disciplined, risk-adjusted opportunity for investors over the next 12–24 months.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Coursera, Inc. (COUR) by Unemployed Value Degen in November 2024, which highlighted its high-margin platform, strong user growth, AI-driven credentials, and robust cash position. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately 32% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as Coursera continues scaling and strengthening AI initiatives. Shehroz Babar shares a similar perspective but emphasizes updated financials, segment consolidation, and rising free cash flow in 2025."

As of 11:22 a.m. ET, Lyft stock was up 12.2% on the news.
Lyft scores a win
The stakes are getting higher in the autonomous ride-sharing race, as Tesla has started an autonomous vehicle service in Austin and is looking to expand it to other cities. Amazon, meanwhile, launched its Zoox autonomous shuttle in Las Vegas. However, Waymo remains the clear leader in the category.
On Wednesday, Lyft announced a new partnership to bring Waymo's full autonomous ride-sharing service to Nashville in 2026. The new collaboration will take advantage of Lyft's integrated fleet management services through its Flexdrive subsidiary, which handles fleet management services, such as vehicle maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations.
According to the terms of the deal, Waymo's vehicles will first be available on the Waymo app and then added to the Lyft app later in the year.
CEO David Risher said in a press release: ""Waymo has proven that its autonomous technology works at scale. When combined with Lyft's customer obsession and world-class fleet management capabilities, it's two great tastes that go great together.""
What it means for Lyft
It's unclear where this partnership goes from here, and it likely depends on how the Nashville rollout goes. However, it's clearly a win to form a partnership with the leading autonomous vehicle company, and the market response was strong enough that Uber, which has also teamed up with Waymo, fell several points on the news.
It's the latest evidence that Lyft is a much stronger business than it was a year or two ago."

Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom.
The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business.
Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year.
Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for.
September Rally in Focus
Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month.
While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking.
It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers.
Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring.
Bullish Price Targets to Monitor
Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements.
To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value.
When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201).
Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201).
Key Support Levels Worth Watching
The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap.
Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

Chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) announced on Tuesday that alongside AI infrastructure partners Nscale, CoreWeave (CRWV) and others, it would invest £11bn ($15bn) in UK AI factories.
Microsoft (MSFT) also said that it plans to pump $30bn (£21.95bn) into AI infrastructure and its ongoing operations across the UK over four years through to 2028.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google announced the opening of its data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, as part of a two-year £5bn investment in the UK.

In addition, software giant Salesforce (CRM) pledged to put a further $2bn into its UK business through 2030, extending a previous five-year investment of $4bn made in 2023.
The commitments came ahead of the UK and US revealing details of their Tech Prosperity Deal on Tuesday evening, as US president Donald Trump arrived in Britain for his state visit.
Richard Clode, portfolio manager on the global technology leaders team at Janus Henderson, said: ""AI is a scale game in terms of infrastructure and scarce AI talent. The UK has the latter while these announcements give us more confidence in the UK having the former. That should pave the way for continued strong AI innovation in the UK with natural advantages versus the rest of Europe.""
With that in mind, here's a closer look at the main companies with which US tech giants are partnering as part of their investments.
Nscale
Nvidia (NVDA) said it was partnering with UK-headquartered AI-infrastructure company Nscale to scale up 300,000 of the chipmaker's Grace Blackwell graphic processing units (GPUs) worldwide, with up to 60,000 in the UK.
Nscale has also entered into a commitment with Microsoft (MSFT) to deliver the UK's largest AI supercomputer at its campus in Loughton, Essex. Nscale said that the site will deliver 50 megawatts (mw) of AI capacity, scalable to 90mw, and will initially house 23,040 Nvidia GB300 GPUs, which will be delivered in the first quarter of 2027.
In addition, Nscale is teaming up with ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Nvidia (NVDA) to establish Stargate UK, an infrastructure platform designed to deploy OpenAI’s technology in the UK.
Nscale, which was founded by CEO Josh Payne in 2023, has already partnered with OpenAI to launch Stargate Norway: an AI infrastructure project in Narvik aiming to deliver 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026."

Riders can initially hail driverless cars through the Waymo app, with plans to integrate the fleet into Lyft’s platform later in 2026.
The collaboration is significant given that Waymo also has deals in place with Lyft's rival Uber (UBER) for its robotaxis in Atlanta and Austin. Uber shares were down about 5% following the announcement on Wednesday morning.
The robotaxi race has accelerated this year. Tesla (TSLA) began testing its service in Austin this summer, with plans to eventually expand to Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. Zoox, backed by Amazon (AMZN), also has limited testing in San Francisco and Las Vegas. Waymo has been leading the race, providing paid robotaxi rides to customers in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin.
Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a press release that the deal was part of a gradual rollout as the company continues to scale Waymo's ride-hailing service ""to more people and more places.""
At stake is a huge opportunity for companies like Waymo, Tesla, and others. Goldman analyst Mark Delaney estimates the market for traditional ride-hailing in the US is worth approximately $58 billion currently. It could be worth more than $330 billion by 2030, with robotaxi-type services pushing the industry forward and reducing costs by — among other factors —not requiring a human driver.
For Lyft, the Waymo partnership could help the company better compete with Uber and Tesla as it sidesteps building the autonomous technology in-house — a costly and risky prospect, particularly if AV expansion stalls.
Still, Lyft faces other challenges. In a note to clients, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated an In Line rating after Lyft's mixed second quarter results, calling the key question ""the company’s ability to sustain top-line growth while ramping profitability.""
""We see LYFT’s valuation as very reasonable,"" Mahaney said. Even so, the firm ""would like to see positive fundamental trends sustained over time to become constructive on the shares.""
Lyft stock is up 70% year to date versus Uber's 48% rise during the same period. Uber's market cap, however, is $195 billion, dwarfing Lyft's $9 billion valuation.

And finally, let's talk about President Trump's visit to the UK. He's been greeted with a lot of fanfare, not just from officials there, you know, royalty, etc., but from companies that are also uh inking partnerships there, Ramzan.
That's right. There's a lot of pageantry, but it's interesting to note that President Trump isn't in London, he's in Windsor. There have been protests as well. But he has been accompanied by uh quite a few of the, you know, leading names in technology, US leading names. Among them, uh Jensen Huang, from Nvidia's Jensen Huang and also Microsoft's Satya Nadela are all are with him as well. And what they've the two countries have agreed is a big, what they called a tech prosperity deal. And it's estimated to be worth around 42 billion dollars. And some of the investments that have been promised include Microsoft saying it'll spend around 30 billion dollars expanding cloud and AI infrastructure in the UK. Google's promised almost 7 billion dollars in spending on a new data center and AI research. Nvidia said it would deploy 120,000 advanced chips across the country. So, a lot of US investment uh in the UK, uh also Salesforce has said they're going to invest, Core Weave as well. So, that's good for the UK, but what about the US? Well, on the flip side, the British pharmaceutical firm GSK said it's going to invest 30 billion dollars in US research and development and supply chain infrastructure over the next five years. Now, remember, Pharma is a bit of a hot topic because of President Trump's threat to potentially somewhere down the line to hit hit uh the these drug companies with 200% tariffs. Well, a lot of companies are already making that move to invest in the UK to avoid that. So, that's quite an interesting take. Also an interesting thing on the tech front, the investment in um the UK could be quite significant because just across the water, across the channel, uh in Europe, there's a bit of a an uneasy relationship with US tech firms and these and uh the European regulators there. And President Trump has often criticized you the EU uh in terms of their how how they hit US tech firms. So maybe going to the UK is is one way of showing, well, actually, we don't need you, we can go to the UK and we can be as prosperous there. Uh also, the UK is desperate as well for this investment. GDP growth in the three months up to July was just 0.2% in the UK. So the economy not really firing on on all cylinders. So this investment will be uh very much welcome here in the UK."

Now, time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Lyft, Eli Lily, and Open Door.
First up, Lyft. It's partnering with Waymo for the first time to offer robotaxi services in Nashville starting next year.
The deal helps it better compete with rival Uber, which struck a multi-year deal in 2023 with Waymo to offer trips in Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.
Alphabet owned Waymo has been conducting testing in Nashville since March. It will launch fully autonomous operations in the coming months.
The rides will open to the public next year, first through the Waymo app and then on Lyft's platform later in 2026.
Those shares right now surging 14%. They earlier jumped as much as 16%, the biggest gain in over 4 months.
Next up, Eli Lily. Patients on its experimental diabetes pill lost more weight and had better blood sugar control than those on an older approved rival from Novo Nordisk.
The late stage study comes as Eli Lily's pill inches closer to becoming another needle-free alternative in the blockbuster market for GLP-1s.
Lily and Nova Nordisk are vying for a greater share of the booming market, which some analysts say could be worth around 100 billion dollars by the 2030s. those shares up just a bit today.
And finally Open door. Shares are jumping. It's new CEO, who's just three days into the job, says they filed an 8K, so his and Open doors X accounts would be used to talk with investors.
An 8K filings report filed with the SEC by publicly traded companies to disclose significant unscheduled events that could affect their operations or financial conditions.
He added that the company has parted ways with this external PR agencies and wants their investors to hear directly from the company.
Investors clearly rewarding open door for that latest announcement. And this is by the way, a playbook that we have seen other so-called meme stocks or retail investor favorites take. For example, AMC, the chain has definitely taken that approach of talking directly to investors using its social accounts among other ways.

The company is updating Seller Assistant, its AI tool for third-party sellers, to help handle tasks on the seller’s behalf.
“Our agentic AI capabilities are designed to work seamlessly throughout the entire selling experience, which means sellers can go from handling every task themselves to collaborating with an intelligent assistant that works proactively on their behalf around the clock, while always keeping sellers in control,” Amazon wrote in a press release. “Seller Assistant will be able to handle everything from routine operations to complex business strategy, so sellers can focus on innovation and growth.”
Seller Assistant can now not only monitor account health and inventory, but also help develop strategies and take action when authorized, Amazon says.
For example, when a seller is reviewing their inventory, Seller Assistant will flag slow-moving products before they incur long-term storage fees and recommend whether it would make sense to leave the item as it is, lower the price, or remove it altogether. Seller Assistant will also be able to analyze demand patterns and prepare shipment recommendations.
Seller Assistant continuously monitors a seller’s account and flag potential issues and actions, such as inventory listings that might violate new product safety regulations. Additionally, it can automatically ensure that all of a seller’s products meet compliance requirements in every country they’re selling in.
Agent-driven commerce is an area of intense interest for tech companies, which imagine a future in which agents can initiate deals or make purchases on behalf of their clients. On Tuesday, Google released a new payments protocol for agentic transactions, although Amazon was not named as a partner.
Amazon also announced that it’s bringing agentic AI to advertising, allowing sellers to develop ads through conversational prompts.
Today’s announcement marks the latest AI tools that Amazon has rolled out for third-party sellers on its platform. Other tools include a video generator for ads and a generative AI tool that helps merchants improve their product listings."

But looking ahead, AI use cases are expected to grow even more complex and reach broader end markets.
One of the more intriguing frontiers is quantum computing -- an emerging technology with the potential to transform mission-critical industries such as energy and financial services. Analysts from McKinsey & Company are projecting that quantum applications could unlock trillions in economic value in the long run.
Naturally, investors are curious: Which of today's AI titans are positioning themselves to lead the quantum era? In my eyes, two companies stick out as particularly well positioned to dominate the next wave of the AI narrative.
Nvidia: Building the hardware + software quantum stack
It wasn't long ago that Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) was perceived as a niche hardware designer that primarily catered to online gamers. That narrow view dramatically underestimated the foresight of Nvidia's visionary CEO, Jensen Huang. Nearly two decades ago, Huang recognized that GPUs had the potential to impact industries far beyond gaming.
Today, these same chipsets serve as the foundation for deploying generative AI models like ChatGPT. But what truly sets Nvidia apart from the competition is its comprehensive ecosystem that extends beyond hardware expertise.
At the core is CUDA, Nvidia's software architecture that layers on top of its GPUs. This end-to-end integration has helped Nvidia build a powerful lock-in effect with developers -- essentially turning the company into a full-spectrum backbone for building AI systems.
While these dynamics have helped Nvidia form a technological moat, the company is quietly working to extend its dominance even further. CUDA is now becoming a bridge connecting conventional (classical) GPU programming with quantum workloads, helping position Nvidia at the center of emerging frontiers in the AI landscape.
The combination of hardware and software stack has helped Nvidia create a platform with durable competitive advantages. This flywheel effect not only reinforces its leadership in the AI industry but also positions the company to benefit from new tailwinds such as quantum computing.
Alphabet: Purpose-built for the quantum era
When most investors think of Alphabet, their minds go straight to Google search or YouTube. Advertising still fuels the majority of Alphabet's cash flow, but beneath the surface, the company has quietly built one of the most advanced AI ecosystems on the market. And a particularly important -- albeit overlooked -- pillar of that strategy is quantum computing.
On the hardware side, Alphabet developed a quantum processor called Willow. In benchmark tests, Willow solved an equation in minutes that would take today's most powerful supercomputers an estimated 10 septillion years to complete.
On the research side, one of Alphabet's lesser-known subsidiaries is a research lab called DeepMind. The advantage of DeepMind is that Alphabet can quickly and constantly test and refine new chip architectures and AI applications -- making them readily available for the company's enterprise and consumer product suites.
Lastly, on the infrastructure side are Alphabet's tensor processing units (TPUs) and its open-source software framework, Cirq. This combination has the potential to usher in a new wave of AI workloads into Alphabet's budding cloud computing network, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In the long run, this could prove to be an interesting differentiator for GCP over larger incumbents like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The key takeaway is that Alphabet's ambitions in quantum computing are far from a theoretical exercise. By deliberately building a vertically integrated stack across chips, research, software, and infrastructure, Alphabet underscores its AI-first identity well beyond search and advertising.
This breadth not only augments the core business, but more importantly, it provides some needed optionality -- ultimately ensuring that Alphabet remains nimble and adaptive in a fast-changing technology landscape."

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks to watch in September.
Dan Niles from Niles Investment Management, in a recent program on CNBC, reiterated his concerns about a potential slowdown in AI demand. This time, Niles highlighted Nvidia’s data center miss in its latest quarterly report.
“Over the weekend it came out that OpenAI has sort of pushed up their revenue forecast for 2030 by about $26 billion to $200 billion,” Niles said. “But to get that revenue increase of $26 billion, they’re going to have to burn $85 billion more in cash. So the data points are definitely there, but you know, we’re in this business to make money. So you have to go, all right, well, do the fundamentals matter right now, or is it the fact you’re going to get even more easy money? The 10-year yields going down to 4%. And so this market, much like in 2021, will keep going up right up until it doesn’t. And so I think you have to look at that. And Nvidia missing on data center revenues, and you can say yes the growth was so high and all this, but they missed, so that should give you another data point. And you throw on top of that Dell or Marll or the fact that AVGO got more ASIC revenues because companies want to cut their costs—those all speak to the same narrative, so don’t confuse the actual data with what the stock prices are doing.”

Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Loomis Sayles Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, which enables computers to mimic human-like intelligence for problem solving and decision making capabilities. Founded in 1993 to develop faster and more-realistic graphics for PC-based video games, Nvidia created the first graphics processing unit (GPU), a dedicated semiconductor that employs a proprietary parallel processing architecture to perform superior graphics rendering outside of a computer’s standard central processing unit (CPU). The parallel processing capability of Nvidia’s GPUs, which contrasts with the linear processing requirement of CPUs, can accelerate computing functions performed by standard CPUs by greater than ten times. As a result, Nvidia extended its visual computing expertise beyond its legacy gaming market into innovative new and larger markets, including data centers, autos, and professional visualization. The parallel processing capability facilitates pattern recognition and machine learning functions that have enabled Nvidia to be at the forefront of growth in artificial intelligence applications. As a result, the data center business, which first surpassed the gaming business to become Nvidia’s largest revenue and profit generator in its 2023 fiscal year, grew to represent over 88% of revenue in the company’s most recent fiscal year. The company is also focused on building out its GPU-computing-based ecosystem and is helping to enable breakthroughs in autonomous driving, and virtual reality."

The company said Wednesday it will begin testing its fleet of all-electric and autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in the Nashville area in the coming months and will open up the service to the public next year.
The partnership agreement announced Wednesday comes as Waymo ramps up its robotaxi expansion from its initial commercial market of Phoenix to Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The Alphabet-owned company has previously announced plans to bring its robotaxis to Miami, Washington D.C., Dallas, and Denver.
The deal also illustrates Waymo’s desire to move beyond being a sole operator and towards being an autonomous vehicle technology provider. Earlier this year, Waymo launched a robotaxi service with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. Under that arrangement, Waymo is responsible for vehicle testing, roadside assistance, and certain aspects of rider support, while Uber manages fleet services such as vehicle cleaning, maintenance, inspections, charging, and depot operations through a company called Moove Cars.
Waymo’s arrangement with Lyft in Nashville is similar. Lyft will also handle fleet services, such as vehicle readiness and maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations through its wholly owned subsidiary Flexdrive. Lyft said it’s investing in a purpose-built AV facility to support the fleet.
The Waymo-Lyft partnership in Nashville has one key difference from the company’s relationship with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. In Nashville, robotaxi customers will be able to access robotaxis in two ways. Users will initially hail rides directly through the Waymo app. Once the service expands, Waymo will also dispatch its autonomous vehicles for matched rides on the Lyft app.
That’s unlike its partnership with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. In those cities, all potential customers have to use the Uber app in hopes of being matched with a robot, not a human driver.
Lyft and Waymo have partnered before, although never at scale. In 2019, Waymo linked up with Lyft to bring a handful of self-driving vehicles onto the ride-hailing network in Phoenix as the company ramped up its commercial robotaxi service."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Glilot Capital, one of Israel's largest venture capital funds, said on Wednesday it had raised $500 million for two new early-stage funds to invest in fast-growing Israeli AI and cybersecurity startups.
Glilot said the money was raised mainly from international investors, including pension funds and other financial institutions in the U.S. and Europe, suggesting little adverse impact from the widespread criticism of Israel over its actions in Gaza.
The cash will go to two new Glilot funds - a seed fund, its fifth, and another that invests in early-stage companies called Glilot Plus.
Glilot has realised 22 investments since its founding in 2011.
Kobi Samboursky, co-founder and managing partner, said each of the new funds aimed to invest in 12 AI and cybersecurity startups in the coming years. Glilot's funds have invested in eight companies so far this year, while portfolio companies have received $700 million in follow-on investment.
""Cyber is now bigger than ever and I don't think it's going to end anytime soon,"" Samboursky, a former officer in the Israeli military's 8200 intelligence unit, told Reuters, adding he preferred to not invest in too many companies.
He said half of the new funding would go to new investments and the rest to follow-on investments. Glilot has more than $1 billion under management.
Investment, Samboursky said, would be focused largely on startups that protect companies' AI as well as attacks stemming from AI - technology that combines AI and cybersecurity.
""This (segment) is going to be bigger than cloud security,"" Samboursky said. ""In the next five, six years we have the potential to create a lot of great companies because of this combination.""
He said that cyber hackers were increasingly using AI so ""we as an industry need to come up with solutions to cope with that ... We already are starting to see much more sophisticated attacks so we have to completely reinvent the way we protect"" against them.
Israel has become a global leader in cyber security, which accounts for about half of all investment in Israeli tech startups.
In July, Palo Alto Networks said it was buying Israeli peer CyberArk Software for about $25 billion. That followed Alphabet's $32 billion acquisition of Israeli startup Wiz in March.
""It's clear,"" Samboursky said, ""that Israel is number one in the cyber domain.""

The former Google Chief Decision Scientist, Cassie Kozyrkov, will headline, joined by leaders from Deloitte, M&T Bank, Snowflake, Thermo Fisher, and Tiger Analytics, to explore the future of agentic data systems
BOSTON, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ataccama, the data trust company, today announced that registration is now open for FWRD 2025, its flagship virtual event for CDOs and data leaders navigating AI, regulation, and enterprise-wide data complexity. Taking place on November 6, the event will feature Cassie Kozyrkov, former Chief Decision Scientist at Google, as the closing keynote speaker. As multi-agent AI systems begin reshaping enterprise architecture, FWRD will offer data leaders a first look at the trust, quality, and orchestration needed to make them work.
FWRD 2025 will bring together more than a thousand CDOs, data product owners, and platform leaders to learn how to make AI work in the real world, starting with data you can trust. Speakers from Ataccama, Deloitte, M&T Bank, Snowflake, Thermo Fisher, Tiger Analytics, and more will lead over a dozen sessions across three tracks, focused on building AI-ready data architectures, weaving quality controls into operational workflows, and delivering reliable insights across complex environments.
At the core of Ataccama’s platform is a market-leading data quality suite that helps organizations ensure their data is accurate, governed, and ready for use every time. By unifying quality rules, observability, lineage, and policy into a single system, Ataccama enables teams to reduce risk and power AI and analytics with confidence.
Attendees will gain practical strategies for modernizing stewardship, embedding trust into AI workflows, and building data architectures that support speed and scale. The agenda will also introduce the agentic future of data management, where intelligent systems assume a greater operational load to improve data quality, observability, and governance autonomously.
“I’m excited to close out FWRD with a conversation on what it really means to lead with data,” said Cassie Kozyrkov. “In the age of AI, the organizations that succeed won’t be the ones with the most answers; they’ll be the ones asking better questions. We’ll talk about how data leaders can rethink decision-making, build trust, and stay ahead as the landscape shifts beneath them.”
In a fireside chat with Jessica Smith, Ataccama’s VP of Data Quality, Kozyrkov will explore the shift from faster insights to smarter decision-making, and the critical role high-quality data plays in AI readiness. Drawing from her experience advising Google’s executive leadership, the keynote titled “When AI answers are cheap, are you asking the right questions?” will share a candid view of what separates surface-level data efforts from strategies that deliver real business value, rooted in trust, quality, and execution.
“Most enterprises are not ready for what is coming. Multi-agent systems are fundamentally changing how decisions get made,” said Mike McKee, CEO of Ataccama. “If your data can’t keep up, your AI won’t either. FWRD is where the leaders building for that future come together. We’ll show what it takes to orchestrate agentic AI that’s aligned to policy, explainable by design, and powered by the best data quality solution on the market to support high-stakes, real-time decisions. This is the next architecture, and we are building it with our customers.”"

U.S. President Donald Trump touched down in the United Kingdom on Tuesday for an unprecedented second state visit. He was accompanied by American tech CEOs, who pledged $42.3 billion worth of investments in U.K. AI projects.
The investments from major players, including Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, and OpenAI, are part of a sweeping £31 billion ($42.3 billion) “Tech Prosperity Deal,” aimed at building out the UK’s AI infrastructure, funding data center projects and computer chips.
The bulk of this investment comes from Microsoft, which unveiled a plan to spend almost $30 billion (£22 billion) over the next four years. The investment package is the company’s largest outside the U.S. and is separate from OpenAI’s recent announcement of a smaller, U.K.-based version of Stargate.
At the heart of the company’s push is a supercomputer in Essex, which will house over 23,000 GPUs in partnership with British-based AI infrastructure company Nscale, a project that CEO Satya Nadella says could accelerate the UK’s economic growth by 10% within just five years. “As we make these investments, we are guided by a clear and bold vision, ensuring that both the United States and the United Kingdom remain at the forefront of cloud and AI innovation,” Nadella said in a video statement.
According to the company, $15.5 billion would be spent on capital investments, such as the data center project, while a further $15.1 billion would be directed towards maintaining and growing its U.K. operations. Microsoft President Brad Smith said during a Tuesday press briefing that the company already had contracts in place or had pre-purchased the electricity needed to power the new data centers it plans to build.
“We will be good for every cent of this investment,” Smith said in the press briefing. “We care about British pounds, not empty tech promises.”
Microsoft isn’t the only U.S. company committing to major AI infrastructure investments in U.K. Google pledged $6.8 billion for AI research and infrastructure, which includes a new $1 billion AI data center that is set to open this week, and more funding for research at Google DeepMind, its advanced AI lab that continues to be headquartered in London.
DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis celebrated the investment as demonstrating “the strength of the US–U.K. partnership.”
“Combining the unique strengths of both countries will help to ensure our scientists continue to lead on the breakthroughs and innovations that will define the future. In particular, we look forward to working with both governments to advise on how scientists can harness the latest AI tools, as well as building on our partnership with the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority to advance fusion energy research in the US and the U.K.,” Hassabis said in a post on LinkedIn."

The L1 blockchain created by former Facebook devs has been thrust into the spotlight with Google’s launch of the Agentic Payments Protocol (AP2), a framework built for AI-driven payments.
Backed by PayPal, Salesforce, and dozens of others, AP2 aims to let autonomous agents manage direct purchases and recurring transactions with little to no human input.
According to analyst MartyParty, AP2 “creates a traceable audit trail, making automated purchases safer,” while setting the stage for broader Web3 applications in subscriptions and digital content monetization. Here’s what else you need to know about Sui crypto heading into Q4.
Sui Crypto Price Action: Could Tight Bollinger Bands Hint at Breakout?
At the time of writing, SUI trades at $3.57, up +2.29% in 24 hours and logging a +1% weekly gain. While modest on the surface, traders are watching a bigger technical story unfold.
Past setups of this SUI price action echo similar squeezes in Dec. 2023 and Sept. 2024, which triggered 250% and 404% rallies. It also helps that the Bollinger bands are at their tightest levels in SUI’s history, suggesting volatility is about to expand.
Analyst CryptoBullet expects a 150–200% move if history repeats, with $5–$6 as early targets. That technical setup, layered on top of Sui’s AP2 partnership, has made it one of the most closely tracked altcoins this week.

Why Google’s AP2 Could Be a Catalyst for Sui’s Next Rally
For investors, the key is whether agent-led commerce becomes more than a buzzword. I mean, would anyone you talk to on the street know what “agent-led” commerce was?
No. But if AI-driven agents gain traction in industries like subscriptions, enterprise licensing, or automated trading, Sui’s architecture is well-positioned to capture demand. Its Move-based design allows fast, asset-oriented execution and it is exactly what’s needed for microtransactions at scale.
DeFiLlama reports $290B in stablecoin liquidity across the market, capital that could rotate quickly if AP2 adoption picks up.

The news comes as US regulators face a flood of new crypto ETF filings. Among them is Bitwise’s spot Avalanche ETF, Tuttle’s “Income Blast” funds covering Sui (SUI) and Bonk, and a leveraged Orbs ETF. While analysts see AVAX and tokenization funds as likeliest to win approval, the presence of Sui in ETF filings adds another institutional angle.
Whether SUI rallies 150% as traders predict will depend on adoption and broader market risk appetite, yet it is clear that Sui is now part of Google’s vision for AI-powered finance.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks to watch in September.
Carter Worth from Worth Charting said in a recent program on CNBC that Amazon is poised to see a rally. The analyst gave the example of Alphabet, which recently broke out after seeing declines, especially during the tariff-related selloff.
“And of course Google just now breaking out but something like Amazon has not,” Worth said. “So here for instance is a chart of what Google did. We know it drops about 30% during the tariff swoon, recovers to that level and then bang, right, a news related breakout, the gap up. Now take a look by contraction at Amazon. Amazon really is a laggard and that is either a problem or an opportunity. I think it’s the latter. It’s an opportunity. So a final chart of this particular effort—those arrows are a judgment, right? Someone else could say no, it’s poor relative strength, it’s not going to make the new high, but I think that it does, and so this would be just another one to join the general move above the pre-tariff sell-off. Highly, of course, Apple is not anywhere close, but every day another one seems to come to life, and I think Amazon is one that’s poised to do just that.”

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe concerns around AI-related threats to Google search are overstated. Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. As of April, Google had over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews.
Google’s competitor OpenAI failed to impress the market with its GPT-5 model, while Gemini is gaining traction with new features. Analysts believe the company is strongly positioned to start placing ads in AI search results, which means its core ads business will not be impacted despite the decline in traditional search.
Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is successfully executing on its vast AI potential. The company’s key advantages – stemming from industry-leading models, a full-stack approach to technical infrastructure (including proprietary chips), access to high-quality data, rapidly improving product launch velocity and a robust distribution ecosystem of seven different apps with over two billion users each – are beginning to meaningfully widen Google’s moat and competitive differentiation in AI."

NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rezolve Ai (NASDAQ: RZLV), a leader in proprietary AI-powered commerce solutions and a strategic partner of Microsoft and Google, today emphasized how it believes its strategy avoids common pitfalls that are bogging down many AI organizations. Recent articles* make clear that worldwide, AI companies are miscalculating scale and expenditures but, Rezolve believes that its architecture can deliver efficiently, with its leadership, operational structure, and focus on execution.
“The AI hype cycle has exposed many AI firms to ballooning costs, missed deadlines, and fragile infrastructures,” said Daniel M. Wagner, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Rezolve Ai. “Rezolve is built differently. We own our AI tech, we’re making hires who’ve scaled before, and we prioritize efficient, reliable delivery over blue sky promises. We believe that translates into lower risk, greater predictability, and real opportunity for our customers and investors.”
Lessons from the AI Industry
-
A recent LSE × Forbes article highlights that “scaling needs AI leadership, not just code” emphasizing that many firms lose money or suffer delays by focusing on tooling rather than strategic direction and market execution.
-
A survey reported in CFODive found that one in four firms overshoot their AI cost projections by 50% or more, which Rezolve believes indicates widespread under-investment in governance, cost controls, and reliable engineering discipline.
How Rezolve Performs Differently
Rezolve is designed to avoid those mistakes, and instead deliver disciplined, valuable AI commerce infrastructure:
-
Strong Leadership & Ownership: Rezolve owns its foundational AI, vision and semantic models; its leadership hires (including recent appointee Crispin Lowery) bring enterprise-level experience in scaling AI and retail systems.
-
Cost Predictability & Efficiency: Using proprietary models rather than renting third-party LLMs helps Rezolve control ongoing licensing or usage fees. Integrated architecture, lean model pipelines, and in-house innovations, like Visual Search and conversational commerce reduce overhead.
-
Execution Focused: Rezolve has already launched Visual Search, is advancing its Brain Commerce + Brain Checkout stack, and is actively building toward regulated payments/wallet infrastructure with Tether.
Investor Implications
-
In an era where many companies overspend on AI or fail to scale effectively, Rezolve’s approach is designed to provide comparative advantages aiming for lower risk, clearer cost structure, and stronger potential margins.
-
The AI sector is crowded; companies with strong leadership, cost management, and owned tech, such as Rezolve, are likely to outperform. Rezolve checks those boxes.
-
With ARR expected to exceed $100 million by the end of 2025, institutional support growing, and regulatory tailwinds in place, Rezolve believes that it is well-positioned for responsible growth and investor value."

-
Why would you look for human freelancers on Fiverr (FVRR -0.13%) or Upwork (UPWK -0.80%) when you can just ask ChatGPT to write a web page?
-
Google Search is great and all, but Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.13%) could surely deliver better answers to your questions with the Gemini large language model (LLM).
-
And human translators must be halfway to the unemployment office already, right? With automated translation services like Google Translate, you only have to click a button to make that legal document or user's guide available in Greek, Japanese, and Slovenian. The work is done by a neural network, auto-trained on public web data. Duolingo (DUOL 2.49%) should just shut down because nobody needs to practice actual language skills anymore. AI can just do it for you.
Those are the market-moving worries hanging over stocks like Duolingo and Fiverr. I get it -- change is scary.
It's not that simple, though. AI can help the very companies that seem to be under robotic attack.
Experts suggest (and I agree) that the machines still need lots of human hand-holding. As a result, one of Fiverr's best-performing businesses these days is humans providing AI management and instruction-writing services. Alphabet built a Gemini-based info-snippet tool into Google Search, and its system developers are always hard at work optimizing the underlying search algorithms.
Even AI needs a human touch, according to Fiverr
Speaking at an industry conference last week, Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman highlighted the need for humans in the AI industry.
""You need very high-skilled people that know how to use AI,"" he said. ""That portion of our business has been growing very nicely. You see some verticals mostly around technology, and marketing, workflow, agent development and so forth, growing 10x.""
Everybody wants to make the most of AI-based resources, Kaufman explained, but the machines absolutely require human handlers. AI platforms can do some impressive things these days, but the best results always involve a human touch along the way.
My Swedish perspective on AI's limits
The translation stuff is kind of personal to me. I've spent half my life in Florida but was born and raised in Sweden. I've seen moose and northern lights in the wild, you know. Translation is a side gig for me, adding a little pocket money and some variety to my daily routine.
AI tools are helpful but unbelievably far from perfect.
Even when the source and target languages are closely related, like my favorite pairing of Swedish and English, the best machine translation tools sound robotic and make lots of mistakes. There is often no ""right"" word or phrase but a choice of near-synonyms with subtle differences. The nuances can make a big difference in medical or legal documents, or in detailed instructions for using a high-tech gadget.
The choices you make at these incredibly common forks in the road will steer other sentences in specific directions. Any language is a creative system. Switching from one to another is a genuinely human effort. The machines just can't get the all-important nuances right -- yet.
The translation services that connect me to gigs rely on several layers of translation (possibly machine-assisted) and human reviews -- often done by several different translators. Some of their clients (my bosses' bosses) insist on human translation and will pay extra for a better result.
I mean, even the AI tools rely on original translations by human experts. It's a lot like ChatGPT or Gemini getting trained on large heaps of hand-typed documents. The neural networks need great examples of what a Swede would say in a particular situation, for instance.
The translation industry agrees: Robots need review
Falk Gottlob, chief product officer at the Smartcat translation platform, expects high-powered LLMs to become commodities over time. People and companies will prefer accuracy and trusted data flows over raw processing muscle.
""Generic translation engines trained on internet data may look powerful, but they consistently fail to meet enterprise realities like brand standards, compliance, and cultural nuance,"" Gottlob said in an emailed analysis. ""Based on our work with global enterprises at Smartcat, we've found that the most strategic approach integrates human expertise directly into AI workflows.""
Sure, you can run a fully automated workflow at Smartcat, simply pulling direct translation results from service providers like Google Translate or Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) Translator. But nobody wants that. Without human review, the paying client pretty much always ends up with a stiff, error-riddled, and practically useless translation. The real value in Smartcat (where ""cat"" stands for computer-aided translation) isn't its ability to deliver plain machine results but in facilitating the human analysis that follows.
I know things will get better over time, but this is not a new problem. Google Translate, for instance, is one of the best tools for this purpose, and it has been around since 2006. And it's still not nearly good enough.
AI helpers are just lifeless tools in human hands
When I look at AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and the neural network versions of Google Translate, I see exactly that -- tools, best used by a skilled artisan.
That's why translators still have jobs, adding value to Duolingo's services. It's why Fiverr and Upwork make money by helping humans help the machines. All of this may change if I ever get my hands on a human-like artificial general intelligence (AGI), but that's probably many decades away.
So I don't mind investing in Alphabet, Fiverr, or Duolingo while other investors see huge AI risks hovering around them. Stock discounts based on misunderstandings are always welcome.
Tack så mycket, börsen! (That's my spin on ""Thank you very much, Wall Street!"" in Swedish, but Google Translate won't quite agree.)"
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-17T12:25:00,"Quantum Computing Is the Missing Piece for AI, and These Stocks Could Benefit Most",The synergy between AI and quantum computing presents significant opportunities for this trio of companies.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4347a763940d0a6b6cec1fee745be08ea5fb7a294cbfad53af196c583a60644c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/quantum-computing-is-the-missing-piece-for-ai-and/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/quantum-computing-is-the-missing-piece-for-ai-and/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/quantum-computing-is-the-missing-piece-for-ai-and/,fool.com,200.0,,"Organizations and governments around the world are rushing to adopt artificial intelligence (AI). Yet downsides exist. AI requires massive computing capabilities and the accompanying energy to run those computers.
The current situation isn't sustainable over the long run. Google parent Alphabet is already sucking up so much power for its AI systems, it signed agreements with utility companies to cut electricity use during peak demand periods.
The solution to AI's needs could be quantum computing. This tech promises computational power that surpasses any classical computer on the planet, while consuming far less energy.
Several companies are working to apply quantum computers to AI, making them attractive stock investments. Three that could reap the greatest benefit from this are IBM (IBM 1.73%), Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), and pure-play quantum company IonQ (IONQ -5.85%).
IBM's quantum tech could turn a corner in 2026
IBM has been working on AI and quantum computing for years. In fact, Big Blue was the first to put a quantum computer in the cloud back in 2016. It owns Qiskit, the most widely used quantum software in the world, according to the company.
It also provided AI and the first quantum computer dedicated to healthcare research to the Cleveland Clinic in 2023. This collaboration showcases the synergy between quantum computing and AI.
IBM specializes in superconducting quantum computers, which benefit from using existing semiconductor chip processes. This makes the tech more scalable than other approaches, although it requires special cryogenic equipment.
But a key reason to consider IBM stock is because the company expects quantum advantage to arrive by the end of 2026. Quantum advantage marks the point when a quantum device surpasses classical computers in efficiently solving practical, real-world problems.
It's a significant step forward in the computing industry's transition to quantum machines. Until quantum advantage becomes a reality, classical computers remain a more efficient means of running AI systems.
IBM is also financially sound. In 2025, it expects more than $13.5 billion in free cash flow (FCF), up from 2024's $12.7 billion. FCF measures IBM's ability to pay its dividend while continuing to invest in cutting-edge technologies such as AI and quantum computers.
Nvidia's AI strategy is coming to quantum computing
Nvidia may be a market leader in AI semiconductor chips, but it's already looking toward the future with quantum computing. The company has a number of irons in the fire.
It developed a software platform, CUDA-Q, to help quantum computer users perform actions such as running simulations on quantum machines. The software builds on the successful CUDA program, which contributed to Nvidia becoming an AI powerhouse.
The company is also assembling a quantum research center to find solutions to quantum computing's shortcomings, such as addressing calculation errors. The center aims to bring together experts in the industry, including scientists at MIT.
But unlike IBM, Nvidia isn't constructing the quantum computer itself. It's bringing AI and accelerated computing tools to the quantum computing sector.
By taking this approach, Nvidia doesn't carry the high cost of manufacturing quantum computers. This is the same strategy it used to achieve AI success.
In addition, Nvidia is investing in businesses building quantum computers. It recently poured money into Quantinuum, a direct competitor of IonQ, since both employ atomic particles, called ions, to run their quantum machines. This bolsters Nvidia's quantum partnerships and expands the reach of its products.
Nvidia's enormous FCF gives it the deep pockets to invest in both AI and quantum computing. Through the first half of its 2026 fiscal year, ended July 27, the company produced $39.6 billion in FCF.
IonQ's high ambitions
IonQ has lofty aspirations for its quantum tech. The company's CEO, Niccolo de Masi, declared the ambitious goal of becoming the Nvidia of quantum computing.
IonQ has assembled an impressive array of quantum computing technology, starting with its own ion-based research, which allows its quantum computers to operate at room temperature, unlike IBM's tech.
IonQ accelerated its technological advancements through several acquisitions. Also, in a laboratory setting this year, it made strides marrying quantum machines with artificial intelligence to evolve AI models beyond the limits of classical computers.
Despite the technological advances, IonQ is not profitable. The company produced sales of $20.7 million in the second quarter, an increase over the prior year's $11.4 million, but its operating loss widened to $160.6 million from 2024's $48.9 million as costs associated with its acquisitions caused operating expenses to skyrocket.
Even so, IonQ is well funded. After an equity offering in July, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $1.6 billion on a pro forma basis.
IonQ's ion-based quantum computer, IBM's superconducting technology, and Nvidia's complementary offerings represent a comprehensive selection of stocks at the intersection of quantum computing and AI. All three are advancing more powerful, energy-efficient AI systems, and the implications of that could be revolutionary."

The stock popped in response to a highly ambitious five-year roadmap to grow Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) from around $10 billion in annual revenue to a staggering $144 billion.
If Oracle achieves this goal, OCI will surpass the current size of the leading three cloud giants by revenue -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.
On Thursday, a 6.2% decline in Oracle, paired with a 6% jump in Tesla, led to Ellison slipping $1 billion below Elon Musk on the billionaire leaderboard, according to Bloomberg. Regardless, Ellison is now in a virtual tie with Musk as the richest person in the world because of his massive stake in Oracle.
Here's why Ellison's ownership of Oracle is great news for long-term investors, and whether the growth stock is a buy now.
The billionaire throughline
A common theme among the world's richest people is that the primary source of their wealth is existing ownership in one company. With the exception of the three Walton children, who inherited large stakes in Walmart, the other nine people on the list of the 10 richest billionaires all played pivotal roles in growing a business, and still hold meaningful positions in those businesses.

Ellison is unique because he owns such a massive amount of Oracle, whereas other founders have decreased positions in their businesses over time. So even though Oracle isn't worth as much as other ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, or Nvidia, Ellison's massive stake can put a charge in his net worth when Oracle soars.
From a legacy stalwart to a cutting-edge AI play
Founder-led companies can be especially effective in the ever-changing technology sector. Ellison's large ownership stake and role as CTO make him heavily involved in Oracle's strategic direction.
Oracle has completely transformed its business model from a large database infrastructure and enterprise software model to a cloud computing giant. To pull it off, Oracle has had to invest a ton of capital, and fast, as the cloud computing race is highly competitive. Its capital expenditures (capex) have exploded higher -- outpacing revenue and earnings growth. So Oracle has taken on a considerable amount of debt to foot the bill.
Oracle is spending so much so quickly that its capex is now higher than its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Most of its capex is going toward building data centers. It's worth noting that capex doesn't even factor into Oracle's operating expenses with its existing businesses. This illustrates the extent of Oracle's leverage.
Oracle's spending is sky high and adds a considerable amount of risk to Oracle's investment thesis. With so much skin in the game, Ellison clearly saw this move as the right one for the long-term growth of the company. Ellison co-founded the company nearly 50 years ago in the late 1970s. So in this vein, Ellison's position is like Bill Gates still being a part of the top brass at Microsoft and having a massive stake in the company.
Oracle still has room to run
Ellison isn't calling all the shots at Oracle, but his large stake gives the company a level of credibility and a vote of confidence for individual investors interested in buying or holding the stock. If Ellison is putting his chips on the table and taking this big bet on cloud, then he must really believe it's the right long-term move, even if it takes a sledgehammer to Oracle's balance sheet and cash flow in the near term.
Wall Street was around. Oracle has nearly doubled in the last year and is up over 300% in the last three years. Investors often prefer capital-light, high-margin business models like those of Nvidia and Apple. Both companies design their products and outsource manufacturing, leading to high margins.

The $10 million Series A closed in just 14 days, with Google Ventures doubling down after first backing Blacksmith’s $3.5 million seed in May. At the time, Alphabet’s VC arm bet on the size of the market and the founding team, which included veterans of Cockroach Labs, another GV portfolio company. But for this round, GV was swayed by results.
Blacksmith, which offers a continuous integration and continuous delivery service for developers that complements GitHub actions, had pulled in hundreds of customers since May, and the boom in AI coding agents has blown the market wide open, co-founder and CEO Aditya Jayaprakash (pictured above on the left) said in an exclusive interview.
The San Francisco–based startup hit $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in February with just four people — Jayaprakash, co-founders Aayush Shah and Aditya Maru, and a product designer. Since then, revenue has reached $3.5 million ARR with more than 700 customers, supported by a team of eight, and the company is aiming to double that figure by year’s end, Jayaprakash told TechCrunch.
Founded in January 2024, Blacksmith was born from the experiences of its founders, who met at the University of Waterloo before building large-scale distributed systems at Faire and Cockroach Labs. There, they saw firsthand how costly and unpredictable the build and unit testing stages of software releases, known as continuous integration (CI), can be.
You would have to spin up hundreds of machines and burn through hundreds of hours of computing power just to test new code before shipping it, Jayaprakash said.
A typical software development process involves developers continuously pushing new code into repositories such as GitHub or AWS CodeCommit. To manage the testing and integration of that code, cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure all offer their own solutions — but these are often slower, costlier, or less predictable than teams need.
Unlike many rivals that rent generic cloud servers from cloud providers like AWS, Blacksmith’s service runs on high-performance, gaming-grade CPUs. The result, the startup says, is up to double the processing speed and lowering, by as much as 75%, compute costs. And because teams can switch by changing just a single line of code, they can start shipping faster within minutes."

Amazon Ads and Netflix recently announced a partnership that will make Netflix's ad-supported inventory available programmatically through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP) in more than a dozen major markets, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, and Brazil. For advertisers, this means one of the most premium sources of connected TV (CTV) inventory is now tied directly into Amazon's advertising ecosystem.
For The Trade Desk (TTD 0.73%), the independent DSP that has long positioned itself as the alternative to walled gardens like Google and Meta Platforms, the move raises both risks and opportunities.
Why Netflix Chose Amazon
Netflix has quickly grown its ad-supported tier, reaching more than 90 million global monthly active users across all ad-tier households. To fully monetize that audience, Netflix needs scale, targeting, and attribution tools that resonate with global advertisers.
Amazon brings exactly that strength. Its DSP is one of the largest in the world, fueled by first-party shopping and streaming data from Amazon.com, Prime Video, and Fire TV. For brands, that means they can target Netflix viewers with the same precision they already use across Amazon's ecosystem, while tying exposure directly to purchase behavior.
Operationally, Amazon gives Netflix plug-and-play infrastructure. It also leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to help advertisers run impactful digital ads campaigns with minimal effort, thanks to the automation of campaign planning, buying, and measurement. So, advertisers already allocating billions through Amazon Ads can now extend those campaigns onto Netflix inventory with minimal friction.
In short, partnering with Amazon should help Netflix quickly scale its advertising business.
What it means for The Trade Desk
Here's where the tension lies. The Trade Desk has also promoted partnerships with Netflix, Walt Disney, and Roku on curated supply access. Its pitch to advertisers is neutrality: unlike Amazon, it doesn't own content or compete in streaming, which helps ensure cross-platform transparency and measurement.
But Amazon's new Netflix deal strengthens its hand. With Netflix, Roku, and Disney inventory increasingly accessible through Amazon's DSP, The Trade Desk risks losing some of the premium authenticated CTV supply that has been central to its growth story.
Besides, Amazon has a closed-loop ecosystem that includes e-commerce, CTV hardware, and Prime Video, providing it with unmatched data for precise audience targeting. Combined with the consumer data from Netflix, it could deliver excellent return on advertising capital, rivaling (if not surpassing) that of The Trade Desk's platform.
The silver lining is that advertisers wary of Amazon's dominance may lean harder on The Trade Desk as a balancing force. Many global brands prefer to diversify demand across independent platforms rather than concentrate entirely inside one ecosystem. That gives the tech company a continued role, even if Amazon is now the more dominant gatekeeper for premium inventory.
The bigger picture
This partnership isn't just about Netflix. Amazon has been steadily expanding its CTV footprint:
- Roku: Earlier this year, Amazon Ads struck a deal to make Roku's authenticated inventory available on its DSP, covering more than 80 million U.S. households.
- Disney: Amazon has also partnered with Walt Disney's DRAX exchange, giving buyers access to premium Disney streaming content.
Together, these moves show Amazon's ambition to consolidate premium CTV supply into its advertising stack. For advertisers, this provides an additional option beyond existing DSPs for capital allocation. For publishers, it offers additional demand for their advertising industry. But for independent players like The Trade Desk, it raises the bar for them to remain competitive over the long term.
What does it mean for investors?
For investors, the Amazon-Netflix tie-up highlights a clear industry trend: Premium streaming inventory is becoming increasingly tied to large ecosystems with first-party data advantages. The Trade Desk still has unique strengths in neutrality, transparency, and cross-channel reach, but the competitive bar just moved higher.
If advertisers increasingly default to Amazon for CTV, The Trade Desk could face headwinds in maintaining its share of wallet. On the other hand, if buyers push back against platform dependency, The Trade Desk's neutrality could prove more valuable than ever.
Either way, the stakes in CTV just got higher. For investors in The Trade Desk, this isn't a reason to panic -- but it is a reason to keep a closer eye on how the competitive dynamics evolve."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-17T10:36:00,Prediction: This Underrated AI Stock Could Be the Next $3 Trillion Giant,AI is helping this tech giant clock a faster growth rate than the lucrative industry it operates in.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=43374e2a9d71cfc809c0a084a0a845d9e217c4faa032fd76a59a95608bc4e94e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/predict-underrated-ai-stock-next-3-trillion/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/predict-underrated-ai-stock-next-3-trillion/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/predict-underrated-ai-stock-next-3-trillion/,fool.com,200.0,,"There are now four companies in the world that are worth more than $3 trillion (Alphabet joined this list this week), and the fast-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has played a key role in helping all four exceed this benchmark.
Nvidia, the world's largest company, dominates the AI chip market. Meanwhile, Microsoft's tremendous revenue backlog created by the booming demand for its AI cloud and productivity services is one of the reasons why it is the second-biggest company in the world. Apple, the other name on the $3 trillion-plus market cap list, is also looking to capitalize on the proliferation of AI to supercharge its growth. Alphabet, like Microsoft, is a cloud computing player and digital advertising leader.
However, there is another big tech company that's winning big from AI adoption within its industry and could witness outstanding growth. Let's take a closer look at that name and check why it has the potential to enter the $3 trillion market cap club ahead of peers, including Amazon.
Digital advertising dominance is set to give this tech giant a major boost
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is the sixth-largest company in the world with a market cap of $1.9 trillion. It is known for its family of social media applications, including Instagram, Facebook, Threads, and WhatsApp, which have billions of users. This puts Meta in a terrific position to capitalize on the massive digital advertising market.
Grand View Research estimates that the digital ad market could generate $1.1 trillion in revenue in 2030. That would be a huge improvement over last year's revenue of $488 billion. Meta is taking advantage of AI to ensure that it can corner a nice chunk of this massive addressable opportunity on offer. It is using AI to drive stronger engagement across its apps, apart from giving advertisers access to AI tools so that they can improve audience targeting and create ad campaigns easily.
For instance, smaller advertisers can use Meta's generative AI creative tools to create and optimize ad campaigns for Facebook and Instagram, eliminating the need to hire a separate agency. Meanwhile, the AI-recommended content that's driving an increase in time spent on both Facebook and Instagram is another positive for advertisers since they have a chance to capture more eyeballs.
Additionally, Meta's AI advertising tools use real-time data from campaigns so that they can be optimized for better performance, helping advertisers reach a wider audience at lower costs. As mentioned in a company blog post citing a recent study conducted by Meta management: ""This study also assessed the impact of our new AI-driven advertising tools and found that they drive a 22% improvement in return on ad spend for advertisers. This means that for every dollar U.S. advertisers spend with Meta, they see a $4.52 return when they use our new AI-driven advertising tools.""
As such, it is easy to see why Meta is growing at a much faster pace than the digital ad market. Its second-quarter revenue increased 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. For comparison, the digital ad market is predicted to grow by almost 8% in 2025. Meta, therefore, seems to be capturing a bigger chunk of the lucrative digital advertising market. Not surprisingly, Meta expects massive growth in generative AI-fueled revenue, which will be enough to help it join the $3 trillion club.
Meta Platforms projects a massive spike in its AI revenue
In June last year, Meta management estimated that its AI revenue in 2025 could hit at least $2 billion (according to unsealed court documents). By 2035, the company estimates this figure to land between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion. That forecast points toward massive growth considering that Meta is expected to end 2025 with $196 billion in revenue.
But even if Meta's AI revenue lands at the midpoint of its guidance range after a decade, the company would see a massive spike in its top line that could send its market cap way beyond the $3 trillion mark in the long run. Importantly, analysts also updated their growth expectations, and that's not surprising considering the points discussed above.
But then, there is a good chance that the company will be able to outpace these expectations as it has the potential to keep growing at a faster pace than the 15% annual growth that the digital ad market is expected to clock. Assuming it can hit 20% revenue growth in 2026 and 2027, Meta's top line could jump to $282 billion after two years (using 2025's projected revenue of $196.1 billion as the base). If it maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could go past $3 trillion.
However, Meta could get to that milestone at a quicker pace. The market may reward it with a higher premium on account of its growing dominance in digital advertising."

IONQ, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Is IonQ the NVIDIA of Tomorrow, and Should You Buy the Stock?
The way NVIDIA Corp. benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom to become a $4 trillion behemoth, a smaller company, IonQ, Inc., is aiming to do the same by taking advantage of the next major tech wave – quantum computing. Can IonQ do it, and is the stock a buy now? Let’s find out –
Why Quantum Computing is Growing and Why IonQ Stands Out
Unlike traditional computing, quantum computing can inherently solve complex problems much faster, making it highly sought after for training AI models and revolutionizing drug discovery, to name a few. As a result, the global quantum computing market is projected to reach around $20.20 billion by 2030 from $3.52 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 41.8%, according to marketsandmarkets.
However, quantum computing has its own problems as well. Qubits can’t provide an exact 0 or 1 as an answer, and this leads to errors in calculation. But here is where IonQ steps in. It’s easily interconnected qubits boost computational accuracy. IonQ’s use of trapped ions is less error-prone than the man-made qubits that many of its competitors are utilizing. This trapped-ion method for quantum computing operates at room temperature, unlike other methods that require absolute zero, which curtails costs.
More Reasons to Be Bullish About IonQ
IonQ’s quantum-as-a-service (QaaS) model helps seamlessly integrate its systems into main cloud infrastructures, including Amazon.com, Inc.’s AWS, Microsoft Corp.’s Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s GCP. The company has also enhanced its presence in the quantum space by acquiring several companies, including Oxford Ionics, Lightsynq, Capella and partnering with Sweden’s Einride.
The Oxford Ionics acquisition was the recent one, as it got approved by the UK Investment Security Unit (“ISU”). This acquisition will help IonQ aim for 10,000 physical qubits with 99.99999% accuracy by 2027 and scale to 2 million qubits by 2030, citing investors.ionq.com. This means that the chances of errors in the future will be minuscule, which is vital for building comprehensive quantum computers."

September is the final month of the third quarter, which means that another slew of earnings reports will be headed our way soon. It also marks one of the final months before the proverbial ""holiday season,"" where businesses settle in to wrap up the year and prep for a new one.
Investors who own many of the top technology stocks have done quite well thanks to the continued artificial intelligence (AI) boom currently taking place.
While many top stocks have become a bit expensive, three names still represent enough value to make them strong buy recommendations for this month.
1. Alphabet
Tech giant and Google parent company, Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.13%), recently reached a new all-time high after it became apparent that the company wouldn't face any drastic penalties resulting from its high-profile antitrust litigation loss. That means no forced sale of Google Chrome or Android smartphone operating software, and it can still pay Apple to keep using Google as the iPhone's default search engine.
The resolved litigation removes a dark cloud over a company that, in most other aspects, is firing on all cylinders. Alphabet's cloud business is thriving on AI-fueled demand, and the company's AI application, Gemini, is thriving as one of the top apps on Apple's App Store. There are concerns that AI's ability to summarize and present information could divert users from Google's lucrative ad-fueled search engine business, but Google's revenue continues to grow. Meanwhile, the company's YouTube TV is growing in the streaming space, and there are additional long-term opportunities in quantum computing and self-driving vehicles.
All told, Alphabet currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24 times this year's estimated earnings, and Wall Street anticipates roughly 15% annualized earnings growth for the next three to five years. That arguably makes the stock a bargain for the expected growth, something that is getting harder to find in this market, let alone for one of the world's most prominent technology companies.
2. Netflix
Despite the stock market's success, many consumers continue to struggle financially. Even if people stay home more, Netflix (NFLX -1.10%), the world's largest streaming service, is likely to continue winning. Netflix has become a global streaming juggernaut, ending last year with over 301 million paid subscribers. The company made little money for years, but its continued subscriber growth eventually overtook its content spending. Now, Netflix is a cash cow with an impressive 24.7% net profit margin.
Netflix still appears to have a lot of growth left in its tank. The company's relatively new ad-supported membership is on pace to double Netflix's ad revenue this year. Also, Netflix is successfully pushing into live sporting events, streaming eye-catching content like boxing matches and National Football League games. These give Netflix a major draw as consumers continue a long-term trend of shifting from cable to streaming platforms.
Analysts estimate that Netflix will grow earnings by an average of almost 23% annually over the next three to five years. While the stock trades at 45 times its 2025 earnings estimates, a higher price tag than most stocks you'll find, such high growth expectations justify buying this proven streaming winner today and holding it for the years ahead.
3. The Trade Desk
The global advertising industry is worth approximately $1 trillion and is becoming increasingly digital as physical media like newspapers and magazines fade into the past. This trend has helped The Trade Desk (TTD 0.73%) become one of the world's leading ad-tech companies. Its platform allows brands to place digital ads on websites, apps, and other digital media, optimize them to their ideal target audience, and track and measure how their ads perform. It's an alternative to search engines and social media-massive digital ecosystems, but they come with little freedom or transparency.
Unlike the other two stocks above, The Trade Desk is reeling. Shares have fallen nearly 70% from their high. But considering that investors were paying over 200 times earnings to own the stock late last year, it makes a lot of sense that shares would crumble at the first sign of trouble. That trouble has arrived in the form of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook. Advertising is a sensitive industry; if brands feel that consumers don't have money to spend, they aren't going to advertise as much.
But the stock's valuation makes far more sense these days. The Trade Desk currently trades at just 25 times its estimated 2025 earnings. Historically speaking, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 over its lifetime. I like the odds of that continuing over the long run for buyers at these levels if The Trade Desk can deliver the 20% annualized earnings growth that Wall Street analysts expect over the next three to five years."

Microsoft has pledged its biggest ever investment in the UK with $30 billion (£22 billion) committed over the next four years.
Brad Smith, Microsoft’s vice chair & president said half the money would be dedicated to capital expenditure on the UK’s cloud and AI infrastructure.
It will include building the country’s largest supercomputer — with more than 23,000 NVIDIA GPUs — in partnership with Nscale.
The announcement is the latest in a series timed to coincide with President Trump’s second state visit to the UK.
Yesterday Google opened its data centre in Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, as part of a two-year £5 billion investment in the UK.
Today Smith said:”The relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States has long been more than a matter of diplomacy — it’s a friendship rooted in shared ideals and mutual ambition. Across generations, our countries have stood shoulder to shoulder — economically, politically, and in a shared pursuit of innovation. From the Atlantic Charter to the digital age, the UK and the US have pursued the power of partnership.
“Today, this alliance enters another new chapter, as we work together to expand access to trusted American technology and strengthen the infrastructure that will drive economic growth and technological advancement in the AI era.”
Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:“Microsoft’s landmark investment is a powerful vote of confidence in UK’s leadership in AI and cutting-edge technology.
“This commitment will not only strengthen our digital infrastructure and support thousands of highly skilled jobs, but also ensure Britain remains at the forefront of global innovation as we deliver on our Plan for Change.
“We are proud to partner with world-leading companies like Microsoft to build a future powered by British ingenuity and ambition.”

Microsoft said the capital investment “will also expand our datacenter footprint to meet growing AI demand and adoption from customers across every sector in the UK — from Barclays, the NHS, the London Stock Exchange Group, the Premier League, Vodafone, UK Met Office, Unilever, and Wayve – customers that are rapidly embracing AI to transform their businesses.
“Vodafone has expanded Microsoft Copilot to 68,000 employees worldwide after seeing productivity gains of four hours per week during its pilot. Barclays is rolling out Copilot to 100,000 colleagues and integrating it into its own tools to unlock insights and efficiency, while developers at the London Stock Exchange Group are using GitHub Copilot and Windows 365 to dramatically accelerate secure, trusted application development.”
The other half of the investment will go to supporting Microsoft’s ongoing operations across the UK, where it employs 6,000 people."

SINGAPORE, September 17, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ant International, a leading global provider of digital payments, digitisation, and financial technology, today announced its role as a launch partner of Google to develop Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), an open rulebook that defines how AI agents can reliably transact with the authorisation of users.
With the rise of agentic commerce, AI agents will increasingly transact on behalf of users for services, products, and even other agents. Existing payment systems are built around direct human interaction and cannot currently address the new requirements of authorization, verification, and interoperability among agents. To address this gap, Google has collaborated with the industry to introduce AP2.
AP2 defines the key components of agentic payments and provides a protocol to ensure user intent is verifiable, transactions are traceable, and accountability is clear for each participant across the payment lifecycle. Its design will also strengthen privacy and compatibility with diverse payment methods.
Ant International brings in extensive expertise in alternative payment methods (APMs) and its close ties with 36 leading digital wallets to develop an APM-based agent payments protocol for AP2.
Its contributions include streamlining the APM checkout process and applying AI to identify and block fraudulent transactions, which will serve as a practical reference for agentic payments. In addition, Ant International’s use of its unique payment mandate model to link transaction parameters with verifiable intent evidence will offer insights for protocols seeking to strengthen traceability, compliance, and dispute resolution.
Ant International is exploring real-world applications of AP2, where agents will coordinate to manage credentials, process payments, and deliver tailored promotions. Alipay+ Voyager, Ant International's built-in AI travel agent for digital wallet and super app users launched in July 2025, will introduce a new capability that can run on a multi-agent model under the Agent2Agent protocol, allowing sub-agents to book rides on ride-hailing platforms and process payments in full compliance with AP2.
""Ant International is excited to partner with Google to advance standards-setting in agentic payments, leveraging our expertise in APM payments and trusted AI innovations,"" said Jiangming Yang, Chief Innovation Officer of Ant International. ""We are committed to working with global partners to shape the future of agentic commerce, where AI agents serve as trusted assistants for discovery, engagement, and transactions, powering merchant growth and transforming consumer experience."""

Based on conversations with third-party checkout providers FastSpring and Paddle, the analysts have come to the conclusion that web checkout systems are enhancing profitability across the mobile ecosystem.
They further noted that even though the conversion rates dip slightly, it is still better than Apple’s higher fee structure. The trend benefits game developers and their advertising partners, as well as digital app companies such as Duolingo.
“Web checkout is set to improve profitability across the mobile ecosystem. We spoke with two third-party providers of website checkout (FastSpring and Paddle) and they both are seeing clients on average benefit by moving to website checkout as the ~10% reduction in conversion is more than made up for by reducing Apple’s 30% take rate to 5% (their elevated fee over Stripe pricing). We believe this is positive for game developers (and their downstream advertising partners including Meta (META, MO, PT $900), Google (GOOGL, MO, PT $250), and Unity (U, MO, PT $35) and for digital app businesses including Duolingo, Life360, Grindr, and Peloton (PTON, MP).”

The framework agreement, unveiled on Monday by senior US and Chinese officials after two days of talks in Madrid, would create a US-based version of the popular social media app. Oracle, venture capital firm Andreessen and Silver Lake will all hold stakes in the new venture, according to people familiar with the matter.
If finalized, a deal will resolve a sticking point in Beijing-Washington relations and help shape the fate of China’s most valuable private company — a $400 billion startup whose video product gained some 170 million mostly young American users before getting labeled a threat to national security.
Under an initial agreement, ByteDance Ltd.’s stake in TikTok would fall below 20% to satisfy a 2024 US law that required the Beijing-based company to divest or face a ban in the American market. Once finalized, the app’s users would migrate to a new platform, a person familiar with the contours of the deal said.
TikTok’s US engineers have been testing that app, which will replicate the recommendation algorithms that made the platform so popular in the first place, the person said. As part of the framework agreement, ByteDance will license the technology behind that, a Beijing official has said.
On the US end, the deal calls for Oracle to continue providing cloud services for TikTok, a business that’s become a steady source of revenue for the Austin-based company. Oracle already works with TikTok to host user data in the US and other countries as part of a multibillion-dollar partnership TikTok has dubbed Project Texas.
But many other unknowns persist — not least the price tag attached to one of ByteDance’s most lucrative businesses. The US operations have been valued at about $35 billion to $40 billion, though tech valuations have climbed rapidly with the advent of the AI boom.
It’s also unclear how much each prospective investor would acquire under the deal. Oracle, for instance, plans to take a small stake in the new venture, according to one of the people.
The US company’s shares rose as much as 5.9% in New York on Tuesday, before giving up most of those gains. The stock is up 84% so far this year thanks to its ascendant cloud infrastructure business.
A senior White House official said that any details of the framework agreement should be regarded as speculation unless announced by the administration. Representatives for TikTok, Oracle, Andreessen and Silver Lake didn’t respond to requests for comment.
More than a year in the making, a final deal will allow TikTok to remain operating for US users — though it deprives ByteDance of control of a key overseas asset, at a time it seeks users and traffic to drive broader endeavors in AI and commerce.
The law signed last year by then-President Joe Biden stipulates that ByteDance cannot have any operational role, including with the algorithm, once a sale is completed.
Under the agreement, new outside investors would own 50% of TikTok’s US business in a unit that would be spun off from ByteDance. Its existing US investors would own about 30% of the new business, cutting the Chinese firm’s stake to just below 20% and allowing it to meet the ownership requirements of the US security law.
The plan largely tracks with a proposal that had come close to an agreement with ByteDance earlier this year but was derailed when China withheld its approval following Trump’s decision in April to impose sweeping tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy.
TikTok’s future became entangled in the broader negotiations between Washington and Beijing over trade. Had there been no agreement on TikTok, any in-person meeting between Trump and Xi later this year would have been off the table, according to a US official.
On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he had “a deal on TikTok” with the Chinese as he departed the White House for a state visit to the UK, but declined to name the companies involved. “I’m going to speak to President Xi on Friday to confirm everything up,” he said. “We made a very good trade deal, and I hope good for both countries.”
Specific terms of the agreement, and whether it would satisfy the requirements of the national security law, remain unclear. But the will to challenge Trump legally or politically over his approach to TikTok has waned. The president has credited the app with boosting his popularity among younger voters and sealing his comeback election win in November.
To buy time for the transaction to be completed, Trump postponed the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US operations. Under the extension announced Tuesday — the fourth granted since January — the company has until Dec. 16 to forge a deal before a nationwide ban sets in.
Trump granted the reprieve even though the 2024 law allows for only one 90-day extension. That posture has defied bipartisan consensus behind the divest-or-ban provision — and has raised questions about whether the president’s repeated extensions have been legally sound.
Tuesday’s extension means TikTok can continue operating in the US while the administration takes more time to strike an accord with ByteDance on a “qualified divestiture” to a non-Chinese owner. Partners like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google can also continue hosting the popular video app in their online stores.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with CNBC that the deal was similar to the commercial terms that had been negotiated earlier in the year and indicated that he believed Trump and Xi would finalize the accord this week.
“This deal wouldn’t be done without proper safeguards for US national security,” Bessent said. “It seems as though we were also able to meet the Chinese interest.”

Microsoft announcing a major investment in the United Kingdom, just before President Trump is set to land in the UK for a state visit. Microsoft president and vice chair, Brad Smith, saying in a statement, the investment will total $30 billion over four years, saying it is the largest investment in the country ever. Half the investment is on building out the UK's cloud and AI infrastructure. Microsoft CEO Sati Nadella also speaking in a new video, saying the company is committed to creating new opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic. This announcement is the latest in a string of similar moves from American companies ahead of the president's trip. Alphabet just announced, you remember, a $6.8 billion investment on Monday.
Dan Howley, still with me. Dan, the Howley take on these headlines. What do you make of it?
Uh look, I think that, you know, one of the things that uh if you look at, we have the the Microsoft uh 30 billion, 15 billion going to capital expenditures, uh 23,000 advanced GPUs. Uh no real name there as to uh which ones they are, but they say they're working with N scale to to build them out. Uh it would be the largest uh supercomputer in the UK. Uh and I think, you know, one of the things to look at first and foremost is this isn't, you know, the first time a European country's gotten this kind of uh play when it comes to AI and companies looking to build out AI. France uh had their own conference where there was a lot of talk of building out their AI uh over the summer. The other thing is, obviously this is uh a race to see who could have released their their uh announcements first, either Google or Microsoft. Google with their uh 5 billion pound announcement, which works out to about $6.8 billion. Uh Microsoft coming later but just kind of dunking on them saying, oh, we got 30 billion. What's what's going on there? Um, and I I do think it also though speaks to how important it is to not just have AI business in the US, but to building it out globally. You got to think these things are just like regular data centers, right? You you need to connect, you need to connect at the speed of light. The further away something is, the more time it's going to take to get an answer. People in the UK want to get answers. They don't want to have to wait for something to come from Ohio. So they build them there. So we're going to see more of these buildouts across the globe and I think that this is just just the start of it.
All right, thank you, Dan. Appreciate it."

Google on Tuesday launched its Agent Payments Protocol, an open protocol that establishes a payment-agnostic framework for users, merchants and payments in agentic AI. Payment and technology firms such as Adyen, Alipay, American Express, Mastercard, PayPal and Worldpay
The protocol supports multiple payment types, including debit and credit card, stablecoins and real-time bank transfers.
""Innovation doesn't happen in isolation, it needs an ensemble of innovators. That's why we are collaborating in crafting an open standard to make the financial infrastructure of the world ready for agentic commerce,"" Andreu Mora, Adyen's senior vice president of engineering, told American Banker. ""This commitment to collaboration is how we ensure that as AI-driven commerce evolves, it works seamlessly for everyone.""
Agentic AI is an AI-powered virtual assistant that can act on behalf of a user autonomously, including, but not limited to, making a payment. Visa and Mastercard were some of the first to
One of the biggest hang ups with agentic payments is that consumers, merchants, financial institutions and payment processors all need to verify that the agent is who it says it is, that it is acting on behalf of the consumer, and that it has the authority to do so.
Google's AP2 protocol is designed to provide interoperable guidelines to how AI agents are authorized, authenticated and held accountable for their actions.
Agentic payments can happen in two modes, Rodri Touza, co-founder of Crossmint, told American Banker. Crossmint is a developer platform for wallets, stablecoins, and agentic commerce and a contributing partner to AP2.
""The first is full independence: an AI agent operates autonomously and makes payments all on its own based on parameters set by a user. The other is a specific task: You might say 'book me a flight' or 'order my usual groceries,' and the agent has to handle the payment in order to resolve that intent,"" Touza said.
The challenge is that payments weren't built for these kinds of functions. ""It's like if you handed your card to a friend: They could misuse it, buy the wrong thing, or get blocked by anti-fraud filters. That creates a poor user experience – and will dramatically slow adoption of AI agents,"" Touza said.
AP2 uses something it calls Mandates to verify authority and intent in both examples. Mandates are tamper-proof, cryptographically-signed digital contracts that serve as verifiable proof of a user's instructions,
On a one-off transaction for a specific task, the protocol captures an ""Intent Mandate"" such as, ""Find me a gold watch."" Once the agent finds the product, it presents that to the user, who then signs a ""Cart Mandate"" verifying the exact item and price.
For a more independent transaction, such as ""Buy Cubs tickets the moment they go on sale,"" the protocol captures both ""Intent Mandates"" and collects additional information about pricing, timing and other conditions that allow the AI agent to generate a ""Cart Mandate.""
""Google's new protocol provides a common language to delegate credentials, set boundaries, and create accountability,"" Touza said. ""That's what allows banks, card networks, and fintechs to treat agent-initiated payments with the same trust as a traditional card swipe. Once the rails are in place, agents can reliably pay for services, content, or even settle with other agents.""
For merchants, AI agents are smart distribution channels, Aurelie Guerrieri, chief marketing and alliances officer at DataDome, said in an email. DataDome is a bot and cyberfraud protection company.
""We're already hearing from merchants exploring how to dynamically recognize loyal customers and offer them early access to inventory or time-sensitive discounts,"" Guerrieri said. ""Others are piloting agent-to-agent price negotiations or using AI to instantly suggest alternate products when stock runs low. Google's launch of a protocol for agent-driven purchases is essential to enabling these experiences.""
But the guardrails AP2 sets up are just the beginning of a larger fight against fraud, Guerrieri said.
""An agent could leverage stolen credentials to access loyalty accounts, flood pricing [model context protocols] to identify and exploit inconsistencies, or even simulate purchase intent en masse to deplete inventory and block out legitimate buyers.,"" Guerrieri said. ""Identity verification won't be enough. It will be about assessing the intent of the agent, and correlating their behavior with what's expected by the business."""

Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to again provide more time to finalize the sale for the popular video-sharing app, following recent talks between US and Chinese negotiators that led to a framework agreement.
The president earlier Tuesday told reporters he had “a deal on TikTok” with the Chinese as he departed the White House for a state visit to the UK, but declined to name the companies involved. Trump is expected to speak on Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about the plan.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with CNBC that the deal was similar to the commercial terms that had been negotiated earlier in the year and indicated that he believed Trump and Xi would finalize the deal this week.
“This deal wouldn’t be done without proper safeguards for US national security,” Bessent said. “It seems as though we were also able to meet the Chinese interest.”
TikTok’s US operations would be controlled by a group including Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the deal.
CNBC reported earlier Tuesday that Oracle would keep the TikTok cloud contract under the framework being discussed, which could close in 30 to 45 days. Multiple versions of a solution involving Oracle remaining a technical partner to TikTok have been floated over the years.
Oracle shares rose as much as 5.9% in New York on Tuesday. The company’s stock is up 85% so far this year thanks to its ascendant cloud infrastructure business.
Trump’s executive order is the fourth extension he’s issued since a national security law that requires ByteDance to sell off TikTok’s US business took effect in January. Since that time, Trump has instructed the Justice Department not to enforce the law, or penalize other companies supporting TikTok.
Trump granted yet another reprieve even though the 2024 national security law allows for only one 90-day extension of the deadline. That posture has defied bipartisan consensus behind the divest-or-ban provision — and has raised questions about whether the president’s repeated extensions have been legally sound.
The terms of a new potential deal, and whether they would satisfy the requirements of the national security law, remain unclear but the will to challenge Trump legally or politically over his approach to TikTok has waned."

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ASTS. AST SpaceMobile, Inc.'s share was trading at $36.91 as of September 9th.
AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is pursuing the ambitious goal of enabling ordinary smartphones to connect directly to satellites, positioning itself as a disruptive player in the direct-to-device (D2D) space. The company has partnered with major carriers like AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, and Google, launched five production satellites, and demonstrated live video calls, aiming to deliver carrier-grade 4G/5G broadband from orbit.
Liquidity is strong, with $923.6M in cash against $505.6M of debt as of June 2025, giving it a runway of roughly 16 months at its current burn rate. However, ASTS remains essentially pre-revenue, reporting just $4.9M in trailing sales versus a $559M operating loss, reflecting heavy capex on constellation buildout. Despite a healthy balance sheet, the model is binary: success opens a multi-billion-dollar market, while delays risk dilution or worse.
Competition has intensified. SpaceX and T-Mobile have already launched text services, bolstered by EchoStar’s $17B spectrum deal, while Apple and Globalstar maintain a stronghold with SOS and messaging integration. Iridium remains profitable in niche satcom, and other startups are targeting regional opportunities. ASTS’s differentiation lies in its carrier-first model, standards-based compliance, and broadband ambitions, but execution speed is critical as Starlink leverages scale and Apple benefits from ecosystem lock-in.
Valuation reflects optionality rather than fundamentals. With a ~$9–10B market cap against negligible revenue, the stock trades as a venture bet on timely execution. If ASTS can meet its launch cadence of 1–2 satellites per month and demonstrate meaningful revenue by 2026, upside could be substantial. But with shares trading at option-like multiples, the risk/reward is finely balanced, leaving little margin for delays.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (ASTS) by Steve Wagner in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s strong funding position, expanding telecom and government contracts, and successful satellite-to-smartphone connectivity. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 40.66% since our coverage. This is because the thesis partially played out. The thesis still stands as ASTS approaches commercial deployment in late 2025. Steve Wagner shares an identical view."

Google announced Tuesday that it has added stablecoin support to its new payment framework, designed to allow seamless transactions between AI applications.
According to a September 16 Fortune report, Google’s new AI payment protocol supports both stablecoins and conventional payment methods, including credit and debit cards.
For stablecoin integration, Fortune reported that Google partnered with crypto exchange Coinbase, which operates its own AI and crypto payment platform.
Google Stablecoin Support Set to Trigger a ‘Ground-Up’ Payment Shift
The tech giant also worked with other blockchain companies, including the Ethereum Foundation.
Beyond crypto partnerships, Google consulted over 60 organizations for other aspects of the payment protocol, including Salesforce, American Express, and Etsy.
“We built this from the ground up to incorporate both legacy and existing payment infrastructure capabilities alongside emerging features like stablecoins,” James Tromans, head of Web3 at Google Cloud, told Fortune.
Google stated that the stablecoin integration initiative stemmed partly from the rise of AI “agents.”
Tech industry leaders anticipate that AI systems will increasingly interact directly with other AI systems, eliminating human intermediaries in many transactions.
The newly launched payment protocol ensures that transactions between AI agents remain safe, secure, and aligned with human intentions, according to Tromans.
Google stands among the more vocal Big Tech companies expressing interest in stablecoins, one of the most active sectors in crypto and Silicon Valley, particularly amid a more crypto-friendly presidential administration in the U.S.
In June, Cryptonews reported that Apple, X, and Airbnb were engaged in preliminary discussions with crypto firms about integrating stablecoins into their payment infrastructure.
The report indicated that Stripe, Worldpay, and other processors were approached to provide back-end support for stablecoin settlements.
In August, Google Cloud was reportedly progressing in the development of Layer-1 blockchain, the Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL), designed for financial institutions to support tokenized assets, settlements, and Python-based smart contracts.
“Biggest Upgrade Since SWIFT”: Google Already Accepting Stablecoin Payments
Google Cloud currently accepts stablecoin payments from select clients using PayPal’s PYUSD, according to Rich Widmann, head of Web3 strategy at Google Cloud.
“Stablecoins represent probably one of the most important payment upgrades since the SWIFT network,” said Widmann.
A comprehensive report shared with Cryptonews shows that stablecoins can process payments up to 13 times cheaper than traditional banks while settling within seconds.
The report positions them as a “new financial operating system” that eliminates intermediaries and transforms global value exchange.
Stablecoins are projected to handle $1 trillion in annual payment volume by 2030 and could constitute 10% of the U.S. money supply.
The stablecoin market has grown from $4 billion in 2020 to over $280 billion today, with monthly settlement volumes reaching $1.39 trillion in the first half of 2025.
Major stablecoin issuers now rank 17th globally in U.S. Treasury holdings, exceeding countries like South Korea, Germany, and Saudi Arabia in their influence on government debt markets.
However, the Bank Policy Institute, joined by the American Bankers Association and other groups, is looking to interrupt the stablecoin growth
The groups recently urged the U.S. Congress to strengthen GENIUS Act regulations, warning that regulatory gaps could allow stablecoin issuers to offer yields that might trigger $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from traditional banks.
The banks contend that stablecoin yield programs could increase “deposit flight risk” during economic stress, resulting in tighter credit conditions and higher borrowing costs.
However, Coinbase has published a detailed response to banking industry assertions, calling the “deposit erosion” narrative a “myth” designed to protect banks’ $187 billion annual payment processing revenue stream.
The company argues that most stablecoin activity occurs internationally, strengthening the U.S. dollar’s global position without materially impacting domestic deposits.

- Google launched an open-source protocol to let AI agents handle financial transactions, backed by Coinbase, PayPal, American Express, and the Ethereum Foundation.
- The protocol expands Google’s Agent2Agent framework with payment support for cards, stablecoins, and real-time bank transfers, plus a crypto-specific x402 extension.
- The Ethereum Foundation says the effort aligns with its ERC-8004 standard to help AI agents securely discover, verify, and transact on Ethereum.
Google took its latest step Tuesday to hasten the arrival of the AI agent economy, announcing the creation of an open-source protocol for agent payments backed by some of crypto’s biggest companies.
The Agent Payments protocol revealed today can be used as an extension of Google’s previously released Agent2Agent protocol, which attempted to create a standard for interactions between AI agents—automated assistants authorized to zip around the internet completing complex tasks on behalf of humans or organizations.
Today’s announced protocol adds the crucial ingredient of payments to that mix, with the goal of enabling AI agents to seamlessly complete financial transactions with users, merchants, and payments providers.
Announcing Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), an open, shared protocol that provides a common language for secure, compliant transactions between agents and merchants.
AP2 can be used as an extension of the A2A protocol and MCP. Learn how it works ↓ https://t.co/RBFzpU2qUI
— Google Cloud Tech (@GoogleCloudTech) September 16, 2025
It is backed both by crypto mainstays like Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation, as well as traditional payments giants and vendors including PayPal, American Express, and Etsy. Other crypto firms supporting the initiative include Sui creator Mysten Labs, prominent crypto wallet MetaMask, and Eigen Labs, the firm behind Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer.
(Disclaimer: MetaMask is a product of Consensys, one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)
Google said Tuesday its new protocol represents an effort to create a platform- and currency-agnostic “common language for secure, compliant transactions between agents and merchants.” It will support credit and debit card transactions, stablecoins, and real-time bank transfers.
To accelerate the adoption of other digital assets in its AI agent framework, Google has also launched a crypto-specific extension for its Agent2Agent protocol, dubbed x402.
The Ethereum Foundation was one of numerous crypto organizations that contributed to the x402 extension, which it says will complement its own efforts to make Ethereum the bedrock of the booming AI agent economy. The Ethereum Foundation is currently finalizing ERC-8004, a standard for agents to discover, verify, and transact with each other on the network, which was backed by members of Google’s Agent2Agent team.
“ERC-8004 will support many forms of payments, but having the x402 extension helps the developer experience,” Davide Crapis, head of the Ethereum Foundation’s newly announced AI team, told Decrypt. “Beyond the ERC, x402 is getting adoption, so this extension opens up a new avenue for agents built on crypto rails.”
Crapis added that today’s announcement from Google is aligned with his team’s goal of creating better infrastructure for agentic interaction on Ethereum.
“It’s exciting to see the idea of agents paying each other resonate with the broader AI community,” Erik Reppel, head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform, said Tuesday in a statement. “Bringing x402 into AP2 to power stablecoin payments made sense—it’s a natural playground for agents to start transacting with each other and testing out crypto rails.”"

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the segment delivered $29.9 billion in revenues, up 26% year over year, while Azure and other cloud services rallied 39%, well ahead of estimates. This growth was driven by strong enterprise demand and the rapid adoption of AI workloads across Microsoft’s cloud ecosystem.
Recent innovations further strengthen this trajectory. The rollout of GPT-5 across Azure AI Foundry and Copilot, the opening of a new datacenter region in Austria, and enhancements to Microsoft Fabric for AI readiness all reinforce Microsoft’s ability to capture rising AI demand.
AI continues to be the primary growth engine. Azure continues to see strong demand for AI infrastructure, while GitHub Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption highlight how AI and cloud are converging into sticky, revenue-generating productivity tools. These developments deepen customer engagement and reinforce Microsoft’s competitive moat, giving investors strong confidence in continued upside.
Looking ahead, management guided Intelligent Cloud revenues of $30.1-$30.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, signaling continued strength. According to the Zacks model, Intelligent Cloud revenues are projected to rise 20.7% in fiscal 2026 and 21.2% in fiscal 2027, supporting a durable long-term outlook.
Microsoft’s confidence is also evident in its record $24.2 billion in capital expenditures, with plans to raise this to $30 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 to expand AI infrastructure and data centers. With deep AI investments, strategic partnerships and strong enterprise adoption, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud is well-positioned to deliver consistent upside and cement leadership in the AI-powered cloud era.
Microsoft Faces Rising Cloud Competition
Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the cloud market with 30-32% share, unmatched scale, 200-plus services and a massive $100 billion in annual infrastructure spend. Still, Amazon trails Microsoft Azure in enterprise and hybrid adoption. Although Amazon’s breadth and legacy remain powerful strengths, surging innovation from Microsoft and Google is eroding AWS’ edge, raising questions about its ability to defend long-term leadership in the fast-shifting cloud and AI race.
Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform is rapidly gaining ground, posting 32% annual growth and $13.6 billion in quarterly revenues in the second quarter of 2025. Fueled by AI infrastructure demand, Google Cloud leverages TPUs, Vertex AI and Gemini to strengthen its competitive edge. Partnerships with leaders like NVIDIA and PayPal are accelerating enterprise adoption. With expanding global data centers and robust security, Google Cloud is positioning itself as a serious rival to Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS in the evolving cloud market."

It follows the release of industrial and retail data in the US.
The Fed started its two-day key policy meeting on Tuesday, AFP reported, hours after Stephen Miran narrowly won confirmation to join the central bank.
Stephen Miran, who has been a key advisor to US President Donald Trump, took the oath of office as a Fed governor on Tuesday after narrowly winning a senate vote on Monday night to become one of the FOMC’s 12 voting members.
It remains to be seen if he will push for larger rate cuts as the US president has repeatedly demanded, with markets widely expecting a 25 basis points cut at the end of discussions on Wednesday.
The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) index closed down 81.37 points, 0.9%, at 9,195.66.
The FTSE 250 (^FTMC) ended down 154.72 points, 0.7%, at 21,491.87, and the AIM All-Share (^FTAI) closed up 0.48 points, 0.1%, at 767.87.
“A barrage of US companies are expected to announce big investments in the UK to coincide with Donald Trump’s state visit,” said AJ Bell’s Russ Mould.
“Google-owner Alphabet (GOOG) is the latest name in the frame, with news it will spend £5 billion in the UK on AI-related infrastructure investments and scientific research… (but) the expected wave of US investment wasn’t enough to lift the UK stock market.
“The FTSE 100 gets more than two-thirds of its earnings from overseas, so even policies that can potentially boost growth domestically may not have the impact on the constituents of the UK’s leading stock market index that some might expect.”
Anglo American (AAL.L), on the FTSE 100, gained 0.6%.
The miner has formally completed its copper tie-up with the Chilean state-owned mining company Codelco.
It comes after the two companies back in February this year signed a memorandum of understanding for a framework to implement a joint mine plan for their adjacent copper mines of Los Bronces and Andina in Chile.
Student accommodation provider Unite Group (UTG.L) lost 1.7%.
The UK Competition & Markets Authority has invited comments on Unite’s proposed acquisition of Empiric Student Property, in the first step ahead of a potential formal investigation into the deal.
Empiric (ESP.L), whose shareholders are set to own 10% of the combined firm if the deal goes ahead, was down 1.1% on the FTSE 250 (^FTMC).
Also on the FTSE 250, Pollen Street Group (POLN.L) closed 3.0% higher.
The London-based asset manager said it was encouraged by growing demand for mid-market alternatives and asset-based lending, as it announced first-half pre-tax profit growing 28% annually to £29.6 million while total income climbed 17% to £63.8 million."

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) has unveiled a 5 billion ($6.8 billion) investment plan aimed at transforming the UK into a key outpost for its global AI operations. The spending will stretch across a two-year timeline and support projects ranging from scientific and health care research to bolstering DeepMind, Google's London-based AI lab. Part of the funds will also go toward building out a previously announced $1 billion data center in Waltham Cross, designed to handle surging demand for core services like Search and Maps. While significant, the UK package remains a small slice of Alphabet's broader capex roadmap, which is projected to reach $92.6 billion in 2026, according to Bloomberg estimates.
The timing of the announcement appears tightly coordinated with US President Donald Trump's visit to the UK this week, where he is expected to finalize a string of tech-heavy economic agreements. Accompanying him are Nvidia's Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Sam Altmanboth reportedly planning fresh commitments worth billions of dollars toward British data center expansion. Trump's team is also negotiating a streamlined bilateral framework to speed up the construction of nuclear power infrastructure, signaling a wider push to deepen US-UK collaboration in high-value sectors.
The UK's ruling Labour Party has been leaning heavily into AI as a central pillar of its growth strategy, although industry leaders have raised concerns about domestic tax policies potentially stifling local innovation. Even so, Google's capital injectionpaired with upcoming pledges from Nvidia and OpenAIcould be positioning the UK as a strategic midpoint between Silicon Valley's AI ambitions and Washington's geopolitical calculus. For investors, the convergence of deep-pocketed US tech firms and White House diplomacy may point to a long-term buildout cycle in British AI and energy infrastructure."

finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-16T16:40:42,Why Magnite (MGNI) Shares Are Trading Lower Today,Shares of digital advertising platform Magnite (NASDAQ:MGNI) fell 5.2% in the morning session after the company announced it had filed a lawsuit against Google for alleged anticompetitive practices.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c6d608cc998f99265b6af8d003f22b898459d27091ddd1246774e290ef044cd0,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-magnite-mgni-shares-trading-154042082.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-magnite-mgni-shares-trading-154042082.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-magnite-mgni-shares-trading-154042082.html,yahoo.com,200.0,,"What Happened?
Shares of digital advertising platform Magnite (NASDAQ:MGNI) fell 5.2% in the morning session after the company announced it had filed a lawsuit against Google for alleged anticompetitive practices.
The lawsuit seeks financial damages, citing an April 2025 U.S. District Court ruling which found Google had willfully engaged in anticompetitive acts to maintain a monopoly in the ad exchange and server markets. Magnite’s complaint alleges that Google's exclusionary scheme locked publishers into its ad server and favored its own exchange. According to the company, this conduct deprived Magnite and other independent players of the opportunity to compete fairly, harming their businesses. The legal battle against a tech giant introduces significant uncertainty and potential costs, which appeared to weigh on investor sentiment.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Magnite? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Magnite’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 33 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 4% on the news that markets pulled back, reversing early gains, as investor sentiment remained cautious despite a softer-than-expected inflation reading.
Stocks rose in the morning session after an unexpected drop in the Producer Price Index (PPI) for August signaled easing inflation and raised expectations for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the PPI, which measures wholesale prices, edged down 0.1% last month, contrary to analyst expectations for a 0.3% rise. This data gives the Federal Reserve more flexibility to consider lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.
Magnite is up 38.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $22.30 per share, it is still trading 15.9% below its 52-week high of $26.52 from August 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Magnite’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,477.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

LSEG data shows that U.S. corporations have sold a record $100 billion in euro-denominated bonds this year, up from $78 billion in all of 2024. Companies are taking advantage of decreasing expenses and moving away from the dollar.
Non-financial issuers have been behind the ""reverse Yankees"" trend, which has seen them sell about 50 billion euros in debt this year, a 32% increase from last year. Issuance from financial corporations almost increased to 35 billion euros.
There has been a lot of demand from investors, which has pushed the U.S. proportion in euro corporate bond ETFs up to about 19%. Analysts think that issuance will keep going as long as the currency is weak and financial conditions in Europe are good."

Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Ralph Lauren, Dave and Buster's, and Alphabet.
First up, Ralph Lauren, the company unveiling its long-term financial outlook at its investor day, and investors don't seem that pleased. The fashion house sees revenue growth remaining similar to recent rates over the next three years. It's projecting sales to grow at a mid-single digit percentage annually through fiscal 2028. That is roughly in line with estimates from analysts, but it's slower growth than the company has posted in recent quarters. That said, Ralph Lauren does plan to return at least $2 billion to shareholders through fiscal 2028. The shares down about 2.3%.
Next up, Dave and Buster's. Those shares are sinking after the restaurant operator reported disappointing earnings results. Adjusted earnings per share and revenue for the second quarter came in well below the average analyst estimate. Shares are now poised for their biggest drop of the year. They're down 17%. But Jeffrey's analyst, Andy Barrish did highlight the company's new CEO has a back-to-basics strategy that has shown some early signs of stabilizing the business.
And finally Alphabet, the parent company of Google unveiling a $6.8 billion investment in the United Kingdom focused on AI. The tech giant disclosed the plan just as President Trump is set to announce billions of dollars of economic deals during his visit to the United Kingdom. Part of the investment will go toward advanced computing hardware for a billion- dollar data center. That center will help meet growing demand for Google services including search and maps. That's all according to its statement. The shares right now are down a third of 1%. Remember yesterday they were at a record as Alphabet breached the $3 trillion market cap level.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the 12 Jim Cramer Stock Picks this Week.
The company unveiled its iPhone 17 lineup, following a favorable court ruling, and garnered Cramer’s attention.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recorded revenue of $94 billion, up 10% year-over-year, in the third quarter of 2025. The iPhone revenue went up by 13% year-over-year, owing to the popularity of the iPhone 16 family. Recently, on September 9, 2025, the company unveiled its new iPhone 17 lineup, including the ultra-thin iPhone Air, new smartwatches, and upgraded AirPods, kindling consumer interest.
However, the positive outlook for the company is heavily attributed to a court ruling on September 2, 2025. The ruling favored Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) significantly as it prevented a forced divestiture of core assets. Calling it his quarterback stock pick, Jim Cramer pointed to the company’s favorable relationship with the Trump administration, its lucrative deal with Google, and growing sales as positive signs.
The company, with 156 hedge funds holding ownership stakes, is strongly backed by institutional interest, which magnifies its positive outlook.
The multinational technology company, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was founded in 1976. Headquartered in California, the company is a global leader in consumer electronics and known for pioneering products like the iPhone, Mac, and iPad, as well as its software and services.
While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Google crossing that 3 trillion dollar market cap uh figure. Does that does that excite you and when a company hits these big round numbers, what what's the message there?
I mean, I I think it's fun, right? It's a nice headline. Congratulations to all the Google investors who hopefully are doing very well. I think the headline there is that the AI enthusiasm led rally continues, right? We we got a very favorable court ruling for Google and Apple last week, which helped continue this momentum, but it really was the the few weeks before that too. Oracle posted very strong backlog as we know, before that, Broadcom posted really good guidance. So the whole AI story still has legs and I don't think there's any reason that an investor should exclude Google from their AI tech basket. Yes, it's not so much on the infrastructure side like a semiconductor company, but with Gemini and with the the advancements they've been able to make in optimizing search and advertising, I think Google belongs and I think this just tells us more broadly, tech is still the market leader until it isn't.
Tom, you think Amazon's next?
I do. I think that that the CAPEX boom we are seeing and this is really for investors, the key with AI is watching capital expenditures, which is the really fancy term for companies spending lots of money on investment in infrastructure and other things. The CAPEX boom is spreading throughout the economy. I think Amazon is in a great place with all their cloud infrastructure through AWS. I think they continue to be a winner.
Uh, is there another company, Tom, that could uh join Nvidia over a $4 trillion dollar market cap? Or at this point, I mean this is Nvidia's territory, they should be isolated on on an island by themselves.
I think I think that's fair enough. You know, certainly I would look to some of the other large cap tech companies like a Microsoft. Uh Apple is sort of an interesting candidate because they've been so late to the party but have recently rebounded. If all of a sudden people begin to believe there's an AI story with Apple who has been very restrained in the AI race or restrained or unsuccessful depending on your opinion, then they can play catchup as well. But I think stick with these these mega cap tech stocks, the momentum is still in their favor and so are the facts."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-16T14:53:00,3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,"Investors have witnessed record gains throughout the AI revolution, but which stocks are truly worth holding onto for the long-term?",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d39702f2cfb603eeab68d0ebd792c30b61379718a5f946f2352f9750232bb7bf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/3-top-ai-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-forever/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/3-top-ai-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-forever/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/3-top-ai-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-forever/,fool.com,200.0,,"There's no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have delivered abnormally high returns for investors in recent years. The real question isn't whether AI is worth investing in -- it's which companies navigating this fast-paced landscape are durable enough to hold for the long haul.
Below, I'll highlight three of my top AI stocks to buy and hold forever and explain why they deserve a permanent spot in your portfolio today.
1. The semiconductor king: Nvidia
Throughout the AI revolution, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has emerged as arguably the most influential player. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone for training and deploying generative AI models. Layered on top of that hardware is CUDA, Nvidia's software architecture that enables programmers to develop applications on top of its chips.
This combination of hardware and software has created a powerful technological moat for Nvidia -- one that competitors have struggled to replicate despite their best efforts.
As AI models become more complex and expand into use cases across robotics, quantum computing, and autonomous systems, the demand for greater inference power will accelerate. Nvidia's long track record of innovation positions it well to address these challenges and scale up alongside its big tech counterparts as they introduce more sophisticated AI applications down the road.
With hyperscalers showing no signs of slowing their infrastructure investment, there's good reason to remain confident that Nvidia's best days are still ahead.
2. The underrated ecosystem: Alphabet
Back in 2015, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai outlined his vision to transform Google and its many businesses into an AI-first platform. Nearly a decade later, investors can clearly see how those early ambitions have materialized.
Alphabet has embedded AI across virtually every layer of its ecosystem, in advertising, search tools, cloud services, consumer applications, and cybersecurity. Two of the most underrated assets within this ecosystem are DeepMind, Google's AI research lab, and its custom tensor processing units (TPUs).
These chips are the computational backbone for training and running large language models (LLMs), giving Alphabet a unique structural advantage as it tests and scales up its own AI capabilities across Gemini and physical infrastructure.
Some on Wall Street even suggest that Google's TPU division could be worth $900 billion -- underscoring just how significant this hardware could be in unlocking future value for Alphabet as well as providing a path to compete more directly with Nvidia.
3. The bridge connecting software and physical infrastructure: Amazon
Amazon's AI story is unique because it bridges the gap between digital and physical infrastructure. On the software side, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has forged a strategic partnership with OpenAI rival Anthropic, a leading AI start-up now valued at $183 billion.
Anthropic is deeply integrated into AWS -- developing its models on Amazon's custom Trainium and Inferentia chips while also expanding the capabilities of Amazon Bedrock. Through this alliance, AWS customers gain access to Claude, Anthropic's highly capable alternative to ChatGPT.
On the e-commerce side, Amazon has been vocal about its ambitions to outfit warehouses with AI-powered robotics. While the up-front cost will be high, the long-term payoff could be transformative -- potentially expanding operating profits by billions of dollars thanks to unprecedented labor efficiencies.
The common thread stitching these monster AI stocks together
Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon each demonstrate how deliberate capital allocation can create a compounding effect that extends far beyond the initial investment. These tech titans aren't just building proprietary systems, they are developing platforms through which technological breakthroughs reinforce and integrate with one another more deeply.
The result is accelerated revenue growth across various end markets paired with widening profit margins and durable, resilient cash flow generation.
In a fiercely competitive and evolving AI landscape, this ability to turn investments into lucrative feedback loops is precisely what sets these businesses apart and why I view them as compelling long-term buys."
finnhub,GOOGL,2025-09-15T23:53:43,Nano Banana Saves Google: Gemini Dethrones ChatGPT as GOOG Hits $3 Trillion,"The Gemini AI app hit #1 in app stores, and now Google is the fourth-most valuable company in the world.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=321d651d9bed456fe0fd70c67a91d63aa827c6ff82f27acbf33a938c1cd2dccc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://decrypt.co/339563/nano-banana-google-gemini-dethrones-chatgpt,https://decrypt.co/339563/nano-banana-google-gemini-dethrones-chatgpt,https://decrypt.co/339563/nano-banana-google-gemini-dethrones-chatgpt,decrypt.co,200.0,,"Google's Gemini app hit the top of the Apple App Store on September 15, dethroning ChatGPT for the first time since OpenAI's chatbot launched nearly three years ago. The catalyst wasn't a breakthrough in artificial general intelligence or some new reasoning mode—after all, Gemini 2.5 was released in March—it seems to be the public’s thirst for making memes and editing images.
""Image editing is one of the most popular use cases for Nano Banana,"" the company tweeted last week. While Google didn't provide any specific reasons for its come-from-behind surge in popularity, given the timing, it's safe to assume that Nano Banana gave the company a huge bump.
One specific prompt for Google’s new image editing model let users transform photos into 3D collectible-style portraits complete with plastic packaging and display bases. That was enough to make the Gemini have its “wen moon” moment.
Within two weeks of going viral in early September, Gemini hit #1 on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store globally. The app added 23 million first-time users and users generated over half a billion images in days, according to Google’s VP Josh Woodward.
Update: In the last 4 days, @GeminiApp has added: + 13M more first-time users (23M+ total now) + 300M more images (500M+ total now)
Google Trends data shows global searches for Gemini overtook ChatGPT on September 12—the first time that's happened since ChatGPT's November 2022 debut.
Before Nano Banana, Gemini pulled in about 13 million monthly downloads compared to ChatGPT's 64 million, according to AppMagic. ChatGPT commanded 60% of AI-related web traffic with nearly 6 billion monthly visits, almost 10 times Gemini's numbers despite being integrated into Android devices and Google services used by 2 billion people.
The surge helped push Alphabet's market cap past $3 trillion, with shares climbing 4% to around $252. That puts Google's parent company in rarefied air alongside Nvidia ($4.3 trillion), Microsoft ($3.8 trillion), and Apple ($3.5 trillion).
Alphabet's stock has climbed nearly 30% year-to-date, outpacing the Nasdaq's 15% gain. The September milestone came after a favorable antitrust ruling that avoided forcing Google to divest Chrome or Android. But the Nano Banana phenomenon contributed directly to investor enthusiasm. Analysts project the feature could help Google increase its revenue through new Gemini subscriptions.
""If Gemini can remain at the top of the App Store charts, we believe more investors will start to view Gemini as a strong core offering with incremental use cases that complement (as opposed to cannibalize) the core search experience,"" Keybanc Capital analyst Justin Patterson wrote in a report.
OpenAI learned this lesson months ago. Its ""Ghiblify"" feature—which transformed photos into Studio Ghibli-style animations—drove more than 1 million people to sign up for ChatGPT in one hour. The feature went so viral that OpenAI had to implement rate limits after users generated millions of whimsical portraits, even recreating controversial moments like the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the Ghibli style.
xAI discovered the same dynamic with Grok, though Elon Musk's company took a different approach. When Grok users found they could generate anime-style ""waifus"" without the content restrictions other AIs imposed, downloads spiked 300% in Asian markets. Musk himself posted several generated images on X, alongside a “spicy mode” that let users generate NSFW videos using Grok’s AI
Vibes have shifted fully. Gemini has overtaken ChatGPT on the AppStore rankings and now worldwide in Search Interest as well.
It's a no-brainer that image editing is the sole reason for this. Nano banana has rescued Google in the AI race!
ChatGPT still dominates on raw metrics—700 million weekly active users and over 1 billion daily queries in the last quarter, but Gemini's sudden rise shows how quickly the landscape can shift when an AI feature catches fire on social media.
Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis tweeted: ""Congrats to the @GeminiApp team... this is just the start.""
Made it to no.1 in the App Store. Congrats to the @GeminiApp team for all their hard work, and this is just the start, so much more to come! https://t.co/GbSDPX64mY"

On Sept. 2, U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta outlined softer-than-feared remedies for his year-ago ruling that Google maintained an illegal monopoly in search. The DOJ had proposed stronger remedies, including that Alphabet-owned Google be forced to sell Chrome. Tech companies like Perplexity and Ecosia lined up with unsolicited bids. But that possibility has been nixed.
Beyond Google’s cash cow of search, its cloud computing business is also growing rapidly on the strength of its AI offerings. Alphabet now joins Nvidia ($4.3T), Microsoft ($3.8T) and Apple ($3.5T) in the three-t club with Amazon next up but a lap behind ($2.5T)."

Sep 15 - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) crossed a historic milestone on Monday as its market capitalization moved above $3 trillion for the first time. The company became only the fourth U.S. firm to achieve this level, alongside Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Shares of Alphabet gained as much as 4.7% intraday, reaching $252.7, which pushed the stock into the $3 trillion tier. The company's stock has advanced more than 30% in 2025, driven by optimism around artificial intelligence and relief following a favorable antitrust ruling. Earlier this month, a judge determined that Alphabet does not need to spin off its Chrome browser, easing concerns of a structural breakup.
The new valuation highlights the growing influence of AI-focused technology leaders. Nvidia has surged on demand for its GPUs, Microsoft continues to benefit from its cloud services, and Apple maintains its premium positioning in consumer devices. Alphabet now stands firmly among them, signaling investor confidence in its growth path despite regulatory challenges.
With this move, Alphabet's inclusion in the $3 trillion club underscores the strength of mega-cap tech in shaping overall market momentum."

Shares of leading data storage manufacturer Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) jumped 4.6% in the afternoon session after the company announced it is immediately increasing prices across its entire range of hard disk drives (HDDs), citing unprecedented demand.
Western Digital is the third major storage manufacturer to raise prices, a move prompted by what it calls ""sky-high demand for every capacity in its portfolio."" This surge is reportedly driven by tech giants like Google and Oracle aggressively expanding their AI infrastructure, leading to substantial growth in demand for high-capacity storage. Industry sources indicate that lead times for these high-capacity HDDs have now stretched to almost a year. However, the company noted a switch to sea freight could add six to ten weeks to shipping times. Reinforcing the positive investor sentiment, Benchmark analysts raised their price target on the stock to $115 from $85, maintaining a Buy rating.
Is now the time to buy Western Digital? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Western Digital’s shares are very volatile and have had 20 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock gained 4.5% on the news that it received bullish commentary from Wall Street, including being named a 'Top Pick' by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring raised the firm's price target on Western Digital to $99 from $92, reiterating an Overweight rating. This decision followed meetings with company executives, which increased the firm's confidence in Western Digital's technology roadmap.
Western Digital is up 66% since the beginning of the year, and at $102.71 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Western Digital’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,718.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Nebius Group (NBIS) is a leading artificial intelligence infrastructure company. The Netherlands-based company’s core business is Nebius, an AI-centric cloud platform built for intensive AI workloads. Nebius builds full-stack infrastructure for AI, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms and tools, and services for developers.
Nebius’ two main businesses are:
· AI Infrastructure: Mega-cap tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers to train and optimize their large language models. With so much capital at stake, they cannot build data centers fast enough and are reliant on companies like Nebius.
· AI Cloud Services: Nebius also offers its AI infrastructure as a service, allowing big tech companies to gain access to resources at a lower cost.
What Sets Nebius Apart from it’s Competitors?
What separates NBIS from most competitors is that it is vertically integrated, meaning it provides its own proprietary AI software and hardware, including servers and racks.
Nvidia Partnership is a Competitive Advantage for Nebius
Nvidia (NVDA) is the undisputed chip leader in the AI market. Simply put, if you want to run the best AI models, you need Nvidia’s GPUs. With demand soaring for NVDA GPUs, many companies do not need to wait for Nvidia’s in-demand top-of-the line technology. Not Nebius. Nvidia is both a partner and investor in Nebius. Through the agreement, Nebius enjoys priority access to Nvidia’s latest and most powerful GPUs. Meanwhile, according to the latest filings, Nvidia owns roughly ~$700 million worth of NBIS, meaning it has “skin in the game.”
Have NBIS Shares Run Too Far, Too Fast?
NBIS has a “nosebleed” price-to-sales ratio nearing 100x. Meanwhile, as the AI hype builds on Wall Street Nebius shares have exploded by nearly 400% since going public late last year.

Microsoft Deal is a Gamechanger for Nebius
If there is one lesson I have learned in my two decades of investing, it’s that traditional valuations mean little in a vacuum. Instead, investors must weigh forward growth and fundamental catalysts to get a clear picture. Because of a new bullish catalyst, Nebius is an example of a high valuation stock worth owning.
On September 9th, Nebius landed a massive multi-year deal with Microsoft (MSFT). In a contract worth a whopping $17.4 billion (with potential to get to $19.4B), Nebius will provide Microsoft with access to its Vineland, New Jersey data center, and the valuable GPUs within it."

While broader market indicators showed an upward trend with technology stocks like Tesla and Alphabet leading the charge, Progress's decline suggests that recent expansions may not have provided immediate investor confidence. As the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached new highs, Progress's performance illustrates a divergence, potentially highlighting investor caution amid its expansion into the public sector amidst a bullish market climate driven by anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts.
The recent creation of Progress Federal Solutions Inc. raises questions about its immediate impact on Progress Software's financial outlook. Despite the company's strategic push into supporting U.S. government digital transformation, its stock experienced a 3% decline amid broader market gains, hinting at potential uncertainties. Over the past five years, Progress's total shareholder return stood at 24.68%, reflecting growth despite the recent setback. However, performance over the past year has lagged, with the company underperforming both the U.S. market and the software industry.
The integration of ShareFile and SaaS acquisitions could bolster Progress's revenue and earnings, but any operational misstep might offset these gains. Analysts forecast Progress's revenue to grow to US$1 billion by 2028, with earnings reaching US$138.9 million. The current share price of US$41.94 reflects a significant discount to the consensus price target of US$70, indicating potential undervaluation if the company's plans succeed. Nevertheless, achieving these projections depends on the effective management of its new ventures and strategic acquisitions amidst macroeconomic risks.

Intuit's price movement diverges from broader market trends, suggesting the launch had limited effect within the context of broader economic factors influencing investor sentiment.
Intuit has 1 warning sign we think you should know about.
The introduction of Clair On-Demand Pay by Intuit may signal a shift towards enhancing its payroll offerings, aligning with its broader strategy of AI and cloud integration to boost customer retention and cross-selling. However, the recent 4% decline in Intuit's share price suggests that this development had a limited immediate impact on investor sentiment, possibly due to prevailing market factors such as optimism around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts that have buoyed tech stocks like Tesla and Alphabet. Over the past five years, Intuit's shareholders have nonetheless experienced a substantial total return of 116.63%, indicating a robust longer-term performance despite recent market fluctuations.
When compared to the broader market over the past year, Intuit's performance was less impressive, underperforming both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which have been reaching record highs. Analysts' forecasts suggest that Intuit's revenue could grow by 12.7% annually over the next three years, with earnings expected to rise to US$6.2 billion. The recent product launch could potentially support these forecasts by diversifying revenue streams and increasing customer stickiness. However, risks such as sluggish growth in Mailchimp and international headwinds remain concerns that could affect these projections. With a current share price of US$646.03, there is a significant discount compared to the analyst consensus price target of US$819.73, suggesting potential upside if the company's growth catalysts align with analyst expectations.

Mehta had pointed directly to ChatGPT's rise to 700 million weekly users, along with emerging rivals like Anthropic and Perplexity, as evidence that Google no longer holds an unchallenged monopoly.
The judge concluded that generative AI technologies could be ""game changers,"" undermining the DOJ's demand that Google divest core businesses such as YouTube, Chrome, or Android. Ironically, ChatGPT — once considered a serious threat that prompted Google's internal ""Code Red"" — became proof in court that competition is intensifying in search, bolstering Google's defense.
Alphabet shares have climbed more than 30% year-to-date, doubling the Nasdaq Composite’s 15% gain.
Google is driving growth through its Cloud division, which projects at least $58 billion in added revenue over the next two years. Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's CEO, told the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference that about 55% of the unit's $106 billion backlog will convert to revenue within that period, excluding new contracts. The division already boasts an annual run rate above $50 billion, highlighting its rising importance for Alphabet.
Kurian noted that new customer sign-ups jumped 28% quarter-over-quarter, with nine of the 10 largest AI labs, including rivals OpenAI and Anthropic, choosing Google Cloud.
Although Google Cloud contributed just 14% of Alphabet's revenue last quarter, it remains one of the company's fastest-growing businesses, even outpacing Microsoft's Azure in recent quarters. Alphabet is also preparing to launch Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL) in 2026, signaling ambitions in blockchain finance that could rival Ripple's XRP Ledger.
Additionally, Google Cloud is expanding automotive partnerships to power next-generation in-car experiences, further diversifying its growth drivers.
Under CEO Sundar Pichai, the company has faced intense regulatory scrutiny and mounting AI competition from OpenAI and Perplexity."

This vertically integrated owner and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure, purpose-built to support bitcoin mining and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, reported revenues of $47.6 million, up 38% sequentially and 34% year over year in the second quarter of 2025.
WULF self-mined 485 bitcoin at the Lake Mariner facility in the second quarter of 2025, and bitcoin mining capacity jumped 45.5% year over year to 12.8 EH/s. As of June 30, 2025, TeraWulf owned approximately 70,300 miners, with approximately 65,100 operational at the facility. However, power cost per bitcoin self-mined jumped 98.5% year over year due to halving (in April), rising network difficulty and short-term power price volatility. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.5 million, down 25.6% year over year in the second quarter of 2025 against a negative $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2025.
However, TeraWulf expects power prices in Upstate New York to remain steady with historical levels for the rest of 2025. The company now expects 5 cents per kilowatt hour for the second half of the year and mining operations to contribute positively to EBITDA. However, WULF expects selling, general and administrative expenses between $50 million and $55 million compared with previous guidance of $40-$45 million due to accelerated growth in the company’s HPC business.
So, how should investors play WULF stock now? Let’s analyze.
WULF’s Top Line to Benefit From Growing Clientele
TeraWulf is on track to deliver 72.5 MW of HPC colocation capacity under its data center lease agreements with Core42 Holding for GPU compute workloads. The WULF Den and CB-1 leases with Core42 are expected to start generating revenues in the third quarter of 2025.
WULF inked a deal with Fluidstack, a premier AI cloud platform that builds and operates HPC clusters. TeraWulf will deliver more than 360 MW of critical IT load at its Lake Mariner data center campus in Western New York. The Lake Mariner facility can expand up to 500 MW in the near term and up to 750 MW with targeted transmission upgrades. At the end of the second quarter of 2025, the facility had 245 MW of energized capacity supporting bitcoin mining infrastructure.
The deal represents roughly $6.7 billion in contracted revenues with total contract revenues expected to hit $16 billion. As per the deal, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google is backing Fluidstack’s lease obligations, which include early termination protections for the first 6 years. Alphabet is also providing $3.2 billion of credit support, and its total pro forma equity ownership in TeraWulf increases to approximately 14%.
WULF also secured a long-term ground lease for approximately 183 acres at the Cayuga site in Lansing, NY. The lease provides TeraWulf with exclusive rights to develop up to 400 MW of digital infrastructure capacity, with 138 MW of low-cost, predominantly zero-carbon power expected to be ready for service in 2026."

Alphabet's shares have continued to climb, pushing the tech company's market capitalisation to a new level and the company value to more than $3 trillion (€2.55tr).
This means that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, entered a small but elite club of tech giants, worth more than $3tr. Other members include leader, Nvidia, which is valued at more than $4.2tr (€3.57tr), followed by Microsoft with an approximate $3.8tr (€3.23tr) market cap and Apple, worth $3.5tr (€3tr).
Alphabet shares received a boost in September after a long-awaited ruling in the US, concluding an antitrust case that had lasted nearly five years, in which the company avoided being forcibly broken up.
The US Department of Justice had previously demanded that Alphabet’s Google sell its Chrome browser business and potentially its Android operating system amid competition concerns. Google's search business accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.
However, a US federal judge has ruled that it doesn’t have to sell either, though the company must share data with competitors.
Alphabet's prospects appear to be promising, as the second-quarter earnings showed that demand for artificial intelligence products is lifting sales. Revenues were up 15%, better than expected.
Alphabet shares were up by more than 4% on Monday afternoon in Europe, after they had gained more than 30% since the beginning of the year."

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway joined the trillion-dollar ranks in August 2024 and is the only non-tech company on the list. Tesla rejoined the list in the second half of 2025 after a sell-off to start the year brought it below the $1 trillion mark.

First up is Alphabet reaching a three trillion dollar valuation. Wall Street's been bullish on the stock after clearing an anti-trust hurdle. Today, Citi raised its price target on the Google parent to $280 from 225.
Analyst Ron Josey seems an accelerated product development cycle that's beginning to emerge with greater Gemini adoption across both its as and cloud businesses. Uh with the case now out of the way, investors are turning their attention back to the potential for gains in Alphabet's stock, which is the cheapest on a P/E basis among the Magnificent 7 despite the recent rally the shares at a record today.
Next up is Robin Hood, launching a closed end fund to give retail investors in the US exposure to private companies. The retail trading platform said it filed an initial registration statement with the SEC, beginning the process to offer public shares of the fund dubbed Robin Hood Ventures Fund 1.

Shares of online advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) jumped 3.1% in the morning session after the company’s market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time, buoyed by a wave of positive developments including a major cloud contract and favorable analyst commentary.
The milestone, which makes Alphabet the fourth company to reach this valuation, was supported by several pieces of good news. Google Cloud secured a significant £400 million contract to deliver a secure cloud platform for the UK Ministry of Defence.
Furthermore, YouTube's first global NFL game broadcast was a success, attracting 17.3 million viewers worldwide. Analysts reacted positively, with Citizens JMP maintaining its ""Market Outperform"" rating and a $250 price target, noting the strong viewership. Evercore ISI also increased its price target for Alphabet from $240 to $300, citing the company's continued dominance in commercial-intent search.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $249.61, up 3.7% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Alphabet’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 6 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 12 days ago when the stock gained 8.3% on the news that a U.S. judge's ruling in a major antitrust case eased fears of a forced break-up of the company.
The decision allows Google to retain control of its key businesses, including the Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system, which the U.S. Department of Justice had sought to divest. Investors welcomed the news, seeing it as a ""massive win"" that helps the tech giant avoid the worst-case scenario. While the company was spared a structural break-up, the judge did bar Google from entering into certain exclusive search agreements in the future and will require modest data sharing with competitors. The ruling removes a significant regulatory overhang for the company.
Following the news, analysts at Needham reiterated a 'Buy' rating and raised their price target from $220 to $260, signaling renewed confidence.
Alphabet is up 31.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $249.61 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Alphabet’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,252.

(Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet hit a market capitalization of $3 trillion for the first time on Monday, riding on renewed optimism around artificial intelligence and a favorable antitrust ruling.
Class A shares of the company were up 3.8% at $250, while Class C shares climbed 3.7% to $250.4 - both trading at record highs.
Including Monday's gains, the company's shares have rallied more than 32% so far this year, the best performer among the so-called ""Magnificent 7"" stocks and outpacing the 12.5% gain for the S&P 500. Alphabet joined other tech giants Apple and Microsoft in hitting a $3 trillion valuation, while AI chipmaker Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, boasts a market cap of $4.25 trillion.
Technology and AI-linked stocks have powered Wall Street's main indexes to record highs lately amid growing hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this week.
Oracle's blowout forecast last week was the latest to fire up the AI trade.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said tech stocks have been the leaders of the recent rally and ""there has been no other (sector) in the past 18 months, maybe even two years that has had such excitement from investors.""
The communications services sub-sector - which houses Alphabet - has jumped more than 26% so far this year, making it the best performing sector among the 11 major sub-indexes with information technology in second place.
HOLDING TOGETHER
Investor sentiment received a boost after a U.S. court earlier this month allowed Alphabet to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system, marking a pivotal moment for the company whose dominance in search and mobile ecosystems has long drawn scrutiny.
While sharing data as part of the ruling will strengthen Google's advertising business rivals, not having to divest Chrome or Android removes a major concern for investors who view them as key pieces to Google's overall business.
In July, the company's cloud-computing unit delivered an almost 32% jump in second quarter revenue, surpassing expectations as investments in in-house chips and the Gemini AI model began to pay off.
""They still are very dependent on search, but with YouTube, Waymo, and other capabilities and products they're working on, investors are starting to see that possibility that this isn't just a search company anymore, this is a company that's moving into a lot of other things,"" said Dennis Dick, chief strategist at Stock Trader Network."

The toy company's ""risk/reward profile [looks] less favorable,"" Kevin Yin, head of Asia consumer research at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients, adding, ""We believe the valuation is priced for perfection.""
Pop Mart shares have soared 184% year to date and a staggering 427% over the past year, far outpacing the Hang Seng Index's (^HSI) 35% and 52% gains. However, it sank over 6% on Monday in Hong Kong trading and dropped 10% over the past five trading days.
JPMorgan cut its rating on the stock from Overweight to Neutral and slashed its price target to HK$300 from HK$400.
The problem isn't that Labubu's brand is collapsing. Yin notes that sales momentum remains ""solid,"" even as resale prices and Google (GOOG) search interest have cooled. Instead, the issue is that investors have already bid up shares as if every future hit is guaranteed.
""Any small fundamental miss/negative media reports might drive underperformance,"" Yin cautioned.
The analyst points out that four of seven key catalysts, from strong first-half results to a Uniqlo collaboration, ""were well hit."" The success of remaining targets, such as an upcoming ""Labubu & Friends"" animation series, the launch of Labubu 4.0, and new interactive toys, is less certain.
Other near-term risks are mounting. Negative chatter around product quality, design, and licensing has already surfaced in Chinese media, with resale prices dropping after Pop Mart rapidly expanded production capacity. The company is trading at a rich 31 times estimated 2025 P/E and 22 times 2026 P/E — multiples that leave little margin for error.
JPMorgan said the company's long-term strategy is still solid. Pop Mart has built a strong portfolio of 100-plus intellectual properties, operates 500 retail stores, and runs thousands of automated ""roboshops"" in more than 30 countries. Yin expects overseas markets to contribute more than 60% of earnings by 2027, with Labubu alone making up 35% of sales.
Yin highlighted several potential upside surprises, including stronger-than-expected Mini Labubu sales, successful cross-selling from the upcoming animation, or endorsements from global celebrities that could recreate the past viral successes. Celebrities and athletes, including Rihanna, Naomi Osaka, and Blackpink's Lisa have all sported the plush doll. Accelerated licensing deals with international brands could also breathe new life into the franchise, Yin added."

Cybersecurity threats are rising fast — and AI is making them harder to contain.
""It's becoming much easier to attack a company,"" Zscaler (ZS) CEO Jay Chaudhry told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (see the video above; listen in below).
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Chaudhry added that generative AI tools like OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) ChatGPT and Google's (GOOG) Gemini can now quickly surface vulnerabilities in corporate systems that once took weeks of research to identify. That puts enterprises on the defensive — and they can only counter with similar technology.
""To fight AI, you must fight it with AI,"" Chaudry said.
Cybersecurity stocks have been some of the hottest trades on Wall Street. Zscaler shares are up over 57% year to date, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and CrowdStrike (CRWD) have also surged, suggesting that investors are betting AI will drive new demand for advanced security systems.
The rise of generative AI agents adds another layer of uncertainty. While much of the industry chatter focuses on AI agents for business use, Chaudhry said the technology is still in its infancy.
However, security challenges may multiply once agents become widely adopted.
""The challenge of cybersecurity and data protection becomes 10x bigger,"" he said.
For Zscaler, that opens both risks and opportunities. The company currently has over 50 million users and utilizes a ""zero trust exchange,"" a cloud platform that securely connects users, apps, and devices. Chaudhry said the same architecture can be extended to govern AI agents as they interact with one another and with enterprise systems.
Beyond corporate networks, Chaudhry explained that banks and big financial institutions have made major strides in security, but utilities and infrastructure like the water system and electric grid remain dangerously exposed. He cited the Colonial Pipeline hack in 2021, which shut down fuel supplies across the East Coast, as an example of how quickly an attack could spiral.
""Our country could do a little bit more, push an incentive for our infrastructure, which has some significant risk because they still depend on old technologies,"" he said.
Ransomware is another persistent threat. Zscaler's latest threat report notes the company blocked about 146% more attacks year over year, its biggest spike in three years, while public extortion cases rose over 70%. Some of those adversaries, according to Chaudhry, range from Eastern Europe and China to the US."

SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESS Newswire / September 15, 2025 / Chatmeter, the multi-location customer intelligence platform, today announced new integrations with delivery apps Uber Eats, DoorDash and GrubHub that enable restaurants to analyze and respond to delivery reviews in Chatmeter.
Recent Chatmeter research revealed a gap in the quality of delivery service that directly impacts brand reputation and customer retention. More than half of consumers said they experienced a late delivery and cold food when ordering, while 44% had items missing from their orders. These service failures represent significant reputation risks for multi-location businesses relying on third-party delivery partners to execute on their brand promise.
Delivery reviews previously existed in siloes, disconnected from broader reputation strategies. Now, brands can analyze and respond to reviews within Chatmeter, alongside reviews from other platforms, like Google, Yelp, Facebook, TripAdvisor and Apple Maps.
""Restaurants now have unprecedented visibility into their customer experience across dine-in, takeout and delivery,"" said John Mazur, CEO of Chatmeter. ""The delivery economy has fundamentally changed how consumers experience restaurant brands, but most businesses are flying blind when it comes to understanding these interactions. AI-powered deep listening has never been more critical to nurturing loyalty and gaining insights that improve the customer experience.""
Delivery app feedback will now be available in Pulse Ai, Chatmeter's AI-powered reputation management platform. Within Pulse Ai, brands can analyze millions of unstructured data points to gain actionable insights, receive AI-powered alerts related to food safety issues and other reputational risks before they go viral, go beyond star ratings to better understand customer sentiment and obtain competitive intelligence to win in local markets.

That's thanks to their ease of use — setting them up is as easy as opening the case and tapping ""connect"" on your iPhone — and solid performance.
The company's newest Pro model, the $249 AirPods Pro 3, ups the ante on both the audio and health fronts with improved sound and built-in heart rate tracking.
I've been using the AirPods Pro 3 for the past few days, including on a cross-country flight, throughout the workday, and during various workouts, and I'm already sold on them.
I've worn the AirPods Pro 2 for the better part of the last year, popping them in so often that walking to grab coffee or around the grocery store without them feels almost unnatural. And while I was satisfied with them, the Pro 3s are simply better in nearly every way.
First up, they now come with five different ear tip sizes, ranging from XX-small to large, and a redesigned shape to improve overall fit. I normally have to use different ear tips for my left and right ears, but the Pro 3s fit perfectly out of the box with the standard tips.
Fit is especially important for the Pro 3 because of the new built-in heart rate trackers. Each bud can track your heart rate while you're working out and provide a post-exercise summary of your heart rate performance and calories burned. The information is then fed into Apple's Fitness and Health apps, where you can review it later.
And if you're the type of person, like me, who is overly obsessed with closing your workout rings, you'll be happy to know workouts completed using the AirPods Pro 3 are counted toward your rings. Apple said it accomplished this by integrating its smallest-ever heart rate tracker into the buds and combining them with a new AI model based on 50 million hours of data from the company's Heart and Movement study.
The idea is to get people into Apple's health and fitness ecosystem, whether they have an Apple Watch or not. Speaking of which, if you have an Apple Watch and are tracking your workouts with it while wearing the Pro 3, all of the heart rate sensors will work in tandem to ensure the best reading possible.

FRANKLIN, Tenn., Sept. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- OMNIA Partners, the nation's largest and most experienced group purchasing organization for the public and private sectors, today announced an investment from CapitalG, the independent growth fund of Alphabet, one of Silicon Valley's most prominent investors.

The stock is down about 20% on the year, and has fallen 25% over the past five years.
Let's take a close look at Adobe's results and prospects to see whether its stock can finally break out.
Solid results
Adobe continues to embed artificial intelligence (AI) across its products to help fuel growth. While it developed its own generative AI model, Firefly, it's also adding third-party models and products to its platform, including Alphabet's Gemini model and Veo 2 video generator.
The company said it's now looking to provide the operating system for creative work. It said Firefly is seeing strong adoption, and that its AI-influenced annual recurring revenue (ARR) now topped $5 billion, up from $3.5 billion at the end of the last fiscal year.
Adobe also continues to target customers outside of creative fields who want AI to help with their content. On this end, the combined number of monthly active users for its Document Cloud and Express products climbed 20% since last year.
Overall, Adobe reported record quarterly revenue of $5.99 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. This was just ahead of its prior guidance for revenue of $5.875 billion to $5.925 billion. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) climbed 11% to $5.31, ahead of its $5.15 to $5.20 forecast.
Among individual segments, digital media, which is home to both the Creative and Document Cloud businesses, saw revenue jump by 12% to $4.46 billion. ARR in digital media also rose 12% to $18.59 billion.
Revenue in the digital experience segment, which provides digital analytics and online marketing services, increased by 9% to $1.48 billion; digital experience subscription revenue jumped 11% to $1.37 billion. Adobe GenStudio, which is used for performance marketing, was a big driver for the segment, with ARR growing 25% to over $1 billion.
Looking ahead, Adobe raised its full-year outlook, as seen in the table below:
| Metric | FY 2025 Forecast (December and March) | FY 2025 Forecast (June) | FY 2025 Forecast (September) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | $23.3 billion to $23.55 billion | $23.5 billion to $23.6 billion | $23.65 billion to $23.7 billion |
| Digital media segment revenue | $17.25 billion to $17.4 billion | $17.45 billion to $17.5 billion | $17.56 billion to $17.59 billion |
| Digital experience segment revenue | $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion | $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion | $5.84 billion to $5.86 billion |
| Adjusted earnings per share | $20.20 to $20.50 | $20.50 to $20.70 | $20.80 to $20.85 |
For its fiscal fourth quarter, meanwhile, it provided the following outlook:
| Metric | Fiscal Q4 Forecast |
|---|---|
| Revenue | $6.075 billion to $6.125 billion |
| Digital media segment revenue | $4.53 billion to $4.56 billion |
| Digital experience segment revenue | $1.495 billion to $1.515 billion |
| Adjusted earnings per share | $5.35 to $5.40 |
Can Adobe's stock break out?
While AI is helping drive Adobe's revenue growth, it hasn't accelerated it, which appears to be what investors want. Instead, it helped the company stay in the 10% to 12% revenue-growth range. AI products like Firefly, GenStudio, and Acrobat AI Assistant are gaining momentum, but they still aren't moving the needle in a big way yet.
Looking at valuation, the stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15 times fiscal year 2026 analyst estimates, and a forward price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of near 0.7. A PEG under 1 is typically considered undervalued.
Software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks have been out of favor in the market, as growth has moderated and investors wonder how their business models hold up with the advent of AI. Most of these companies, including Adobe, use seat-based models, meaning they sell their solutions based on the number of people using their product. The worry is that AI will eventually reduce jobs, leading to fewer seat-based subscriptions. That's a risk, but business models are likely to evolve if this happens.
Overall, Adobe has become a nice growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) stock, and looks attractive at current levels. Sentiment will need to shift for the stock to break out, but the company has been seeing solid growth and trades at a reasonable valuation, which is a good reason to own it right now."

you heard uh Inez talk a little bit how the Mag 7 reacted after uh prior rate cuts. Uh, what, you know, what is your thinking on this key space? You know, we get that one rate cut, get a couple more. Historically, these stocks have done pretty darn well uh after rate cuts.
Yeah, I I I think that they've not only done well over rate cuts, they also have done well over the last couple of years and they've really been the only source of positive earnings revisions, you know, ever since the Fed started to hike in 2022. But if you're looking at a change in potential leadership, I would look outside of the Mag 7 uh because, you know, the a lower interest rate environment should allow kind of more cyclical parts of the economy, things like housing that we talked about or manufacturing to start to grow again, to start to demonstrate some positive earnings revision. That's a catalyst in my mind that's been absent in markets last couple of years. And if you're looking just at at a valuation differential between those areas of the market and the Mag 7, that is is quite wide. Uh and so there's a potential there I think for a catch-up trade outside of just continued strength from the Mag 7 potentially, but also uh maybe uh maybe some other opportunities that investors really haven't favored the last couple of years.
You mentioned small cast. Small cast have been rallying. What's the what's the case for for that? You know, I would just counter, we've seen a weakening labor market, inflation is still high, a lot of these smaller businesses in the US, in some respects are really struggling.
They are and and it really has been a, um, a result of, you know, the Fed hiking rates in 2022 aggressively, but now we're on the other side of that. And what we've seen, especially if you, if you look at kind of prior periods of history when we start to see an easing in policy, um, you know, the smaller companies tend to borrow at at at a prime rate or a variable rate, and when the cost of financing comes down, they are in a unique position to benefit because they were the ones that have been hurt by it. Um, the Mac 7 hasn't been hurt by this. And so, you know, while they're not going to have any difference in terms of their operating environment, the small businesses are. Uh and so we would just look to that as more of a unique callyst for that specific part of the market even though it struggled the last couple of years."

This week, Tracey is going solo to talk about top Ranked growth stocks. These are the hot stocks of 2025. Why not find some companies that are expected to have both growth and rising earnings estimates?

The Zacks Rank is a short-term stock recommendation of 1 to 3 months. It looks at revisions to analyst earnings estimates, including the agreement among analysts and the magnitude of the upward, or downward, revisions.
The top rank of #1 usually means something good is going on at a company. It means that the analysts are raising earnings estimates. Out of over 4,000 stocks, there was only 223 Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buys) at the time of the podcast.
Running a Growth Stock Screen
Make it easy on yourself. To find the top growth stocks, run the premium screen called “Zacks #1 Rank Growth Stocks.”
In addition to the companies being #1 (Strong Buys), they will have a minimum of 20% historical EPS growth rate and 20% or more projected EPS growth.

Chicago, IL – September 15, 2025 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Oracle ORCL, Adobe ADBE and Alphabet GOOGL.
Q3 Earnings Season Gets Underway: A Closer Look
We include the recent results from Oracle and Adobe for their respective fiscal quarters ending in August as part of the September-quarter tally. The Q3 reporting cycle will really get underway when the big banks release their results on October 14, but we will have already seen fiscal August-quarter results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members by then. We have five such companies on deck to report results this week, including FedEx, Lennar, and Darden.
Adobe beat estimates and modestly raised guidance, but the results fail to challenge the prevailing bearish narrative on the stock. At the core of this bearish narrative is the view that Adobe will be unable to sustain its software niche in the coming AI-centric world.
A similar narrative has partly been at play in the case of Alphabet, where skepticism centers on the sustainability of Google’s search dominance. Unlike Adobe, however, Alphabet has a number of other businesses that it can lean on going forward, though any threat to the search cash cow is understandably a significant concern.
Adobe shares have lost approximately one-third of their value over the past year, lagging behind the broader market and the Tech sector.
As you can see above, the above chart also includes Oracle (up +81.8% over the past year) and Alphabet (+53.4%). Oracle’s quarterly results were off-the-charts good, with the company’s backlog gains and management’s outlook for the coming periods exceeding even the most bullish sell-side estimates by big margins.
Adobe’s fiscal year ends in November, so its next quarter will be its fiscal fourth quarter. With only one quarter to go, Adobe’s earnings for the current year are on track to be up +12% on +9.6% higher revenues. For next year, the expectation is of +12.8% earnings growth on +9.2% revenue gains.
These growth numbers aren’t terribly out of line with the company’s recent history, but the stock’s recent performance suggests that the bearish narrative now represents the prevailing view on the stock. As a result, ADBE shares currently trade at their lowest valuation multiple in more than 10 years.
The question at this stage is whether this software name has finally become a ‘value’ play or is it a ‘value trap’?
The expectation is for Q3 earnings to increase by +5.1% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues. This would follow earnings growth rates of +12.5% and +12.3% in 2025 Q2 and Q1, respectively."

It has made many AI stocks some of the best-performing stocks during that time, but it has also brought many AI companies into the light that are only there because of pure speculation and hype.
If you're looking for a good AI stock to invest in that has stood the test of time, proven its ability to innovate, and has growth opportunities ahead of it, look no further than Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%).
What makes Alphabet a great AI stock is that it has its hands in virtually all major phases of the technology:
- Its AI research company, DeepMind, is responsible for critical breakthroughs that have pushed the entire AI field forward.
- It has dozens of its own data centers, giving it more infrastructure control.
- Its cloud platform, Google Cloud, allows it to train, deploy, and scale its AI models in-house (and its quantum computing advancements could make this faster and more efficient).
- It has user-facing AI applications like Gemini, Flow, and Whisk.
Alphabet may not be the best in the market in all of these phases, but its significant presence in the AI pipeline allows it to capture value at every stage and rely less on other companies, unlike many of its competitors. The icing on the cake is that Alphabet seems to be undervalued compared to its other ""Magnificent Seven"" peers."

That's when ChatGPT broke out, kicking off the artificial intelligence (AI) movement that has sent numerous technology and AI stocks to lofty heights and produced electrifying investment returns in the process.
It may be difficult for some of these companies to continue to justify increasingly higher stock prices. That said, there are still compelling opportunities in a select few companies that have the growth and valuation to continue performing at a high level over the coming months.
Three contributing Motley Fool analysts identified Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%), Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), and AppLovin (APP 2.01%) as three winners that can still pack a punch for your portfolio.
1. All AI chip roads lead to this red-hot stock
Justin Pope (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): The AI landscape will undoubtedly evolve, but it's hard to imagine that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC, won't remain one of the biggest AI winners.
The company is the world's leading semiconductor (chip) manufacturer, also known as a foundry.
Nvidia and most other chip companies design the chips used in AI data centers and throughout almost every technological application you can think of. However, they often outsource the actual production of those chips to foundries.
TSMC is the clear industry giant, with an estimated 67% revenue share of the foundry market at the end of last year. The leading AI chip companies are likely going to come to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for its capacity and leading manufacturing technologies to produce the high-end chips in the quantities needed to support what continues to be rampant demand, as billions of dollars pour into data centers and the chips that go into them.
This wave of AI investment is the key reason why TSMC continues to turn in stellar earnings reports. Additionally, some industry experts believe that trillions of dollars will continue to pour into data centers worldwide over the next five years.
Analysts believe TSMC will grow earnings by an average of 21% annually over the next three to five years. Yet, the stock still trades at just 25 times this year's earnings estimates. In other words, the stock, which has soared by 31% since January, could have more upside ahead.
2. Investors may finally be ready to give one tech giant the respect it deserves
Will Healy (Alphabet): After years of doubting Google parent Alphabet, investors may finally be looking at the stock in a more favorable light.
A U.S. District Court just ruled that the company would not have to sell its Chrome browser because of antitrust concerns. Chrome is a critical part of the company's digital advertising strategy. Even though products like Google Cloud are on track to reduce Alphabet's dependence on digital ads, that segment still generated 74% of the company's revenue in the first half of 2025.
Hence, despite new requirements to share data with competitors, investors saw the ruling as a victory and bid the stock higher.
That gain has taken Alphabet's P/E ratio to 25. Nonetheless, it remains the cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" stock, and the ability to invest in itself makes its long-term growth prospects extremely favorable.
Alphabet's $95 billion in liquidity gives the company tremendous optionality. Moreover, it generated an additional $67 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. This is critical, as free cash flow also does not include the $75 billion Alphabet pledged to invest in capital expenditures (capex) in 2025.
That investment is also likely to enhance its AI capabilities, a concern for the Google parent since OpenAI released GPT-4 in 2023. Additionally, it can fund the $70 billion in share repurchases it announced earlier this year and its new, growing dividend.
Ultimately, the favorable antitrust ruling seems to have become a catalyst for what was already a solid business that invests heavily in its future growth. Since investors now have a new appreciation for the Google parent, Alphabet stock appears on track to move higher for the rest of the year and beyond.
3. AppLovin's AI-powered ad platform is producing incredible results
Jake Lerch (AppLovin): Unlike many big tech companies, AppLovin isn't your traditional AI stock. It isn't in the semiconductor business like Nvidia or Broadcom. It isn't investing tens of billions into AI research or data centers like Meta Platforms, Alphabet, or Amazon.
Rather, AppLovin is laser-focused on using AI tools to perfect its business niche: digital advertising. And on that front, the results speak for themselves.
AppLovin's crown jewel is its Axon 2, its AI engine, launched in 2023. Axon 2 powers AppLovin's mobile ad platform, helping marketers to deliver value to their clients by finding and targeting the right users, driving higher return on investment for ad campaigns.
In turn, AppLovin's financials have taken flight. In its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on June 30, 2025), AppLovin reported:
- $1.26 billion in revenue, up 77% from a year earlier
- $0.8 billion in net income, up 164% year over year
- 76.5% operating margin, an all-time record
Moreover, AppLovin reported $768 million in free cash flow, and the company repurchased roughly $340 million worth of existing shares as part of its ongoing share buyback plan.
All told, shares of AppLovin have advanced by 75% year to date, despite a big pullback at the start of the year. Since 2022, shares are up 2,000%, having generated a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 173%.
Granted, there are risks to owning AppLovin stock. Given its enormous run, its stock sports a lofty valuation. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 37. That's high for any stock, but it's also high for AppLovin itself, which has a lifetime average P/S ratio of around 11.
Nevertheless, for investors seeking out a hypergrowth stock within the AI sector, AppLovin is worth a look thanks to its remarkable financials and innovative, AI-powered platform."

Over the last five years, Broadcom is up over 925% and Oracle is up over 475% -- outperforming every ""Magnificent Seven"" stock (Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla) except one -- Nvidia.
The ""Ten Titans"" provide an update to the Magnificent Seven by adding Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix to the list. Combined, these three companies have nearly the same market cap as Apple, and are gaining increasing influence in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%). In fact, the Ten Titans now make up 39.1% of the index compared to 33.7% for the Magnificent Seven.
Beyond the market cap influence of these names, Broadcom and Oracle embody groundbreaking advancements in cloud computing, infrastructure software, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Here's why Broadcom and Oracle have become such dominant companies, and whether either growth stock is a buy now.
Broadcom is a balanced way to invest in AI
Broadcom and Oracle's surging stock prices illustrate how AI is redefining previously stagnant investment theses. Just a few years ago, both companies were often viewed as dividend-paying stalwarts.
Broadcom was known for its established semiconductor business, providing the nuts and bolts behind networking, broadband, wireless, cybersecurity, and more. But the company is completely different today due to its acquisition of VMware in late 2023 and the development and adoption of its AI chips.
Cloud computing giants are lining up to buy Broadcom's AI chips, known as XPUs. XPUs are highly advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are tailored to a specialized function and are especially good at handling increasing AI workloads. Broadcom doesn't just design the chips, it also makes associated networking products, like Tomahawk switches that link chips within a server rack, and Jericho Ethernet fabric routers, which enable the connection of over 1 million XPU clusters across multiple data centers.
Broadcom is unique because it is far bigger than just an AI play. Rather, it is a highly diversified company that benefits from the buildout of AI infrastructure, AI software, and the growth of high-speed connectivity.
Oracle is heavily disrupting incumbent cloud giants
Oracle's latest quarter perfectly represents why Broadcom has become a behemoth that is closing in on $1 trillion in market cap. On Sept. 9, Oracle said that its cloud infrastructure segment is expected to grow 77% in fiscal 2026, 78% in fiscal 2027, 128% in fiscal 2028, and 97% in fiscal 2029 to become a $144 billion business. If Oracle comes remotely close to these estimates, its cloud business will become far larger than its legacy database services segment.
Like Broadcom, Oracle was once an entrenched business-to-business giant in tech, known for its stodgy growth and reliable dividend. But Oracle is now a completely different company. Its strength comes from its competitive pricing model, which makes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) a great add-on for customers that use its database services.
Oracle is an enterprise-facing company. Whereas investors in the ""big three"" cloud players, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are getting a lot of moving parts that have nothing to do with cloud computing. In this vein, Oracle has become one of the best ways to invest in high-octane cloud growth, somewhat similar to how investors are drawn to Nvidia. Nvidia has become a pure-play AI stock because its data center business is now magnitudes larger than its gaming and professional visualization markets.
Broadcom and Oracle's stock prices are running up far faster than they are growing earnings because investors are buying these stocks for where they could be years from now rather than where they are today. Forward earnings estimates will probably increase as analysts adjust their targets based on recent results and guidance. But for now, Broadcom's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a staggering 54.8 compared to 48.2 for Oracle. For context, Nvidia's forward P/E is 39.5 -- meaning investors are even more excited about Broadcom and Oracle's growth.
Broadcom and Oracle are moving markets
The breakneck growth rates and size of Broadcom and Oracle prove why it's time to forget the Magnificent Seven and use the Ten Titans as a better descriptor for market-moving growth stocks. Even folks who don't own the Ten Titans outright may be indirectly impacted through their holdings in index funds and exchange-traded funds.
In addition to their foundational role in the major indexes, the Ten Titans will likely make or break broader market sentiment. If the S&P 500 keeps making new highs, it's probably because of the Ten Titans. If it undergoes a major sell-off, it's probably because a few key Titans fell. You may have even seen headlines about how the S&P 500 is expensive relative to its historical valuation. That's because many of the Ten Titans are valued more for their future earnings than their current profits. So investors should only approach these stocks if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term time horizon, and believe these companies can deliver on highly optimistic expectations.
It's also worth noting the correlation that these companies can have. For example, Oracle's blowout quarter sent Broadcom and Nvidia soaring on Sept. 10 because Oracle is a major customer of these chip makers. Increased AI spending to build out OCI benefits Broadcom and Nvidia. Although Oracle may account for less than 2% of the S&P 500, its results had a significantly larger impact on the S&P 500 than the movement in its stock price alone."

With AI looking like it has the potential to be a once-in-a-generation technological innovation, this is an area where you want to invest.
Let's look at two AI stocks that still look cheap and could have plenty of upside ahead.
1. Alphabet
Even after its rally this year, Alphabet (GOOGL 2.13%) (GOOG 2.17%) is still cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 22.5 based on 2026 estimates. That's a discount to most of its megacap AI peers, despite the fact that Alphabet has a much more diversified business model and arguably the best portfolio of emerging bets with robotaxis and quantum computing.
Investors were worried that AI would eat into Google Search, but search revenue growth actually accelerated last quarter, and new AI features like AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving more queries, not fewer.
The recent Department of Justice ruling also removed the worst-case scenario for the company. Alphabet gets to keep its crown jewels, Chrome and Android, and its search deal with Apple is still largely intact.
That means Alphabet maintains its distribution edge. With Chrome controlling over two-thirds of the browser market and Android powering over nearly three-quarters of smartphones, Google remains the default entry point to the internet for billions of users. Meanwhile, people tend to stick with defaults.
On top of that, Alphabet is quickly integrating AI into search in ways that boost engagement and increase monetization. New features like Lens and Circle to Search are driving incremental queries, often with a shopping intent. That helps feed into one of Alphabet's biggest strengths: its huge global ad network. Alphabet is a master at monetizing search through advertising, and there is no reason it won't be able to apply the same principles when it comes to AI queries.
At the same time, Alphabet's cloud computing business, Google Cloud, is booming. Revenue soared 32% last quarter while segment profits more than doubled. The entire cloud computing industry is currently capacity-constrained, as organizations rush to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. However, once the rush is over, Alphabet has the advantage of being vertically integrated, with everything from its world-class Gemini AI model to custom AI chips that help give it a cost advantage.
Taken altogether, Alphabet is one of the best megacap tech stocks out there, and at its current valuation, it could have a lot more room to run.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%) is one of the most important companies in the AI space, and at just 23 times 2026 earnings estimates, it is a bargain for a company that makes the AI boom possible.
TSMC is the heart and soul of the semiconductor industry. It manufactures the vast majority of advanced semiconductors for the leading players in the industry. While there are other foundries, none can consistently produce advanced chips at scale with strong yields.
Competitors like Intel and Samsung have tried to catch up but continue to struggle with yield issues. Intel is still losing money in its foundry business, while Samsung has lost key contracts like Google's Tensor G5 chip. For all intents and purposes, this has left TSMC as the only game in town for making advanced chips at scale.
Chip designers are constantly looking to shrink nodes, which is the number of transistors that can fit on a chip. This helps chips become more powerful and energy-efficient, and TSMC has been the only foundry able to deliver adequate yields for chips at smaller nodes.
Demand for AI chips, meanwhile, remains red-hot. Nvidia has predicted that the AI infrastructure market will hit $3 trillion to $4 trillion over the next five years, while TSMC management has forecast that AI chip demand will increase at a more than 40% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. In addition, given its dominant position in the foundry space, TSMC also has strong pricing power, with reports saying it will raise prices by 10% next year.
Beyond AI, TSMC could also benefit from growth in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and quantum computing. With an attractive valuation, this makes it a top AI stock to own for the long term."

Did you come up with a new acronym? I see aren't you out there pushing a new uh acronym on social media? What what is this all about?
I did. I tried my best yesterday and I came up with Gamaton, which uh, you know, sort of sort of gets uh gets the Mag 7 plus. It actually was meant to include Broadcom, truthfully. I forgot the B and and actually Broadcom you could either do an A or a B. so I may have to make it gamma with an extra A, but um basically that would be my that would be my next thought here is uh because you know, I think
we're we're definitely broadening out our focus and I and I think from hearing the the uh the you know, the speakers you heard, they were all tech heavy people. So I do want to hear a little bit more from end users, uh because, you know, the the the crowd strike user was very the crowd strike person was was was very clear about how AI could be used, but it's still not clear that it's all filtering down, let's say to, you know, ordinary companies. And and it took the internet a long time for that to happen.
Um, but so in the meantime, I think Oracle has to be at least included among the big boys. And again, I I I regret that I did not find a place for Broadcom because I've actually been advocating it for uh a great eight or a Mag 7 plus for some time."

The momentum is not just a short-term story either, as the stock has climbed 15.2% year-to-date and is up 21.3% over the past twelve months. What is behind this steady positive performance, and is it likely to continue?
Recent headlines may have something to do with the renewed enthusiasm. IBM is making waves as a leader in the race for quantum computing, positioning itself alongside giants like Google and Microsoft in a high-stakes competition to achieve what experts call ""Quantum advantage."" This kind of cutting-edge tech news, combined with past innovations and strategic management changes, has kept investor interest strong, even as some headlines have raised questions around broader tech industry topics.
But here is the real question: does the price accurately reflect IBM's true value? Valuation is where things get interesting. According to a quick check across six standard valuation metrics, IBM is undervalued in 2 out of 6, giving it a value score of 2. That number might raise eyebrows among cautious investors and offer a clue to potential upside or hidden risks.
Up next, we will break down each major valuation approach, from traditional discounted cash flows to multiples, unpacking what goes into the score and where the usual methods might fall short. Stick around, because at the end, we will share a smarter way to cut through the noise on IBM's true worth.
International Business Machines scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: International Business Machines Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model forecasts the company's future free cash flows and then discounts those projections back to today's dollars to estimate what the business is worth right now. For International Business Machines, this approach begins with a look at its latest reported Free Cash Flow, which stands at $11.48 billion. Analysts provide concrete estimates for the first five years, projecting steady growth. Simply Wall St extrapolates further to cover a full decade.
By 2027, Free Cash Flow is forecasted to reach approximately $15.52 billion, with projections extending out to $21.31 billion in 2035. Early estimates rely on analyst input, while long-term numbers are modeled based on historical data and anticipated trends within the company and broader IT industry."

These two companies are currently the third and fourth largest in the world by market cap, so neither is likely to provide market-crushing returns. As a result, investors need to determine if either of them can outperform the market over the long term; otherwise, they aren't worth owning.
I believe there is a clear better buy between the two right now, and this stock could easily outperform the market over the next five years, while the other may struggle to do so. Which one is it? The answer may surprise you.
Both businesses want to maintain the status quo
Both Apple and Alphabet have some of the most recognizable brands on the planet. Apple's ecosystem is centered around the iPhone, with accessories and laptops to create a leading consumer technology brand. Alphabet is the parent company of many businesses, but its most notable brand is Google. Google is how the vast majority of people access the right content on the internet, although that notion is under distress.
Many investors believe that generative AI could replace Google, although that remains to be seen. Google remains the top search engine used by many, and with its recent integration of AI search overviews, it has also evolved to adapt to this AI-centric view.
Additionally, Alphabet recently won a court case that allowed it to stay in its current state and continue paying Apple for the right to be the default search engine on its iPhones. This helps ensure Alphabet's status quo is maintained, and is an extremely positive sign for investors.
Apple is thriving on the status quo, as it hasn't really released a new feature or technology in recent years. That may change at its next release event, but investors will need to see what the market demand is for anything that Apple releases, as it could be a flop.
At their core, Alphabet and Apple are two businesses that want to maintain the status quo while expanding when possible. This doesn't really distinguish either of them from the other, so we'll need to examine their finances to determine the true best buy.
Winner: Tie
Alphabet is putting up better growth figures
Since 2023, Apple's growth has been practically nonexistent. That changed in Q3 FY2025 (ending June 28), when it delivered 10% revenue growth and 12% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth.
AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Still, that pales in comparison to Alphabet's growth, which has been far stronger for much longer. In Q2, Alphabet's revenue rose by 14% and diluted EPS increased by 22%. That continues a long-standing streak of Alphabet outperforming Apple from this standpoint, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that pattern continue.
Alphabet's faster growth stems from some of its other divisions, such as Google Cloud and Waymo. Both of these have massive upside and provide growth wings that Apple can't match.
As a result, I think it's fairly clear that Alphabet has far better growth than Apple.
Winner: Alphabet
Alphabet's stock is far cheaper
Valuation is another important consideration, as it's possible that the slower-growing company can be the better investment if it's priced cheap enough. However, that's not the case here. Apple's stock is significantly more expensive than Alphabet's, despite the latter's much slower growth.
Although they used to trade at a similar price-to-earnings (P/E) price tag, a significant gap has opened up since mid-2024. However, after reviewing the growth charts from above, it's clear that Alphabet has grown much faster than Apple during this time frame.
As a result, Apple's stock has become far more expensive than it normally is, while Alphabet is just returning to its usual valuation range. This makes Alphabet a far better buy considering its growth.
Winner: Alphabet"

Investors saw this as a green light to return, with concerns about a forced breakup now off the table and Alphabet’s competitive position reaffirmed for the foreseeable future.
This verdict arrived as Alphabet’s shares had already shown strong momentum, rising over 8% after the ruling last week and delivering a 54% gain for investors over the past year. Even before the legal clarity, the company’s ongoing investments in AI and cloud have fueled new growth narratives, and the resolution of regulatory uncertainty seems to have amplified market confidence. Momentum appears to be building, especially as Alphabet moves past a year clouded by risk and positions the company to pursue new opportunities tied to evolving tech trends.
With regulatory headwinds diminishing and a fresh wave of optimism rolling in, the next big question is whether Alphabet offers a genuine buying opportunity at today’s price or if the market has already baked in all that future growth.

Mastercard Investment Narrative Recap
If you’re a Mastercard shareholder, you likely believe in the ongoing digital shift in payments, the company’s powerful network effects, and its ability to grow by expanding into new revenue streams like AI-powered services. The recent launch of AI tools and expanded partnerships has the potential to support growth drivers, especially deeper collaboration with tech partners for value-added services, but the most important short-term catalyst remains increasing digital and e-commerce transaction volume. For now, these AI announcements don’t fundamentally alter the biggest risk: faster adoption of alternative payment rails in key emerging markets.
Among the recent announcements, the release of Mastercard’s On-Demand Decisioning (ODD) stands out. This solution offers financial institutions more direct control and flexibility over transaction approvals, supporting the broader catalyst of helping partners automate, personalize and scale digital payments. As Mastercard continues to expand its value-added services beyond core payments, such tools could help reinforce its differentiated service offering.
However, investors should be aware that while Mastercard accelerates innovation, an even faster shift by consumers and merchants to alternative payment options could...

Nowhere is this shift more evident than among the cloud hyperscalers -- Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon -- as well as other tech titans like Meta Platforms and Oracle.
In just this year alone, Meta committed $14.3 billion to Scale AI and launched a new research hub, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). It also signed a six-year, $10 billion agreement with Google Cloud. Meanwhile, Microsoft just struck a $17.4 billion deal with Nebius, a rising neocloud specialist.
At the center of this unprecedented wave of AI infrastructure spending stands one clear beneficiary: Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). Whether directly or indirectly, the graphics processing unit (GPU) powerhouse is capturing a significant chunk of the money being spent on AI infrastructure.
Let's explore how big tech is reshaping the AI landscape -- and why these secular tailwinds point to further significant upside for Nvidia.
AI infrastructure spending has accelerated since the launch of ChatGPT
The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 ignited an unprecedented AI arms race among the world's largest companies. What's important to recognize is that their capital expenditures in this battle are not plateauing -- they're accelerating.
Data from Goldman Sachs underscores just how dramatic these dynamics have become. In 2021, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft collectively had capex of about $100 billion. By next year, Wall Street expects that figure to approach nearly $500 billion.
What does this mean for Nvidia?
Training and deploying large language models (LLMs) and building generative AI applications demands extraordinary amounts of computing power. GPUs are parallel processors, which makes them some of the best chips available to provide the type of computing power AI workloads require. Today, Nvidia commands a more than 90% share of the GPU market, giving it a dominant position within the AI supply chain.
A significant portion of the AI capex surge is flowing directly into GPUs and the supporting data center equipment necessary to maximize their performance.
This dynamic places Nvidia in a uniquely enviable position as the backbone of modern AI development -- and it's poised to capture incremental budget allocations as hyperscalers and other data center operators race to secure its next-generation chips the moment they become available.
Is Nvidia stock a buy?
The magnitude of hyperscaler infrastructure investment reflects more than the world's apparently insatiable appetite for AI computing power. It underscores a deeper reality: AI is becoming the central growth engine for these companies, and securing access to the most advanced chips has shifted from being a matter of technological advantage to being a matter of competitive survival.
The accelerating pace of this spending suggests that corporations are still in the early stages of implementing their AI playbooks. Far from being a speculative bubble, this wave of infrastructure investment is the result of deliberate, long-term strategic planning by some of the world's most influential companies as they pivot away from their traditional priorities and take on sophisticated projects in robotics, autonomous systems, cybersecurity, and more.
For Nvidia, this dynamic should translate into sustained pricing power for its wares, durable recurring demand, and a multiyear runway for rapid growth. Its GPUs and CUDA software platform have become the gold standard for enterprise AI tech stacks.
Taken together, these tailwinds suggest that Nvidia could experience meaningful valuation expansion from here. As the infrastructure chapter of the AI narrative continues to unfold, Nvidia appears well positioned to remain as a core enabler of big tech's transformation.
For these reasons, I see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer investment, and view it as one of the most compelling buy-and-hold opportunities in the market."

Sorting through this pricey terrain to find bargains can feel akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.
Amid the pile of stocks with elevated prices, there remain a few diamonds in the rough, quality companies trading at reasonable valuations. If you have $5,000 available to invest that isn't needed for monthly bills, to bolster an emergency fund, or to pay down short-term debt, you might want to consider putting it toward buying shares of either (or both) of these value stocks. Here's why.
UnitedHealth Group
UnitedHealth Group (UNH 0.24%) has faced a turbulent 2025 so far, with its stock price down nearly 32% since the start of the year. The company has had to manage several issues.
For one, the health insurer is facing multiple federal investigations that have added significant legal and reputational pressure. The Department of Justice (DOJ) launched both civil and criminal probes into alleged upcoding, where patients are categorized into higher-cost tiers to boost reimbursements. Investigators are also examining its pharmacy benefit manager as the government increases its scrutiny on healthcare ""middlemen.""
On top of that, the company underestimated the acceleration of medical trends when setting premiums for 2025, especially in its government-backed segments. Its 2025 pricing assumptions were well short of actual medical costs. For example, care activity increased at twice the rate anticipated for its Medicare Advantage business in the first quarter. There has been a sharp rise in medical cost ratios, which worsened by 430 basis points to 89.4% in the second quarter.
This spike in care utilization caught the company off guard, resulting in an earnings miss in the second quarter, as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $4.08, significantly below forecasts. The company slashed its full-year earnings guidance to $16 per share, down from its initial midpoint guidance of $26.25 per share earlier this year.
Analysts have lowered price targets across the board as UnitedHealth stock sold off over the past several months, and this year is now being viewed as a reset year. The company maintains a significant share of the U.S. health insurance market. And optimism persists for 2026, hinging on premium adjustments, provider renegotiations, and growth in the Optum segment.
With the stock priced at 19.4 times next year's forecast earnings, $5,000 will get you almost 14 shares. UnitedHealth is relatively cheap on a historical basis and has some potential for investors seeking a bargain in an otherwise expensive market.
Alphabet
Despite its status as one of the world's largest tech giants, Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) trades at a forward P/E ratio in the mid-20s (the S&P 500 P/E is at 30.2). $5,000 will get you almost 21 shares. This pricing is appealing considering Alphabet's commanding market position and the high margins of its core search business.
It's a powerhouse in the search arena, processing 5 trillion queries annually and boasting over 2 billion users across diverse platforms, including Android, YouTube, Gmail, and the Play Store. The search division stands as a reliable cash cow, generating a whopping $104.9 billion in the first half of this year alone while growing 11%.
While there have been discussions about the potential impact of large language models on its search business, Google is adapting with its own models. Its AI Overviews, powered by Gemini, are already driving an extra 10% in global queries for relevant searches. Its monetization trends remain consistent even with the integration of these AI Overviews.
There are other upsides to the business. For example, ventures like Waymo and the AI infrastructure present promising growth prospects. Waymo, which started as an ambitious ""moonshot,"" has morphed into a leader in fully autonomous driving technology. Its service expansion now accommodates over a quarter of a million paid passenger trips weekly -- a fivefold surge from just a year ago.
Meanwhile, Google Cloud is riding a wave of strong customer demand, bolstered by its AI product portfolio. Deals exceeding $250 million have doubled year over year, and the influx of new Google Cloud Platform customers has surged by nearly 28% quarter over quarter.
With over $95 billion in cash reserves, Alphabet holds a strong position of flexibility to both return capital and invest in future growth, making it an attractive technology stock to buy in today's pricey market."

The opportunity ahead is still massive, so this is an area that most investors will want some exposure to.
Here are five top AI stocks to buy as September rolls on.
1. Nvidia
No company has benefited more from the buildout of AI infrastructure than Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). Its graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the gold standard for powering the training of large language models (LLMs), and its popular CUDA software platform helped give it a moat that competitors have yet to crack. Meanwhile, its networking revenue is also soaring, with demand for its NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X products leading to a 98% year-over-year surge in Q2 data center networking revenue to $7.3 billion.
While its Blackwell chips are already the leading hardware for providing processing power for training, Nvidia said that those GPUs also set the standard for inference, which could eventually become a much bigger market than training. With AI infrastructure projected to be a multitrillion-dollar market in the coming years, Nvidia has more than enough room to keep growing.
The stock has had a massive run, but the momentum behind AI spending means Nvidia remains a top pick for long-term investors.
2. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) has emerged as the go-to name for custom AI chips, which are becoming critical as hyperscalers (operators of massive data centers) look to lower their inference costs and reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Broadcom already counts Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%), Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), and ByteDance among its customers, and management projects that these relationships alone could be worth $60 billion to $90 billion by its fiscal 2027 (which ends October 2027).
However, things got even better for shareholders after Broadcom revealed that a fourth customer, presumably OpenAI, had placed a massive $10 billion order for next year. The pace at which Broadcom is able to design custom AI chips appears to be accelerating, which bodes well for its growth, especially with Apple having been earlier revealed as a fifth major customer.
Throw in Broadcom's strong networking business and its VMware arm, which positions it as a software player in AI infrastructure, and this is a company with a lot of growth potential. Investors looking for diversified AI winners beyond Nvidia should have this stock near the top of their lists.
3. Advanced Micro Devices
The next battleground in the AI chip wars looks like it will be for inference. While Nvidia and Broadcom are both well positioned for this fight, don't count Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%) out. AMD has already been carving out a role in this space. Seven of the 10 biggest AI operators already use its GPUs, with one major AI company running a significant amount of inference on AMD chips.
AMD, along with Broadcom and others, also helped form the UALink Consortium to create an open-source interconnect standard. This could loosen the grip that Nvidia has established on that score with its NVLink offering, and allow companies to more easily mix and match AI chips from different vendors. That would be hugely beneficial for AMD.
On top of that, AMD's central processing units (CPUs) continue to gain traction in data centers. The revenue gap between Nvidia and AMD is still massive, which is why even modest market share gains in the GPU segment could drive AMD's numbers significantly higher. That opportunity makes the stock a compelling buy.
4. Alphabet
Alphabet just dodged what could have been a big problem when the judge in its antitrust case opted not to require it to sell its Chrome browser. That preserved one of the company's most important advantages in search: distribution. That foundation, with Chrome and Android, gives Google an advantage that will be difficult for AI upstarts to overcome.
The company is now layering AI on top of search. Its AI Overviews are already being used by more than 2 billion people each month, and it's rolling out AI Mode around the world in different languages. Meanwhile, its Gemini large-language models are among the best in the industry, and giving users the option to toggle between AI Mode and traditional search inside Google is another edge. Importantly, Alphabet knows how to monetize users, whether through traditional search or AI.
Beyond search, Google Cloud has been a powerful growth engine for Alphabet as companies rush to cloud computing providers to help build out their own AI models and apps and run them on cloud infrastructure. Meanwhile, its custom chips -- made with the help of Broadcom -- have given it a cost advantage. Add in other bets like its Waymo robotaxi business and its quantum computing efforts, and Alphabet is well-positioned for the future.
5. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms has reinvented itself with AI, turning what many thought was a fading social media company into one of the best growth stories out there. Its Llama models are improving user experiences by serving up more engaging content, while advertisers get access to better targeting and ad campaign tools. That combination led to a 22% year-over-year jump in ad revenue last quarter, with both impressions and ad prices moving higher. Meta is also just starting to run ads on WhatsApp and Threads, opening up new growth avenues.
Yet CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ambitions go well beyond ads. He has talked openly about building ""personal superintelligence"" and has been recruiting aggressively to make it happen.
With its huge operating cash flow, Meta can afford to chase big opportunities in AI, and it already benefits from AI-driven gains in its core business. That makes Meta an AI stock to own."

She was founding CMO of Pharmacy2U Group, the UK’s leading online pharmacy.
I was born into a family of engineers and I remember when Dad brought one of the first CD players over from France to Russia, where we were living at the time. Tech was part of the world we grew up in.
When I later landed a job at Google (GOOG) in marketing and told Dad I was thinking of taking it, his reaction was: “It’s a white page. What are you marketing?” But Google's homepage was offbeat to everything else you were seeing on the web at the time.
I was hired in 2005 by Lorraine Twohill, who is now Google’s (GOOG) global CMO. She was a very strategic stakeholder manager, not in the political sense, but in how to get things done in the most collegial and fastest way.
For me, it was an art of strategic preparation. What she taught me was that leadership is not always about having all the answers. A lot of your work is about collaborating with others and bringing input from people.

Neither diversity nor gender parity were part of any mainstream or business conversation in the early 2000s. The tech industry is still male-dominated, but even more so 20 years ago.
Now, in hindsight, I realise how lucky I was to encounter senior female leaders in that environment in my first major job. It built my sense of belonging. I never felt like I was the odd one out and it impacted my whole career in tech and my ability to see myself in it later on.
Every time Lorraine had to push forward a project or get approval, she would engage with every stakeholder, gather their input, address their concerns and only then show up at the big meeting.
Many people come thinking they are prepared because they’ve done the work, but they haven’t brought people along. Lorraine would come in almost knowing it would be approved. I learned that you shouldn’t do it all alone. Input from other people is strategic intelligence and increases your chances of success.
At Google (GOOG) there were a lot of decisions by consensus. That might feel counterintuitive in a business that moves fast and innovates, but they gathered the wisdom of the crowds and then took decisions. As the business grew, you needed alignment to get anything done.
Lorraine was the first person I saw doing that well and sometimes she asked me to prepare for that work too. She was nurturing and even when she had an office, she still mostly sat outside. I remember negotiating my first salary increase with her directly."

Since then, investor concern over the potential consequences dampened Alphabet stock's performance.
That changed on Sept. 2, when a federal judge finally delivered the legal penalties, and they largely favored Alphabet. The news sent the company's stock to a record high.
Even so, Alphabet didn't escape unscathed. While the penalties pose no immediate threat, over the long run, the possibility exists for damage to its critical artificial intelligence (AI) business. Digging into the court ruling's implications can reveal if the tech titan's AI aspirations face long-term risk.
How the court's decision affects Alphabet's AI ambitions
The Sept. 2 legal ruling bars Alphabet from signing exclusive contracts with partners such as Apple. Deals are still allowed, as long as exclusivity isn't a component, so no immediate revenue impact is involved here.
But another legal stipulation mandates sharing some of Google's search data with competitors. This is where AI comes in.
Artificial intelligence relies on massive troves of data to perform tasks accurately. The court's decision arms Alphabet's rivals with ammunition to improve their AI models.
That competition includes Microsoft, which battles Alphabet on several fronts, including search, digital advertising, cloud computing, and of course, AI. The court's requirement would deliver Google's data insights to Microsoft's Bing search engine, and feed across all the areas where the two corporations compete. But where it can really provide value is in AI.
Microsoft incorporates AI models developed by ChatGPT creator OpenAI into its offerings, since it has a stake in the company. ChatGPT's introduction of generative AI to the world is one of the key drivers that kicked off the current artificial intelligence frenzy. Adding Google data to the mix could strengthen both Microsoft and OpenAI's tech.
In fact, the judge who delivered the Sept. 2 ruling, Amit Mehta, noted, ""The emergence of GenAI changed the course of this case.""
Is Alphabet's AI position at risk?
Alphabet has the option to appeal the court's penalties, but even if it doesn't, the tech conglomerate's impressive use of AI to date could be enough to prevent erosion of its businesses.
For instance, new AI features introduced to its Google search engine boosted usage. This enabled Google search revenue to hit $54.2 billion in the second quarter, up 12% from 2024's $48.5 billion.
Alphabet's AI advancements helped Google maintain a search market share of 90% in August, compared to next-closest competitor Bing's 4%. Even if Google's data helps Bing gain share, the gap between the rivals is so huge, Bing is unlikely to make a meaningful dent in Google's lead anytime soon.
AI contributed to growth in Alphabet's cloud computing segment, Google Cloud, as well. The division is bringing AI-powered shopping capabilities to PayPal. Such customer adoption of AI drove Google Cloud's Q2 sales to $13.6 billion, a whopping 32% year-over-year increase.
Should cloud competitors improve their AI with Google data, the difference would have to be significant to get Alphabet's customers to switch. Google Cloud integrations aren't easily unfurled, leading to high switching costs.
Beyond search and cloud computing, Alphabet has injected AI into YouTube, its Waymo robotaxi service, Gmail, and more.
Alphabet isn't out of the woods yet
Overall, Alphabet dodged a bullet in the Google search antitrust case. The legal penalties could have been as far-ranging as a forced divestiture of its popular Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.
Considering these worst-case scenarios, Alphabet got off pretty light, and the ruling's impact to its business over the long term looks minimal. The conglomerate's widespread use of AI across its operations gives it a solid lead against competitors who may benefit from access to Google data.
But the legal dangers aren't over yet. Earlier this year, Alphabet lost a separate antitrust case directed against its advertising empire. The penalties in that case are yet to be determined. However, Google was slapped with a $3.5 billion antitrust fine by the European Union on Sept. 5 for violating rules designed to protect a competitive advertising marketplace.
Compared to the Google search case, this separate antitrust lawsuit poses a lower risk. That's because it involves advertising tech related to the company's Google network, which produced $7.35 billion in Q2 sales, a drop from the $7.44 billion generated in the previous year. By comparison, Google search accounted for $54.2 billion of Alphabet's $96.4 billion in Q2 revenue.
So while Alphabet isn't out of legal trouble yet, the biggest long-term risk to its business is behind it, as long as the conglomerate can continue pushing AI innovation across its operations."
