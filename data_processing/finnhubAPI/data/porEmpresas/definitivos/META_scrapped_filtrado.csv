SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP), the nonprofit international organization bringing at-scale innovations and hyperscale best practices to all, announces an expansion to its Open Systems for AI, an umbrella initiative with the new Open Data Center for AI Strategic Initiative (SI), to increase efforts on key data center infrastructure challenges: power, cooling, mechanical, and management telemetry. The addition of this new strategic initiative is in response to a large increase in data center physical infrastructure projects and workstreams launched in the past year, learnings from the OCP Open Systems for AI SI workshop series, and the new open-letter call for collaboration. With strong support from the OCP Board and stakeholders, the Foundation invites other organizations to sign this letter, which was initiated by Google, Meta, and Microsoft.. This underscores the OCP Foundation's mission to support the entire open data center ecosystem, covering IT as well as physical data center infrastructure and facilities.
The mandate of the Open Data Center for AI SI is to develop standardizations for data center infrastructure allowing advanced high-density AI infrastructure to be deployed as flexibly as traditional compute where facilities are built with a common understanding of management telemetry, advanced power and cooling technologies to enable simpler deployment of a wide variety of AI solutions. The issue faced by data center partners including hyperscalers, neoclouds, co-location providers, enterprise users, and technology providers is that siloed efforts produce competing design requirements that slows innovations and extends deployment timelines. The goal is to identify and specify requirements for AI data centers such that the physical infrastructure common ground enables fungibility for a diverse AI IT infrastructure, especially while aspects of the AI IT elements are rapidly evolving. This will enable colocation data center providers to support a wider range of tenants with fewer customizations.
""The OCP Community's vision of the open data center ecosystem continues to enable solving the challenges of building at-scale AI clusters and the infrastructure that houses them. We are continuing to utilize OCP's open, collaborative, and unique value proposition and its large community and ecosystem to develop open specifications and standards that address the bottlenecks that threaten to constrain the future of AI growth. We firmly believe OCP's role in fostering development of open, standardized, sustainable, and scalable infrastructure to be increasingly vital to the industry and its supply chain enabling it to deliver on AI's transformative potential cost effectively and with faster TTM, while managing its environmental impact,"" said George Tchaparian, CEO at the Open Compute Project Foundation."

The DGX Spark, which Nvidia said offers data center-class performance, packs the company's GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, as well as its ConnectX-7 networking capabilities and software stack.
The idea is to provide smaller businesses and developers with access to an AI computing system without requiring them to spend thousands on renting AI data center services or buying their own AI servers.
The Spark is part of a new class of computer Nvidia is rolling out with third-party partners, including ASUS (2357.TW) and Dell (DELL), which will allow customers to develop and use AI models on their own local devices.
Nvidia said the Spark can be outfitted with up to 128GB of memory, which should help when running massive AI models.
“In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon [Musk] at a small startup called OpenAI — and from it came ChatGPT, kickstarting the AI revolution,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
“DGX-1 launched the era of AI supercomputers and unlocked the scaling laws that drive modern AI. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.”
Like the DGX-1, Huang also hand-delivered one of the first Spark systems to Musk.
The company also has a larger, more powerful DGX Station, which runs on Nvidia's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra desktop superchip.
But don't expect to grab a Spark or Station and start running your video games or other apps. The system runs on Nvidia's own Linux-based DGX OS and its AI software stack and is specifically designed for building and running AI models.
Nvidia also said users can connect two Spark systems to allow for even larger AI models with up to 405 billion parameters.
The Spark and Station are designed to complement Nvidia's existing AI offerings, enabling users to prototype AI models before deploying them more widely.
Nvidia holds the pole position in the AI chip race thanks to both its powerful processors and CUDA software service.
In addition to its desktop systems, the company continues to ink massive deals with AI companies, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) that will see the ChatGPT developer purchase 10 gigawatts of GPUs.
Last month, Nvidia signed a deal that will see CoreWeave (CRWV) purchase $6.3 billion worth of GPUs from the chip giant.
The company is also providing GPUs to Elon Musk's xAI (XAAI.PVT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and a slew of other tech behemoths — not to mention OpenAI and Oracle's (ORCL) joint Stargate Project venture."

What Is The Market Telling Us
Nvidia’s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock dropped 3% after the threat of a 'massive increase' in tariffs on Chinese goods by President Donald Trump, reignited fears of a trade war.
In a social media post, Trump described China as becoming 'hostile,' sending a ripple of concern through the market. The semiconductor sector, which relies heavily on global supply chains and sales in China, was hit particularly hard. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index dropped 3.4% following the announcement. This development adds to existing tensions, including Beijing's recent expansion of export controls on rare earths and an antitrust probe into Qualcomm's acquisition of Autotalks. Investors are showing caution as the prospect of escalating trade disputes between the world's two largest economies could disrupt production and demand for chipmakers.
Nvidia is up 36.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $188.30 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $192.57 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $13,215.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Designed with end-to-end encryption and creator-first privacy, Luffa is laying the foundation for a universal loyalty infrastructure that will connect creators, brands, and fans across digital and real-world experiences. Starting on a base level of direct messaging at launch creates the trusted, high-frequency interactions that long-term loyalty is built on. Luffa's upcoming loyalty features, currently in beta, will expand this foundation into a connected rewards ecosystem for creators and fans. In this role, Ozturk will lead product strategy and execution as the company evolves its secure messaging layer into the next generation of fan-loyalty technology.
Ozturk brings to Luffa deep experience building global consumer products across social, marketplace, and commerce platforms. At Meta, she helped take Instagram Reels from early experiments to global launch. At Uber, she led safety and quality initiatives that strengthened marketplace integrity, improving driver earnings, reducing cancellations, and building trust across the platform. She later built tools at Zillow that helped agents and loan officers convert more buyers into funded loans, and led machine learning work at Instacart to detect fraud and reduce unnecessary refunds. Her product career began in college, contributing to Snapchat's story search feature - the foundation for what became Snap Maps. Her career is defined by turning user insight into systems that scale with clarity and impact - the kind of product leadership Luffa needs as it evolves from secure fan communication to a connected loyalty ecosystem.
""The next generation of loyalty won't be owned by any single platform,"" said Ozturk. ""Today, loyalty spans creators, brands, live experiences, and digital communities, but it's fragmented. At Luffa, we're starting with secure, decentralized messaging as the backbone, and building toward a portable identity and reward layer that travels wherever fans go. We're laying the infrastructure that turns engagement into value for creators, brands, and their communities alike.""
""Esra's track record of building products people love at global scale, and navigating the complexity of multi-stakeholder platforms, is exactly what we envisioned for this next stage of Luffa's growth,"" said Yu Xiong, founding advisor of Luffa. ""As we expand from encrypted messaging into loyalty and rewards, her leadership will help evolve Luffa into the connective infrastructure linking creators, brands, and fans."""

South Korean investors turned their Chuseok holiday into a week of aggressive risk-taking, funneling $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets while domestic markets were closed between October 3 and 9.
Key Takeaways:
- South Korean investors poured $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets during the Chuseok holiday week.
- Top buys included Tesla, Meta, and Bitcoin mining stocks, with leveraged ETFs leading the surge.
- The buying spree ended abruptly as US–China trade tensions triggered a global market pullback.
Instead of taking time off during the country’s Thanksgiving break, retail investors piled into leveraged ETFs and high-growth stocks, according to data from the Korea Securities Depository.
Korean Investors Flock to Tesla, Meta, and Bitcoin Miner Stocks
The most popular target was the Direxion Daily Tesla Bull 2X ETF, a leveraged fund that amplifies Tesla’s stock movements, with net purchases totaling $151 million.
Other top buys included $105 million in Iris Energy, an Australian Bitcoin mining firm; $100 million in Meta Platforms, and $96 million in Tesla shares themselves.
Another leveraged crypto play, the T-REX 2X Long BMNR Daily Target ETF, which tracks Bitmine Immersion Technologies with double exposure, ranked fifth among foreign purchases at around $95 million.
The spree followed a strong rally in Seoul, where the Kospi Index hit new highs before the holiday amid optimism over US tech resilience and local stimulus plans.
With Korean exchanges closed, that bullish sentiment appeared to spill overseas as investors chased Wall Street’s momentum.
But timing may have worked against them. The surge in cross-border buying came just days before global markets tumbled on renewed US–China trade tensions, erasing part of the previous week’s gains.
Analysts say it remains to be seen whether Korean retail traders, known for their risk appetite and agility, will maintain such aggressive exposure.
The Kospi reopened 1.7% lower on Monday, slipping back below the 3,600 level and hinting that the Chuseok rally may have been short-lived.
South Korea Orders Crypto Exchanges to Halt Lending Services
In August, South Korea’s financial regulator moved to rein in risky lending practices in the digital asset sector, ordering local exchanges to suspend all crypto lending services until a proper regulatory framework is established.
The crackdown came amid South Korea’s broader pivot toward regulated crypto adoption. Authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country’s first spot crypto ETFs.
President Lee Jae Myung’s administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs.
More recently, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions.
The service stores all deposited digital assets in cold wallets, entirely offline and insulated from internet-based threats, to shield holdings from cyberattacks and other external breaches.

For instance, Susquehanna raised their price target to $400 from $300 last week after TSM reported a 31.4% increase in September sales (vs. Sep'24). And the Jan-Sep run-rate compares at +36.4% yoy.
Taiwan Semiconductor, aka TSMC, is the premier chip fabrication company for the world's most advanced digital technologies, from Apple smartphones to NVIDIA GPUs.
In less than five years, TSMC's trailing 12-month revenue has more than doubled to hit nearly $105 billion as of the June quarter. Clearly, this is on the back of NVIDIA's (NVDA) explosive growth which saw sales grow by ten times in the same period to $165 billion as of the July quarter, on its way to cross $205 billion this fiscal year (ends January).
Of course, demand for NVIDIA GPU systems didn't turn into a hockey stick until its ""ChatGPT moment"" in the spring of 2023.
I mark that moment in late May at Computex in Taipei City, Taiwan when Jensen Huang unveiled the DGX Grace Hopper 200 system and said that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms (META) were already in line.
To me, this meant that the other 996 corporations in the Fortune 1,000 would want (or need) to build their own LLMs too. I then published this article and video to explain what was coming...
Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion
And that $2 trillion market cap came quickly. That's when the ""AI bubble"" talk started. You can imagine how astonished the bubble breathers are now that NVDA is approaching a $5 trillion market cap.
""Honey, I Shrunk the Chips!""
While Apple's business has been significant for TSMC (as much as 25% of revenues), the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in the low single digits.
What still makes Apple very important though is how they help drive innovation at TSMC by always demanding the latest and greatest architectures for their ecosystem of devices.
TSMC supplies chips for flagship smartphones and 5G infrastructure, where efficiency and miniaturization are crucial. The company’s 5nm and 3nm transistor nodes are widely adopted in high-end mobile devices and 5G equipment, supporting the global rollout of next-generation connectivity.
Transistor nodes refer to the specific manufacturing processes used to produce integrated circuits, where the ""nm"" (nanometer = 1 billionth of a meter) like 7nm or 5nm, historically represented a physical dimension of the transistor, specifically the gate length. For reference, the coronavirus is about 50nm.
Now it's more of a marketing term that signifies a new generation of chip technology with improved performance, power efficiency, and transistor density.
But generally, a smaller node number means...
Smaller transistors: More transistors can be packed into the same area on a chip.
Faster switching: Electrons have a shorter distance to travel, leading to higher clock speeds.
Lower power consumption: Less voltage is needed to operate the smaller transistors.
Why the AI Economy is Not a Bubble
Which brings us back to NVIDIA as they now pack 208 billion transistors into the Grace Blackwell ""superchip"" with further density on the horizon in the Rubin and Feynman series of GPUs expected in 2026 and 2027, following Jensen's nearly annual cadence of development.
I mentioned the early demand for NVIDIA systems in 2023 and have recently seen similar projections from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Marvell (MRVL) at their Custom AI Investor Event that total datacenter capex by the big ""hyperscalers"" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) plus Meta, Tesla (TSLA), OpenAI, Apple, and xAI, will grow from nearly $600 billion this year to over $1 trillion in 2028.
This demand is not slowing down because all these companies realize that the transition to an ""AI economy"" is built on the infrastructure of NVIDIA GPU systems. I am on record late last year saying that this megatrend would lead to over $500 billion in revenues for NVIDIA by 2030. That's only ~35% CAGR from when the TTM topline crossed $100 billion.
And Citi just updated their industry outlook in their ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Energy"" report. The bank forecasts global AI infra capex at $5.5 trillion cumulative through 2029 (56% CAGR), hitting $2.16T in 2029 alone. So that's a double from 2028's $1 trillion.
And that's the infrastructure to power not just generative and agentic AI systems (i.e., LLMs), but a whole new world of ""physical AI"" for autonomous machines, including self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and many other types of 3D automation requiring ""embodied"" or edge intelligence and vision/spatial perception.
And of course my favorite use cases for these technologies are science and medicine, where researchers can plumb the depths of our existence and come back with wondrous and life-changing knowledge.
The training alone for these worlds requires enormous datasets and compute, using simulation and synthetic models. In this way, Jensen is forging a new universe of possibilities that keep TSMC ""fabs"" humming.
TSMC is the Backbone of the AI Economy
TSMC holds about 67% of the global foundry market and nearly 90% of advanced chip production, making it the preferred manufacturer for high-performance, custom AI accelerators and GPUs.
While NVIDIA designs the magical GPUs and systems that power the innovations of the AI Economy, it all starts with Taiwan Semi's advanced silicon fabrication. This is the epitome of high-tech manufacturing using lithographic etching to create circuits smaller than the eye can see.
And what's better for crafting new chips than brand new ""fabs"" as TSMC just broke ground on their 3rd facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In late June, Softbank's Masayoshi Son announced new plans to invest in a $1 trillion industrial complex in Arizona that will build robots and AI technologies.
Son is seeking to create a version of China's vast manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, which concentrates high-tech companies for proximity of resources, logistics, R&D, collaboration, and talent. TSMC was named as a key partner in Son's plans.
Currently for TSMC, the 5nm and 3nm nodes are the backbone for state-of-the-art AI accelerators, powering chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple that are used in generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.
In Q1 2025, 58% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from 3nm and 5nm nodes, with 73% from 7nm and below, underscoring the centrality of these advanced processes in TSMC's business and the broader tech ecosystem.
But TSMC wouldn't be itself if it wasn't planning to go deeper. The company plans to begin production of its 2nm node by late 2025, promising significant gains in power efficiency and performance. Looking further ahead, mass production of the 1.4nm (14 angstroms) process is slated for 2028, offering 10–15% higher speeds or 25–30% lower energy use compared to 2nm."

Each of these companies posted strong results last quarter, and there are good reasons to believe that strength can continue into the final stretch of the year. These stocks look attractive, not just heading into earnings, but for the long haul as well.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and last quarter's results showed just how strong demand for its chips has been. Its data center revenue surged 56% year over year, despite the company lacking access to the Chinese market, as companies and governments around the world continue to rapidly build out their AI infrastructure.
That trend does not look like it's slowing, with cloud computing companies continuing to spend big on data center infrastructure and Oracle announcing massive AI data center spending plans. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to dominate the AI infrastructure market, where its graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to power AI workloads and have an over 90% market share. Its CUDA software platform continues to give it a wide moat in the space, as most early AI code was written on it, and developers favor it.
With data center spending remaining strong and AI demand still outpacing supply, Nvidia's growth trajectory looks intact. The company has already proven that it can deliver consistent upside surprises, and it's positioned better than any of its peers to capture profits from the next leg of the AI infrastructure buildout.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has transformed itself into one of the biggest AI beneficiaries in tech, and that evolution showed up clearly in its last earnings report. The company posted 22% revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by an increase in ad impressions and higher prices. The number of daily active users across its family of apps also climbed by 6% year over year to 3.48 billion, proving that it can still draw in new users despite the maturity of its platforms.
AI has been the key driver behind Meta's resurgence. It has been using AI to improve how its algorithms recommend content, which is keeping users more engaged. That, in turn, increases the amount of ad inventory it can sell. At the same time, its AI tools for advertisers are helping companies create and target their marketing campaigns more effectively, which boosts Meta's ad pricing power.
Meanwhile, it is just starting to introduce ads to its biggest untapped assets, WhatsApp and Threads, both of which have huge growth potential. All these things should help keep the company's earnings momentum going.
Meta also isn't sitting still when it comes to innovation. It recently debuted its new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, sales of which could give its Q4 revenue a boost. These augmented reality glasses could also be a precursor to its eventual vision for things like ""superpersonal intelligence"" and the metaverse, which are longer-term bets.
3. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) capped off its fiscal 2025 with one of its best quarters in years, showing just how well it's executing across both cloud computing and AI. In its fiscal Q4, which ended June 30, revenue from its Azure cloud platform jumped by 39%, marking its eighth straight quarter of growth above 30%. Meanwhile, its Intelligent Cloud division as a whole grew by 26% to nearly $30 billion. That strength is being driven by companies accelerating their AI spending, with Azure being one of the biggest beneficiaries.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's early investments in OpenAI continue to give it an edge. Its Copilot AI tools, now integrated across Office products, are increasingly being adopted by enterprises to increase worker productivity. These products are still in their early innings, which means there's plenty of runway for growth left. Revenues from Microsoft 365 rose more than 20% last quarter, and even the company's personal computing segment saw renewed growth, led by Xbox and search advertising.
Microsoft is spending aggressively to expand its data center capacity to meet the flood of AI demand, which should keep growth strong in the quarters ahead. With Azure continuing to increase its sales in a rapidly growing cloud market, and with Copilot adding a valuable new layer of recurring revenue, Microsoft looks like one of the most reliable performers heading into this earnings season and a top long-term holding for investors."

Shares of Broadcom rose more than 12% in premarket trading.
The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts' worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam.
The agreement is the latest in a string of massive AI chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry's surging appetite for computing power as it races to build systems that meet or surpass human intelligence.
OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity.
""Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal.
CUSTOM CHIP BOOM
The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on Nvidia's costly processors that are limited in supply.
The approach is not a sure bet. Similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have run into delays or failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports, and analysts believe custom chips do not pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the short term.
The rise of custom chips has, however, turned Broadcom - long known for its networking hardware - into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022.
The company unveiled a blockbuster $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer that some analysts and market watchers speculated was OpenAI.
Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements."

TAIPEI, Taiwan, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TrendForce’s latest investigations reveal that the rapid expansion of AI server demand is propelling global cloud service providers (CSPs), such as Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu, to boost investments in NVIDIA’s rack-scale GPU solutions, data center expansion, and in-house AI ASIC design. Total CapEx from the eight major CSPs is expected to surpass US$420 billion in 2025, roughly equivalent to their combined spending in 2023 and 2024, marking a 61% YoY increase.
TrendForce predicts that as rack-scale solutions like GB/VR systems grow in 2026, the total CapEx of the eight CSPs will hit a new peak, surpassing US$520 billion with a 24% year-over-year rise. Additionally, investment priorities are moving from revenue-generating assets to short-lived infrastructure such as servers and GPUs, indicating a strategic emphasis on boosting long-term competitiveness and market share rather than immediate profits.
In 2025, NVIDIA’s GB200/GB300 rack systems are poised to become the main deployment targets for CSPs, driven by higher-than-anticipated demand growth. Besides North America’s leading four CSPs and Oracle, emerging customers such as Tesla/xAI, CoreWeave, and Nebius are increasing their purchases for AI cloud leasing and generative AI workloads. By 2026, CSPs are likely to shift from GB300 racks to the new NVIDIA Rubin VR200 rack platform in the latter half of the year.
Custom AI chip production continues to scale up
North America’s leading four CSPs are increasing their investments in AI ASICs to improve autonomy and manage costs for large-scale AI and LLM tasks. Google is partnering with Broadcom on the TPU v7p (Ironwood), an optimized platform for training, set to expand in 2026 and succeed the TPU v6e (Trilium). TrendForce predicts Google’s TPU shipments will stay the highest among CSPs, with over 40% annual growth in 2026.
AWS is prioritizing its Trainium v2 chips, with a liquid-cooled rack version expected by late 2025. The Trainium v3, developed jointly with Alchip and Marvell, is planned for mass production in early 2026. AWS’s ASIC shipments are anticipated to more than double in 2025, marking the fastest growth among major CSPs, with a further approximate 20% increase in 2026.
Meta is enhancing its partnership with Broadcom, with MTIA v2 set for mass production in Q4 2025 to boost inference efficiency and lower latency.

Here's how you can profit from it.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d1481812b45e762f8dfb5dd54afad5c56877b9fe277698b13dca7ca843874abb,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/5-reasons-to-buy-global-x-uranium-etf-stock-like-t/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/5-reasons-to-buy-global-x-uranium-etf-stock-like-t/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/5-reasons-to-buy-global-x-uranium-etf-stock-like-t/,fool.com,200,,"For years, nuclear energy has been pushed to the sidelines, grappling with a tarnished reputation. The catastrophic meltdown at Fukushima left many questioning whether this powerful energy source was truly worth the risk.
Fast forward to today. As global power demands surge and the push for cleaner energy intensifies, with tech giants like Microsoft and Meta Platforms leading the charge, nuclear energy is making a resurgence.
Enter the Global X Uranium ETF (URA 2.04%), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for investors seeking to capitalize on this renewed interest in nuclear power. Here's why adding the Uranium ETF to your portfolio could be a smart move.
1. Energy demand will rise significantly in the coming years
Energy demand in the U.S. and across the globe is rising. Driving this increased demand are power-hungry data centers that support artificial intelligence (AI) and technology like ChatGPT. Goldman Sachs forecasts that global data center power demand will surge 165% by 2030, primarily driven by the growth of AI.
Data centers are projected to use more energy, while the electrification of vehicles, heating, and industrial processes adds steady new baseload demand. Unlike past cycles, this surge is not cyclical but structural, tied to digital infrastructure, decarbonization mandates, and the reshoring of energy-intensive manufacturing.
Traditional efficiency gains from appliances and lighting are no longer sufficient to offset growth, and grid operators warn of capacity shortfalls in multiple regions.
2. Nuclear provides clean-burning, reliable fuel
As utilities scramble to expand their generation, nuclear power and natural gas are emerging as essential backstops, as renewables alone face challenges related to intermittency and transmission.
Nuclear power offers a unique solution, as it provides massive, steady baseload electricity without producing carbon emissions. Unlike fossil fuels, which release CO2 and pollutants, nuclear reactors generate power through fission, making them one of the cleanest large-scale energy sources available.
This positions nuclear as essential for achieving carbon-neutral goals, since it can complement intermittent renewables like wind and solar while displacing coal and natural gas. With governments and utilities under pressure to reduce emissions while meeting surging demand, nuclear energy offers a reliable and scalable path to cleaner energy and long-term climate commitments.
3. Countries are seeking energy security at home
For the U.S., nuclear energy enhances energy security by providing a stable, domestic power source that reduces dependence on foreign oil, gas, and enriched uranium from adversarial nations, such as Russia.
As geopolitical tensions rise, countries are diversifying away from supplier countries that could use energy as a form of leverage and shifting toward trusted partners and homegrown production. This creates an opportunity for nuclear power companies and uranium miners.
4. Supplies are low
Global uranium supplies and production capacity are relatively tight. Over the last decade, as nuclear energy fell out of favor, prices declined, and there was little incentive to invest in new mines, resulting in underinvestment and closures.
This, coupled with rising demand as nations expand nuclear fleets and advanced reactors approach deployment, will put pressure on current supplies. With utilities increasingly locking in long-term contracts, supply could fall short of demand later this decade. This imbalance sets the stage for higher uranium prices and positions well-capitalized miners, developers, and fuel-cycle companies for growth.
5. The Global X Uranium ETF provides diverse exposure across nuclear
The Global X Uranium ETF (URA) provides investors with a convenient way to gain broad exposure to the uranium industry across its entire value chain.
Rather than betting on a single miner or fuel-cycle company, this ETF holds a diversified basket of global uranium-related stocks, including uranium producers, developers, exploration companies, and providers of nuclear components or technologies. Its top five largest holdings include Cameco (19.6% of net assets), Oklo (15.5%), Uranium Energy Corporation (5.9%), Centrus Energy (5.6%), and Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (5.4%).
This mix helps balance risk between established players with stable operations and smaller companies with higher growth potential. Importantly, it captures companies at different stages of the supply chain, from mining and refining to reactor construction and fuel services, allowing investors to benefit from rising uranium demand in multiple ways."

But you have eight people watching a football game who are hungry. What's the easiest solution? Cut each of the four slices in half. Voila -- you now have eight slices. It's still the same amount of pizza, but now more people get to eat.
That's the general idea of stock splits. When share prices become too high, some investors might be left out of the party. Splitting the share prices allows them to buy at a more affordable price. Nothing changes fundamentally with the company. However, stock splits can sometimes provide nice catalysts.
With that in mind, there are several stock-split candidates on the market today. Here are three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to especially keep on your radar.
1. ASML Holding
ASML Holding (ASML 2.71%) is arguably the AI stock most poised for a stock split. The Dutch semiconductor fabrication equipment provider's share price isn't too far away from $1,000. That's a lofty level that could make a split attractive.
A stock split wouldn't be new to ASML, either. The company has conducted five of them in the past. Its most recent one, though, was a reverse stock split in 2012. ASML issued 77 shares for every 100 existing shares. A forward stock split could be on the way in the not-too-distant future, although management hasn't stated that one is forthcoming.
It's even more likely that ASML's board reduces the number of outstanding shares. The company stated in its second-quarter investor presentation that it expects to ""return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders"" through increased dividends and stock buybacks.
I suspect that ASML's share price will continue to grow briskly if a stock split isn't on the horizon. The semiconductor industry could generate over $1 trillion in revenue by 2030. ASML believes that lithography equipment innovations will be required to make AI chips that use less power and are more cost-effective. No company is in a better position to deliver those innovations than ASML.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has never conducted a stock split. However, its stock hasn't risen above $700 until this year. I wouldn't be surprised if the idea of a split hasn't entered the minds of some of the company's directors.
The pressure for a stock split could increase if Meta's momentum continues. Can its share price keep soaring? I think so, barring a major stock market correction that especially hurts high-flying AI leaders.
Meta's core business remains rock-solid. Its family of apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, attracted roughly 3.5 billion daily users in the second quarter of 2025. That's a lot of eyeballs that advertisers love to target.
The company is using AI to boost profits for its social media and messaging platforms. Meta is also a leader in AI glasses, which holds the potential to be a massive market over the next few years.
3. AppLovin
AppLovin (APP 2.01%) has been an especially big winner this year. Its tremendous gains have pushed the share price to around $600. That's potential stock-spit territory, in my view.
The company, which develops software and AI solutions for mobile advertising, analytics, and marketing, hasn't conducted any stock splits in the past. That isn't surprising, though, considering AppLovin's initial public offering occurred only a little over four years ago.
At the rate AppLovin is growing, its share price could increase enough to make a stock split much more likely. The company reported 77% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter. Earnings skyrocketed 164%.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle, though, is valuation. AppLovin's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 50.5. A lot of growth is already baked into the share price."

What began as a niche designer of graphics chips for gamers has evolved into the central nervous system of the artificial intelligence (AI) economy.
Today, hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, and Meta Platforms rely on Nvidia's hardware and software stack to train and deploy their AI models. Unprecedented demand has fueled staggering financial growth, propelling Nvidia's market value nearly 16x during the AI revolution. At a market cap of roughly $4.5 trillion, Nvidia now wears the crown of the world's most valuable company.
This raises the question: Is there any upside left, or have investors who don't already own shares missed the boat?
The answer according to Wall Street analyst Phil Panaro at The Boston Consulting Group may surprise you. Panaro projects that Nvidia could reach a $20 trillion valuation within the next five years -- representing a gain of more than 340% from current levels. While this target may sound ambitious, his thesis is built on three converging forces shaping the next decade of AI.
Let's unpack the key drivers behind Panaro's bold prediction and explore why Nvidia's long-term story remains one of the most compelling in the entire market.
The AI boom has only just begun
The first pillar of Panaro's thesis is that the current AI boom is still in the early innings of a decades-long transformation. He estimates that global AI adoption remains below 1% today, meaning that most industries have only begun to explore the potential of intelligent automation. As AI becomes embedded across healthcare, financial services, logistics, retail, and manufacturing, the demand for accelerated computing should expand exponentially.
Nvidia is uniquely positioned to capture these tailwinds. On the hardware front, its chips remain the gold standard for training and inferencing large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems. Equally important, Nvidia's CUDA software platform forms the base layer of its ecosystem, enabling developers to build AI applications at scale.
This deep integration has created enormous switching costs, meaning that once a company's AI infrastructure is built on Nvidia's backbone, migrating to another platform becomes complex and financially prohibitive.
This combination of superior product performance and ecosystem lock-in gives Nvidia exceptional pricing power. In effect, the company is no longer just a chip designer. It has assumed the role of a toll collector in the AI era, charging admission to every breakthrough that relies on its compute stack.
Web3 and the next frontier of compute demand
The second pillar of Panaro's argument centers on the rise of Web3 and decentralized applications. Blockchain validation, metaverse rendering, and on-chain governance are all emerging systems that require computationally intensive processing power -- precisely the kind of workload Nvidia's GPUs are designed to handle.
Nvidia's opportunity in this realm is twofold.
First, the company's hardware will likely remain a core foundation for next-generation decentralized networks -- providing the horsepower to process blockchain transactions and train autonomous systems at global scale.
Second, Nvidia's software capabilities -- particularly in simulation and digital twin technologies -- could prove to be essential tools for building virtual worlds, industrial replicas, and real-time digital economies that mirror the physical world.
As Web3 evolves, Nvidia remains positioned to supply both the silicon and the advanced software required to power the next frontier of the internet.
Governments will be the next wave of AI customers
The third pillar of Panaro's forecast highlights an often-overlooked source of demand: the public sector. While private businesses have raced to procure GPUs and expand their data center footprints, government agencies around the world are only beginning to invest in digital transformation.
Federal and state governments could use AI to optimize logistics, detect fraud, forecast infrastructure needs, and manage power grids with greater efficiency. Meanwhile, defense agencies could leverage AI for training simulations, satellite imagery analysis, and developing advanced cybersecurity protocols.
The underlying investment theme here is quite powerful: Government contracts tend to be long-term and capital-intensive. Initiatives like Project Stargate underscore this trend -- large-scale, multiyear buildouts designed to make AI infrastructure a national security asset.
Ambition vs. reality
Whether Nvidia will reach a $20 trillion valuation by 2030 remains open to debate. In my view, Panaro's target should be interpreted less as a precise forecast and more as a statement of potential.
Nvidia has built one of the most durable and profitable business models of the modern era, one that bridges hardware, software, and connected ecosystems.
And regardless of whether Nvidia reaches the $20 trillion milestone, I agree that its story appears to be in its early chapters. For this reason, I see Nvidia as a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon."

Blow-out quarterly earnings estimates from American software and cloud services specialist Oracle, a $100bn (£75bn) investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI by silicon chip designer Nvidia and, in reverse, the purchase of a 10pc stake by OpenAI in another semiconductor maker, AMD, are all keeping the artificial intelligence (AI) pot boiling, so far as stock markets are concerned.
The magnificent seven of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla now have an aggregate stock market capitalisation of $21tn – or 36pc of the S&P 500 index’s total value. Their spending on AI and their share prices are firing US economic growth, which continues to shrug off tariff turmoil, corporate earnings – and thus, the US stock market.
In theory, where the US goes, the rest are sure to follow. America is the world’s largest economy and home to its biggest stock market, biggest bond market and its reserve currency the dollar, all of which count for rather a lot. Many headline stock indices are cruising to new highs, including our very own FTSE 100.
Yet someone is worried. The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), released last Wednesday, offer warnings of increased risks of a sharp pullback in global share prices. The question now, as one email sent to this column immediately reflected, is whether this is a timely alert or a repeat of Alan Greenspan’s “irrational exuberance” speech of 1996. The then-Federal Reserve chair cautioned about the dangers of a galloping stock market, only for share prices to continue rising, not peaking until 39 months later.
Uncanny echoes
The FPC’s frets about the sky-high valuations of anything AI carry uncomfortable echoes of the technology, media and telecoms (TMT) – or dotcom – bubble that inflated over the 1990s, popped in 2000 and bottomed in 2002. It then took America’s technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index, the poster child for the bubble, until April 2015 to return to its March 2000 high, teaching investors a painful lesson of the perils of choosing narrative over valuation.
Greenspan had, in the eyes of some, tried to calm animal spirits before the bubble even got going – and with good reason. Just eight months after the Fed chair spoke, trouble blew in from an unexpected quarter when Thailand devalued the baht. Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia quickly followed with the rupiah, won and ringgit, and the Asian debt crisis began to roil markets."

Today, the term refers to the group of innovative companies that have driven stock market gains in recent years. They are technology names you probably know well, from Nvidia to Meta Platforms, and they're all involved in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). These players have helped the S&P 500 climb in the double-digits this year, too, and even reach record levels.
But the Magnificent Seven aren't the only game in town, and two other stocks in particular may give them a run for their money over the next five years, as AI infrastructure spending soars and customers seek capacity for their AI workloads. Right now, these two AI stocks are charging forward and already have outperformed the Magnificent Seven so far this year -- but this movement may not be over. Let's check out the two players that may crush the Magnificent Seven in the years to come.
1. CoreWeave
CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) has climbed more than 250% since its market launch earlier this year, but that doesn't mean it's used up all of its fuel. The company may just be getting started, and that's because it offers up a service in high demand today -- and into the future. I'm talking about AI infrastructure capacity.
CoreWeave, thanks to its 250,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), has a lot of computing power to offer -- and customers can easily rent it as needed, even on an hourly basis. This means they don't have to invest in purchasing costly GPUs but still can access the power they need for the training and inferencing of their models, for example.
To make the picture even sweeter, Nvidia plays a key role in the CoreWeave story. The chip giant holds a 7% stake in the company and recently pledged to buy any unused capacity through 2032 -- this removes a great deal of risk from CoreWeave stock.
Finally, CoreWeave's revenue has been exploding higher, growing more than 400% in the first quarter from the year-earlier period -- and more than tripling in the latest quarter year over year. Considering the great need for AI capacity to power the training of AI and its application in the real world, the company should continue to see strong demand -- and this may send the stock to greater gains than those of the Magnificent Seven.
2. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) stock has advanced nearly 50% so far this year, but this company, too, could keep marching higher in the coming years as cloud service providers focus on scaling up AI infrastructure. The company is a networking giant, known for thousands of products found in a variety of places -- from smartphones to data centers.
But this data center business has driven growth as the AI boom picked up momentum. Customers are turning to Broadcom for networking solutions, needed to connect the many compute nodes that power AI workloads across data centers. Broadcom is an expert here and has seen its Tomahawk switches and Jericho routers fly off the shelves.
The company also represents a future winner in the area of computing power as it designs AI accelerators, known as XPUs -- but doesn't necessarily compete with chip giant Nvidia. The XPU is a custom accelerator, made for specific purposes while Nvidia's chips are high-powered for general use. This makes it easier for Broadcom to carve out market share, serving a customer's specific needs and offering a product that may be complementary to Nvidia's. In the recent quarter, Broadcom announced a $10 billion order for XPUs -- and analysts say the customer is top AI lab OpenAI.
The AI business has resulted in significant revenue gains in recent quarters -- for example, in the latest one, Broadcom reported AI revenue growth of 63% to $5.2 billion. And this trend could continue if Nvidia chief Jensen Huang is right: He expects AI infrastructure spending to climb to $3 trillion or $4 trillion by the end of the decade, and Broadcom clearly could benefit from this stage of the AI boom. And that suggests this stock may crush the Magnificent Seven players as this AI infrastructure story unfolds."
finnhub,META,2025-10-12T22:19:00,Prediction: These Will Be Wall Street's 2 Most Prominent Stock-Split Stocks of 2026,"Up over 400% in just three years, these industry leaders are ripe for stock splits in 2026.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a308803e43f22ae070e38eb49218e9b170015e52f2703132aa8bfdcf8aff7334,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/wall-street-stock-split-buy-netflix-meta-2026/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/wall-street-stock-split-buy-netflix-meta-2026/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/wall-street-stock-split-buy-netflix-meta-2026/,fool.com,200,,"There were a flurry of stock splits last year, including Nvidia, Broadcom, Chipotle, and Walmart, among others. But 2025 hasn't been nearly as active a year for stock splits.
That could change in 2026.
Here's why Netflix (NFLX -1.02%) and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) stand out as top candidates to split their stocks in 2026.
When stock splits make sense
Stock splits provide an opportunity to make a company's shares more accessible to smaller investors with limited capital. While they are less important in today's age of zero-cost trading and fractional shares, companies will still pursue stock splits for other benefits like employee compensation and psychological appeal too.
For example, Berkshire Hathaway offers class A shares and class B shares. At the time of this writing, A shares trade for around $750,000 compared to $500 for B shares, with each B share making up 1/1,500th of an A share. If given the choice to invest $500 in B shares or buy 1/1,500th of a fractional share of class A, many investors will prefer the simplicity (and satisfaction) of owning one full B share.
It's also worth noting that options contracts are typically packaged in increments of 100 shares. A lower stock price can increase interest from smaller investors who are looking to buy or sell options.
Despite these benefits, a company should only execute a stock split if it is confident it can grow its value and, in turn, its share price over time. Oracle split its stock a staggering six times between 1995 and 2000. It was too much, too fast. The dot-com bubble burst, and it took over 15 years for Oracle to exceed its all-time high from 2000. Oracle has not split its stock since then.
Netflix and Meta could split next year
Netflix and Meta have what it takes to continue compounding in value, setting the stage for stock splits in 2026.
It's been over a decade since Netflix last split its stock. The company is a completely different business today, shifting its focus from growing revenue and subscribers to cash flow and profitability. Netflix is achieving impeccable results despite much more difficult competition from legacy media companies that are expanding their streaming offerings, as well as tech companies like Apple and Amazon that offer their own services as well.
By 2030, Netflix plans to triple operating income from 2024 levels, grow operating income faster than revenue (thus expanding margins), and hit a $1 trillion in market cap. With a share price over $1,200 at the time of this writing, I could see Netflix splitting its stock by 7-for-1 in 2026, which is the same ratio as its split in 2015.
Since its initial public offering in 2012, Meta has never split its stock. It is the only member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" or ""Ten Titans"" to have never done so -- and for good reason. It's easy to forget that Meta fell below $100 per share in the fall of 2022 as investors heavily criticized management's decision to invest in the metaverse. The company recovered because it unlocked massive engagement increases through short-form videos, which made Instagram more attractive for advertisers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) was another big change for Meta, as the company has fine-tuned its algorithm to further boost engagement and provide useful metrics for advertisers. In short, Instagram has become one of the most sought-after platforms for targeted digital advertising. And Meta's share price is now over $700, a remarkable recovery in less than three years.
Like Netflix, Meta is now consistently profitable and raking in free cash flow (FCF). In the last three years, Meta has increased its FCF by 163%, and Netflix has boosted its FCF more than fivefold. What's particularly impressive about Meta's FCF growth is that it is spending a record amount on capital expenditures to boost AI infrastructure. Without that AI spending, FCF would be much higher. But investors would probably prefer the company to invest in long-term growth, given the potential reward. I could see Meta announcing a 5-for-1 split next year.
Two potential Dow Jones components
Netflix and Meta's industry leadership, profitability, and international growth potential give both companies the green light to split their stocks in 2026. Another reason these companies may split their stocks is to get added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
For a stock to be added to the Dow (which is a price-weighted index), its stock price can't be too high, or it would excessively shift the balance of the index. It's worth mentioning that Nvidia, Amazon, and Sherwin-Williams all underwent stock splits before being added to the Dow in 2024. Adjusted for splits, all three stocks had a share price below $400 when they were added to the Dow.
A glaring flaw in the Dow is that it doesn't have exposure to social media. With two large cloud providers already in the Dow (Amazon and Microsoft), Meta might have a better chance of replacing Verizon Communications than Alphabet.
A less likely scenario is that Netflix replaces Walt Disney in the Dow. Disney has been underperforming the broad market for years, but it has made substantial headway in monetizing its streaming business recently.
Beyond the typical benefits, stock splits would also position Meta and Netflix for consideration in the event of further Dow Jones index shakeups in 2026."

This includes Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, which are together known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" There are others now part of the trillion-dollar club, but these are among the more notable names.
The list may get even bigger in the years ahead, as many businesses are growing and benefiting from feverish spending on artificial intelligence (AI). There's one unstoppable company that's doing well due to that trend, and which looks set to join the club in the near future: Oracle (ORCL 1.45%). Here's why it may not be too late to invest in this promising tech stock.
Oracle has become a key player in the AI boom
For years, Oracle has been known as a big name in databases and providing companies with the critical backend services and infrastructure they need to manage all their data. It still serves that purpose today, plus it also offers key products and services, which help its customers manage AI workloads.
Its new Oracle AI World, for instance, will allow its customers to use large language models to analyze existing databases. The big advantage with Oracle is that unlike many big tech companies, it's agnostic to the whole chatbot market; it isn't developing one of its own, and it's there to simply provide customers with the AI-powered products and services they need. It also has AI agents that can help to automate tasks and add efficiency.
And its efforts have been paying off. Last month, the company reported its latest quarterly results (for the period ending Aug. 31) and demand remains robust, with CEO Safra Catz noting that it ""signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1."" It expects even more large contracts to be signed in the future. And its contract backlog has skyrocketed by 359% year over year, totaling $455 billion.
Oracle's quarterly revenue totaled $14.9 billion and rose 12% year over year. Its cloud segment led the way, as sales in that business unit came in at $7.2 billion and were up by 28%.
The company also generates terrific profit margins, as its net income during the period was $2.9 billion, which is comparable to what it generated in the prior-year period. The bottom line would have been larger, however, if not for an increase in restructuring expenses, as the company has been reducing its workforce in an effort to improve efficiency.
Why a $1 trillion valuation may be just an inevitability at this point
Oracle's market cap as of the end of Monday was around $820 billion. For it to hit a $1 trillion valuation, it would need to rise by another 22% from that. In just the past year, its shares have soared more than 70%. And with tech companies continuing to invest heavily into AI, Oracle looks poised to benefit from those growth opportunities.
It may not happen soon, and it could take a couple of years, as the stock has already risen so fast. It's currently trading around its all-time highs, and its price-to-earnings multiple of 66 doesn't look cheap at all. As a result, growth investors may be thinking twice about the stock, and that could lead to limited gains, at least in the short term.
But with so much growth still out there, it may truly be an inevitability before Oracle reaches $1 trillion. According to analysts from the MarketsandMarkets, the global cloud AI market is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.4% until 2029. It's a staggering level of growth, with Oracle right in the middle of it all.
Oracle's still a good buy today
Although you may be tempted to pass on Oracle's stock because its valuation is a bit rich, over the long term, there's still much more runway for it to become more valuable. The important role it plays in tech makes it a solid investment, particularly due to its close relationship with other tech giants.
Oracle's solid fundamentals and AI-powered growth makes it a great investment to add to your portfolio today, especially if you're looking for an AI stock that still has a lot of upside left."

Since then, it's been joined by other companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Of course, the list also includes the current market-cap leader, Nvidia.
It's becoming increasingly normal for a new company to join the $1 trillion club. But it remains an impressive feat nevertheless. At this pace, these tech titans could be joined by brick-and-mortar giant Walmart (WMT 1.71%) in 2026.
Over the past 15 years, Walmart stock has risen by 470%. The company has also been a steady dividend payer over this time. For investors who bought, held, and reinvested the dividends along the way, returns were even better with a 680% gain.
Stocks that post strong long-term gains, as Walmart stock has, often decide to undergo stock splits, bringing the price per share down due to a higher number of shares overall. Walmart has done this many times in its history, including a 3-for-1 stock split in 2024.
As of this writing, Walmart has a market cap of $820 billion. Therefore, to reach $1 trillion in 2026, it would need to appreciate by about 22% in less than 15 months. Is this really possible? It's not a sure thing, but it may be easier than some investors think.
How Walmart can reach $1 trillion
At a high level, stocks tend to go up when profit potential goes up. Perhaps profit potential goes up because a business is about to reach a new scale thanks to new locations or an acquisition. Or perhaps profit potential goes up because management is about to unlock some operating leverage. But either way, for Walmart stock to go up another 22%, one would expect improvement to its operating income over the next year or so.
Walmart is known for selling millions of products. But retail sales aren't driving growth for the company's operating income. In the earnings call to discuss financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2026, CFO John Rainey said: ""Contributions to operating income are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of interrelated drivers, including improved e-commerce, economics, and business mix, most notably from higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees.""
Rainey attributes much of Walmart's operating income growth to e-commerce, an area of the business that's absolutely booming. In Q2, e-commerce revenue was up a strong 25% year over year globally, far outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of about 5%. If e-commerce continues to boom in 2026, it could drive operating income, and the stock price, higher.
Walmart's e-commerce growth provides it with another opportunity: Digital advertising. The company has troves of consumer shopping data and strong relationships with top consumer brands. With more customers transacting digitally, it gives the retailer an opportunity to generate high-margin digital advertising revenue.
Additionally, Walmart recently completed its acquisition of connected-TV company Vizio. This is another channel with which the company can leverage its data and scale to advertise to consumers, which again drives operating income growth.
For what it's worth, Walmart's Q2 advertising revenue was up 46%. Granted, some of the growth was inorganic from the recent addition of Vizio. But the company is growing this revenue stream nonetheless.
In other words, Walmart's fastest-growing revenue streams also happen to be the ones that are driving growth in operating profit. Assuming these trends continue, which I do, Walmart's profits should continue to climb in 2026, providing a boost for the stock price.
To be clear, Walmart might not grow enough over the next 15 months to warrant a $1 trillion valuation before the end of 2026. But directionally, the business appears to be headed for the trillion-dollar club. It doesn't seem to be a matter of if, but rather of when."

And I could see why some investors would gravitate toward Berkshire Hathaway, which is like an ETF bundled within a single stock.
But I have my sights set on a stock that has quietly delivered a 58,000% return since it began trading in 1991. The business isn't flashy, but it's indispensable. It's a cash cow in good times and bad. And the company's share-buyback program can only be described as relentless.
I'm talking about AutoZone (AZO -0.62%).
You know the jingle
AutoZone is an auto parts retailer that likely needs no introduction, because that ubiquitous jingle -- ""Get in the zone, AutoZone!"" -- is probably living rent-free in your head. But if you've never peeked under the hood of AutoZone's business, you might be surprised by how strong the engine is.
Founded in 1979, AutoZone has grown from a single store in Forrest City, Arkansas, to more than 6,600 stores in the United States. AutoZone also is expanding internationally, with 883 stores in Mexico and nearly 150 in Brazil.
For the company's fiscal year 2025, which ended Aug. 30, AutoZone reported net sales of $18.9 billion, a 4.5% increase over the previous year on a 52-week basis. U.S. same-store sales -- also known as comparable-store sales -- were up 3.2%, while international same-store sales were up 9.3%, adjusting for the negative effects of currency exchange rates.
Tariff-driven cost inflation, a stronger U.S. dollar, and AutoZone's aggressive expansion efforts have put pressure on earnings. Net income dipped 6.2% to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2025, and diluted earnings per share fell 3.1% to $144.87.
In fact, AutoZone's fiscal 2025 Q4 results marked the fifth consecutive quarter that the company has fallen short of analysts' earnings estimates. Yet the stock is up 24% this year, as of Oct. 9, which tells me that investors are focusing on the big picture. Here's why you might consider doing the same.
A huge total addressable market
One way to assess a company's growth prospects is to look at its total addressable market. AutoZone is one of the leading retailers in the automotive aftermarket. Industry associations expect the total value of the U.S. automotive aftermarket to reach $576 billion in 2025, and globally, it's valued at $2.3 trillion. . With the number of vehicles on the road and the average age of vehicles at an all-time high, demand for replacement parts should continue to be strong.
AutoZone has been investing heavily in its sales and distribution footprint to capture more market share. In fiscal 2025, AutoZone's capital expenditures rose 27% to nearly $1.4 billion. The company opened 304 new stores -- the most since 1996 -- and two new distribution centers. Management expects fiscal 2026 capex spending to be in the same ballpark, with most of it focused on ""accelerated store growth.""
Some of those new stores are larger stores that function like mini distribution centers. ""Megahubs,"" for example, are supersized AutoZone stores carrying more than 100,000 SKUs (individual products). Megahubs have been outperforming traditional stores, and they're helping smaller stores in their area fulfill orders faster. AutoZone's ultimate goal is to have 300 megahubs.
In fiscal 2025, AutoZone generated nearly $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, so it's in a strong position to keep investing in the business. Given the sheer size of the automotive aftermarket, the payoff could be massive. But there's another reason I'm such a huge fan of this stock.
AutoZone knows how to treat shareholders
Since fiscal 1998, AutoZone has scooped up $38.5 billion worth of its own shares. Over the past 10 years, AutoZone reduced its outstanding share count by 45% -- and it's still buying more shares.
Share buybacks are a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders, and they signal management's confidence in the business. By reducing the supply of shares available in the market, share buybacks can enhance earnings per share and increase demand for the remaining shares -- both of which can drive the stock price higher.
You can see the inverse relationship in this chart:
Inelastic demand
There's something else that makes AutoZone a strong candidate for this ""what-if"" hypothetical.
The automotive aftermarket benefits from a concept known as inelastic demand -- meaning consumers will make essential repairs to their vehicles regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. In fact, auto parts retailers often shine in tough times, because consumers tend to pull back on buying new vehicles. As a leader in this space, AutoZone might be the ultimate recession-resistant stock, well-positioned for growth in boom times and busts."
finnhub,META,2025-10-12T08:10:00,Meta Just Got Some Powerful New Competition for AI-Enhanced Wearables,Here's why its dominance in this niche might come to an abrupt end.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=35f14b081bf905a41dcd06343226576e2fd4c3d1a3ee039c315936d5afe82ee1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meta-powerful-new-competition-for-ai-wearable/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meta-powerful-new-competition-for-ai-wearable/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/meta-powerful-new-competition-for-ai-wearable/,fool.com,200,,"Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is the king of virtual reality (VR) right now.
Between its Quest VR headset and its new line of Ray-Ban artificial intelligence (AI) glasses, Meta's wearables not only dominate the market -- in some cases, they are the market.
But last week, a new report emerged that Apple (AAPL 0.54%) might be planning to bring Meta's dominance in wearables to an end. Here's why this could be very bad for Meta.
Headsets are so 2023
The Meta Quest (formerly Oculus Quest) line of headsets is by far the top-selling VR headset, and it's not even close. The Quest dominates with 77% of market share. Its nearest competitors, Sony's PlayStation VR, Apple's Vision Pro, and Chinese entrant PICO, each have market shares in the single digits.
In spite of Meta's headset dominance, though, the Reality Labs unit -- which makes the Quest -- has been losing money as Meta pours resources into it as part of its long-term vision for building a metaverse. In the company's most recent quarter, Reality Labs brought in just $370 million in revenue (0.8% of Meta's total $47.5 billion in quarterly revenue), but reported a $4.5 billion net loss.
Meanwhile, VR headsets just aren't catching on the way Meta hoped. Although the company hasn't provided specific sales figures for the Quest 3 and Quest 3S, estimates indicate that right now, about two years after the Quest 3's release, somewhere between 1 million to 2 million are currently in use. By contrast, Nintendo's (NTDOY 0.78%) Switch 2 was released on June 5 of this year, and by June 30 had already sold 5.8 million units.
Still, that doesn't mean that wearables are dead. What about replacing that clunky headset with a simple pair of glasses?
The specs of the specs
The first-ever foray into eyeglasses as wearable technology, Alphabet's Google Glass, was a total disaster. With its front-mounted camera, anyone the wearer looked at worried they were unknowingly being filmed. Alphabet began selling a prototype in April 2014 and discontinued it just nine months later over concerns it could violate privacy laws.
However, we seem to have turned a corner from the time when Google Glass was deemed ""creepy"" and ""invasive."" Although Meta's AI glasses, like Google Glass, look like chunky plastic-framed glasses with front-mounted cameras, and although they have a $400-plus price tag (not including prescription lenses), sales have been rapidly expanding.
This could be a much larger and more promising market than the one for VR headsets, given that eyeglass wearers are used to having frames on their faces, and everyone is used to seeing people walk around with glasses on, unlike a clunky VR headset. Plus, new prescription glasses cost hundreds of dollars anyway. Why not shell out a few extra for AI enhancement?
Meta has a big early lead with this technology. But even that might not withstand a challenge from Apple.
Why Meta should worry
Apple's incredibly advanced VR/augmented reality (AR) Vision Pro headset drew rave reviews when it came out in 2024, although its $3,499 price tag meant it was never destined for mass-market sales. So, given the apparent growing market for AI glasses and the shrinking market for VR headsets, it's no surprise that Apple would follow Meta into the wearables field. In fact, over the past year, a number of industry watchers have questioned why Apple wasn't already in the smart eyeglasses market to begin with.
Not only does Apple clearly have some expertise with the technology, as evidenced by the Vision Pro, it has a lot of things Meta doesn't have: robust supply chains, existing manufacturing partners, and decades of experience mass-producing and mass-marketing technological devices, including wearables like the Apple Watch.
Furthermore, Apple has storefronts across the country and around the world where it can display wearable products and demonstrate how they work. Meta doesn't, and has to rely on Ray-Ban, LensCrafters, and Best Buy stores to demo its latest wearables.
Millions of people around the world own an iPhone -- an AI-ready device that could easily be configured to control and power AI glasses from Apple. That's not true for Meta, and the lack of integration with phone apps -- even Meta's own apps like Facebook and Instagram -- is one of the big complaints about the new Meta Ray-Ban Display.
True, if Apple scraps its Vision Pro headset, Meta loses a competitor in the VR headset space, but that's where its products are already dominant. The potential for Apple to disrupt Meta's monopoly in the fast-growing AI glasses market is much more concerning. Worse, if Apple eats Meta's lunch in the AI glasses market, Meta doesn't really have an apparent fallback product for its metaverse plans. That's what's probably keeping Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg up at night."

Although his company Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has a trillion-dollar valuation, and its social media platforms are essentially a money-printing machine, he sees virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) as the future, and VR/AR wearables as key to dominating the future's metaverse.
But a powerful new competitor is entering the AR wearables arena, and it's probably the one company Zuckerberg was hoping not to face. Here's why Apple (AAPL 0.54%) might just eat his VR lunch.
Why wearables
Most of Meta Platforms' money comes from its popular suite of social media platforms, which includes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Ads on these platforms brought in $88 billion in the first half of this year alone.
Wearables, not so much. Meta's Reality Labs unit, which makes the company's wearables, lost $4.5 billion in the most recent quarter.
However, Zuckerberg wants to ensure his trillion-dollar company stays relevant in the future, and so he's willing to keep pouring money into Reality Labs and his vision of the metaverse: a virtual world where people can meet, talk, shop, attend events, make financial transactions -- you name it.
Despite his big investments, though, Reality Labs' VR headsets like the Quest 3 are still niche products, primarily used for gaming. Even there, they haven't gained much traction. Meta's release of the $300 Quest 3S boosted headset holiday sales in 2024, but overall VR headset purchases declined again in 2024.
A new type of wearable
This stagnation in the headset market may be why Meta has introduced a new wearable product: AI-enhanced glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban. These smart devices look like chunky plastic-framed glasses featuring small front-mounted cameras. The first two generations offer video recording and small speakers above the ear that can respond to voice commands.
Last month, however, Zuckerberg introduced the latest device in the lineup: the Meta Ray-Ban Display, billed as ""the most advanced AI glasses we've ever sold with a full-color, high-resolution display that's there when you want it and gone when you don't."" The glasses come with a Meta Neural Band electromyographic (EMG) wristband that translates finger movements into commands for the glasses.
Although the Display is currently on sale at select Ray-Ban, Best Buy, and LensCrafters stores, there are only a handful of locations actually selling it. For example, there are none within 50 miles of Cincinnati, just two near Chicago, and one in greater Boston.
The Display also requires a 20-minute demo -- booked in advance -- plus the $799 purchase price (or more if you need prescription lenses). Recent reports indicate it's so popular that it's already sold out at many locations.
Right now, Meta has this fast-growing field all to itself. But all that could be about to change.
The giant slayer
According to Bloomberg News, Apple has shifted employees who were working on a cheaper, lighter version of the Vision Pro to working on wearable glasses. Supposedly, there are two versions of these glasses in development: one that pairs with the iPhone but has no display -- similar to most of Meta's Ray-Ban products -- and one that will have an on-lens screen like the newly unveiled Meta Ray-Ban Display. The former could be unveiled next year and go on sale in 2027, with the latter following in 2028.
Apple has a history of introducing its own version of existing devices and turning them into cash cows for its company. The MP3 player, the smartphone, and the tablet had all been available for years before Apple introduced its iPod, iPhone, and iPad, all of which turned into smash hits (and turned those existing products into has-beens). So even though Apple is late to the AI glasses party, that hasn't stopped it from dominating a product niche in the past.
Why Zuckerberg should worry
Zuckerberg has already poured a lot of money into VR/AR wearables and has plenty more money to invest in this area in the future. But ultimately, Meta is a social media company, not a device company. Prior to its acquisition of Oculus, and its marketing of the Quest headset, it had no experience developing or marketing any devices of any kind.
Apple, on the other hand, is arguably the most successful device maker in history, with a huge global network of parts suppliers, supply chains, retail outlets, and expertise in mass-manufacturing and mass-marketing the latest tech gadgets. Meta has none of these advantages.
And that's why Mark Zuckerberg should be very, very worried right now."

A Thinking Machines Lab spokesperson confirmed the departure to the WSJ, saying that ""Andrew has decided to pursue a different path for personal reasons"".
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Thinking Machines Lab could not immediately be reached for comment. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously reached out to OpenAI’s former chief technology officer, Mira Murati, and offered to buy her fledgling startup, Thinking Machines Lab, WSJ had earlier reported, stating that upon refusal, Zuckerberg had approached more than a dozen of the startup's employees, including Tulloch, to jump ship.
Tulloch had been offered a package that could have been worth $1.5 billion over at least six years, with top bonuses and extraordinary stock performance, according to the WSJ.
Zuckerberg has been aggressively hiring from rivals in order to close the gap in advanced AI, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman saying that Meta offered its employees bonuses of $100 million to recruit them, as the tech giant seeks to ramp up its artificial intelligence strategy.
Meta has been offering some of Silicon Valley's most lucrative pay packages and striking startup deals to attract top researchers, a strategy that follows the underwhelming performance of its Llama 4 model.

Meta Platforms Investment Narrative Recap
To be a Meta Platforms shareholder, you need to believe in the company's ability to drive long-term value from its massive AI infrastructure investments, leading in digital advertising and platform engagement despite persistent regulatory and spending risks. The recent Aspire.io AI Instagram Discovery launch aligns with Meta's push for platform innovation and creator monetization, but does not materially change the short-term catalyst, acceleration in ad revenue growth fueled by AI, or the biggest risk, which remains escalating regulatory and compliance pressures, particularly in Europe.
The Aspire.io partnership underscores Meta’s ongoing efforts to deepen AI-powered tools across Instagram, enhancing ad performance and engagement. This announcement fits squarely within management’s focus on leveraging technology to deliver incremental improvements in ad conversions, a trend that remains a primary growth catalyst as Meta approaches its upcoming earnings report.

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is the largest producer of carbon-free energy in the US, with over 32,400 MW of generating capacity consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric assets.
Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is the largest producer of nuclear energy in the US by a wide margin, over three times more than its closest competitor. The company’s business model generates strong, stable cash flows through regulated rate structures and long-term power purchase agreements and it boasts hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google among its key customers. It was reported this summer that the utility has also struck a deal with Meta to keep one of its reactors in Illinois operating for 20 years.
Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) made headlines earlier this year when it announced the acquisition of Calpine, turning the company into the largest independent power provider in the country. The blockbuster deal, which is expected to close in Q4 2025, is expected to boost CEG’s EPS by more than 20% next year.

finnhub,META,2025-10-11T13:32:00,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" or the Entire S&P 500: What's the Better Option for Growth Investors?","The big names in tech have been doing well of late, but a slowdown could be overdue.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4b9d139ec826a38981202cad07daf0304bc49c0262367d5772fe0c51a1b632a1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,fool.com,200,,"If you're thinking about investing in the stock market today, you may be wondering whether it's a better idea to go with the big names in the ""Magnificent Seven"" or to simply hold a position in the entire S&P 500.
The Magnificent Seven refers to some of the most prominent growth stocks in the world: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Investing in these companies has yielded strong returns for investors over the years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 makes for a more balanced investment overall, as it gives investors broader exposure to the market while still growing over the long term. By having a position in the 500 best stocks rather than just the top seven, there's much more diversification.
Which option should you go with today, if your focus is on long-term growth?
The Magnificent Seven are magnificent, but they could be overdue for a decline
One way you can gain exposure to the Magnificent Seven is by investing in the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS 0.76%). The fund invests in just the Magnificent Seven and, thus, can be an easier option than investing in each stock individually. Since its launch in April 2023, the fund has soundly outperformed the S&P 500, rising by more than 165% while the broader index has achieved gains of around 64%.
Many of the Magnificent Seven have benefited from an uptick in demand due to artificial intelligence (AI) and have been investing heavily in next-gen technologies. However, many investors worry that a bubble has already formed around AI stocks and that spending could slow down, especially if there's a recession on the horizon. If that happens, then these stocks could be susceptible to significant declines.
While these stocks have been flying high of late, back in 2022, when the market was in turmoil due to rising inflation and as investor sentiment was souring on growth stocks, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks fell by more than 26%. The worst-performing stocks were Meta and Tesla, which lost around 65% of their value. That year, the S&P 500 also fell, but at 19%, it was a more modest decline.
The S&P 500 is more diverse, but that doesn't mean it's risk-free
If you want to have exposure to the S&P 500, you can accomplish that by investing in an S&P 500 index fund, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 0.38%). Its low expense ratio of 0.09% makes it a low-cost, no-nonsense way of tracking the S&P 500. Its focus is to simply mirror the index, and it does a great job of that.
The problem, however, is that while the S&P 500 will give you exposure to more stocks than just the seven best stocks in the world, how those leading stocks do will still have a significant impact on the overall stock market. And the Magnificent Seven, because they are so valuable, are also among the SPDR ETF's largest holdings.
But even if you were to go with a more balanced exchange-traded fund, such as the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which has an equal position in all S&P 500 stocks, that may only offer modest protection from a wide-scale sell-off. In 2022, the ETF declined by 13%.
You're always going to face some risk when investing in the stock market, especially if your focus is on growth stocks, which can be particularly volatile.
What's the better strategy for growth investors?
If your priority is growth, then going with the Magnificent Seven can still be the best option moving forward. These stocks will undoubtedly have bad years, but that's the risk that comes with growth stocks. However, given their dominance in tech and AI, the Magnificent Seven still have the potential to vastly outperform the S&P 500 in the long run, and their gains are likely to far outweigh their losses."

In the past three years, shares have skyrocketed 437% (as of Oct. 9). The business has been riding some serious momentum. Now, investors are patiently waiting for management to release financial results from the latest quarter.
Should you buy this social media stock before Oct. 29?
Meta stock looks like a good opportunity
Despite Meta's meteoric rise in the past three years, the current setup still looks favorable. The stock is trading 9% below its peak. Investors can scoop up shares at a compelling forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24.6.
For one of the most dominant enterprises in the world, this might be a no-brainer buying opportunity. This is especially true before a potential positive catalyst in the upcoming earnings report.
Investors must maintain a long-term mindset
Meta has exceeded Wall Street earnings per share estimates in 11 straight quarters. Perhaps it's likely this streak will continue, which could push the stock higher as we head into November.
As enticing as it sounds to buy shares before the Oct. 29 update, it's extremely important that investors aren't making this decision with a short-term mindset. Buying and holding stocks should be done with a timeframe that spans at least five years, forcing investors to think about the fundamentals."

BOTHELL, WASHINGTON / ACCESS Newswire / October 10, 2025 / ReelTime Media, Inc. (OTCID:RLTR) today highlighted a striking market divergence as its stock continued to rise while many of the world's largest AI companies fell sharply. Investor confidence in ReelTime's flagship ""Reel Intelligence"" (RI) platform propelled ReelTime higher, even as global tensions and tariff anxieties triggered losses across the broader AI sector.
ReelTime's stock resilience stems from the unique independence of its RI platform. Unlike conventional AI systems that rely on specialized chips and massive data centers, RI is fundamentally chip-agnostic and globally distributed, meaning it is not tethered to any single hardware supplier, cloud cluster, or country's infrastructure. This strategic advantage has insulated ReelTime from the geopolitical headwinds currently battering its peers.
Everyone is encouraged to try RI Now for free at http://tryrinow.com/
""While others scramble to navigate chip shortages, tariffs, and political crosswinds, RI thrives because it lives throughout the connected world,"" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of ReelTime Media. ""RI doesn't rely on a single chipset or server farm. It was built to operate everywhere, all at once, making it resilient where others are vulnerable.""
Industry analysts have taken note of RI's unconventional design and performance. In an update earlier this year, experts described RI as ""smarter, more capable, higher quality, more efficient, and significantly more environmentally friendly"" than any other AI on the market. Since its public launch in March, RI has surpassed industry-leading AI systems across multiple domains, from language fluency to image generation, music composition, and even 4K video creation, all while using only a fraction of the computing resources required by traditional models. These breakthroughs, achieved without the massive server farms or costly GPU clusters of rival platforms, reinforce why investors see ReelTime's technology as fundamentally different. Today's market action underscores that RI's hardware-agnostic, globally distributed approach is proving its value, as ReelTime extends its rally in the face of challenges that sent many big-tech AI stocks sinking.
Why Reel Intelligence (RI) Is Superior to Traditional AI Platforms
-
All-in-One Creativity: RI handles an array of tasks that typically require multiple AI tools, from natively generating 4K cinematic video and photorealistic images to composing Grammy-eligible music with vocals and even writing or debugging software code. This comprehensive capability outstrips siloed platforms that specialize in only text, images or code, positioning RI as a one-stop creative intelligence solution.
-
Self-Learning & Adaptive: RI continuously improves itself via proprietary real-time feedback loops, allowing it to evolve faster than competing models that wait for manual retraining. In practical terms, RI gets smarter and faster with each interaction, whereas traditional AIs remain static between big updates. This adaptive learning gives RI a growing performance edge over time.
-
Independent of Data Centers: Dubbed the ""greenest AI on Earth,"" RI runs without energy-draining centralized servers. Its lightweight, distributed architecture leverages existing connected devices for processing power instead of power-hungry data centers. By eliminating bulky server farms, RI dramatically reduces infrastructure costs and carbon footprint, all while delivering high-end AI functionality to users.
-
Globally Distributed Power: Rather than hinging on any single chipset or cloud facility, RI scales across a worldwide network of nodes, dynamically allocating work around the globe for maximum efficiency.

The headline-grabbing designer debuts this past season — from Matthieu Blazy at Chanel to Demna at Gucci — are just a sign of how powerful a storm is passing through.
There’s also the continued slide of the American department store, the near-complete digitization of marketing, President Donald Trump’s trade war with the world, the after-effects of the pandemic, the tech dominance of a few large players like Meta and Google, and so on and so forth.
The industry is just different today, even from only seven or eight years ago.

And as the changes started to pile up, the old business models stopped working or stopped working well enough to avoid some kind of a big transformation project.
The numbers just aren’t adding up the same way.
Antony Karabus, a longtime strategic adviser to retailers, gave a back-of-the-envelope accounting of how the costs of all the retail must-haves have changed since 2017 or 2018.
- “In retail, IT was somewhere between 1.5 percent and 2 percent of sales,” Karabus said. “Now it is anywhere from 3 percent to 5 percent-plus.
- “Marketing has gone from under 2 percent to somewhere between 3 percent and 5 percent of sales, which is massive,” he said. “Today, the cost of digital technology, digital marketing is dominated by Amazon, Facebook, Instagram and Google.”
- Logistics costs have “exploded” from a range of 3 percent to 4 percent of sales to anywhere from 5 percent to 10 percent as the industry seeks to keep up with Amazon’s free shipping and returns for Prime members.
Taken together, that’s a 5- to 10-point swing in costs that has brought the respectable 10 percent or 12 percent EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin down into the doldrums of the midsingle digits.
“It’s getting a lot harder to make money,” Karabus said. “And whenever you think you’ve got a really strong position, it’s not guaranteed. The great example is what’s happening with Lululemon right now with Alo and even Costco at the other end of the spectrum getting stronger and stronger. [Lululemon was] considered to have had a strong moat around their business. You see it even with folks like that.”
Fashion has always been competitive and brands have had to push to keep improving. But getting just that much sharper might not be enough.
“If you continue to incrementally get better, you are falling further behind Amazon, Costco and Walmart, because they have more wherewithal to leapfrog further,” Karabus said.
And even the very big have proven to be able to be agile, too, with Walmart standing as Exhibit 1, as it seems to be successfully retooling to meet the competitive threat of Amazon.
Since that divide between the very big and everyone else in retail is not a new thing, the giants have already taken big steps ahead.
Investment banker David Shiffman, head of consumer retail at Solomon Partners, said: “Of the top 150 publicly traded retailers, 82 cents of every revenue dollar goes to the top 20. The bigger you are, you have greater scale, you enjoy lower cost of capital, you have a stronger balance sheet, you have the ability to reinvest more.”
Business is draining away to the extremes.
“Where has market share gone? Luxury players selling to U.S. consumers and fast-fashion players — Zara and H&M — have done fantastically well. Off-price has taken enormous share,” Shiffman said.
“What’s left are the lifestyle brands that are predominantly the specialty retailers that have been around for decades, that are very mature, have large store bases, have large DTC businesses that now are lower margin businesses,” he said. “The market doesn’t ascribe high values to them. The middle has gotten hollowed out.”
This all goes a long way to explaining fashion’s curiously active deal market, which was supercharged instead of shut down when Trump again ratcheted up tariffs on U.S. imports.
Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. snatched up Foot Locker Inc. in a $2.4 billion deal. Prada is buying Versace from the struggling Capri Holdings. Authentic Brands Group is taking Guess Inc. private and bought Dockers from Levi Strauss & Co. Bluestar Alliance is buying Dickies from VF Corp.
At the other end of the retail market, Saks Global is shopping a stake in Bergdorf Goodman and The Webster sold a majority position to Frasers Group.
Shiffman is bullish that there’s more activity ahead for the deal market as companies come to grips with the change that’s still to come in retail.
“When you have black swan events, hundred-year floods, they’re supposed to happen infrequently. The reality is, in retail, they’re happening annually,” he said.
“Those who are miscapitalized — either undercapitalized or over-leveraged — are going to have to remedy balance sheet-types of challenges. You’re going to see more large-cap multibrand players continue to prune their portfolios. You are going to see a growing appetite by brand management companies to deploy more capital and buy more businesses and buy businesses of size and scale.”
That leaves the giants playing in another league entirely, the rare unique companies starting up their growth curve, everybody else looking for traction and the brand management crew, which at the very least has a clear vision for the future.
“The predominant portion of the companies that are for sale today are distressed,” said Heath Golden, chief executive officer of Marquee Brands, which owns the intellectual property of Martha Stewart, Ben Sherman, Anti Social Social Club, Body Glove and many more.
“Either it’s a healthy brand within a distressed company or a distressed company,” Golden said. “Liquidity can be challenging and that’s causing people to seek buyers.
“Then there’s other companies maybe that aren’t yet distressed, but in this environment with the challenges that are happening out in the sourcing world, largely tariff driven, there’s companies that are just struggling to see where the growth comes from — so trying to sell before anything turns too bad on them. The brand management companies have an advantage in that situation because our model helps to solve for those things.”
And that’s really what everybody’s looking for — a solution for an uncertain future.

Meta Platforms (META, Financials) shares climbed after Citizens reiterated a Market Outperform rating and set a $900 price target, pointing to artificial intelligence as a key growth driver across the company's advertising and platform businesses.
The firm said AI improvements have strengthened Meta's core advertising operations, helping marketers achieve higher returns and fueling continued spending. Meta's revenue grew 19.4% over the past year, supported by enhancements to its recommendation algorithms and new AI-powered tools for businesses.
One of the best things about Meta is its Business AI, a virtual sales assistant that can help customers with their questions, suggest products, and finish transactions. Early users have said that they get more sales and bigger orders on average. People responded that these AI technologies are making a difference in business and making it easier for firms to talk to customers.
Meta is always adding new products, including ones that aren't for advertising. Instagram is launching a TV app to go up against YouTube more directly.Facebook Reels has also been improved with faster learning algorithms that suggest tailored content. Meta also added public communities on Threads, allowing users to engage in topic-based discussions.
The company's strong execution has helped it maintain 82% gross profit margins and a $1.84 trillion market capitalization. Analysts at TD Cowen also kept a Buy rating with an $875 target, noting resilience in ad demand through the third quarter."

According to Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives, the market reaction stems from China’s announcement about tightening restrictions on rare earth materials effective December 1.
""After a relatively calm few months and improving relations between the US and China this step up in tensions has created a white knuckle moment for the markets with tech stocks under major pressure today,"" Ives noted.
The analyst characterized the situation as ""a game of high stakes poker"" between the US and China amid the ongoing AI revolution, with Beijing also increasing scrutiny of NVIDIA’s advanced chips.
Ives maintained his bullish stance on tech stocks despite the sell-off, suggesting that ""the bark will likely be worse than bite this time around as cooler heads prevail."" He views such market reactions as buying opportunities for semiconductor, software, and Big Tech companies.
The analyst highlighted several companies leading what he called the ""4th Industrial Revolution,"" including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Palantir (which he dubbed ""the Messi of AI""), Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.
Ives predicted tech stocks could rise another 7% or more by year-end, describing the current market as a ""1996 Moment...and NOT a 1999 Moment."" He also pointed to OpenAI’s recent investments in NVIDIA and AMD as evidence of ongoing capacity expansion and enterprise demand.
""Sell-offs like today we encourage investors to buy the tech winners and not head for elevators despite this war of words between Trump and Xi,"" Ives concluded.

Third quarter earning season is underway with the biggest tech names slated to report later in the month. It'll of course give us the latest read on just how much companies are spending and making on artificial intelligence, which has driven markets to repeated record highs. Here with more on what to watch is Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and Global Head of Technology Research. Dan, it's great to see you, as always. Um, so we're going into earning season for this company for these companies at a time where there is this debate of valuations. There is this debate about the so-called circular economy, how much they're all sort of spending on each other. Um, what are you going to zero in on in the in these earnings reports?
Yeah, I look, Julia, I'd say, I mean, the street's still massively underestimating what this tech cycle is going to look like. I think it's an AI super cycle. And I think this 3Q earnings is going to be much more of a validation moment in terms of not just for chips but for software. And I think the broader build out. Look, it continue the bears in hibernation mode. They've missed the last two and a half years. and they'll continue to miss this bull market that I think has another two years ahead of it.
You know, it's interesting because I haven't talked to that many bears, right? The bears, the straight up bears are hard to find on this stuff. It's more the message that maybe you should start to diversify a little bit. It's not that you should sell necessarily, maybe take a little bit of profits and put it in some of the smaller companies in the space, put them outside of AI entirely because maybe we're in a little bit of a a breathing period here. What do you think of that argument, Dan?
Look, I get it. I mean, but my view is we're in the second inning of a nine- inning cycle. So, I mean, to to peel away from an AI perspective, talk about people have peeled away from AMD over the last, you know, a month ago, or Oracle six months ago, or Nvidia a year ago. See my whole point is like, the street's under estimating what this cycle is going to look like. And I think ultimately in the next one, two years, numbers are maybe 20, 30% underestimated. And I think that's why three Q earnings is just going to be more validation showing the use cases are exploded."

A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after President Trump threatened to impose ""massive"" new tariffs on Chinese imports, reigniting trade war fears.
The unexpected announcement shattered a monthslong calm on Wall Street, sending major indices tumbling. The S&P 500 dropped around 1.3%, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7%. Investors reacted by selling off stocks, particularly in the technology and retail sectors, amid concerns that escalating trade tensions could disrupt global supply chains and increase costs for companies. The sell-off marked a significant reversal from the morning's slight gains, highlighting the market's sensitivity to geopolitical trade developments.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

Zooming In On Skillz (SKLZ)
Skillz’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 45 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock dropped 4.2% on the news that a steeper-than-anticipated drop in U.S. consumer confidence raised alarms about future consumer spending.
The Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in September, its lowest reading since April. The decline was attributed to growing pessimism among Americans regarding inflation and a weakening job market. This data is particularly concerning for companies reliant on discretionary spending, such as those in online retail, travel, and the gig economy, as reports suggest a bleak consumer outlook could curb spending on non-essential items and services. The survey's Expectations Index, a measure of short-term outlook, has remained below a key threshold that often signals a future recession, adding to investor concerns about the economic landscape."

Baidu BIDU, China’s leading search and AI company and Meta Platforms META, the social media conglomerate behind Facebook and Instagram, represent contrasting yet compelling approaches to AI monetisation. Both are investing heavily in foundation models, cloud infrastructure and next-generation computing, though they operate in very different markets and regulatory settings.
Each company shares the ambition to scale large language models, expand cloud capabilities and build immersive digital experiences that redefine how technology fits into everyday life. As BIDU and META develop formidable AI ecosystems while pursuing distinct growth paths, the question for investors is which presents the stronger opportunity. Let’s delve deeper to find out.
The Case of BIDU
Baidu’s transformation into an AI-first enterprise is reshaping both its growth composition and financial trajectory. The company leads China’s AI ecosystem through three key pillars - AI Cloud, autonomous driving and the modernisation of its search platform. Its four-layer architecture spanning infrastructure, frameworks, models and applications enables deeper enterprise integration and supports long-term scalability across sectors.
In the second quarter of 2025, total revenues declined 4% year over year, as softer online marketing trends offset strength in newer businesses. Baidu Core revenues reached RMB 26.3 billion ($3.66 billion), with non-online marketing revenues up 34%, driven by rising enterprise demand for AI-powered cloud and generative solutions. This reflects an ongoing shift toward AI-led businesses, partly offset by slower legacy advertising.
However, higher investment intensity continues to weigh on profitability. Operating income declined 45%, reflecting higher infrastructure and compute costs linked to large-scale AI deployments. The rollout of generative and multimodal search features remains in early stages, limiting near-term monetization, while investments in model training and autonomous mobility continue to lift expenses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $4.34 billion, indicating a 9.33% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for EPS is pegged at $7.51, down by 9.7% over the past 30 days, indicating a 28.66% year-over-year decline. These trends reflect a temporary recalibration as Baidu invests heavily to build durable, high-margin AI platforms.

University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment After the Open
Later on this morning, a preliminary Consumer Sentiment survey from the University of Michigan is due out. The October print is expected to be the third-straight down to 53.5 from 55.1 in September, though still off the 52.2 levels in April and May. The tariff environment is far less nebulous than it was back in the spring, but still uncertain how it will impact consumer prices in the medium-term.
Last month, inflation expectations among consumers in this survey actually ticked down a tad, perhaps indicating tariff realities are not as painful as some may have anticipated. These types of sub-headline numbers will be interesting to compare when today’s report comes out at 10am ET.
What to Expect from the Stock Market Today & Next Week
Aside from this University of Michigan survey, we were expected to also receive Monthly U.S. Federal Budget figures for September, but those will be mothballed while the federal government shutdown continues through Week 2. Next week was supposed to have provided Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) results, but they won’t either without an agreement on Congress’ budget resolution.

This aggressive investment underscores the company’s determination to expand its cloud infrastructure footprint and strengthen its position as a global cloud powerhouse. The bulk of the spending is directed toward revenue-generating equipment in new data centers, supporting Oracle’s surging Remaining Performance Obligations, which are expected to exceed $500 billion soon.
The plan includes building 37 new multi-cloud data centers, bringing Oracle’s total to 71 worldwide, with new sites under development in Texas and New Mexico. This expansion aims to meet rising demand from enterprise clients and hyperscaler partners, including OpenAI, NVIDIA, AMD and Meta, all of which rely heavily on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for AI workloads. OCI revenues grew 55% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, and management expects it to rise 77% this year to $18 billion, with long-term projections targeting $144 billion by 2030.
However, this massive capital spending is putting pressure on free cash flow and margins, with a negative $362 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, and Oracle has taken on additional debt to finance expansion. The Zacks model forecasts free cash flow to be negative $380.7 million throughout fiscal 2026, which would create liquidity concerns if growth slows.
Still, Oracle’s CapEx supports its expanding AI and multi-cloud ecosystem, powering products like Fusion and NetSuite with embedded AI capabilities. With the Zacks model predicting 16.5% revenue growth in fiscal 2026, the company's strategic bet looks set to pay off.
Oracle Faces Fierce Rivals in AI CapEx Race
Microsoft MSFT is accelerating its AI-driven cloud expansion with record CapEx. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, Microsoft spent over $24 billion, and it plans another $30 billion for first-quarter fiscal 2026 alone. Microsoft’s massive investments in data centers, AI chips and cloud infrastructure strengthen its leadership in Azure and enterprise software while positioning Microsoft at the forefront of global AI growth.
Amazon AMZN via AWS is intensifying its AI and cloud dominance with massive CapEx investments. In the second quarter of 2025, Amazon’s spending hit $31.4 billion, with annual investments projected to exceed $118 billion. Amazon’s unmatched scale, in-house AI chip innovation and vast data center network give it a powerful edge over Oracle. With AWS’ global reach and pricing strength, Amazon continues to reinforce its leadership in cloud and AI infrastructure."

Citigroup Inc.’s basket of 46 stocks most favored by non-professional investors, which includes companies like SoFi Technologies Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc., is up 30% since the start of September, beating the S&P 500 Index’s 4.3% gain. Meanwhile, retail trading volume has increased to an all-time-high, the bank’s equity trading desk wrote in a research note Tuesday.
“It’s been our contention for quite some time that the stock market gains have been largely propelled by a combination of FOMO and MOMO,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “At this point, every dip is perceived as a buying opportunity, and uptrends are something to be chased.”
Citigroup’s figures on trading activity defied weak October seasonality, with volume rising to the highest since the bank started tracking the data in 2018.
Data from other banks shows a big jump in volume as well. From Oct. 2 through the close of trading on Oct. 8, retail investors accelerated their weekly purchases of stocks to $7 billion, an increase from the of $5.3 billion per week over the past two months, JPMorgan equity and quant strategist Arun Jain wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.
The buying spree coincided with renewed optimism around artificial intelligence stocks, fueled by a series of corporate deals, bets on interest-rate cuts and expectations for resilient earnings. Indeed, AI-linked names remain the epicenter of retail enthusiasm. Dell Technologies Inc. drew its largest inflow in nearly five months, while members of the Magnificent Seven such as Tesla Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., but excluding Apple Inc., saw sizable buying, Jain wrote.
Risk-on sentiment is present in the options market as well. Over the last seven trading sessions, retail gamma supply — a gauge of how much investors are selling options and collecting premiums on short-dated calls and puts — jumped to an all-time high of $93 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The surge was led by growth-oriented names, with technology and communications stocks seeing the steepest pickup."

When asked why he believed the company would be a top performer, here is what the analyst said at the time:
“ I think if you look at Amazon, Meta, or Microsoft, it’s very strategic for them to have a second source. They need to keep Nvidia’s pricing in check. Nvidia, to their credit, while prices and margins have gone up, have not taken advantage of their customers. They’ve profited from them greatly, but they’ve not exploited their market position. The buyers we’re talking about—hundreds of billions of dollars going into AI infrastructure—they need to make sure there’s a competitor. We’ve already seen the AI category for AMD growing to a $5 billion market for them over the next year.”
Over the past year, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) shares have gained 36%. The stock is up 95% so far this year, thanks to the recent surge following its latest deal with OpenAI. AMD agreed to supply 6 gigawatts of compute capacity to OpenAI.
Macquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and manufactures semiconductors, including central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and other high-performance computing solutions for various markets like gaming, data centers, and AI. The company currently maintains a small market share for GPUs used for AI applications though by 2027, we believe the company will have product on par with the market leader, NVIDIA. Hyperscale customers with deep programming expertise may increasingly decide to dual-source high-end chips leading to much larger revenue and profit gains in coming years for AMD than investors currently expect.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Is this the bull market's final act? As mom-and-pop investors pile in, Wall Street observers hear echoes of past bubbles
Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images
Retail investors are buying stocks in force and pushing up stock prices — a dynamic that’s spooking some veteran Wall Street analysts and observers.
According to data released this week, Citigroup’s index of stocks most favored by individual investors, which includes SoFi Technologies, Riot Platforms, and Facebook parent Meta, has surged 30% since the start of September, compared with a 4.3% gain in the S&P 500.
Here's what to know.
Fastest pace of retail buying since 2021
JPMorgan Chase says retail investors have bought about $7 billion in stocks in the first week of this month, up from roughly $5 billion per week over the summer. That marks a roughly 40% increase and the fastest pace of retail buying since the 2021 meme-stock boom.
Of course, the connection between retail dollars flowing into the market and rising stock prices isn’t strictly one-to-one. But the directional pressure looks to be unmistakably upward. A 40% jump in buying doesn’t automatically translate into a 30% gain because prices reflect the push and pull of broader forces, including institutional, algorithmic, and other sources of demand.
Still, when billions in new money flow each week into a handful of popular tech names, it can add meaningful fuel to market rallies. Rising prices draw in more buyers, which functions to raise prices, which then functions to draw in even more buyers. It’s a classic feedback loop.
As Interactive Brokers strategist Steve Sosnick put it, “Every dip is seen as a buying opportunity” while “uptrends are something to be chased.”
Options trading among retail investors has also climbed to record highs, JPMorgan noted. For Wall Street veterans, the phenomenon may appear spooky because it touches on historical patterns and what you might call insiders’ more fundamental view of institutional vs. retail dynamics.
'Smart money' vs 'dumb money'
On Wall Street, the old distinction between “smart money” and “dumb money” goes back at least a century. The “smart” money generally refers to institutions such as hedge funds, money managers, and corporate insiders, which are perceived as moving early and strategically, guided by research and access.
The “dumb” money has traditionally meant retail or “mom and pop” investors, who tend to arrive late to rallies, driven more by headlines and fear of missing out than by fundamentals or asset mis-pricings. The line has grown blurry over the last decade, with the rise of trading apps and real-time data, but the distinction endures as shorthand for a familiar cycle.
Retail pile-ins have preceded past crashes
When individual traders pile in, it often signals that a long bull run is nearing its end. In the late 1990s, online brokerages helped fuel the dot-com bubble. In 2006 and 2007, broad participation, especially in housing and financial stocks, preceded the global crash. Still later, in 2020 and 2021, pandemic-era stimulus checks in combination with zero-commission trading drove a similar mom-and-pop boom that tailed off sharply after the Federal Reserve tightened policy.
It's true that retail investors now represent a larger, more permanent presence in markets than they have historically. Still, crowded buying among a handful of fast-rising technology names and the overall growth in inflows has some strategists worrying that the peak is here."

finnhub,META,2025-10-10T11:15:00,3 Breakout Growth Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,These three companies look like they could be AI leaders over the long term.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7e6ad7b95861fc2c7d2a9b3539eb0dcf4592ed3f14bf364bdb221c422543402b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/3-breakout-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/3-breakout-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/3-breakout-growth-stocks-you-can-buy-and-hold-for/,fool.com,200,,"Growth stocks have been leading the market higher, and with artificial intelligence (AI) still looking like it could be in the early innings, there is every reason to believe this could be the case moving forward.
Let's look at three growth stocks that looked positioned to lead over the next decade.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) was supposed to be at risk when chatbots started answering questions directly, but the company turned that threat into an advantage. It folded its Gemini models right into search, rolling out AI Overviews and AI Mode so users could move back and forth between traditional search and AI chat with a click. That change has driven more queries, which is feeding into Alphabet's advertising platform, driving growth.
The company has always been good at using its own ecosystem to stay ahead. It became the default search engine for billions of people by controlling Android and the Chrome browser and cutting a revenue-sharing deal with Apple to lock in prime placement on iPhones. Now it's building a similar moat in AI.
While its cloud computing business, Google Cloud, is only No. 3 in market share, it has arguably the most complete AI stack. In addition to its leading Gemini model, it also has custom AI chips, called tensor processing units (TPUs), that help lower costs, strong data analytics tools, and Vertex AI for helping customers build and deploy their own AI models and applications.
On top of that, it Waymo's robotaxi business keeps expanding into more cities, and its work in quantum computing is starting to show real progress. Alphabet is setting itself up not just to protect its lead in search but to become one of the leading AI and tech companies on the planet over the next decade.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) turned itself into one of the biggest AI beneficiaries because it figured out how to use the technology to keep people engaged on Instagram and Facebook. Its AI-driven recommendation systems have become so good at feeding users the content they want to see that time spent on its platforms keeps going up, which creates more ad space to sell.
At the same time, its AI tools give advertisers better targeting and more effective ads, which has led to higher prices and strong returns for marketers. That combination pushed ad revenue up 22% in the most recent quarter.
What will make Meta interesting over the next decade is that it is still barely monetizing some of its largest assets. WhatsApp, with 3 billion users, has only just started showing ads, and Threads is still in the early stages of user growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also been pouring billions into AI infrastructure and talent to pursue what he calls ""personal superintelligence."" Meanwhile, the company is testing smart glasses with consumer appeal and has not walked away from its metaverse ambitions.
None of these projects have to succeed to keep Meta growing, but if even one of them works out, the sky is the limit for the stock.
3. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) emerged as one of the key behind-the-scenes players in the AI buildout. As companies look for alternatives to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), they have been increasingly turning to Broadcom to help them design custom-built chips to handle AI tasks. While these chips are pre-programmed and lack the flexibility of GPUs, they tend to be faster and more energy efficient than GPUs for the tasks for which they've been designed.
As the market starts moving toward inference, where costs per inference matter more and Nvidia's CUDA software is less of an advantage, Broadcom is positioned to take AI chip share.
Broadcom first proved its chops by helping Alphabet design its TPUs, which now handle a big chunk of Google Cloud's AI workloads. That success led Meta and ByteDance to sign on as customers, and together those three represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for Broadcom in fiscal 2027. A fourth customer, widely believed to be OpenAI, has reportedly placed a $10 billion order for next year, and reports suggest Apple is also working with Broadcom on its own AI chips.
As more companies look for ways to cut the cost of inference, Broadcom's expertise in custom application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) is likely to make it an indispensable supplier for years to come. Together with its strong networking portfolio and VMware virtualization business, which is helping customers run AI workloads in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, Broadcom is well-positioned to see strong growth over the next decade."

Data center construction — just the cost of building the building — has increased to an annual rate of $43 billion, up 30% year-over-year and 322% higher than $10.2 billion four years ago. Add in the costs of chips and servers and you’re talking about real money.

Cloud providers like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) enjoyed 20%-30% annual revenue growth rates last year. So, it’s understandable that players like Oracle Corp. (ORCL), xAI, Meta Platforms Inc. (META), and others would jump into the lucrative market.
One of the biggest users of AI data center capacity is OpenAI. The company — which is expected to generate $13 billion in revenue this year but earn no profit — recently said it was likely to spend around $16 billion to rent computing servers alone this year. That number could rise to $400 billion in 2029. And now it too is building data centers for its own use.
As for AI stocks, OpenAI is privately held, but many of the other cloud providers are public. Microsoft and Oracle are members of the S&P 500 Systems Software stock price index, which has climbed roughly 24.8% year-to-date. The industry is expected to grow earnings by 15.2% this year and 14.3% in 2026. Its forward P/E is 33.7, near the top end of its range in all periods except the 2000 dot-com bubble.

The lack of new Meta hardware deployments is possibly ""a timing issue related to Meta's ongoing RSC buildout and Penguin's fiscal calendar,"" the analyst stated. He expects Meta to resume hardware deployments involving Penguin during fiscal 2026.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
Arrived Homes
Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly."

From Google’s TPU strength where the company is anticipated to maintain 100% market share through 2026, to the ramp of Meta’s AI ASIC, MTIA v2, several growth drivers seem to be working in favor of the stock.
The firm believes that investor attention will be focused on aspects such as the $10 billion in revenue associated with Broadcom’s fourth ASIC customer, AI outlook and ASIC backlog updated, and also potential additions to its XPU customer pipeline.
Broadcom is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets.

The analyst explains to Market Catalysts host Julie Hyman why he believes the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) is in an AI bubble and what could pop it.
To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.
In a research note out this week, Seaport Research partners makes a call that the AI trade is indeed in the early days of a bubble driven by spending from six major companies, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Open AI and Oracle. It comes as the tech sector has announced a wave of deals between some of these players. And joining me now to break down that call, Jay Goldberg, Seaport Research partners senior analyst. Jay, it's good to see you. Thank you for being here. Um, and you know, you say it's a bubble, but that's not necessarily a bad thing or it's not necessarily imminent that the bubble is going to burst, I guess is what you're trying to communicate.
That that's right. I think we're in a bubble, but we're in early stages of the bubble and you can still make a lot of money. The stocks can still go up a lot from here. Um, but I think people just need to be aware that they're they're we're we're starting to get a little bit beyond the realm realms of rationality and into more sort of faith-based, uh belief-based investing.
Well, when you talk about those six companies that are so pivotal to this AI trade, of course, there's been a lot of concern that everything is riding on just a few players. And even among those players, I mean, Open AI is unique, as you point out, in that it doesn't really have cash flow. The others do have good cash positions. But the other, I mean, you know, we have the six up here, but it maybe open AI should be in the middle of it rather than just one of the others, right? Because doesn't it seem like it's sort of the center of the web in some ways?
So, I I think that's the important thing that's taken place right now. In the last few weeks, we've seen two, I think big changes in what's what's sort of the pacing of things. The the first is Oracle is now taking on debt to fuel its growth. And if you look at sort of historical bubbles, once you enter the company's taking on debt phase, that accelerates things. Debt is great on the way up, uh it juices things, but it's it's an amplifier. So it it's good on the way up and it's you know, it's makes things extra painful on the way down. Uh the other big shift is that Open AI has been, like you said, in the middle of lots of deal making, uh and it's an interesting company.
It doesn't, it doesn't make a profit, doesn't have free cash flow. It's actually has pretty serious negative free cash flow. Uh and they are the the most aggressive out there signing deals. Um just in the last two weeks, they've talked about adding 16 gigawatts of capacity, which is just a staggering amount uh of compute. And uh there are a lot of legitimate questions about where they're going to get that money from and what it's going to take. But critically, I think all the other names on that list are watching what Open AI is doing and are afraid of missing out. They don't want to lose to this uh this startup. And so they're going to spend aggressively to keep to keep up with that. And that's why I think the this bubble will keep it'll keep growing.
And as it keeps growing, I mean, what in the past when we've had bubbles, there's always sort of a precipitating event, even if it's a small one, that call causes the house of cards to come down to mix my metaphors. What what could how could that possibly play out this time? What should investors be watching for?
So, I think there's a lot of ways that it could it could fall. Uh in particular, once you start adding debt, then you have timing becomes really important. And I don't think this is, you know, I don't think any of the the companies on the list other than Open AI have problems with credit or making their their debt payments. But there are lots of other entities sort of below them, right? You go first to the to the neoclouds, companies like Core Weve and Nebius and Cruso and Lambda. Uh they're all taking on a fair amount of debt to finance this. And then beneath them, there's another layer of special purpose vehicles and smaller funds, smaller companies that are building all this. Uh and it's not quite a house of cards, but they are we we are dealing with smaller entities that don't have strong balance sheets, that don't have strong cash flow. And and things it's it's easy to see them getting tripped up and causing wider spreading problems."

Brook Dane, co-head of public tech investing at the firm, pointed to companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), and HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) as beneficiaries of the AI boom, signaling that selective stock picking in this sector could yield significant returns as enterprise adoption and capital spending accelerate.
Dane reaffirmed his optimism on AI during an appearance on CNBC’s Money Movers, highlighting opportunities across AI infrastructure, data management, and enterprise applications.
Trending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends
Addressing concerns over potentially inflated AI valuations, Dane emphasized the role of active investing in identifying value. “We’re finding plenty of stocks to buy right now in the market for our clients that are priced at really attractive rates. For example, look at Nvidia. We all know Nvidia is getting 70 cents of every dollar of capex being spent. Capex is likely to be up something north of 30% in the next year. It’s trading at like a 3.2% free cash flow yield. That seems like an attractive entry place. That doesn’t seem like a bubble. It doesn’t seem like it’s extended.”
He added that while some areas of the market are overheated, disciplined selection can uncover compelling opportunities. Nvidia remains a top pick for Goldman Sachs.
AI Picks Beyond Nvidia
Beyond chipmakers, Dane outlined three key areas for investors to watch in AI. First, the infrastructure layer, including companies like Nvidia and TSM, which are building the hardware to run AI models.
Second, the data and security segment, where firms such as Snowflake, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), and Varonis Systems (NASDAQ:VRNS) benefit from efforts to organize, secure, and govern enterprise data for AI applications.
The third, more nuanced area is AI applications. Dane noted opportunities exist where companies leverage durable data advantages to drive growth, even amidst frontier AI competition.
Examples include Samsara (NYSE:IOT), which specializes in fleet management software and telematics, and HubSpot, recently partnering with OpenAI on an agentic model builder.
“HubSpot has this great advantage of being the tech provider for many small businesses...they are going to look to HubSpot to help them guide them through this confusing period of time around AI,” Dane said."

But now that Wang has moved on to run AI at Meta, many funders see an opening — and are willing to fund companies with compelling new strategies for collecting training data.
The Y Combinator graduate Datacurve is one such company, focusing on high-quality data for software development. On Thursday, the company announced a $15 million Series A round, led by Mark Goldberg at Chemistry with participation from employees at DeepMind, Vercel, Anthropic, and OpenAI. The Series A comes after a $2.7 million seed round, which drew investment from former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan.
Datacurve uses a “bounty hunter” system to attract skilled software engineers to complete the hardest-to-source datasets. The company pays for those contributions, distributing over $1 million in bounties so far.
But co-founder Serena Ge (pictured above with co-founder Charley Lee) says the biggest motivation isn’t financial. For high-value services like software development, the pay will always be far lower for data work than conventional employment — so the company’s most important edge is a positive user experience.
“We treat this as a consumer product, not a data labeling operation,” Ge said. “We spend a lot of time thinking about: How can we optimize it so that the people we want are interested and get onto our platform?”
That’s particularly important as the needs of post-training data grow more complex. While earlier models were trained on simple datasets, today’s AI products rely on complex RL environments, which need to be constructed through specific and strategic data collection. As the environments grow more sophisticated, the data requirements become both more intense for both quantity and quality — a factor that could give high-quality data collection companies like Datacurve an edge.
As an early-stage company, Datacurve is focused on software engineering, but Ge says the model could apply just as easily to fields like finance, marketing, or even medicine.
“What we’re doing right now is we’re creating an infrastructure for post-training data collection that attracts and retains highly competent people in their own domains,” Ge says."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping industries by enabling machines to analyze vast datasets, identify patterns and make informed decisions. The rapid deployment of generative AI (Gen AI), agentic AI, and multi-modal learning supported by advanced hardware like GPUs and TPUs is fueling innovation across healthcare, finance, robotics, cybersecurity and e-commerce. AI now powers chatbots, diagnostics, fraud detection and autonomous systems, boosting agility while simultaneously improving efficiency.
Per IDC, global spending on AI is expected to reach $307 billion in 2025, expanding to $632 billion by 2028. Per Gartner, global Gen AI spending is expected to hit $644 billion in 2025, indicating 76.4% growth over 2024. U.S. tech giants, including Microsoft MSFT, Adobe, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META, have been at the forefront of bringing remarkable advances to AI technology, well supported by powerful AI chips from NVIDIA NVDA, Analog Devices ADI and Micron Technology MU. The recent deal between Open-AI and AMD reflects growing demand for AI chips.
Microsoft-backed OpenAI introduced GPT-5 in August, which offers multi-modal understanding across text, images, audio and more. The latest model offers stronger reasoning, emotional intelligence, persistent memory for personalized interactions and an autonomous task-performing agent. AI is evolving rapidly, with Meta Platforms’ latest AI systems boasting self-improvement without human intervention, pushing AI toward superintelligence. Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.1 in August for data analysis tasks, while Alphabet introduced Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) for image generation and editing.
Alphabet is infusing AI into its search business in order to attract more users, while Meta Platforms’ focus on integrating AI into its platforms is driving user engagement. Both initiatives are driving ad revenue growth.
We believe that the rapid deployment of AI technology and huge spending on its development efforts offer significant growth opportunities for investors. Our Artificial Intelligence Screen is an invaluable source for identifying AI stocks with massive growth prospects.

Garmin Investment Narrative Recap
To own Garmin shares, you need confidence in its ability to sustain innovation across wearables, outdoor, and specialty devices while effectively managing cost pressures and economic uncertainty. The recent launches of the rugged eTrex Touch navigator and eco-friendly Descent X30 expand Garmin's reach, though they do not meaningfully change the key short-term catalyst: growing subscription services and higher-margin offerings. The most immediate risk remains margin compression if operating expenses continue to outpace revenue growth.
Among the latest developments, the partnership with Meta stands out as most relevant. By integrating Garmin's technology with Meta's Oakley AI glasses for real-time training insights, Garmin could boost its service revenues and further entrench itself in connected fitness, a critical area given the company’s focus on premium, recurring subscriptions as a growth engine.

SAN FRANCISCO, October 09, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Echelon, the AI platform automating enterprise IT implementations, development, operations and managed services, today emerged from stealth and announced $4.75 million in seed funding led by Bain Capital Ventures. Its AI agents compress ServiceNow implementations from months to days, replacing the need for offshore developers that have made enterprise IT rollouts slow, expensive and often unreliable. Additional investors include leading angels and executives from Anthropic, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Meta, Atlassian and PagerDuty.
Enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow are foundational but notoriously hard to implement and maintain. Enterprise IT rollouts have suffered from ongoing talent shortages, poor-quality offshore labor and inconsistent service. According to industry research, demand for ServiceNow professionals is outpacing supply, with many customers turning to offshoring partners who deliver mixed results. The $1 trillion global IT services market remains ripe for disruption.
Echelon has built the first-ever AI agents that handle end-to-end enterprise software delivery, starting with ServiceNow. Echelon replaces the need for offshore developers with AI agents that compress project timelines from months to days. Instead of hiring an outsourced ServiceNow consultant, companies can now activate a trained Echelon agent that works alongside their internal team to execute platform migrations, custom application development, managed services, and ongoing maintenance instantly and consistently. The result is faster time to value, fewer errors and better ROI for both customers and their platform vendors.
""The biggest barrier to digital transformation isn't technology — it's the time it takes to implement it,"" said Rahul Kayala, founder and CEO of Echelon. ""AI agents are eliminating that constraint entirely, allowing enterprises to experiment, iterate, and deploy platform changes with unprecedented speed. This unlocks a completely different approach to business agility and competitive advantage.""
Echelon’s AI agents are purpose-built for platforms like ServiceNow, combining system-specific expertise with the ability to execute real enterprise workflows. Customers can assign development tasks, configuration changes or entire implementations directly to AI agents, who work in tandem with platform admins. These agents are continuously trained on new platform capabilities and industry best practices to maintain quality and compliance at scale. Echelon is currently focused on serving ServiceNow customers, with plans to expand support for additional platforms."

Partnership with Permian Labs, the developer of the USD.AI protocol unlocks blockchain-based credit markets for scalable GPU deployments
ATLANTA, GEORGIA / ACCESS Newswire / October 9, 2025 / QumulusAI, a provider of GPU-powered cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence, today announced a $500 million non-recourse financing facility arranged by Permian Labs and distributed through the USD.AI Protocol.
The facility allows QumulusAI to finance up to 70% of approved GPU deployments with stablecoin liquidity from USD.AI's blockchain-based credit market. This structure offers faster access to capital compared to traditional financing alternatives like bank or private credit capital, with flexible terms enabling a non-dilutive path to scale AI infrastructure.
QumulusAI's facility reflects a broader shift in how compute infrastructure is financed. Global demand for AI infrastructure is projected to surpass $6.7 trillion by 2030, yet capital remains concentrated among hyperscalers like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. USD.AI's financing model opens new pathways for emerging operators like QumulusAI, linking real-world hardware directly to blockchain-based credit markets for accelerated, more transparent scaling.
Permian Labs developed the financing framework behind USD.AI, which treats GPUs as a financeable commodity. Permian Labs issues GPU Warehouse Receipt Tokens (GWRTs), and USD.AI serves as the on-chain DeFi protocol that enables those tokens to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoin-based credit, unlocking capital for the next generation of AI builders.
This structure creates yield-bearing opportunities for onchain depositors, while giving operators fast, transparent access to non-dilutive financing.
For QumulusAI, the $500 million facility signals institutional confidence in its infrastructure growth strategy and provides a repeatable model for scaling deployments with blockchain-native financing rails. For Permian Labs and USD.AI, it represents the continued expansion of real-world assets into on-chain credit markets, bridging institutional capital with income-generating compute infrastructure.
""This partnership represents a paradigm shift in AI infrastructure financing,"" said Mike Maniscalco, CEO of QumulusAI. ""By leveraging Permian Labs' tokenization framework, we can scale faster and more flexibly - meeting the surge in AI compute demand without the constraints of legacy financing.""
""QumulusAI is exactly the type of innovative AI operator we built USD.AI to serve,"" said Conor Moore, Permian Labs Co-Founder and COO. ""Their integrated approach to AI supercompute-combining HPC cloud, purpose-built data centers, and controlled power generation-fits seamlessly with our tokenized financing model, proving how blockchain can unlock institutional capital for real-world infrastructure."""

This is especially true in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, where increased computing costs are the primary bottleneck on growth. As many readers will know, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has benefited tremendously from the growing importance of data center computing. The computer chip designer is now the largest company in the world by market capitalization, and the $46.7 billion in revenue it posted last quarter was up 56% year over year.
Large data center builders such as Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) are now spending tens of billions of dollars on Nvidia's chips every year. In a bid to cut down on these costs, Meta just acquired an AI computer chip start-up called Rivos. Did this just turn one of Nvidia's top customers into a competitor overnight? The answer is more complicated than it seems.
Custom semiconductors to decrease costs
With plans to spend around $70 billion on capital expenditures this year and even more in 2026, Meta is putting considerable sums toward feeding its insatiable need for Nvidia chips to train and power AI systems. Meta had already been in talks with Rivos about building chips using the RISC-V architecture, an open-source chip design platform. Now, after its acquisition, Rivos will focus on building AI chips for Meta's internal use.
This could impact Nvidia's dominance. Not only could it decrease its unit volume, but it could eliminate the company's sustained pricing power, which has sent gross profit margins up to 70% and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins up to 58% over the last 12 months. Pricing power is a huge reason why Nvidia now has the largest market cap in the world. A reversal of this trend could mean pain for its shareholders.
Nvidia will not get disrupted overnight
Nvidia shareholders should keep a close eye on increased competition from customers trying to build their own AI chips to ease its choke hold on the AI data center market. Conversely, investors in Meta should keep close track of its progress in designing its own computer chips and bringing them into production, as that could result in huge cost savings for the business over the long term.
Regardless of what happens, Nvidia will not get disrupted overnight. It can take a full year or longer to design and validate a chip, which then has to wait in line at a foundry to get manufactured. Even then, first iterations for chip designers are usually years behind the latest offerings from more-established competitors. It is not like Nvidia is going to sit tight and just wait for the competition to catch up.
One AI company thought far ahead of Meta
Meta is smart to start designing its own chips. The Nvidia tax is large and not going away anytime soon. Even if it takes Meta years and billions of dollars in investment, the tens of billions of dollars it could eventually save every year through vertically integrated chip design will make it well worth it.
One company learned this lesson many years ago: Alphabet. The parent of Google and YouTube started using its first tensor processing units (TPUs) in early 2015, and has slowly been scaling up the usage of these computer chips in its own data centers ever since. This is the only example of an Nvidia customer actually producing computer chips that are close to equivalent to its wares in terms of cost-effectiveness. Compared to every other AI player, Alphabet now has a competitive advantage because of its TPUs.
Even so, Alphabet remains a major customer of Nvidia 10 years later. Taking the TPU as a case study, it is highly unlikely that Meta's acquisition of Rivos is going to kill Nvidia's business. Don't use it as a reason to sell the stock."

NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top recommended stocks.
Josh Brown from CNBC recently said in a program that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the best way to play the AI trade despite the stock’s bull run. He said most major AI deals end up benefiting NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Brown thinks investors should focus on the obvious winner in the space instead of thinking about the “next Nvidia.”
“NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still the most obvious way to play the AI buildout theme. Just look at the CoreWeave deal today. It’s a $14.2 billion agreement with Meta. It’s great for CoreWeave because it diversifies them a little bit away from Microsoft and adds another monster company to their roster of clients in a very big way. But what does Meta get out of this? They’re getting access to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Grace Blackwell 300 systems because CoreWeave already has that infrastructure in place and ready to go. This — all of this — benefit accrues to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the end. It may not go up the most from here relative to other AI plays, but it is the foolproof name for people that want to gain sector exposure or want to gain thematic exposure, and I don’t really see that changing. They’ve got this unbelievable competitive position. We’ve been talking about it on the show forever because it’s true, and everyone’s always like, well, what’s the next, what’s the new NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)? There are other ways to play AI. We’ve seen other chip companies work out. I’ve talked about Lam Research on the show. We’ve had Broadcom. We’ve had AMD. But in the end, I still think people would be better off looking for the obvious answers and defaulting to them. And if you’ve done that with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), congratulations. We’re now breaking into a new range, and who knows how high this one can go.”
It's hard to find cracks in Nvidia's story in the short term. Why? Nvidia owns about 90% of the GPU market, which is expected to reach $3 to $4 trillion by 2030, according to Jensen Huang. McKinsey sees data center CapEx hitting $6.7 trillion with no slowdown in sight in the short term. Nvidia’s next-generation GPU series Rubin is coming in 2026, and the company also has a software edge in AI computing with its CUDA platform, which is now the de facto standard for AI programming. With no competitor and rising global demand for its chips, Nvidia is a very strong market position.

Chicago, IL – October 9, 2025 – Stocks in this week’s article are Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT.
October's Momentum Alert: Meta, Vertiv Among Top Picks
Historically, October has been a volatile month for the stock market, making it challenging to pick the top momentum stocks. Therefore, savvy investors should employ the ""buy high and sell higher"" approach, also known as the Driehaus strategy, to identify momentum stocks. This strategy has helped Richard Driehaus earn a spot on Barron's All-Century Team.
To that end, stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. and Vertiv Holdings Co. have been selected as today's momentum picks using the Driehaus strategy.
Breaking Down the Driehaus Strategy: A Guide for Investors
Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria when creating a portfolio, following Driehaus' philosophy.
It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.
Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.
Here are the top two of the 37 stocks:
Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms develops products that help people connect and share globally through mobile devices, personal computers, and wearables. Meta Platforms has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for META is 20.5%, on average.
Vertiv
Vertiv designs and produces essential digital infrastructure technologies and lifecycle solutions for data centers, communication networks, and industrial settings worldwide. Vertiv has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for VRT is 10.7%, on average."

The move comes via Intel's new Intel Robotics AI Suite software package, which includes things like advanced algorithms and vision-language models, as well as its Panther Lake chip. Combined, the company said, they'll help developers build robotics, such as individual robotic arms for future humanoid robots.
""Effectively, this is a Panther Lake that has almost 200 TOPS [trillions of operations per second] worth of performance and can run one of these humanoid robots on a board that's the size of your passport,"" Mike Masci, vice president of product management with Intel's Edge Computing Group, told Yahoo Finance, adding that this highlights the latest chips' power and energy efficiency.
""We're proving to the industry, effectively, the myth of x86 not being able to be low power and not being able to fit into these unique form factors; we're just basically challenging every one of those paradigms,"" he added.
The tech industry is in the midst of an enormous race to create practical humanoid robots, with companies including Tesla (TSLA), Agility Robotics, Apptronik, and Boston Dynamics competing to be the first to bring the machines to market.
And like Intel, Big Tech companies are keen on getting in on the action, with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) developing and powering the AI that brings robots to life.
We're still quite a way away from humanoid robots folding our clothes or taking the dog for a walk, but in the meantime, Intel said there are plenty of real-world applications for robotics software and chips that are being used today.
""Just one example is order accuracy in retail stores,"" explained Matthew Formica, senior director and head of edge product marketing at Intel.
""In fast food, you order online from Uber Eats ... When that order is fulfilled, it's humans putting the food into the bag, but increasingly they're trying to remove errors. There are solutions now to put a camera that points at what the person's doing that [compares] the order with what they're actually putting in the bag, and using the same [vision-language model]-style technology to have a deep understanding of what those items are.""
If someone forgets to add a soda to an order or puts in the wrong kind of burger, Formica explained, the system can then flag it and ensure they drop in the right product.
""So while humanoids are sort of the tip of the spear ... there's a lot of real markets today where the application of that technology is much more real,"" he added."
finnhub,META,2025-10-09T13:00:04,These 2 Computer and Technology Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar,Investors looking for ways to find stocks that are set to beat quarterly earnings estimates should check out the Zacks Earnings ESP.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=34547f76cb199a2e5a15c4d3b491a398d66ac3e3a1a5e7f01897141bd604d1c2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-computer-technology-stocks-could-130004494.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-computer-technology-stocks-could-130004494.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-computer-technology-stocks-could-130004494.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist
The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.
The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Fortinet (FTNT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 5, 2025, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.66 a share.
By taking the percentage difference between the $0.66 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.63 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Fortinet has an Earnings ESP of +4.43%.
FTNT is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Meta Platforms (META) as well.
Slated to report earnings on October 29, 2025, Meta Platforms holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and its Most Accurate Estimate is $7.56 a share 20 days from its next quarterly update.
Meta Platforms' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at +12.24% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.74.
FTNT and META's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.
Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported
Use the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading. Check it out here >>

Advances Akero’s Mission of Bringing Novel Therapies to Patients with High Unmet Medical Needs
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (“Akero”) (Nasdaq: AKRO), a clinical-stage company developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk”) for up to $5.2 billion in cash.
Under the terms of the agreement, Akero shareholders will receive $54.00 per share in cash at closing and a non-transferable Contingent Value Right (“CVR”). Each CVR will entitle its holder to receive a cash payment of $6.00 per share upon full U.S. regulatory approval of efruxifermin (“EFX”) for treatment of compensated cirrhosis due to MASH by June 30, 2031.
The upfront cash portion of the consideration represents an equity value of approximately $4.7 billion, a 19% premium to Akero’s 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP), and a 42% premium to Akero’s closing price on May 19, 2025 prior to market speculation. Combined, the upfront and potential contingent value payment represent, if achieved, an equity value of approximately $5.2 billion, a 32% premium to Akero’s 30-day VWAP, and a 57% premium to Akero’s closing price on May 19, 2025 prior to market speculation.
Akero’s innovative EFX program – focused on developing a best-in-class treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (“MASH”) – will complement Novo Nordisk’s leadership in GLP-1 based metabolic treatments. Novo Nordisk’s world leading capabilities in cardio-metabolic disease will enhance and accelerate evaluation of EFX in the Phase 3 SYNCHRONY program, preparation for a successful commercial launch, and delivery of EFX to patients in need around the globe.
“We are excited to enter into this transaction with Novo Nordisk, which follows a comprehensive review undertaken by our Board of Directors, delivers meaningful value to Akero shareholders, and positions us to expand treatment options for people around the globe through Novo Nordisk’s industry-leading development capabilities and commercial infrastructure,” said Andrew Cheng, M.D., Ph.D, President and CEO of Akero Therapeutics. “I want to thank Akero’s talented employees for their tireless commitment to advancing EFX and meeting a critical global unmet need. We look forward to joining the Novo Nordisk family and accelerating the momentum of EFX to deliver a transformational impact on patients’ lives.”"

But the fierce ascent has also raised concerns about a bubble.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2050e4e0d9d6e906e26f1941edbf2faca367285fa2a97113e66d6d481219f555,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/09/investing/us-stock-market-ai-bubble-concerns,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/investing/us-stock-market-ai-bubble-concerns,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/investing/us-stock-market-ai-bubble-concerns,cnn.com,200,,"Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence has propelled markets to record highs this year. But the fierce ascent has also raised concerns about a bubble.
AI has been the dominant theme in markets since 2022, when OpenAI first launched ChatGPT. Optimism has since spread among investors about a potential transformative AI boom, and enormous amounts of money have flowed into tech stocks. Valuations have risen to historically expensive levels.
To some analysts and economists, those are red flags that the market might be in a bubble — when investors bid up stock prices beyond what they’re worth, creating an unsustainable rally that often results in a significant downturn, as seen during the dot-com bubble that burst in 2000.
“Fired up by optimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI, global equity prices are surging,” Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech on Wednesday.
“Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” Georgieva said. “If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth.”
Jamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan Chase, said he thinks “AI is real,” but some money being invested now will “probably” be wasted.
“Take AI, there’s a lot of money going into it,” Dimon said in an interview with the BBC. “AI is real, AI in total will pay off. Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off. But most people involved in them didn’t do well.”
Dimon also said he thinks there is a higher chance of a meaningful drop in stocks in the next six months to two years than what is being reflected in the market.
“I am far more worried about that than others,” Dimon said. “I would give it a higher probability than I think is probably priced in the market and by others.”
“The level of uncertainty should be higher in most people’s minds than what I would call normal,” he said, adding that geopolitics and government debt burdens are contributing to the uncertain outlook.
Bubble nerves
Big tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and infrastructure to build out and power AI, and have earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars for more spending.
These companies’ earnings results continue to impress Wall Street, supporting elevated valuations and the rally in stocks.
Yet some investors said there are questions about whether the spending and AI aspirations will eventually generate enough returns to justify the enormous buildout.
Concerns are growing about whether it is sustainable and what the fallout might be if there is a significant drop in stocks.
Concerns about a potential bubble intensified in recent weeks as AI stars like Nvidia and OpenAI announced deals with circular financing that raised eyebrows that the top players might be propping up the market.
The rise in valuations and emergence of circular financing are among aspects that “rhyme with previous bubbles,” according to strategists at Goldman Sachs.
“While it appears we are not in a bubble yet, high levels of market concentration and competition in the AI space suggest investors should continue to focus on diversification,” the strategists said in a note.
Despite concerns, anything related to AI has been in high demand. OpenAI on Monday announced a new deal with chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), sending AMD’s shares soaring almost 24%.
The rally has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble. However, investors said there is a key difference: Big Tech companies now are actually profitable and delivering strong earnings results.
“Unlike the 1990s tech bubble that featured soaring stocks from unprofitable early-stage companies, strong mega-cap company earnings are driving this year’s rally,” Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Asset Management, said in a note.
Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, said the market is signaling “bubble light” territory. He said investor sentiment has not yet reached the levels of exuberance that would signal the market is at peak risk levels.
“Valuations, positioning and flows are all certainly signaling that we’re in bubble light territory, but sentiment has just not got there yet,” Mullaney said. “And so this thing could still run.”
AI’s growing influence on the S&P 500
Big Tech is an increasingly influential part of the S&P 500, which is weighted by companies’ market value. As AI-related stocks have carried the market to record highs, they have also become a more significant part of people’s 401(k) retirement plans.
While the rapid growth of tech stocks lets individual investors and people saving for retirement take part in companies’ gains, it leaves people vulnerable to a potential extended drawdown if a bubble bursts.
Just seven stocks — Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for 55% of the S&P 500’s gains since the end of 2022, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The Bank of England on Wednesday said the risk of a sharp downturn in the stock market has increased.
“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence,” the bank said in a quarterly report.
“This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” the bank said.
1996, 2000 or neither?
In 1996, then-Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan famously asked whether “irrational exuberance” might be taking hold in financial markets.
While Greenspan warned that the stock market could be running too hot on emotion, the dot-com bubble peak did not happen until four years later in 2000.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on September 23 said stocks are “fairly highly valued,” drawing comparisons to his predecessor’s comments 30 years ago.
Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note: “Is the stock market back on the road to the same irrational exuberance that inflated the Tech Bubble of 1999, which was followed by the Tech Wreck of the early 2000s? Perhaps.”
“However, the S&P 500 has been driven to new highs this year by better-than-expected earnings,” Yardeni said. “We are still targeting the S&P 500 to get to 7,700 by the end of next year.”"
finnhub,META,2025-10-09T08:46:00,Prediction: This Tech Stock Will Outperform Palantir Over the Long Haul,"This tech company's lucrative business model, capital return program, and attractive valuation create a stronger path to outperformance.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=aefc9c7005a07e127467cf68f0b6d8e14576ea7168a8c0dea05798f1ea447231,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-this-tech-stock-will-outperform-palanti/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-this-tech-stock-will-outperform-palanti/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-this-tech-stock-will-outperform-palanti/,fool.com,200,,"After a powerful run-up in the share prices of many companies benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI), it is tempting to lump Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) and Palantir Technologies into the same bucket. But the two businesses and their prospects as potential investments differ significantly.
In short, Meta's extreme profitability, disciplined capital returns, and much lower valuation arguably set it up to outperform the enterprise AI platform specialist. Putting it even more bluntly, Meta looks like a much better stock to buy than Palantir. Yes, Palantir may continue growing at torrid rates for years, but its stock already bakes in near-perfection. Additionally, Meta has a more tested and dominant competitive advantage.
Strong growth
Meta's latest quarter underscores just how healthy its underlying business is.
The company, which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, saw second-quarter revenue rise 22% year over year as both ad impressions and price per ad increased. Even more impressive, its operating income climbed 38% as its operating margin expanded to 43% (up from 38% a year ago), highlighting powerful operating leverage. Net income jumped 36% to more than $18 billion, and earnings per share was $7.14 -- up from $5.16 in the year-ago quarter. These are uncommon levels of profitability for any company, and they matter because profits fund the investments that keep Meta competitive while still leaving ample cash for shareholders.
Importantly, the quarter also showed the company's underlying growth engine is balanced: Daily active people across Meta's family of apps grew 6% year over year, ad impressions rose 11%, and price per ad increased 9%. This multi-faceted growth signals that both engagement and monetization are advancing in tandem.
A powerful competitive advantage
Of course, Palantir is growing even faster than Meta -- and it's throwing off a ton of cash, too. So, what's so impressive about Meta when comparing it to Palantir? One key factor is its staying power. Time and time again, Meta has shown it's essentially impossible to disrupt.
Case in point: When a new digital social format catches on somewhere else, Meta frequently ships a competing feature across its massive user base not long after. That copy-fast capability -- visible in products like Reels and features across Instagram and WhatsApp -- reduces the market share gains of would-be disruptors and keeps engagement robust inside Meta's apps.
Returning capital to shareholders
There's another area Meta easily beats Palantir: capital returns.
Meta repurchased roughly $9.8 billion of stock and paid about $1.3 billion in dividends in Q2 alone. Additionally, Meta's dividend is growing; in February, the board raised the quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.525.
Further, because Meta's earnings and free cash flow are so strong, there's still plenty of cash left over after dividends and repurchases to fund heavy infrastructure spending for AI. At quarter-end, Meta's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled about $47 billion -- even after accelerated capital expenditures tied to data center and network infrastructure expansion.
Meta's mix of robust organic growth, a large cash cushion, and a disciplined (and substantial) capital return program makes the investment case for Meta extremely compelling.
Valuation favors Meta over Palantir
Valuation is where the gap becomes most striking. Meta trades around the mid-20s on a price-to-earnings basis. That is not particularly high for a company growing revenue at a rate exceeding 20% and with an operating margin of more than 40%. Palantir, meanwhile, carries an eye-watering P/E in the hundreds and a price-to-sales ratio of more than 137 as of this writing. Even if Palantir keeps executing well, those multiples leave little room for disappointment. By contrast, Meta's multiple looks far more reasonable relative to its scale, profitability, and cash generation.
Investors should still be mindful of a few key risks. Meta is increasing capital expenditures substantially to support AI and infrastructure, which can pressure near-term free cash flow. Further, advertising is cyclical; if the economy slows, ad budgets can tighten.
Still, Meta combines extreme profitability and scale with the ability to adapt quickly to new social trends -- and it is returning significant cash through buybacks and a growing dividend, while trading at a valuation that still looks reasonable against its results. Meanwhile, Palantir may remain an exciting AI story, but its stock price already assumes extraordinary growth for years to come. For investors deciding between the two, Meta offers the stronger case for outperformance from here -- powered by robust earnings, disciplined capital returns, and a valuation that does not demand perfection."

In mid September 2025, Alexandr Wang, the billionaire founder of Scale AI and the Chief AI Officer of tech giant Meta, appeared on tech podcast TBPN and said that teens dreaming of lucrative tech careers should seize on the opportunity to hone their artificial intelligence skills by immersing themselves in the growing number of AI-powered code generation tools. Wang compared the current moment of rapid technological advancement to the early days of the computer revolution, when people like the Bill Gates of the world capitalized on being early adopters of computers and software. That moment is happening right now — and if you are, like, 13 years old, you should spend all of your time vibe coding, he advised.
Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR), a publicly traded company that specializes in software platforms for big data analytics, has taken this advice to heart. The firm has become one of the biggest success stories of the AI boom by integrating AI into a suite of software products designed for government and commercial purposes. Last month, the firm announced that it had entered a partnership with the UK government that would see an investment of up to £1.5 billion in the UK to deliver new jobs, growth and national security.

Investor euphoria for influential businesses conducting stock splits has been another important upside catalyst for the stock market.
A stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. These adjustments are purely superficial in the sense that they have no impact on a company's market cap or operating performance.
Despite these changes being superficial, investors view stock splits very different, depending on whether they're designed to raise or lower a company's share price. Reverse splits, which aim to increase a public company's share price, are often shunned by investors. Companies conducting this type of split are usually doing so to avoid delisting from a major stock exchange.
At the other end of the spectrum, investors gravitate to businesses announcing and completing forward splits. This type of split, which is designed to make a company's shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, is undertaken by businesses that are out-innovating their peers and executing with precision.
Furthermore, companies enacting forward splits have a history of handily outperforming the S&P 500 in the 12 months following their split announcement. This is why investors are always on the lookout for Wall Street's next blockbuster stock-split stocks.
While there's no way to tell, with any concrete certainty, which stocks will split next, social media titan Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) and one of its ""Magnificent Seven"" peers look ideally positioned to become the headline stock-split stocks of 2026.
Meta Platforms is perfectly positioned to announce a forward split
There's more to picking out the next blockbuster stock-split stock than a high share price. In order for a company's board of directors to propose a split, there typically needs to be substantive ownership by retail investors. Most stocks with share prices of $500 or higher fail this portion of the sniff test -- but Meta Platforms doesn't.
Meta is the only member of the Magnificent Seven that's never completed a split. More importantly, over 28% of its outstanding shares are held by ""non-institutional"" investors. With a share price that's been consistently above $700 for the last four months, it's not hard to imagine that everyday investors who can't buy fractional shares through the broker may be somewhat constrained. This is a recipe that warrants a potential stock split in the coming year.
Beyond having the characteristics to incent a stock split, there's a good probability Meta stock will increase in value over time due to a handful of catalysts working in its favor.
First and foremost, Meta is an ad-driven business. While all the hoopla for the time being has to do with Meta's AI spending and the build-out of its AI-accelerated data center, it's collecting almost 98% of its net sales from ads tied to its family of apps, which includes Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger.
Advertising is a highly cyclical industry that benefits from the disproportionate nature of economic cycles. Since World War II ended 80 years ago, the average U.S. recession has lasted about 10 months, while the typical expansion has endured five years. This is a recipe for ad spending to expand over time.
Additionally, Meta Platforms coaxed an average of 3.48 billion daily active users to its family of apps during the month of June. No social media company comes particularly close to giving advertisers access to this many users, which allows Meta to command quite a lot of ad-pricing power.
Meta's balance sheet gives it plenty of flexibility, as well. Closing out June with more than $47 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and pacing around $99 billion in full-year operating cash flow for 2025, puts it in the driver's seat to aggressively invest in game-changing technologies, such as AI and the metaverse.
It's time for Microsoft's first stock split since 2003
The other high-flying Magnificent Seven stock that looks to have a clear path to a forward stock split in 2026 is none other than Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), the world's second-largest public company by market value behind Nvidia.
Unlike Meta, Microsoft is no stranger to conducting stock splits to make its shares more nominally affordable for retail investors. Since going public in March 1986, it's completed nine forward splits (seven of the 2-for-1 variety, and two 3-for-2 splits). However, the last of these splits occurred in February 2003.
The two catalysts here are that Microsoft's share price has soared well above $500, and more than 33% of its outstanding shares are held by retail investors. Although the ability to purchase fractional shares has become more common for online brokers, a share price north of $500 is well above where Microsoft had previously split its stock in the days prior to fractional-share purchases.
Similar to Meta, Microsoft's high share price and retail investor ownership represent only part of the story. The company's foundational operating segments should also lead to big-time upside in its stock.
Microsoft's key operating segment is cloud infrastructure service Azure, which is incorporating generative AI solutions and large language model applications for its subscribers. The addition of AI solutions has reaccelerated Azure's year-over-year growth firmly back into the 30%-plus range.
But what investors often overlook with Microsoft is the value that its legacy operating segments provide. While Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, these are exceptionally high-margin software segments capable of generating boatloads of operating cash flow. Windows is still the leading operating systems for desktops. Microsoft can redirect the cash it generates from these legacy operations to faster-growing initiatives, such as AI, or use this capital to make earnings-accretive acquisitions.
Not to sound like a broken record, but Microsoft's cash balance is impressive, too. It closed out its fiscal year (June 30, 2025) with $94.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and collected more than $136 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2025.
The table is set for Microsoft to join Meta Platforms as Wall Street's likeliest blockbuster stock-split stocks of 2026."

Why Are We Positive On Meta?
Famously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Reality Labs.
1. Eye-Popping Growth in Customer Spending
Average revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track because it measures how much the company earns from the ads shown to its users. ARPU can also be a proxy for how valuable advertisers find Meta’s audience and its ad-targeting capabilities.
Meta’s ARPU growth has been exceptional over the last two years, averaging 14.5%. Its ability to increase monetization while growing its daily active people demonstrates its platform’s value, as its users are spending significantly more than last year.
2. Outstanding Long-Term EPS Growth
Analyzing the change in earnings per share (EPS) shows whether a company's incremental sales were profitable – for example, revenue could be inflated through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.
Meta’s EPS grew at an astounding 31.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years, higher than its 14.4% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.
3. Excellent Free Cash Flow Margin Boosts Reinvestment Potential
If you’ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills.
Meta has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model and cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that enable it to stay ahead of the competition through investments in new products rather than sales and marketing. The company’s free cash flow margin was among the best in the consumer internet sector, averaging 29.2% over the last two years.
Final Judgment
These are just a few reasons why we're bullish on Meta, but at $718.60 per share (or 14.4× forward EV/EBITDA), is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it’s free for active Edge members.

Therefore, savvy investors should employ the ""buy high and sell higher"" approach, also known as the Driehaus strategy, to identify momentum stocks. This strategy has helped Richard Driehaus earn a spot on Barron’s All-Century Team.
To that end, stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Vertiv Holdings Co. VRT have been selected as today’s momentum picks using the Driehaus strategy.
Breaking Down the Driehaus Strategy: A Guide for Investors
Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria when creating a portfolio, following Driehaus’ philosophy.
It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.
Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.

TD Cowen kept its Buy rating on Meta Platforms Inc. (META, Financials) and its $875 price target ahead of the company's third-quarter earnings announcement, which is due on October 29.
John Blackledge, an analyst, said that Meta is set up for another successful quarter, with ad revenue projected to be a major driver of growth. According to InvestingPro, 32 analysts have lately boosted their earnings estimates. The average target currently ranges from $658 to $1,086.
Meta reported revenue growth of 19.4% over the past year and maintained an industry-leading gross margin of 82%. TD Cowen said ad demand across Meta's platforms remains solid, though rising costs could pressure margins in the second half of 2025.
The company said that Meta's long-term prognosis depends on its smart investments in AI and semiconductor design. The business recently decided to buy Rivos Inc., a chip startup, to improve its own semiconductor skills and rely less on outside partners like Nvidia.
This is meant to make the ads more personalized and interesting. New upgrades to Facebook Reels and the addition of community features on Threads are further expanding Meta's social platform ecosystem.
Analysts expect these AI-driven initiatives to support ad performance and keep Meta's competitive edge heading into 2026."

Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) has emerged as a standout among large tech companies by leveraging AI to drive tangible business results rather than focusing solely on hypothetical or pure-AI products. While the company’s platforms: Facebook, Instagram, and Reels face scrutiny for societal impact, Meta’s disciplined AI integration has accelerated revenue growth and profitability, particularly in its digital advertising business.
By embedding AI into ad targeting, delivery, and analysis, Meta has generated tens of billions in additional cash, which it has reinvested into AI, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and innovation. This approach contrasts with the common misconception that AI’s commercial value only comes from standalone products; instead, Meta’s internal AI enhancements have improved the performance and efficiency of its existing offerings, delivering outsized returns.
The financial impact is evident: Meta’s digital advertising revenue grew by $8.2 billion year-over-year in the most recent quarter, significantly outpacing competitors like Amazon, which grew by $2.9 billion, and Google, which lags in comparable growth. AI-driven improvements in ad recommendations increased conversions by 5% on Instagram and 3% on Facebook, while ad impressions and pricing rose 11% and 9% year-over-year, respectively, even amid consumer spending headwinds. These results underscore Meta’s dominant position in digital advertising and its ability to capture market share through technology-driven efficiency.
Overall, Meta represents a unique investment case where AI is not just experimental but profit-generating, enhancing the core business while reinforcing its leadership in digital advertising. The company’s proven ability to convert technological investment into tangible financial outcomes provides a compelling risk/reward profile for investors seeking exposure to AI-driven growth within a mature, cash-generative platform.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) by LongYield in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s AI-driven ad growth, strong Q1 financials, and strategic AI investments. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 30% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out with continued ad revenue acceleration. Joe Albano shares a similar perspective but emphasizes AI’s direct impact on ad efficiency and market share."

AAOI’s forward P/E was 84.03 according to Yahoo Finance.

Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) stands out as a speculative yet compelling beneficiary of the ongoing data center buildout, which shows no sign of slowing until lenders or hyperscalers curb spending. With U.S. data center construction projected at 10GW annually through 2030, demand for optical transceivers is set to surge, supporting AAOI’s growth trajectory. The company manufactures transceivers critical for converting fiber optic to electronic signals, a market expected to expand from $15 billion today to $35 billion by 2029.
AAOI has been approved as a supplier for at least three hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, and likely Amazon, with SEC filings confirming Amazon holds warrants tied to a potential $4 billion supply agreement. While not yet firm orders, early shipments are already driving performance, with Q2 revenue up 139% year-over-year and trailing twelve-month revenue up 77%. Current quarterly sales of $103 million are projected to rise another 12–23% in the near term.
AAOI’s past failures, including quality issues in 2018 that collapsed its stock from $70 to $2, still weigh on investor sentiment, explaining its high options volatility and cautious valuation. Yet management’s insider buying and growing hyperscaler ties indicate confidence in execution. If AAOI merely maintains its current 2% market share, revenues could surpass $1 billion by 2029, implying a modest doubling of market cap.
However, if it regains a 5% share, revenues could approach $2.5 billion, implying a market value near $9 billion and a stock price above $140, versus today’s $26. The key risks remain quality execution and sustainability of hyperscaler investment, but with hyperscalers generating $400 billion in annual operating cash flow and competing aggressively, the buildout appears durable. This sets AAOI up as a high-risk, high-reward play with asymmetric upside if market share expansion materializes.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Fabrinet (FN) by Industrial Tech Stock Analyst in April 2025, which highlighted the Amazon warrant deal as a strategic validation of Fabrinet’s role in hyperscaler supply chains and a catalyst for long-term growth. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 83% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. The thesis still stands as Fabrinet remains a critical optical supplier. Unemployed Value Degen shares a similar view on data center growth but emphasizes AAOI’s hyperscaler approvals and potential market share expansion as a high-risk, high-reward play."

finnhub,META,2025-10-08T15:11:00,Hold Your Horses: AMD's OpenAI Payday Starts in a Year (and Really Ramps Up in 2027),AMD just scored a massive artificial intelligence (AI) deal with OpenAI. But there's a catch that investors need to understand.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7e31ed3ec33fef0e0837d59bdb1bda0187214bc72eecdc03b6f62a7ed2ecfde5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/amd-openai-payday-starts-in-a-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/amd-openai-payday-starts-in-a-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/amd-openai-payday-starts-in-a-year/,fool.com,200,,"Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%) just inked a headline-grabbing artificial intelligence (AI) partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI -- but investors shouldn't expect big sales right out of the gate.
The OpenAI contract is indeed a big deal. However, the revenue clock doesn't start until the second half of 2026, with the real ramp-up to follow in 2027. Each gigawatt-scale tranche of AMD's Instinct MI450 and Helios rack installations could translate into double-digit billions of annual AI-related data center revenue once ramped. You just have to give AMD some time to get its number-crunching ducks in a row.
AMD's AI superhighway won't open until late 2026
AMD is finally getting the green light to build a 6-gigawatt AI superhighway with OpenAI. But it takes time to deliver on a project this big.
The on-ramp opens in late 2026, when the first AMD MI450/Helios systems go live. Traffic really starts moving in 2027, when each new lane -- Instinct chips and Helios racks -- can add many billions of annual revenue once it's humming along at full scale. AMD's management expects the partnership to add more than $100 billion to the company's sales over ""the next few years,"" including direct OpenAI shipments and a smattering of additional deals inspired by this week's announcement.
The speed limit and mile markers are baked into a complex set of stock warrants: OpenAI unlocks vesting based on actual chip deployments and AMD share-price targets.
If all targets are met, OpenAI could acquire up to 160 million AMD shares in five years. That's about 10% of the 1.6 billion shares AMD has in circulation today. The final tranche takes effect when AMD's stock reaches $600 per share. That's about triple the stock's closing price on Oct. 6.
Whether OpenAI goes public or not, this structure gives the private company market-based performance incentives. It's a great road for AMD and a genuine route around Nvidia's pricey tollbooths -- but it's a long drive with scheduled maintenance, not an instant teleport.
AMD and OpenAI can still see other people
Crucially, this contract is nonexclusive. AMD can sell MI450/Helios to anyone, and OpenAI will keep buying AI accelerators from Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) (and possibly others) because the world needs every ounce of AI compute it can get nowadays.
You're watching the industry shift into a multivendor phase -- less obviously dominated by Nvidia, more about second-sourcing and managing the total cost of ownership. The AI accelerator industry suddenly looks more competitive. AMD's Instinct chips may not win many head-to-head performance comparisons against Nvidia's Blackwell family, but the math often changes when you include power consumption in those calculations.
The domino effect: Who's next in line to buy AMD chips?
Will OpenAI rivals like Anthropic, X, Meta Platforms, or Alphabet's Google follow with big AMD orders? That's hard to tell, and some of it may already be happening behind closed doors. It's fair to say that OpenAI tends to set the tone in the AI market, and others tend to follow suit when the ChatGPT maker takes a big step.
Wall Street was quick to embrace the news either way. AMD stock hit a fresh all-time high on the announcement, arguably for good reason: This deal is real validation and a clearer line of sight to big AI dollars for the chip-supplier underdog.
You just need to give the top line some time to expand, since the OpenAI sales won't start flowing until the second half of 2026. But you know what they say about patience being a virtue, especially on Wall Street. Big, juicy AI revenue streams are coming AMD's way, just not right away."

We recently published Top 10 Trending Stocks as Famous Billionaire Predicts Massive AI Stock Rally Before Bubble Burst. CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the trending stocks.
Amit Daryanani, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, said in a latest program on CNBC that CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ:CRWV) is positioned to benefit from the rising AI infrastructure demand. He recently started covering the stock with a $175 price target.
“You have Microsoft and Meta over here and hopefully other customers as well. I do think fundamentally what’s happening with them right now is demand for AI infrastructure is far in excess of what supply is. Coreweave is positioned to benefit really well from having one of the largest independent GPU clusters — 250,000 plus GPUs — that a lot of customers beyond just Microsoft and Meta could use. I would argue customers like Google and others could look at this as well to meet incremental demand, because that’s really what the shortage is right now: there’s not enough supply to go around for all these companies.”

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- HiOctave, the AI software company helping small and mid‑sized businesses (SMBs) automate and personalize customer experiences, today announced its launch and $15M in financing, led by Vinod Khosla and Khosla Ventures. Additional investors and shareholders include Celesta Capital, Anthology Fund, operated jointly by Anthropic and Menlo Ventures, and Carya Venture Partners.
HiOctave was incubated by co-founders Andy Lee, Alorica Founder and Executive Chairman; and Anand Chandrasekaran, Managing Partner at Celesta Capital and formerly at Meta, Five9, and General Catalyst. Lee and Chandrasekaran previously co-founded Crescendo, an AI-powered customer experience platform for enterprises that combines AI and human agents. Within 20 months of founding, Crescendo has grown to $100M in revenue and delivered more than 500 agentic AI deployments for mid-market enterprise customers. Golan Agmon, previously eCommerce COO for $10B SMB software company Wix, will join HiOctave as co-founder and CEO.
SMBs make up over 90% of U.S. businesses, employ 45% of the private workforce, and generate 44% of U.S. GDP – yet, most lack modern, AI‑native tools to maintain high‑touch customer relationships at scale. HiOctave's platform is designed to enable SMB founders and lean teams to deliver high‑touch, high‑trust customer service without high overhead, despite typically not having teams dedicated to vendor selection or deployment. The platform provides off-the-shelf customer satisfaction management for SMBs delivered in an easy-to-use, mobile-first experience, including autonomous voice and digital agents, automated quality monitoring, voice of customer analytics, and escalation tools.
""Agentic AI will transform how small businesses operate,"" said Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures. ""SMBs have long been underserved by traditional software. HiOctave will empower entrepreneurs to run their businesses in the era of AI, led by a team with a proven track record of bringing AI to new markets and deep experience building for small business owners."""

Chicago, IL – October 8, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Reddit RDDT and Meta Platforms META.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Reddit vs. Meta: Which Social Media Stock Is the Better Buy?
Reddit and Meta Platforms are leading social media platforms that monetize user engagement through digital advertising. While RDDT is an emerging social media platform, gaining traction with community-driven advertising, Meta leads the broader social networking space through platforms like Facebook and Instagram.
Per the Grand View Research report, the global digital advertising market size was valued at $488.4 million in 2024 and is expected to reach $1,164.25 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 15.4% from 2025 to 2030. Both Reddit and META are expected to benefit from this rapid growth pace.
RDDT or META — Which of these Social Media Giant stocks has the greater upside potential? Let's find out.
The Case for RDDT Stock
Reddit is benefiting from strong growth in user engagement, including rising daily and weekly active users, ARPU gains, and the expansion of advertiser tools such as Dynamic Product Ads, Reddit Pixel and Conversion API.
In the second quarter of 2025, Reddit's advertising revenue increased 84% year over year to $465 million, driven by both existing advertisers deepening their investments and a 50% rise in the active advertiser count. This growth highlights Reddit's ability to attract advertisers across large, mid-market and small-to-medium-sized businesses.
The company's focus on automation and usability is another driver of its advertising success. The platform has integrated tools like Smartly, which combines Reddit's audience and performance data with AI-powered advertising capabilities, making it easier for advertisers to launch, scale and optimize campaigns.
RDDT's expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. The company recently announced the launch of new Reddit Pro tools for publishers. These tools include article insights, RSS auto-import, and AI-powered community recommendations, all of which are currently in beta testing. The platform also introduced a better in-app link viewing experience. This change makes it easier for users to read articles and join conversations directly on Reddit.

Chicago, IL – October 8, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: CoreWeave CRWV, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT and Nebius NBIS.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Will the $14.2 Billion Meta Deal Give CoreWeave the Edge Over Competitors?
CoreWeave's position in the rapidly growing AI infrastructure market is likely to get a boost following its recent deal with Meta Platforms. Under the partnership, CRWV will supply META with cloud computing capacity. Depending on certain conditions, Meta will initially pay up to $14.2 billion through Dec. 14, 2031, with an option to expand significantly through 2032 for more cloud capacity. This deal indicates increasing confidence in emerging AI infrastructure providers like CoreWeave, beyond established players such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.
The META deal comes after the recent OpenAI contract expansion. The new contract, worth $6.5 billion, involves CRWV supplying capacity for OpenAI training of its next-generation models. The total value of OpenAI contact now stands at an impressive $22.4 billion, which includes $11.9 billion agreement in March and $4 billion expansion in May. The contracts with META and OpenAI (which is a leading AI company) not only enhance revenue visibility for CRWV but also validate its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable.
Moreover, collaboration with NVIDIA is another positive aspect. CRWV's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. Additionally, the company deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its ""Mission Control"" for enhanced reliability and performance. NVIDIA also has an agreement with CRWV to purchase residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions.
However, the road to market dominance would not be easy, given that the incumbents in this space still command vast financial resources. There is also fierce competition from upcoming players like Nebius, which CoreWeave needs to watch out for. Another challenge will be scaling efficiently without compromising profitability and margins.
Nonetheless, these various contracts mark a pivotal moment for CRWV, but maintaining this momentum will require disciplined execution, prudent capex management and continued innovation amid rising competition."

OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), a company that hasn’t turned a profit, is spending billions building out data centers to power its artificial intelligence offerings.
On Monday, the company inked a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that will see the chipmaker provide next-generation GPUs to OpenAI, which will also have the opportunity to purchase up to 10% of the company. Nvidia (NVDA), in turn, is pouring $100 billion into OpenAI, which is also a major customer.
Meanwhile, tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) continue to spend billions on their own AI data centers. Then there’s the $40 billion Oracle (ORCL) is spending on Nvidia chips to power OpenAI’s Project Stargate, the Financial Times reported in May.
It all makes for a rather confusing array of deals and moves that continue to raise questions about when exactly all of this spending will turn into profits, not to mention the specter of the dot-com crash of the early 2000s.
But even if the AI hype cycle plays out like the dot-com bubble, a good amount of that investment in AI infrastructure will still pay off, at least in the long run.
“I actually do believe that there is significant long-term demand,” Ram Bala, associate professor of business analytics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, told Yahoo Finance.
“I think it's definitely going to pan out. The macroeconomic challenge is ... there's probably going to be this intermediate phase where it seems like we overbuilt a lot of this and demand isn't quite catching up to all of that.”
Bubbling up
Fears of an AI bubble have been percolating for months as AI stock prices and corporate valuations have continued to soar. Nvidia, the world’s AI chip leader, has a market capitalization north of $4.5 trillion. On top of that, OpenAI is now valued at $500 billion, more than Elon Musk’s SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), which is valued at $400 billion.
The explosion in AI interest and the promise of future riches have also sent Microsoft and Google’s valuations above the $3 trillion mark, with Microsoft quickly closing in on $4 trillion.
It’s enough to raise the hair on anyone’s neck.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos last week said that we’re likely witnessing an AI bubble during a discussion at Italian Tech Week, but he added that some of those investments will eventually pay off.
""When people get very excited, as they are today, about artificial intelligence, for example ... every experiment gets funded, every company gets funded,"" Bezos said. ""The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and bad ideas."""

MIDLAND, Texas, October 08, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (""AST SpaceMobile"") (NASDAQ: ASTS), the company building the first and only space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by everyday smartphones, designed for both commercial and government applications, today announced the signing of a definitive commercial agreement with Verizon (NYSE, NASDAQ: VZ) to provide direct-to-cellular AST SpaceMobile service when needed for Verizon customers starting in 2026. This service will further enhance Verizon's already expansive and award-winning network, building upon the exceptional service and ubiquitous connectivity customers currently enjoy.
The combination of Verizon’s highly reliable terrestrial mobile network, the use of premium multi-operator 850 MHz cellular spectrum, and AST SpaceMobile’s next-generation space-based cellular network in low Earth orbit, is planned to enable cellular customers to stay connected wherever they are, from hiking trails to city centers and everywhere in between.
Featuring the largest-ever commercial communications arrays deployed in low Earth orbit, AST SpaceMobile's network can connect directly to everyday smartphones, eliminating the need for specialized equipment. AST SpaceMobile’s network is designed to operate across premium low-band spectrum, the company’s own licensed L-band and S-band spectrum, and up to 1,150 MHz of mobile network operator partners’ low- and mid-band spectrum, globally. These capabilities advance AST SpaceMobile’s efforts toward commercial service.
""Through our definitive commercial agreement with Verizon, we are working to deliver space-based cellular broadband coverage from space across the continental United States,"" said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. ""The agreement will extend the scope of Verizon’s 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum into areas of the U.S. that would benefit from the ubiquitous reach of space-based broadband technology.""
Proven Technology Through Successful Trials
This agreement follows testing milestones that have proven the capabilities of the AST SpaceMobile network. In a recent demonstration, the companies successfully completed direct voice and video calls, as well as two-way RCS messaging, between standard, unmodified smartphones and a BlueBird satellite in space. A crystal-clear Voice over LTE (VoLTE) call was made from a smartphone on Verizon's network in Texas, connecting via an AST SpaceMobile satellite to another Verizon smartphone in New Jersey. These successful tests represent a significant leap in satellite-to-cellular technology and pave the way for a future of ubiquitous connectivity."

As per the firm, an estimated 2 million advertisers are already using the company’s video generation tools. These tools aren’t just helping to lower creative costs but also paving way for greater personalization that should improve advertising performance.
The firm highlighted how creative elements account for roughly half of overall campaign performance, as previously mentioned by both Meta and Google. This underscores the potential impact of AI-driven tools for them.
Citizens particularly highlighted Meta’s AI business assistant, noting how AI agents can enhance interactive experiences across the platform’s messaging services.
They added how Meta’s Messaging Ads, representing a $10 billion business segment, is likely to continue growing as these AI capabilities expand.

finnhub,META,2025-10-08T08:56:00,Meta Platforms Stock Investors: Circle This Date on Your Calendar,"Meta is growing its earnings faster than every other ""Magnificent Seven"" company except Nvidia right now.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c80736ad6a6421eb15651c07d8ec69e49a63083e24c8793ec6fe4ce07bebb5d4,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/meta-stock-investors-circle-this-date-on-calendar/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/meta-stock-investors-circle-this-date-on-calendar/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/08/meta-stock-investors-circle-this-date-on-calendar/,fool.com,200,,"October is a busy month for the stock market, because it's when companies start reporting their operating results for the quarter ended Sept. 30. As has been the case for the last few years, Wall Street will be laser-focused on the tech giants powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, because they typically deliver the fastest revenue and earnings growth.
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is one of those companies. It's scheduled to release its third-quarter results on Oct. 29, and management's guidance points to a further acceleration in its revenue growth, thanks largely to AI. The upcoming report could be a very positive catalyst for Meta stock, so here's why investors might want to pay attention.
Look for accelerating revenue growth
More than 3.4 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every single day, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Considering that is nearly half the population of the entire planet, finding new users is getting harder and harder, which is why the company is focused on boosting engagement instead.
Simply put, the longer each user spends on Meta's apps, the more ads they see, and the more money the company makes. AI is a huge part of that strategy; Meta uses the technology in its algorithms to learn what content each user likes to see, so it can show them more of it. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), this drove a 6% increase in the amount of time users spent on Instagram compared to the year-ago period, and a 5% increase for Facebook.
Meta adopted a similar strategy for its ad-recommendation engine to target users more accurately on behalf of businesses. During Q2, this led to a 5% increase in conversions on Instagram, and a 3% increase on Facebook. This typically means Meta can charge more money per ad because businesses are yielding a higher return on their marketing spend.
The social media giant generated $47.5 billion in total revenue during the quarter, which was a 22% increase from the year-ago period. That marked an acceleration from the first quarter when revenue jumped by 16%. Management's guidance suggests the company delivered as much as $50.5 billion in revenue during the third quarter, which would represent even faster growth of 24%.
That would be a very bullish result for Meta stock on Oct. 29.
Here's an even more important number to watch
Meta's AI strategy also involves developing new features, like its Meta AI chatbot which can answer complex questions, generate images, or even join your group chat to settle debates. It only launched in late 2023, yet it already has almost a billion monthly active users.
Meta AI is powered by Meta's Llama family of large language models, which are improving so rapidly that they already rival some of the best models from leading start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic, even though those companies had a multiyear head start on development. But in order for the Llama models to continue improving, Meta has to invest heavily in data center infrastructure and chips to unlock the necessary computing power.
The company came into 2025 expecting to allocate somewhere between $60 billion and $65 billion to capital expenditures (capex) for the year, but it has since revised those numbers to $66 billion and $72 billion. Meta would only spend that kind of money on AI infrastructure if it expected a positive financial return, and the signs are already there considering the company's growing engagement, higher ad conversions, and accelerating revenue growth.
A further upward revision to Meta's 2025 capex forecast on Oct. 29 would probably be bullish for its stock, because it might be a signal that management expects an even bigger payoff than originally anticipated.
Meta's stock looks like a bargain heading into Oct. 29
Meta shares are trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.7 as I write this, making it the cheapest stock in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which is the group of tech titans driving the AI revolution forward.
Personally, I think Meta deserves a much higher valuation considering it grew its earnings per share by a whopping 38% in the second quarter, outpacing the earnings growth of every other Magnificent Seven company except Nvidia.
Typically, investors will pay a premium for a company that is growing quickly, so there might be some upside on the table for Meta stock through multiple expansion alone. If the company's third-quarter results match or exceed the high end of management's guidance on Oct. 29, that could be the spark that ignites a powerful rally for the stock into the end of the year."

HENDERSON, Nev., Oct. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- React Conf – The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced its intent to launch the React Foundation. The new foundation will serve as the home for React, React Native, and other supporting projects, helping accelerate React's momentum as one of the world's most widely adopted open source technologies for front-end development.
Contributed by Meta, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that gives developers a simple, replicable way to create dynamic and interactive web applications. React Native extends React for cross-platform mobile applications, leveraged by hundreds of thousands of developers and downloaded over 4 million times every week. React is used by nearly 55 million websites and React Native is one of the top choices for mobile developers building apps today.
""The move to a neutral home is the natural next step in the evolution of this important open source technology to ensure React and React Native remain open, innovative and community led,"" said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation. ""This will be a major milestone for the open source ecosystem, and we look forward to welcoming the React Foundation to the Linux Foundation.""
Founding members of the React Foundation will include Amazon, Callstack, Expo, Meta, Microsoft, Software Mansion and Vercel. The React Foundation will provide governance, manage core infrastructure, organize events, including React Conf., and launch new programs to expand global community collaboration. Seth Webster, Head of React at Meta, will serve as the foundation's executive director.
""We open sourced React 12 years ago and since then the community has made it an essential part of how our industry ships better products. Today React is used by over 20 million developers to build across mobile, desktop, TVs, gaming consoles and VR headsets"" said Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth, Meta CTO and Head of Reality Labs. ""The new React Foundation board will include many leaders who helped get the community where it is today, including from Meta and our partners at Amazon, Callstack, Expo, Microsoft, Software Mansion, and Vercel. I'm excited to keep supporting the React community and making better user experiences for everyone.""

Lightspark CEO David Marcus claimed that Bitcoin remains “severely undervalued” compared to gold, suggesting the cryptocurrency could reach $1.3 million if it matched gold’s market capitalization.
“I still feel Bitcoin is severely undervalued, especially if you compare it to gold,” Marcus said during a Monday interview with Bloomberg, adding that Bitcoin would trade at $1.3 million per coin at gold parity.
The statement came as Bitcoin touched a fresh all-time high above $126,000 on October 7, while tokenized gold assets simultaneously crossed the $3 billion market cap threshold for the first time.
Marcus, who previously led Meta’s failed Libra cryptocurrency project, argued that Bitcoin’s utility as a neutral settlement asset for global payments has not been priced into current valuations.
Former Meta Executive Sees Bitcoin as Internet of Money
The Lightspark founder emphasized Bitcoin’s role as foundational infrastructure during the interview, comparing it to the internet’s architecture.
“Bitcoin is the internet of money,” Marcus stated, explaining that his company bought Bitcoin three years ago to facilitate transactions and support stablecoins on the network.
Marcus acknowledged the improved regulatory conditions under the Trump administration compared to previous years, when roadblocks had stifled innovation across the crypto industry.
He noted that major financial institutions are now embracing Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds, which could be seen as the beginning of an irreversible shift towards mainstream adoption.
“The horse has left the barn,” Marcus said, describing Bitcoin as the most accepted and trusted digital asset globally.
His firm entered Bitcoin during the previous bear market, giving Lightspark an advantageous cost basis as the asset climbed nearly 100% over the past year.
Lightspark specializes in building technologies on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, allowing faster and cheaper cross-border payments compared to traditional alternatives.
Marcus described his company’s work facilitating peso transfers to Mexico 24/7 at a cost below conventional remittance services as an example of Bitcoin’s practical applications.
Tokenized Gold Surges Alongside Physical Metal’s Record Run
The tokenized gold market reached $3.03 billion in capitalization on Tuesday as physical gold briefly topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever.
PAX Gold and Tether Gold dominate the sector, with each token trading just below $4,000 and closely tracking spot gold prices.
Trading volume for gold-backed tokens spiked to $640 million over 24 hours as the precious metal rallied alongside silver, which jumped past $48.50.
The surge occurred during the sixth day of the U.S. government shutdown, which contributed to renewed investor interest in traditional safe havens.
Bitcoin’s current price represents a ratio of roughly 31.6 ounces of gold per coin, down from a peak of over 40 ounces in December 2024.
The declining ratio suggests gold has outperformed Bitcoin in recent months despite the cryptocurrency’s 30% year-to-date gain.
Institutional Analysis Supports Undervaluation Thesis
VanEck’s Matthew Sigel separately argued on Tuesday that Bitcoin could reach $644,000 per coin if it captured half of gold’s store-of-value market at current prices.
“Surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin,” Sigel wrote on X, noting that roughly half of gold’s market value stems from its store-of-value role rather than industrial or jewelry demand.
VanEck’s broader research projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, potentially supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin.
The research also estimates that central banks would hold approximately 2.5% of their reserves in Bitcoin under such a scenario.
Deutsche Bank analysts predicted in September that Bitcoin could join gold on central bank balance sheets by 2030, citing the Trump administration’s strategic Bitcoin reserve initiative.
The growing Bitcoin edge over gold for institutional investors comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.24 billion in net inflows last week, their second-highest tally since launch.
Centralized exchanges now hold just 2.83 million Bitcoin, the lowest level in six years, intensifying supply constraints as demand accelerates.
The Bitcoin-to-gold comparison has sharpened this year as both assets set records amid mounting concerns over currency debasement and fiscal uncertainty in major economies.

While RDDT is an emerging social media platform, gaining traction with community-driven advertising, Meta leads the broader social networking space through platforms like Facebook and Instagram.
Per the Grand View Research report, the global digital advertising market size was valued at $488.4 million in 2024 and is expected to reach $1,164.25 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 15.4% from 2025 to 2030. Both Reddit and META are expected to benefit from this rapid growth pace.
RDDT or META — Which of these Social Media Giant stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.
The Case for RDDT Stock
Reddit is benefiting from strong growth in user engagement, including rising daily and weekly active users, ARPU gains, and the expansion of advertiser tools such as Dynamic Product Ads, Reddit Pixel and Conversion API.
In the second quarter of 2025, Reddit’s advertising revenue increased 84% year over year to $465 million, driven by both existing advertisers deepening their investments and a 50% rise in the active advertiser count. This growth highlights Reddit’s ability to attract advertisers across large, mid-market and small-to-medium-sized businesses.
The company’s focus on automation and usability is another driver of its advertising success. The platform has integrated tools like Smartly, which combines Reddit’s audience and performance data with AI-powered advertising capabilities, making it easier for advertisers to launch, scale and optimize campaigns.
RDDT’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. The company recently announced the launch of new Reddit Pro tools for publishers. These tools include article insights, RSS auto-import, and AI-powered community recommendations, all of which are currently in beta testing. The platform also introduced a better in-app link viewing experience. This change makes it easier for users to read articles and join conversations directly on Reddit.
The Case for META Stock
Meta Platforms’ focus on integrating AI into its platforms, which include Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Threads, is driving user engagement to boost ad revenues.
In the second quarter of 2025, Advertising revenues increased 21.5% year over year to $46.56 billion, accounting for 98% of second-quarter revenues. At cc, revenues increased 22% year over year.
The company’s AI-powered ad recommendation models have improved efficiency and performance, driving approximately 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. Improvements in AI-powered recommendation systems have led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram in the second quarter of 2025.
Meta Platforms is also seeing an increase in the usage of its AI creative tools. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.48 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, which is now available in more than 200 countries and territories."

The move signals the AI startup’s push to deepen its presence in its second-largest market after the U.S.
Amodei is expected to visit Mumbai to meet Ambani and other senior executives at Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company and the parent of the nation’s top telecom operator, Reliance Jio, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Anthropic has been in discussions with Reliance for some time over a potential partnership to expand access to its Claude AI assistant in India, the people said.
India — the world’s second-largest online market after China, with more than a billion internet subscribers — has emerged as an important growth region for Anthropic. Several Indian AI startups already use its Claude models in their products for both domestic and U.S. clients. India also accounts for the second-highest share of traffic to Claude’s website after the U.S., according to digital intelligence firm Similarweb.
In August, Reliance Industries partnered with major technology companies, including its existing investors Google and Meta, to build AI infrastructure and enterprise solutions through its new unit, Reliance Intelligence. The Mumbai-headquartered conglomerate had also explored a potential collaboration with OpenAI, which rolled out its under-$5 ChatGPT plan in India earlier this year and announced plans to open an office in New Delhi later in 2025.
That Reliance-OpenAI partnership was expected to be announced during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s planned visit to India last month, but Altman ultimately postponed the trip.
Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to OpenAI for comment.
Alongside Mumbai, Amodei is visiting New Delhi to meet top lawmakers and senior federal government officials, sources said. He is also expected to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two people familiar with his trip plans told TechCrunch.
Later in the week, Amodei will be in Bengaluru to announce Anthropic’s office opening on Thursday, sources told TechCrunch. Anthropic EMEA head Guillaume Princen and startups chief Daniel Delaney are also accompanying him. Prominent venture funds, including Accel and Lightspeed, are also hosting dedicated sessions with Anthropic executives this week to share insights on how developers and startups can leverage Claude for their offerings."

Tanzeel Akhtar is a seasoned journalist who has been reporting on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology since 2015. Her work has appeared in leading publications including The Wall Street Journal,...
Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) continues to cement its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, ranking fifth among U.S. corporate treasuries with approximately $80 billion in digital assets, according to company data and recent regulatory filings.
A chart published by the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla.
Bitcoin Holdings and Valuation
According to the company’s latest Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion.
The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC.
The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date.
The appreciation reflects Bitcoin’s sustained rally through Q3 2025. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense, noting the accounting implications of its Bitcoin-centric balance sheet.
ATM and Preferred Stock Programs
The filing further detailed updates to Strategy’s extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which collectively represent about $63.9 billion in potential capital issuance. These include:
• $2.1 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF)
• $4.2 billion in Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC)
• $21 billion in 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK)
• $4.2 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD)
• $21 billion in Class A common stock (MSTR)
The company reported no new share issuances during the period, noting that any proceeds from potential future sales would be presented net of commissions.
Financial Position and Oversight
As of the end of Q3 2025, Strategy’s digital-asset carrying value remained $73.21 billion, with a corresponding deferred-tax liability of $7.43 billion. The figures reaffirm Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as its core corporate reserve asset.
The financial disclosures were internally prepared and reviewed by KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. With Bitcoin’s market value continuing to climb, Strategy’s holdings now place it firmly among the top five U.S. corporations by total treasury size — a rare achievement for a firm whose reserves consist primarily of digital assets.

A report by Bloomberg, citing people privy to the matte,r said that the SEC is looking into allegations that AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) violated service agreements with its platform partners to deliver more targeted advertising to consumers.

Meanwhile, Muddy Research said in March that AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) collected and structured user IDs from key platform partners.
For its part, the listed firm said it engaged a law firm to investigate the allegations.
While we acknowledge the potential of APP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Under the partnership, CRWV will supply META with cloud computing capacity. Depending on certain conditions, Meta will initially pay up to $14.2 billion through Dec. 14, 2031, with an option to expand significantly through 2032 for more cloud capacity. This deal indicates increasing confidence in emerging AI infrastructure providers like CoreWeave, beyond established players such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s MSFT Azure.
The META deal comes after the recent OpenAI contract expansion. The new contract, worth $6.5 billion, involves CRWV supplying capacity for OpenAI training of its next-generation models. The total value of OpenAI contact now stands at an impressive $22.4 billion, which includes $11.9 billion agreement in March and $4 billion expansion in May. The contracts with META and OpenAI (which is a leading AI company) not only enhance revenue visibility for CRWV but also validate its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable.
Moreover, collaboration with NVIDIA is another positive aspect. CRWV’s cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. Additionally, the company deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its “Mission Control” for enhanced reliability and performance. NVIDIA also has an agreement with CRWV to purchase residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions.
However, the road to market dominance would not be easy, given that the incumbents in this space still command vast financial resources. There is also fierce competition from upcoming players like Nebius NBIS, which CoreWeave needs to watch out for. Another challenge will be scaling efficiently without compromising profitability and margins.
Nonetheless, these various contracts mark a pivotal moment for CRWV, but maintaining this momentum will require disciplined execution, prudent capex management and continued innovation amid rising competition.
Taking a Look at Competitive Position for NBIS & MSFT
Nebius, while smaller in scale, has emerged as an intriguing challenger to CoreWeave. NBIS is also experiencing hypergrowth with revenues surging 625% year over year to $105.1 million in the second quarter of 2025. AI cloud infrastructure revenues grew more than nine times year over year, driven by demand for copper GPUs and near-peak GPU utilization. Explosive revenue growth demonstrates Nebius’ ability to capture demand in a rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. With the new Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and its data center capacity expanding significantly in parallel, the company expects a substantial increase in sales by year-end."

Candy Ventures Sarl (CVS), a portfolio of companies founded by Mr Candy, is taking legal action against Dutch businessman Robert Bonnier over allegations he “lied” to “deceive” it into investing around 7.5 million euro (£6.5 million) in Aaqua BV, which he directs.
Mr Candy, who was announced as Reform’s treasurer in December last year, owns 90% of CVS.
Barristers for the company told a trial on Tuesday that Mr Bonnier claimed Apple and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) were set to invest one billion US dollars in Aaqua, and as a result, CVS swapped shares in podcasting firm Audioboom for “worthless” shares in Aaqua.
It is asking a court to rescind the investment or order Mr Bonnier and Aaqua to pay £5.7 million in damages.
Mr Bonnier is representing himself at trial and in August was blocked from defending the claim for breaching court orders, with barristers for CVS telling the court he was “restricted to attendance and making oral submissions” and was “not allowed to advance any factual case”.
He has told the court that while he “overstated the prospects of an investment” into Aaqua, he did not believe CVS would “rely” on it.
In written submissions for the trial in London, Jonathan Nash KC, for CVS, said: “In late 2020/early 2021, Mr Bonnier lied to CVS, time and again, both orally and in writing, to deceive it into investing in his company, Aaqua.
“He told CVS that he had discussed Aaqua with two of the world’s biggest names, Apple and LVMH, and believed that they would invest in the company.”
He continued: “In fact, and as Mr Bonnier well knew, none of that was true.”
He added: “As a result of his flagrant fraud, CVS, like other sophisticated investors, was duped into investing in Aaqua.”
Mr Nash told the court Aaqua, which is now insolvent, was established in the Netherlands in 2020 to develop a “new social media software application”.
Mr Bonnier is claimed to have told Mr Candy and Steven Smith, CVS’s executive director, that Apple and LVMH were set to invest in Aaqua, which Mr Smith told the court was “completely fundamental” to CVS’s decision to invest.
Mr Candy met Mr Bonnier in Dubai in January 2021.
Mr Nash claimed Mr Bonnier said he personally knew Apple chief executive Tim Cook and LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, and told Mr Smith that Aaqua would be the “next Facebook”.
CVS agreed in February 2021 to transfer 1.5 million shares in podcasting firm Audioboom to Aaqua, worth around £6.5 million."

Financial news of the past two decades is littered with stories of companies delaying IPOs and growing despite it — Meta, Uber, Airbnb and the like. Some still remain private, most notably Elon Musk’s SpaceX. If they can find success without going public, why should anyone else?
Take the example of Klarna — a 20-year-old company — which recently had a successful IPO on the NYSE, with a nice pop on its first day.
Why would a company like Klarna choose to go public? Public companies have to deal with public investors, follow specific rules on governance, and disclose extensive information. Klarna had no trouble accessing private capital in the past. Surely some of their original backers were looking for liquidity, but there is plenty of private liquidity around if that is all they need.
Many companies have decided that the private markets are a better place to be. Over the last couple of decades, the number of listed companies and new IPOs in developed markets has dropped dramatically. The rigor and scrutiny of being publicly traded, and the perceived pressures that come with opening up the shareholder roll, are burdens many companies would prefer to avoid.
So why go public? The answer is that there are great benefits to being a listed company in a deep, global market. While there are plenty of capital options besides going public, public markets help companies grow up. That discipline and credibility, as well as the opportunity for founders, employees, and investors to benefit from the value created, still make public markets the destination of choice.
And while listings did indeed drop over the past 30 or so years, in that same timeframe, global public market capitalization rose to over $90 trillion, or about 112% of global GDP. Public markets aren’t dead — they’re just misunderstood. The idea that companies must choose between the quarterly spin cycle and the refuge of private markets is a myth. With the right strategy and the right investors, public companies still deliver superior long-term value.
Avoid the short-term cycle
It’s true, public companies spend a lot of time on the quarter — hitting or missing targets, talking to the Street, etc. But the reality is that providing estimates of your next quarter’s earnings only encourages traders to make short-term bets and increases the volatility of your stock price. It’s a habit, not a requirement."

While Warren Buffett said, “our favorite holding period is forever,” occasional investor skittishness is nothing new. Yet has it gone to extremes?
Despite solid stock market performance this year, “I think that we’re in a period where people are not sure about capitalism,” ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi on a new episode of the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (see video above; listen below).
“I do believe we’re still stuck with what happened in 2000 and 2008, which were both horrendous,” he continued. “Although if you held on to the Mercks of the world, you ended up doing fine.”
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Cramer has sat in the host chair of ""Mad Money"" for nearly two decades and is the author of several books, including the recently published ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" He has studied markets and worked to demystify them for the average investor. He was one of the first to call out Nvidia (NVDA) — “my best pick” — when it was just a gaming company. He also had a hand in coining the acronym FAANG (Facebook, now Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG), now Alphabet (GOOGL).
Save the date for Yahoo Finance's BIG Invest event!
“FAANG was the greatest creator of wealth in my life other than Nvidia, and I think my job was to find great stocks,” Cramer said. “But I wanted people to understand why I thought they were great.”
For many young investors, crypto and the hot stocks of the moment often crowd out the more traditional names and advice, leaving them susceptible to more volatile investments. “Compounding is so boring,” Cramer said. “People think it’s too hard. They don’t understand what the P/E means. They don’t understand what it means to buy and hold a great stock.”
This shorter-term thinking contrasts with Buffett’s sentiment on the stock market. He once said, “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”

Year to date, markets remain stable. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up nearly 15% while the Russell 2000 (^RUT) is up 11.61%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up 9.76%. Top S&P 500 performers during this same time period include Robinhood (HOOD), Seagate Technology (STX), Western Digital (WDC), Newmont (NEM), and Palantir (PLTR).

New Clicks + Deterministic Views technology uses AI to measure in-app clicks and ad views across Meta, TikTok, Snap, and more to reveal the true impact of campaigns
Company secures strategic growth investment led by HighPost Capital and Silversmith Capital Partners
SAN FRANCISCO, October 07, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Northbeam, the leader in marketing attribution, today launched its new Clicks + Deterministic Views attribution model, giving marketers a complete picture of how campaigns drive purchases. The first-of-its-kind solution, developed in direct partnership with Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, Pinterest, Axon, MNTN, and Vibe, unifies in-app clicks and ad views across platforms and ties them directly to first-party transaction data.
Northbeam also announced a strategic growth investment led by HighPost Capital and Silversmith Capital Partners.
Unlike traditional models built on statistical guesswork, Northbeam’s Clicks + Deterministic Views model uses verified first-party data to deliver accurate, end-to-end attribution. By crediting view-through revenue alongside clicks, it closes one of digital marketing’s most persistent blind spots. The result is a clear view of the full chain of influence, from view to click to purchase. Just as important, it highlights the true impact of awareness and prospecting campaigns, which have long been overlooked in digital marketing. Key Benefits of the Clicks + Deterministic Views Model include:
-
See beyond clicks: Capture both verified views and clicks for a full picture.
-
Upper-funnel visibility: Quantify how awareness and prospecting campaigns influence purchases.
-
Deterministic accuracy: Every impression tied to a conversion is proven—not modeled—so attribution is grounded in reality.
-
Smarter budget allocation: Know which campaigns drive downstream revenue and confidently scale what works.
-
Cross-platform clarity: Combine verified impression data with Northbeam’s pixel + order data for a single source of truth.
-
Privacy-preserving measurement: Data is processed in Northbeam’s clean room, ensuring compliance and security.
-
Reduce wasted spend: Eliminate over-crediting of last clicks and avoid underspending on top-of-funnel channels.
""Awareness ads are often undervalued because traditional attribution favors last-click interactions and overlooks upper-funnel influence,"" said Stas Goldobin, VP of Product at Northbeam. ""We built Northbeam’s Clicks + Deterministic Views model to set a new standard for attribution accuracy and transparency. Every conversion in our model is backed by verified data. There’s no guesswork—marketers finally get a full picture of the chain of influence, from view to click to purchase, so they can move faster and invest smarter."""

But there are plenty of other things that most investors do know about him.
In 2012, Zuckerberg donned his notorious hoodie to ring the Nasdaq bell as his company Facebook, now Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), went public. There were many questions about the future of the business at the time. But Zuckerberg and company have effectively laid them all to rest.
Facebook ended 2012 with just over 1 billion monthly active users and made $1.54 per user, on average, in the fourth quarter of that year. As of the second quarter of 2025, however, it now has nearly 3.5 billion users across its family of apps and makes $13.65 per user.
Facebook's growth, as well as the growth in the other apps, propelled Zuckerberg's net worth to over $250 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, which is the third-highest spot on the list. But Zuckerberg isn't sitting back sipping a lemonade. His ambitions are higher still.
Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms in 2021 because Zuckerberg believes in a concept called the metaverse -- an interactive digital world. Many companies at the time were investing in the metaverse, and it's mostly fizzled out.
But not for Meta. The company's metaverse division is called Reality Labs, and it reported an $8.7 billion operating loss in the first half of 2025 alone. In short, Zuckerberg still believes in the metaverse, as evidenced by how much money the company is willing to lose on it right now.
Beyond the metaverse, Zuckerberg is also extremely optimistic with superintelligence -- the point at which artificial intelligence (AI) surpasses human intelligence in all domains. In 2025, Meta Platforms engaged in an all-out spending spree to hire the brightest minds in the field to bring Zuckerberg's visions to life.
Everybody knows that Zuckerberg is leading the pack when it comes to social media, the metaverse, and superintelligence. But few realize that he's making gobs of money from something else entirely.
Zuckerberg's little-known income stream
On Sept. 29, Meta Platforms paid a quarterly dividend of $0.525 per share. When that happened, Zuckerberg got a check for around $180 million because he owns over 340 million shares.
At this rate, Zuckerberg rakes in somewhere around $720 million annually from Meta Platforms' dividend alone. Within a few years, he could even get $1 billion in annual dividend income if Meta gradually increases its payouts.
Buffett loves dividends. In reality, he seems to prefer stock buybacks as a way to use excess cash to boost shareholder value. That's what he does with his company, Berkshire Hathaway. But stock buybacks need to be at attractive prices, and most managers don't seem to time it well. So paying out a dividend is an attractive option.
For perspective, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway makes a lot of money from his dividend stocks, including over $800 million annually from Coca-Cola. That's roughly the size of Zuckerberg's dividend from Meta, giving these two very different people something in common.
But what does any of this have to do with the average Joe? Reading about dividend income for the rich and famous hardly seems useful. But indeed, there is a lesson here for all.
Buffett's Berkshire is raking in hundreds of millions of dollars in annual dividend income, but it didn't start out that way. With Coca-Cola, Berkshire started investing in the 1990s. The stock price and the dividend payment were much lower back then. But by holding for over 30 years, it's grown into something incredible. Buffett calls this his ""secret sauce"" -- holding winners.
Zuckerberg didn't invest in Meta Platforms in the same way that Berkshire Hathaway invested in Coca-Cola. He received his shares from starting the company. But make no mistake, Zuckerberg wouldn't be half as well off as he is now if he had sold his stake after only a couple of years. Zuckerberg held on to this winner, which is Buffett's secret sauce.
The same principle holds true for any investor, even if the scale is smaller. Take a stock such as Microsoft. If you bought 10 shares 10 years ago, you would have received $12.40 in dividend income that year. But over the last 12 months, you would have received $34 -- nearly a 200% increase, not to mention the stock is up more than 1,000% as well.
If a company is growing and is paying a dividend -- like Coca-Cola for much of the last 30 years, Meta Platforms, or Microsoft -- holding on to those shares for as long as possible can help boost long-term returns.
Not everyone can have portfolios as big as those of Zuckerberg and Berkshire Hathaway. But the same principle can still help anyone build lasting wealth."

Other tech giants featured on the list included Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms, a contingent that’s spending tens of billions of dollars annually to develop large language models and AI chips to get a competitive edge in the AI arms race.
But the AIQ 50 wasn’t only dominated by the tech sector. In fact, there were 17 other sectors with representation, including financials, health care, retail, energy, and transportation.
This expansive embrace and quick adoption of generative AI differs from past technological advancements. The widespread adoption of the internet in the late 1990s caught many industries completely off guard, including physical retail and banking. More recently, the expensive and complex IT-led shift to cloud computing saw multiple sectors lag behind, including airlines, agricultural producers, and hospitals.
Kate Smaje, a senior partner at consulting giant McKinsey, says that unlike other digital transformation efforts, with AI there have been notable winners and losers within each sector, rather than entire industries falling behind on adoption.
AI, Smaje says, “it’s something that is innately democratized to everyone across the organization. It doesn’t matter whether you’re at the front line, you’re the HR director, or you’re the CEO. Your ability to use it and figure out ways to improve your lot, as it were, is a lot easier.”
Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, which ranked 36 on the AIQ 50 list, has applied AI and machine learning models across all parts of the company’s business, ranging from how it recruits patients to enroll in clinical trials to reimagining the supply chain and helping surgeons perform procedures.
Jim Swanson, J&J’s chief information officer, says that the company created a “lighthouse” framework to organize how it thinks about the value it can extract from AI across the business.
At the top of the lighthouse are use cases that apply to core products and services, including the use of AI to improve surgical outcomes. The middle layer focuses on utilizing AI to improve functions like customer support or patient enrollment in drug trials, while the lowest level involves employee productivity tools. In each case, Swanson says, he prioritizes investments that can generate big outcomes."

This is a huge reason why next-gen energy stock GE Vernova GEV soared 330% since its April 2024 IPO, crushing Nvidia and many other AI tech stocks on its way to becoming a $165 billion market cap next-gen energy powerhouse.
The AI future that the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Meta are betting on is impossible without spending hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars, expanding energy generation and the grid over the coming decades.
Wall Street views GE Vernova as one of the most surefire investments across the broader AI trade since it will thrive no matter which hyperscalers win the AI arms race.
GEV is also the opposite of speculative, especially compared to the likes of pure-play next-gen nuclear stock Oklo, which is a pre-revenue home-run bet.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
GE Vernova provides investors with a potent mix of huge upside potential, given its leading role in small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and stability.
The GE spinoff boasts that its customers generate approximately 25% of the world's electricity through its installed base of technologies across natural gas, hydro power, nuclear, wind, and beyond.
GE Vernova’s improving financial position helped it commit to stock buybacks and dividends. “We are at the beginning of an investment supercycle into more reliable baseload power, grid infrastructure and decarbonization solutions,” CEO Scott Strazik said following its strong Q2 results.
The AI energy stock is attempting to hold its ground at a key technical level to start the fourth quarter. GEV could break out in October and Q4 after trading sideways since the end of July. The nuclear energy stock also appears far less overheated than the likes of Oklo and others.
Are Energy and Nuclear Stocks the Best AI Investments?
This brief AI energy overview section helps investors quickly understand why they should consider buying GEV stock and other standouts across nuclear, natural gas, electrification, and energy infrastructure as long-term investments in AI.
Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT use 10X the energy of an average Google search, while large data centers consume as much electricity as a mid-sized city. AI growth, alongside reshoring and the energy transition, are expected to drive a 25% increase in U.S. electricity demand by 2030 and a 75% increase by 2050.
AI hyperscalers are projected to spend approximately $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone, with global data center infrastructure spending expected to reach $7 trillion by 2030."

Citizens kept its Market Outperform rating and $900 price target on Meta Platforms (META, Financials) on Monday. This was because the firm was still making progress with its artificial intelligence-based advertising platform. The company reported that some 2 million marketers are using Meta's AI-generated video and creative capabilities. This helps lower production costs and lets advertisers run more personalized campaigns. People pointed out that both Meta and Alphabet have said that creative considerations are responsible for around half of campaign performance. This shows how AI techniques could help ads do better. Meta's AI business assistant and messaging-based AI agents were called out as important growth drivers since they can make interactive interactions bigger on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. The article also said that Meta's Messaging Ads business makes roughly $10 billion a year and is likely to grow as AI features get better. The price goal was confirmed after the whole AI infrastructure sector made some big movements, like Google's $4 billion investment in a new data center in Arkansas and its plans to reorganize its Verily life sciences company. Analysts say that Meta's ongoing use of generative AI techniques is a key driver in keeping revenue growth going in a digital advertising market that is very competitive. Later this month, investors will look at Meta's third-quarter profits to see if AI-driven ad solutions are still bringing in money and getting people to use them."

The major indexes are trading in record territory. This might discourage investors who are looking to put some more money to work, as they might believe that they'd be better off waiting for a dip.
That might sound like a smart strategy, but in practice, time in the market usually beats trying to time the market. Moreover, there are always some reasonably priced opportunities -- and sometimes, they include some of the biggest and most dominant companies out there.
In my view, these two megacaps are the best stocks investors can buy with $1,000 right now.
Alphabet's playing a leading role in the AI revolution
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) is best known for Google Search, its crown jewel segment that raked in revenues of $54.2 billion in Q2 alone and that commands 90% of the search market. But the company is much more than that. In 2023, CEO Sundar Pichai said that six of Alphabet's products and services are used by 2 billion people each. That showcases its tremendous reach and adoption.
The monster success of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots gave the market reasons to be concerned about the future of Google Search's competitive position. But these worries now seem to have been overblown. Google Search posted an 11.8% year-over-year revenue gain last quarter, and management is boasting about the huge early success of its AI Mode feature.
Nvidia deservedly gets a large share of the attention in AI. But it's worth pointing out that Alphabet is also working on its own AI chips. Additionally, the business has a booming cloud platform that's generating rising profits. Demand is strong, with companies like PayPal, Wayfair, Target, and Mattel leveraging its AI tools.
Moreover, Alphabet's Gemini LLMs are being used to improve the user experience of all the products and services the company owns. Advertisers also benefit from AI. ""Over 2 million advertisers now use Google's AI-powered asset generation tools to run ads,"" said Philipp Schindler, chief business officer of Google.
This AI stock has soared by 228% in the past five years, and the company carries a market cap of $3 trillion. But its shares still trade at a compelling forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.1 -- a good deal for such an excellent company.
Meta is strengthening its network effects
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is another stock to add to the portfolio today. Its family of apps combined had 3.48 billion daily active users during the second quarter, a gargantuan figure. And that was up by 6% year over year.
These apps benefit from a powerful network effect. For Meta, the best outcome is not only growing the user base, but getting people to spend more time on these apps. That's where it's getting a lot out of AI, which it's using to personalize content recommendations. It's also giving users AI tools to find information or generate text and images.
""Advancements in our recommendation systems have improved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram just this quarter,"" founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the Q2 earnings call.
Meta generated 98% of its revenue in Q2 from advertising activities. Unsurprisingly, the business is focused on finding more ways to monetize all the engagement on its platform. Again, AI is coming into the picture, helping advertisers be more creative and effective, creating ads that are driving higher conversions.
During the Q1 earnings call, Zuckerberg said that should AI continue to improve ad capabilities, in the future, advertising will be a ""meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today. That view implies big revenue upside.
In the past five years, Meta's stock has risen by 171%. It sports a market cap of $1.8 trillion, and at a forward P/E ratio of 25.2, its valuation is reasonable. Taking advantage of that would be a smart move."

Despite mounting concerns over a government shutdown and fresh warnings of an AI ""bubble,"" strategists across Wall Street say there's still upside for US equities heading into year-end.
Ed Yardeni, veteran market watcher and president of Yardeni Research, raised his S&P 500 (^GSPC) target back to 7,000, describing the current rally as a ""slow-motion melt-up"" fueled by earnings resilience and further support from Fed rate cuts.
Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel echoed that view, keeping a base-case target of 7,750 for 2026 and assigning a 30% chance of a ""bubble scenario"" that could see the S&P 500 hit 9,000 by the end of next year, driven by accelerating capital markets and continued AI investment.
Signs of that exuberance are already emerging: On Monday, OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) announced a multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that gives the ChatGPT maker the right to acquire up to 10% of the chipmaker as part of what executives have described as ""the world’s most ambitious AI buildout.""
That wave of AI spending has prompted several high-profile voices to weigh in. Last week, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos described the current boom as a ""good kind of bubble"" that could spark massive investment and innovation, ultimately benefiting the broader economy.
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon offered a more cautious tone, warning that while tech and stimulus tailwinds could keep the economy accelerating into 2026, investors should not be surprised to see a drawdown in the next 12 to 24 months as some capital fails to generate returns.
The debate over whether markets are veering into bubble territory comes as valuations hover well above historical norms.
According to DataTrek Research, the S&P 500 is trading at about 25 times expected earnings for this year, a level the firm said ""reflects complete confidence (and then some)"" that profits will meet expectations. That implies earnings will climb 13% next year and another 10% in 2027.
That means ""higher valuations than historical norms are the key to further upside for the S&P 500,"" DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote. He added that ""solid earnings growth over the next 2–3 years [is] already baked into stock prices.""
In other words, much of this rally still rests on the shoulders of Big Tech."

However, researchers have suggested new ways to increase long-term memory of AI models, as they often can’t hold context over several sessions.
Nineteen-year-old founder Dhravya Shah is attempting to solve problems in this area by building a memory solution, called Supermemory, for AI apps.
Originally from Mumbai in India, Shah started building consumer-facing bots and apps a few years ago. He even sold his bot that formatted tweets into good-looking screenshots to the social media tool Hypefury.
The founder, who was preparing for an entrance exam to get into IIT (Indian Institute of Technology), earned good money from this sale and decided to move to the U.S. to attend Arizona State University instead.
After relocating, he challenged himself to build something new each week for 40 weeks. During one of those weeks, he built Supermemory (which was initially called Any Context) and put it on GitHub. At that time, the tool allowed you to chat with your Twitter bookmarks.
The current version of the tool extracts “memories” or insights from unstructured data and helps the applications understand the context better.
Shah secured an internship at Cloudflare in 2024, where he worked on AI and infrastructure. He later worked as a developer relations lead at the company. During this time, advisors, including Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht, asked him to turn Supermemory into a product.
This year, he decided to build Supermemory full-time.
Supermemory, now described as a universal memory API for AI apps, builds a knowledge graph based on the data it processes, and personalizes the context for the users. For instance, it can support querying across month-old entries for a writing or a journaling app, or searching for an email app. As the solution allows for multimodal inputs, it could also allow a video editor to fetch relevant assets from a library for a particular prompt.
The startup can ingest any type of data, the company says, including files, docs, chats, projects, emails, PDFs, and app data streams. Its chatbot and notetaker feature lets users add memories in text, add files or links, and connect to apps like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Notion. There’s also a Chrome extension that lets you easily add notes from a website.
“Our core strength is to extract insights from any kind of unstructured data and give the apps more context about users. As we work across multimodal data, our solution is suitable for all kinds of AI apps ranging from email clients to video editors,” Shah said."

It has benefited from high-profile deals.
The first was with Nvidia, in which the chip giant agreed to purchase CoreWeave's residual unsold capacity. Now, expanded deals with OpenAI and Meta Platforms have added further fuel for a CoreWeave stock surge.
However, CoreWeave has only traded on the market since March 28, meaning investors have not had much time to start buying. Are they too late, or can they still take advantage of this opportunity?
The CoreWeave value proposition
CoreWeave is a cloud infrastructure provider, but it stands out from Amazon's AWS and the Microsoft cloud platform Azure because of its added emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI).
CoreWeave designed its platform specifically to handle workloads pertaining to AI, machine learning, visual effects, and high-performance computing.
As previously mentioned, CoreWeave already has many of these companies as clients. Still, it further benefits because companies like Meta Platforms and Alphabet have allocated tens of billions of dollars in 2025 alone for AI-related capital projects.
Thus, in a sense, it should not be a surprise that Nvidia took an interest in CoreWeave's unsold capacity. Nor should it shock investors that OpenAI made an additional $6.5 billion in long-term agreements with the company. Additionally, CoreWeave concluded September with a $14 billion contract with Meta to provide additional cloud capacity.
Moreover, the growth before this was phenomenal. In the first half of 2025, CoreWeave generated $2.2 billion in revenue, a 275% increase from the same period one year ago. Admittedly, it will likely not sustain that growth rate in the long term, but since those numbers do not include the latest deals, investors can probably expect the rapid increases to continue.
Furthermore, the company raised guidance when it announced earnings in mid-August, before announcing the latest deals. For 2025, it forecast revenue of $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. That will rise 174% at the midpoint if that prediction holds.
Concerns about CoreWeave
Nonetheless, the financial picture appears less rosy below the top line. In the first half of 2025, cost and expense growth surged 350% higher, surpassing the rate of revenue growth and resulting in a modest operating loss.
Its spending also led to interest expenses spiking to $531 million during the period. Consequently, CoreWeave lost more than $605 million in the first two quarters of 2025, well above the $452 million loss in the same period one year ago.
Amid that loss, debt levels spiked considerably higher, leaving CoreWeave with almost $8.4 billion in debt, a tremendous burden for a company with less than $2.7 billion in book value.
Also, the company's $1.1 billion in liquidity will absorb around one year of losses at current rates. While it may attain access to some of the $560 million in restricted cash over time, continued losses may force it to issue additional shares or more debt in the near term.
Another effect of the losses is that they leave CoreWeave stock without a P/E ratio. Still, while its 16 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is not cheap, that level is not unusual for a tech growth stock. Considering the company's growth, it could persuade investors to overlook its financial challenges and continue bidding the stock higher.
Is it too late to buy CoreWeave stock?
Despite the size of the recent deals and the growth in the stock price, it is not too late to buy CoreWeave stock.
Indeed, amid massive revenue growth, CoreWeave is sustaining huge losses and burning tremendous amounts of cash. Such conditions make the cloud stock a riskier holding and could pressure its value in the long term, so this stock is probably not suitable for risk-averse investors.
However, CoreWeave's cloud servers play a pivotal role in the AI market, and its three huge deals in September confirm its value. Such conditions arguably make 16 times sales a reasonable price to pay for this stock, and shareholders who can handle the risk might benefit by buying CoreWeave shares at these levels."

This deal is an important step for Alberta as it aims to become a major data hub for the world’s top AI companies. A key part of this plan is using Alberta’s plentiful natural gas as a clean and reliable energy source to power these energy-hungry facilities.
Pembina Partners With Kineticor and Beacon AI to Power AI Infrastructure
In partnership with Calgary-based energy firm Kineticor, which specializes in power generation facilities, Pembina will supply natural gas-fired electricity to the Meta data center project. Beacon AI, another Calgary-based data center company, has reportedly played an integral role in the deal by providing crucial expertise in data center development. While contractual details remain under negotiation, regulatory announcements could emerge imminently, marking a significant milestone in Alberta’s AI infrastructure ambitions.
Alberta’s Industrial Heartland: The Epicenter of AI Data Center Development
Meta’s data center will be located in Alberta’s Industrial Heartland, a strategically vital cluster of oil refineries, petrochemical plants and clean technology operations near Fort Saskatchewan. This region not only boasts world-class industrial infrastructure but is also a hub for advanced carbon capture and storage (“CCS”) technologies, which can play a key role in mitigating the environmental impact of high-energy AI operations. The proximity of CCS facilities offers Meta and other tech giants the opportunity to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of their AI workloads.
Meeting the Immense Energy Demands of AI With Natural Gas Power
As hyperscale tech companies race to enhance AI capabilities, their data centers require vast quantities of electricity to train, deploy and maintain complex AI models. While some players, including Microsoft, have opted for nuclear power to minimize emissions, the limited availability and extended build times for nuclear infrastructure have led many to consider natural gas as a practical interim solution. Pembina and Kineticor’s collaboration embodies this approach by delivering scalable natural gas power optimized for the unique demands of AI data centers.
Greenlight Electricity Center: Modular Power Solutions for AI Expansion
Earlier this year, PBA, Calgary-based oil and gas storage and transportation company and Kineticor jointly announced the development of the Greenlight Electricity Center (“GLEC”) — a 1,800-megawatt natural gas power station within the Industrial Heartland. Designed for phased construction in 450-megawatt increments, GLEC is engineered with future-ready carbon capture capabilities to align with evolving sustainability standards. Scheduled for commercial operation by 2029, the facility is intended to either supply power directly to colocated data centers or bolster the broader Alberta grid, supporting multiple AI infrastructure projects across the province."

Multicoin Capital managing partner Tushar Jain has predicted that the GENIUS Act will trigger a competitive upheaval in retail banking, with major technology companies poised to challenge traditional banks by offering stablecoin products with superior yields and user experiences.
Jain argued that banks have long exploited retail depositors by paying minimal interest rates.
He foresaw that tech giants like Meta, Google, and Apple would soon leverage their massive distribution networks to offer stablecoins with better returns, instant settlement, 24/7 payments, and free transfers embedded directly into widely used apps and operating systems.
Banking Industry Fights Yield-Sharing as Deposit Flight Fears Mount
The banking sector has mounted an aggressive lobbying campaign to prevent stablecoin platforms from offering competitive yields to holders, despite the GENIUS Act’s prohibition applying only to issuers, not intermediaries.
Five major U.S. banking trade organizations have urged Congress to close perceived “loopholes” that allow crypto exchanges to offer stablecoin yields through affiliate programs and marketing arrangements, citing Treasury estimates of potential $6.6 trillion deposit outflows.
Citigroup analyst Ronit Ghose particularly warned that stablecoin interest payments could trigger 1980s-style deposit flight similar to when money market funds surged from $4 billion to $235 billion in seven years, draining traditional bank deposits.
During that period, withdrawals exceeded new deposits by $32 billion between 1981 and 1982 as consumers chased higher returns.
The American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute argued that joint marketing arrangements between issuers and exchanges could accelerate deposit flight during periods of financial stress.
However, the banking lobby’s position faces contradictions as major institutions simultaneously explore stablecoin opportunities.
Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser confirmed the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin” while developing tokenized deposit services for corporate clients.
JPMorgan also launched JPMD deposit tokens for institutional blockchain payments and served as lead underwriter for Circle’s IPO.
Jain dismissed banking concerns, noting that the prohibition on passing interest to stablecoin holders is “easily circumvented,” as evidenced by Coinbase’s yield-sharing with customers.
Stripe CEO Patrick Collison reinforced this view, arguing that depositors “are going to, and should, earn something closer to a market return on their capital.”
Given that average U.S. savings deposits yield just 0.40%, while $4 trillion in bank deposits earn 0% interest, Collison’s point is well-taken.
Stablecoin Market Consolidation Faces Disruption From New Entrants
The long-standing Tether-Circle duopoly, which controls 86% of the $298 billion stablecoin market, faces mounting pressure from new issuers offering yield-sharing arrangements and customizable reserve structures.
Venture capitalist Nic Carter argued that the dominance of the two major issuers has begun declining from its 91.6% peak in March 2024, driven by intermediaries rolling their own stablecoins to capture reserve yield rather than surrendering revenue to third parties.
White-label issuance platforms, including Bridge, Anchorage, Brale, M0, and Agora, have dramatically reduced fixed costs, enabling even seed-stage startups to launch their own stablecoins.
Exchanges and fintechs now face strong incentives to internalize yield rather than allowing Tether to earn approximately $35 million annually on every $500 million in deposits while the intermediary receives nothing.
Phantom wallet launched Phantom Cash, a Bridge-issued stablecoin with embedded earn and debit card functionalities.
Similarly, Hyperliquid’s public bidding process for its stablecoin attracted proposals from Native Markets, Paxos, Frax, Agora, Sky, Curve, and Ethena.
The platform currently hosts $5.5 billion in USDC, representing 7.8% of the total USDC supply, and aims to reduce its dependence on Circle while capturing reserve yield.
Ethena’s USDe has emerged as the biggest success story of 2025, surging to a $14.7 billion supply by passing along yield from crypto-based trades.
Other yield-focused stablecoins, including Ondo’s USDY, Maker’s SUSD, Paxos’ USDG, and Agora’s AUSD, have collectively accumulated more supply than during the prior bull market cycle.
Carter noted that cross-chain swaps have become significantly more efficient and cheaper, reducing network effects that previously benefited major issuers.
According to him, many fintechs and neobanks now display user balances in generic “dollars” or “dollar tokens” rather than USDC or USDT, guaranteeing redeemability in any stablecoin while managing reserves internally.
The Global Dollar consortium, launched by Paxos, includes Robinhood, Kraken, Anchorage, Galaxy, Bullish, and Nuvei, alongside over a dozen other partners.
Similarly, a report by Cryptonews suggests that JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo held early talks about creating their own stablecoin consortium.
Carter predicted that banks will join the stablecoin market as issuers, despite concerns about deposit flight, noting that even maintaining a 50- to 100-basis-point margin could generate meaningful revenue from trillions of deposits.

It's made up of:
- Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%)
- Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%)
- Apple (AAPL 0.54%)
- Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%)
- Amazon (AMZN -0.45%)
- Meta Platforms (META 1.20%)
- Tesla (TSLA 1.39%)
If you bought shares of these stocks five years ago, you're a happy investor. This group still makes up a huge chunk of the largest stocks in the market, with seven of the top eight largest stocks by market cap listed on U.S. exchanges belonging to this group. Of these seven, I think five are excellent buys now, although one could also sneak onto this list.
What are the five? Let's find out.
Apple and Tesla are on the outside looking in
Since there are more stocks that I think are buys than stocks to avoid, let's start with the two that I'm avoiding first.
Apple headlines this list as a stock I want no part of owning. While it has been a top performer over the past decade, a lot of that growth can be attributed to multiple expansion, which in this case occurred because investors were willing to pay more for the stock. Apple is one of the most expensive stocks in this group, despite having some of the slowest growth rates. (Note: Nvidia and Tesla were removed from this graph because they skew the growth and valuation figures)
As a result, the other stocks are far more attractive.
Tesla is also another one I'm not sure about. It's seeing some headwinds in its EV business, but it also has several promising technologies coming down the pipeline. I'm more neutral on Tesla than I am on Apple, but it just doesn't look like as good a buy as these other five right now.
The AI infrastructure buildout is a huge growth driver for the Magnificent Seven
The biggest trend around the other five is clearly artificial intelligence. A boatload of money is being spent on AI infrastructure right now, and many of these companies are reaping the benefits.
Nvidia is clearly the biggest beneficiary, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are being purchased in massive quantities by the AI hyperscalers to power workloads. There doesn't appear to be any signs of this trend slowing down, and Nvidia will continue to be an excellent stock to hold over the next few years as AI data centers continue to be built.
Next, Alphabet was once a concern for investors that generative AI competitors would eliminate it. However, Alphabet appears to have weathered the storm and has integrated generative AI into the Google Search engine. AI Search Overviews have become a popular feature, and are used by millions around the globe. This helped secure Alphabet's future, but it also has another promising segment that shares some overlap with Amazon and Microsoft.
Cloud computing is a monster market that has received a huge AI boost. Most companies don't have the resources to maintain a massive data center, so it makes more sense to rent the computing power necessary to run AI models from cloud providers like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure. These divisions are major growth and profit drivers for all three, although Amazon's business benefits the most, with 53% of Amazon's operating profits coming from AWS during Q2. Cloud computing is the primary reason to own Amazon and Microsoft stock, and the growth is far from over in this industry.
Lastly, there is Meta Platforms. Unlike the previous four, Meta doesn't have a division that's benefiting from all of this AI spending. Yet.
Meta is developing its AI models to boost its advertising prowess across its social media platforms. It has already seen some success, but there is still a lot of room for improvement here. Additionally, Meta is launching AI glasses that help bring AI into the real world. Time will tell if this endeavor is worth the massive amount of money Meta has poured into this division, but if it becomes a hit, it could launch a brand new revenue stream for Meta. Even without some of the benefits that AI could have on Meta's business, it's still posting incredible results, with its ad business delivering 22% year-over-year revenue growth during Q2 and projected to grow revenue at a 20% rate overall in Q3.
Meta is a strong investment option alongside most of its other peers in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" and I wouldn't be surprised to see this group outperform the S&P 500 moving forward."

These facilities are the backbone of the AI revolution, enabling the training and deployment of increasingly complex models.
But with this progress comes a challenge that few anticipated: AI requires staggering amounts of electricity, placing unprecedented strain on existing power grids. As a result, many investors are beginning to view energy stocks as adjacent beneficiaries of the AI revolution.
Among different sources of power, nuclear energy has gained particular attention, given its ability to thread a tough needle: providing consistent baseload power while maintaining a low-carbon footprint.
One nuclear energy stock that has gone parabolic over the last year is Oklo (OKLO -1.34%). Let's explore how Oklo is positioning itself as a disruptor in the AI energy landscape and analyze how much an investment of just $1,000 in the stock a year ago would be worth today.
How did Oklo go public?
Oklo's path to the public markets was anything but conventional. Rather than pursuing a traditional initial public offering (IPO), the company merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) cofounded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The deal was symbolic, as Altman's involvement instantly linked Oklo to the booming AI narrative.
Breaking down Oklo's notable partnerships
Oklo has gained significant attention for its small modular reactor (SMR) technology. Some of the company's most notable partnerships include:
- Department of Energy (DOE) fuel supply chain: Oklo was selected to help build three advanced fuel-fabrication facilities, a critical step in advancing and bolstering the DOE's domestic nuclear fuel ambitions.
- Liberty Energy alliance: Oklo and Liberty Energy formed a strategic partnership to provide turnkey power solutions for data centers, industrial operations, and utilities -- fusing natural gas and nuclear power across energy supply chains.
- Vertiv collaboration: Oklo partnered with Vertiv to design integrated power and cooling systems tailored for hyperscale and colocation data centers.
This growing network of federal projects and private sector alliances gives Oklo an enviable degree of credibility. More importantly, these deals underscore that Oklo is not simply building nuclear hardware -- it is actively embedding itself into the energy infrastructure of today's AI-driven industries.
Is Oklo stock still a buy?
If you had invested $1,000 in Oklo stock at the time of its SPAC merger on May 9, 2024, that stake would be worth roughly $6,200 today. Generating a sixfold return in just over a year is abnormally high by any standard. This raises a critical question: What's really driving Oklo's momentum?
While these partnerships are impressive, investors should recognize that none of them have yet translated into tangible sales. In other words, Oklo remains a pre-revenue, cash-burning company in a capital-intensive industry that's historically been burdened with lengthy construction timelines and heavy regulatory scrutiny.
In truth, much of Oklo's rally is driven by narrative. The company is increasingly taking on characteristics of a meme stock, boosted by optimism from enthusiastic -- and likely out-of-touch -- retail investors.
At today's levels, investors would be buying into Oklo at a $16 billion valuation. For context, this implies a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 1,100 based on 2027 revenue estimates. This far exceeds the peak of valuation multiples witnessed during the dot-com and COVID pandemic-era stock market bubbles.
All told, Oklo is an intriguing case study in how hype and megatrends can blur the lines between reality and hope -- fueling prolonged outsized gains in the process. But as an investment, it remains highly speculative. Until Oklo demonstrates meaningful revenue and operational progress, smart investors should monitor from the sidelines rather than buying in at these inflated levels."
finnhub,META,2025-10-06T08:43:00,The Single Best Stock to Buy for the AI Revolution? This Company Might Be It,"This company could be aptly described as ""the Swiss Army Knife of AI.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7e7dc57f94321d816990324651d90364356a568a6c55f70c6e219593ad4c7612,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/the-single-best-stock-to-buy-for-the-ai-revolution/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/the-single-best-stock-to-buy-for-the-ai-revolution/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/the-single-best-stock-to-buy-for-the-ai-revolution/,fool.com,200,,"It's hard to narrow down the best of any category to only one favorite. That's true whether we're talking about the greatest football player of all time, the best actor, or the top musical artist.
Choosing the most outstanding artificial intelligence (AI) stock is difficult, too. What is the single best stock to buy for the AI revolution?
Multiple worthy contenders
Answering that question isn't easy because there are multiple worthy contenders. Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) absolutely makes the list. It's the largest company in the world based on market cap. Nvidia's GPUs remain the gold standard for training and deploying AI systems. The company's technology is also used in AI-powered robots and self-driving vehicles.
I like Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), too. Its Azure is the second-largest cloud platform. The company has embedded generative AI into its software products that are used by millions of people across the world. Microsoft also arguably represents the best way to invest in ChatGPT developer and AI pioneer OpenAI, which doesn't trade publicly at this point. The two companies are close partners, and Microsoft has invested in OpenAI.
If you're thinking about the next frontiers for AI, Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) especially stands out. The Facebook and Instagram parent is going all-in on developing artificial superintelligence (ASI). Meta also leads the fast-growing AI glasses market.
Ark Invest's Cathy Wood and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives think that Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) is the best AI stock. Tesla ranks as the largest holding in Wood's Ark Invest portfolio. Ives views Tesla as the most undervalued AI stock on the market. Tesla is best known for its electric vehicles (which feature AI self-driving technology), but CEO Elon Musk predicts that its Optimus humanoid robots will be the company's greatest growth driver in the future.
Checking off all the AI boxes
I think solid cases can be made for Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla as the single best AI stock to buy. However, my vote goes to another AI leader -- Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%). This company checks off all the AI boxes, in my view.
Alphabet's Google Cloud is the fastest-growing major cloud provider. The unit uses Nvidia's GPUs, but has also developed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that can be more cost-effective in specific machine learning operations.
Like Microsoft, Alphabet has integrated generative AI into many of its products, including Google Search and Google Workspace productivity software. Its Google Gemini large language model (LLM) competes against OpenAI's GPT-5. Google's research into transformers (the ""T"" in GPT) paved the way for today's LLMs, by the way.
Google DeepMind is actively working on artificial general intelligence (AGI), a critical stepping stone to ASI. Google Glasses were a predecessor to Meta's AI glasses. Google teamed up with Warby Parker to develop smart glasses using the extended-reality operating system Android XR that will compete against Meta's devices.
Alphabet's Waymo unit has a solid head start on Tesla in the autonomous ride-hailing market. Google DeepMind is developing humanoid robots that use the Gemini 2.0 AI model. And, with apologies to Wedbush's Ives, Alphabet's stock appears to be more attractively valued than Tesla on every commonly used metric.
Is Alphabet the single best stock to buy for the AI revolution?
Are there risks for Alphabet? Absolutely. Rivals are hoping to chip away at Google Search's market share. Some industry observers have even predicted that generative AI presents an existential threat to Google Search. Alphabet's dominance in multiple arenas makes it a big target for regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe.
However, Google's integration of generative AI into its search engine appears to be paying off so far. The regulatory threat against Alphabet also doesn't seem nearly as concerning after a federal judge didn't impose the worst-case penalties against the company in a recent decision in an antitrust case.
Multiple stocks will be big winners in the AI revolution, probably including all of the ones discussed earlier. However, if I had to pick the single best AI stock to buy, it would be Alphabet."

Such market-moving sway, usually reserved for behemoths like Apple Inc. or Nvidia Corp., is the latest sign of OpenAI’s rising influence on a wide variety of stocks even though there’s little indication the startup, which was recently valued at $500 billion, plans to list its shares anytime soon. That’s made OpenAI’s announcements and events — like the developer conference it’s holding on Monday — critical for traders.
“Software and internet investors are keenly focused on where OpenAI will go next and how disruptive it could be,” said UBS (UBS) analyst Karl Keirstead. As OpenAI continues to expand, he said, “the consensus view is that it will have to diversify more aggressively beyond ChatGPT subscriptions.”
Investors will be looking for clues about those plans at OpenAI’s third annual DevDay, which kicks off at 10 a.m. in San Francisco. The event could drive another round of stock moves with potential gains for partners or infrastructure providers and declines for companies in businesses the artificial intelligence giant is pushing into.
The Sam Altman-led company is likely to unveil more consumer AI agents that could include a “more robust travel booking agent,” Keirstead wrote in a research note on Oct. 1. OpenAI could also unveil an AI browser, the analyst said.
“Even though we can’t play OpenAI directly, this could be an important event, since any information we learn about its plans or products will help investors assess the landscape,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, which has about $10.5 billion in assets. “Maybe we learn that companies seen as being at risk aren’t as threatened as we think, or maybe we get insight into the next big AI play.”
Of course, OpenAI has been a factor for market pros ever since ChatGPT ignited a mania for AI in late 2022. The subsequent race to beef up computing power has fueled the rise in stocks of chipmakers like Nvidia and cloud-computing providers like Oracle Corp. (ORCL) Yet while fears about AI’s disruptive potential have long been present, they’ve mostly been theoretical. That’s starting to change."

“Picks and shovels” are a perfect metaphor for what is happening today in artificial intelligence, the modern-day gold rush. Companies like Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) are spending $100s of billions of dollars to vie for AI supremacy. Though it is tough for investors to predict who will ultimately win the AI race, AI infrastructure providers like Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Astera Labs (ALAB) provide the most sure-fire investments as they provide the picks and shovels needed to train large language models (LLMs).
What Does Astera Labs Do?
Astera Labs manufactures high-powered semiconductors and software designed for use in data centers and artificial intelligence applications. Today, AI data centers are filled with large clusters of Nvidia (NVDA) GPUs that must transmit gargantuan amounts of data quickly and reliably. However, the massive quantity of data transmission can lead to bottlenecks. Astera Labs creates specialized solutions to help alleviate these bottlenecks, allowing AI data centers to run seamlessly.
ALAB Boasts Strong Partnerships with AI Leaders
Although a plethora of companies seek to capitalize on the AI revolution, only a select few are responsible for the foundational data infrastructure. These companies include Nvidia, Intel (INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Before going public in March, ALAB disclosed that the company has “trusted relationships” with these industry juggernauts.
ALAB: Explosive Top & Bottom-Line Growth
As the AI buildout snowballs and becomes more competitive, Wall Street analysts expect Astera Labs to benefit. Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates predict that ALAB will grow top-and-bottom line growth at a double-digit pace through 2026.

ALAB shares have more than doubled in value since July, amid the AI hype. Last week, ALAB retreated to its 50-day moving average for the first time since the meteoric move. The first tag of the 50-day moving average in a leading stock typically offers investors a favorable buy point."
finnhub,META,2025-10-06T07:45:00,AI Spending Could Soar to $4 Trillion: 2 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Now (Hint: Neither Is Nvidia),These companies are offering two things greatly needed by AI customers right now.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a32b4f18807daff149da9637e2189d0a4af76ad5a56131a83920a6cc71d92638,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/ai-spending-could-soar-to-4-trillion-2-no-brainer/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/ai-spending-could-soar-to-4-trillion-2-no-brainer/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/ai-spending-could-soar-to-4-trillion-2-no-brainer/,fool.com,200,,"Jensen Huang, the chief executive officer of Nvidia, recently made a prediction. He said that he expects artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending to soar to as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade. As leader of the world's No. 1 chip designer and someone who maintains close communication with customers, Huang has a clear idea of what's to come in this high-growth market. So, when he speaks, investors sit up and take notice.
Trends we've seen in recent times support Huang's prediction. Companies from Meta Platforms to Alphabet have increased capital spending plans to boost this AI buildout. And chip designers as well as cloud service providers have reported increasing demand and revenue quarter after quarter.
Though prices of these stocks have climbed, the good news is that it's not too late to add to your positions in certain players or open a new position. This infrastructure buildout suggests the momentum will keep going. Now, let's check out two no-brainer stocks to buy right now, and I may surprise you when I say I won't be talking about Nvidia. Though Nvidia is a clear AI star, the following two companies may be among the biggest winners as the general need for AI capacity soars.
1. Nebius Group
Nebius Group (NBIS -1.81%) offers the capacity customers so desperately need, and it's resulted in explosive revenue growth in recent times. In the latest quarter, revenue surged 625% year over year to about $105 million, and the company's AI cloud business even reached positive adjusted EBITDA ahead of its expectations.
Customers come to Nebius for access to high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs), or the AI chips necessary for key AI tasks like the training of models or inferencing -- the ""thinking"" process that helps the model solve complex problems.
So, customers don't have to buy their own GPUs, and instead can rent this compute from the cloud services provider. This can save them both time and money. Meanwhile, customers also can opt for Nebius' managed services -- for example, MLflow for the handling of the machine-learning lifecycle. All of this makes Nebius a company that could see tremendous demand as this AI infrastructure spending phase advances.
To ensure its ability to serve demand, Nebius is ramping up and aims to add 1 gigawatt of power by the end of next year. (That's the equivalent of 100 million LED bulbs.)
The stock has soared more than 300% this year but still could have room to run as this phase of the AI boom unfolds.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 3.22%) may benefit even more than chip giant Nvidia from the infrastructure buildout. That's because this player manufactures Nvidia's chips as well as the chips of other market giants, such as Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom.
This means that as demand for all of those products grows, TSMC, as the world's biggest foundry, could see revenue explode higher. Since it doesn't depend on the fortunes of just one chip designer, this stock makes a great bet for investors concerned about which player will dominate in the coming years. As long as demand for AI chips continues, and there's reason to be optimistic about that, TSMC's future is bright.
TSMC also has made wise moves in recent times that should support its work in the U.S. market -- the biggest AI market globally -- and may shield it and its customers from the impact of import tariffs. The company has made enormous investments in U.S. manufacturing, and earlier this year said it would expand its investment to $165 billion to fund three new fabrication facilities, a research and development site, and two advanced packaging factories.
This chip giant in the recent quarter reported a 38% increase in revenue and said current trends suggest sustained strength in AI demand moving forward. Considering all of this, TSMC, trading at 29 times forward earnings estimates, is very reasonably priced and looks like a no-brainer buy as AI infrastructure spending heats up."

It’s such a fixture on the social media landscape that it’s hard to remember a time when we didn’t have constant visual updates of how much richer, prettier and healthier everyone else seems to be. Over the past 15 years, checking Instagram has become part of the everyday habits of around 33 million people in the UK, but it comes at a real cost.
A huge part of the Instagram engine is as a shop front for businesses. In fact, there are more than 25 million businesses on the platform. Nine out of 10 users follow at least one of them, so in the vast majority of cases we’re actively choosing to spend our time scrolling through adverts, or promotions.
Unsurprisingly, it means we can be tempted into buying things we otherwise wouldn’t.
One in 20 social media users in the UK say they shop through Instagram, according to Hargreaves Lansdown. Fashion dominates and 47% of social shoppers have bought clothes, while 37% have bought beauty products and 17% wellness or fitness products. Those browsing inspirational homes are also keen to buy what they see, with 26% buying home décor and furniture.

But this is just the tip of the iceberg. There’s also a whole host of things we buy elsewhere because we’re being influenced by Instagram and want to follow a viral trend.
It seeps into every area of our lives. It makes people seek out the latest fashions, but also inspires them to travel to beautiful places, try the food everyone else is posting about, and take the coveted Instagram photos to post on their own profiles.
Instagram-inspired shopping is most common among Gen Z, followed by millennials. Some 55% of users in this age group say their fashion purchases are driven by the social media platform.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with any of this, as long as it fits into your budget.
The risk is that people are overstretching themselves because they’re so keen to have an insta-ready life. For those in the expensive stages of life – such as first-time buyers or new parents and those just starting out – money can be tight, so overspending is a real risk.
They may end up borrowing more than they can afford to buy these things. In some cases, they’ll build up buy-now-pay-later debts to the point where it impacts their ability to cover the cost of the essentials.

Its Family of Apps averaged 3.4 billion daily active users in March 2025, highlighting the unrivalled scale that underpins its advertising franchise. The company’s AI powered ad-delivery tools are driving higher pricing and better campaign performance, while new initiatives—such as the rollout of ads in WhatsApp—have the potential to unlock fresh revenue streams and are supported by a cash-rich balance-sheet that now includes a quarterly dividend. Shares rose during the quarter after fiscal first-quarter results came in better-than-expected due to strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Additionally, management guided fiscal second-quarter revenue above consensus and trimmed full-year expense guidance even as it lifted capital-expenditure plans to accelerate AI-infrastructure build-out.”

finnhub,META,2025-10-05T09:15:00,Is CoreWeave a Better Investment Than Nvidia?,CoreWeave announced several massive deals over the past few weeks.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=86e2127051f9bb14baf2da40d94370fb8a5a442537cb89a0c1866b7efb35abe3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/is-coreweave-a-better-investment-than-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/is-coreweave-a-better-investment-than-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/is-coreweave-a-better-investment-than-nvidia/,fool.com,200,,"CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) is making some big moves. Recently, it signed a deal to rent out $14 billion of its computing capacity to Meta Platforms (META 1.20%). It also expanded its agreement with OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, by $6.5 billion. These monster deals are pushing the stock higher, and CoreWeave's stock is up almost 34% since September started.
CoreWeave's business goal is to become the artificial intelligence (AI) cloud king. To do that, it will need to buy a lot more computing capacity, including chipsets from Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). That leads to the question: Is it better to buy CoreWeave stock, or are you better off owning Nvidia? Let's take a look.
CoreWeave's servers are filled with Nvidia GPUs
As mentioned above, CoreWeave's goal is to become the go-to cloud computing platform for artificial intelligence computing. This is an attractive business model for CoreWeave and clients alike. While most clients are building out their own computing infrastructure, having some flexibility to run workloads on CoreWeave's servers when demand is higher or not needing to build out AI computing capacity all at once is a smart move. On CoreWeave's side, the business model is fairly simple: Rent out the computing power for more than it costs to replace and operate the equipment.
For Nvidia, its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most flexible computing units available and are a top option for AI companies to run workloads on. However, custom AI chips are starting to increase the competition that Nvidia has to deal with, but it's still the most commonly used computing unit due to its flexibility. Nvidia sells its GPUs to cloud providers like CoreWeave or its competitors because they have no idea what type of workload their computing units will see. AI hyperscalers can purchase their own custom AI chips because they know what workload will be run across them. This is a key distinction for Nvidia, so it's crucial for its success that CoreWeave and other cloud competitors continue buying up Nvidia's GPUs to meet capacity.
In a way, both companies are critical for each other's success, but there's one option that stands out as a much better pick.
CoreWeave isn't profitable during a once-in-a-lifetime boom
CoreWeave is growing at a rapid rate as demand for AI computing capacity explodes. During its most recent quarter, CoreWeave's revenue rose 207% year over year to $1.2 billion. Considering CoreWeave signed a $14 billion agreement through the end of 2031 with Meta and the total value of the OpenAI contract (which runs through 2029) is now $22.4 billion, there's a massive backlog for CoreWeave to churn through.
However, what remains unclear is what will happen after those contracts expire. Both Meta and OpenAI are building out internal computing capacity to meet AI demand. If they build out enough to satisfy capacity, using CoreWeave as a third-party cloud provider may be unnecessary. This would cause CoreWeave to lose substantial business.
For Nvidia, a complete AI computing capacity buildout may sound scary, but it really isn't. GPUs utilized for AI computing are run incredibly hard and can have lifespans of one to three years. This means that current computing capacity must be replaced every couple of years, which will allow Nvidia to maintain a strong revenue base. CoreWeave has no similar guarantee, and I think that's a key point investors must understand.
Furthermore, right now is about as good as it's going to get for CoreWeave. Demand for AI computing capacity is high, and although it's still growing, it's hard to imagine this growth lasting over the long term, say five to 10 years out. The current problem is that CoreWeave isn't profitable. It posted a net loss margin of 24% during Q2. CoreWeave losing money during arguably its best time to be making profits is a huge red flag, and it makes sense why companies like Meta and OpenAI are renting computing capacity from them; they can likely rent it from CoreWeave for cheaper than they can build it. If CoreWeave increases prices to become profitable, this may no longer be the case. At that point, customers will likely build their own.
This makes the future precarious for CoreWeave, and I'd much rather own Nvidia stock than CoreWeave as a result."

Based on the forecasts above, Meta Platforms is the best trillion-dollar AI stock to buy now, though Microsoft and Amazon are close behind. Read on to learn more about the social media company and its pursuit of superintelligence.
Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve its advertising business
Meta Platforms owns three of the four most popular social media networks, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as measured by monthly active users. That those platforms attract 3.4 billion people daily makes Meta a key advertising partner for countless brands. And investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are only strengthening the value proposition.
Meta is using AI to create more engaging experiences across its social media. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says, ""AI is significantly improving our ability to show people content that they're going to find interesting and useful."" Users spent 5% more time on Facebook and 6% more time on Instagram during the second quarter due to improvements in the underlying recommendation engines.
Meanwhile, Meta made improvements to Andromeda (a machine learning system that powers ad retrieval) and applied the model to Facebook Reels, which increased conversion rates by 4%. Also, the company made improvements to GEM (a machine learning system that ranks and personalizes ads) that raised conversion rates by 3% on Facebook and 5% on Instagram.
Here's the big picture: Adtech spending is projected to grow at 14% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Meta Platforms, the second-largest adtech company, is well positioned to benefit from AI product development. Indeed, Malik Ahmed Khan at Morningstar writes, ""Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share.""
Meta Platforms sees a tremendous opportunity in smart glasses and superintelligence
Meta has established a business unit called Superintelligence Labs, which is focused on model development and product initiatives. The company has invested heavily to build data center infrastructure, with capital expenditures topping $100 billion in the last two years, and is actively recruiting top talent in the field.
The ultimate goal is to develop and monetize superintelligence, which means an AI system that is not only fundamentally smarter than people but also has the capacity to improve itself by learning without human intervention. There are several ways Meta could monetize such a system, but the company is particularly focused on smart glasses.
""Personal devices likes glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices,"" Zuckerberg wrote in July. ""Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful.""
Importantly, Meta is already the dominant player in the smart glasses market, and its lead is widening. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025, up from 66% in the second half of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Investors have good reason to think that trend will continue.
Meta recently introduced its first pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses called Ray-Ban Meta Display, which overlay the real world with a holographic color display on the right lens. The glasses are controlled by a wrist-worn device that tracks finger movements. It integrates with the conversational assistant Meta AI, but future models could integrate with a superintelligence system.
Smart glasses could become a substantial revenue stream for Meta. The augmented reality market is forecast to increase at 38% annually to reach $600 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.
Meta Platforms stock trades at a reasonable valuation
Wall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17.3% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate is reasonable given that adtech spending is forecast to increase at 14% annually through 2030. But it also leaves room for upside if smart glasses or another superintelligence form factor becomes a material source of revenue.
Regardless, the present valuation of 25.9 times earnings is reasonable even if the forward earnings estimate is spot-on. Those numbers give a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.5. In that context, Meta is actually tied with Nvidia as the cheapest trillion-dollar stock. So, patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position today."
finnhub,META,2025-10-05T07:40:00,Should You Buy CoreWeave Stock After the $14 Billion Meta Deal?,A recent 8-K filing revealed CoreWeave signed a $14.2 billion cloud deal with Meta Platforms.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9fc9a5e3d82caacd54535690dec4841f3fa38a0f640cc9e53380bc946ba2b1ac,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/should-you-buy-coreweave-stock-after-the-14-billio/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/should-you-buy-coreweave-stock-after-the-14-billio/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/should-you-buy-coreweave-stock-after-the-14-billio/,fool.com,200,,"Since debuting on the public markets earlier this year, CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) has swiftly established itself as a central character in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure narrative.
Its latest milestone -- securing a six-year, $14.2 billion deal with Meta Platforms -- has further cemented its position and raised an important question for investors: Does CoreWeave merit a position in your portfolio right now?
What does CoreWeave do, and why is it important for AI infrastructure?
Unlike traditional hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, CoreWeave belongs to the emerging category of neoclouds -- a new class of cloud providers designed to excel at one function above all else: delivering GPU compute power at scale. Instead of offering a broad suite of enterprise services, neoclouds specialize in rapid chip provisioning, building dense GPU clusters, and offering flexible pricing tailored to the needs of AI developers.
This business model matters because the foundational layer of AI infrastructure is shifting. The competitive edge now lies less in general-purpose compute and more in securing the right partners to deliver accelerated hardware at scale -- removing supply chain bottlenecks in the process.
Simply put, companies pushing the frontiers of training large language models (LLMs), powering agentic AI systems, and running increasingly complex inference workloads require uninterrupted access to compute -- downtime or resource constraints are not an option.
By making Nvidia GPUs available on demand through its cloud-based platform, CoreWeave directly addresses this pain point. Its ability to provide scale quickly and reliably has made the company an attractive solution for businesses demanding additional AI capacity beyond their own data centers.
Who does CoreWeave compete with?
CoreWeave is not the only company capitalizing on the neocloud opportunity. Nebius Group recently secured a $17 billion deal with Microsoft, while Oracle signed a staggering $300 billion arrangement with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Even Iren, which was once focused on Bitcoin mining, is beginning to repurpose its power infrastructure to host Nvidia accelerators -- a move that highlights the economic convergence between energy and compute.
Despite their differences, these players are stitched together through a common strategy: Lock in long-dated, high-value contracts with leading AI companies; use those agreements to finance massive data center buildouts; and scale rapidly to keep pace with secular demand trends.
For customers, these partnerships mitigate the risk of GPU shortages and help stabilize pricing mechanics. For providers, they offer visibility into revenue and cash flow growth in a market evolving at unprecedented speed.
Is CoreWeave stock a buy right now?
Interestingly, CoreWeave's blockbuster contract with Meta comes on the heels of another multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI. Together, these wins give the company an enviable backlog. Nevertheless, investors should weigh the full picture before pouring into the stock purely based on headline figures.
On the bullish side of the equation, CoreWeave has secured long-term demand at a time when GPU supply remains severely constrained and heavily concentrated among a handful of big spenders. These contracts provide scale, enhance credibility, and create more predictable revenue streams that could support margin expansion.
That said, the risks are equally pronounced. Neoclouds are inherently capital-intensive, often relying on vendor financing and circular structures where a company like Nvidia serves as both a hardware supplier and financial backer. This dynamic introduces a complicated layer of fragility should demand begin to slow, liquidity tightens, or existing customers migrate toward alternative chips (including their own custom silicon).
Given these factors, I see CoreWeave less as a reliable long-term compounder and more like a momentum stock riding the wave of AI-driven tailwinds. For aggressive growth investors seeking direct exposure to the GPU boom, CoreWeave could be a compelling opportunity on pullbacks. But for more conservative investors, the established hyperscalers still offer greater diversification and the safety of blue chip branding."

His wealth, too, has continued to accrue. According to Forbes’ real-time billionaire’s list, Ellison is the second-richest man on Earth, pegged at a net worth of $349.5 billion as of Oct. 2. That ranking places him just below Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a notch above Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
But how, exactly, did Ellison accumulate such massive wealth?
Early Beginnings: Ellison as a Software Self-Starter
Described as a “classic rags-to-riches story” by CEO Today, Ellison was raised in Chicago by his aunt and uncle, and is noted as a two-time college dropout, first exiting the University of Illinois followed by the University of Chicago.
Nonetheless, he displayed a natural aptitude for programming and the attendant problem-solving and logic that accompanies the practice, and soon he joined up with tech companies such as Ampex and Amdahl.
While working for Ampex, Ellison ended up working on a project for the CIA (codenamed “Oracle”), which would end up being fuel for his own entrepreneurial fire.
In 1977, Ellison co-founded Software Development Laboratories, which would later assume the moniker of Oracle Corporation. Oracle would go on to be the brand behind some of the world’s most popular enterprise software offerings — notably, Oracle Database — and the rest is history.

Oracle Stock and Other Investments
While it’s undeniable that the vast bulk of Ellison’s wealth (and the growth thereof) is attributable to his holdings in Oracle — he holds about a 40% stake in the company, per Forbes — he also has investments in Tesla, real estate and other ventures.
Regarding the bulk of his investments, in Oracle, the company’s earnings results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2026 showed revenue growth of 12%. Plus, its share price has skyrocketed by more than 74% for the year as of Oct. 2. As a result, Ellison’s holdings have blossomed over time.
The lesson: Being a self-starter willing to teach yourself in-demand skill sets and leverage these into business pursuits could pay off big. While you may not make billions, it’s certainly a good place to begin if you’re looking to pursue long-term wealth-building."

Tech firms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on advanced chips and data centers, not just to keep pace with a surge in the use of chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude, but to make sure they’re ready to handle a more fundamental and disruptive shift of economic activity from humans to machines. The final bill may run into the trillions. The financing is coming from venture capital, debt and, lately, some more unconventional arrangements that have raised eyebrows on Wall Street.

Even some of AI’s biggest cheerleaders acknowledge the market is frothy, while still professing their belief in the technology’s long-term potential. AI, they say, is poised to reshape multiple industries, cure diseases and generally accelerate human progress.
Yet never before has so much money been spent so rapidly on a technology that, for all its potential, remains somewhat unproven as a profit-making business model. Tech industry executives who privately doubt the most effusive assessments of AI’s revolutionary potential — or at least struggle to see how to monetize it — may feel they have little choice but to keep pace with their rivals’ investments or risk being out-scaled and sidelined in the future AI marketplace.
What are the warning signs for AI?
When Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure plan known as Stargate alongside other executives at the White House in January, the price tag triggered some disbelief. Since then, other tech rivals have ramped up spending, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who has pledged to invest hundreds of billions in data centers. Not to be outdone, Altman has since said he expects OpenAI to spend “trillions” on AI infrastructure.
To finance those projects, OpenAI is entering into new territory. In September, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. announced an agreement to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s data center buildout, a deal that some analysts say raises questions about whether the chipmaker is trying to prop up its customers so that they keep spending on its own products."
finnhub,META,2025-10-04T12:10:00,3 Tech Stocks Perfect for Gen Xers to Add to Their Portfolios,"Meta, ASML, and CrowdStrike are all worth holding for at least the next decade.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5537434b100907f65a6a23e542eb7c8e6325d150d3725fe5cbbf8b72a59c0e02,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-tech-stocks-perfect-for-gen-xers-to-add/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-tech-stocks-perfect-for-gen-xers-to-add/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/04/3-tech-stocks-perfect-for-gen-xers-to-add/,fool.com,200,,"The stock market is often considered the world's greatest wealth creator, but some recent data compiled by The Motley Fool reveals that many Americans are still missing out on those life-changing gains. According to a recent Gallup poll, only 62% of American adults owned stocks. The Federal Reserve also found that baby boomers held 54% of all shares in the U.S., while Gen Xers and Millennials only held 21.9% and 8.5%, respectively.
Those lopsided percentages could be bad news for the Gen Xers, who are already 45 to 60 years old. But if you're a Gen Xer who has at least a decade left before retirement, you might want to invest in a few high-growth tech companies that have wide moats, robust growth rates, and clear plans for the future.
So today, let's take a look at three stocks which I (as a 45-year-old Gen Xer) either personally own or would be comfortable buying in this frothy market: Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), ASML (ASML 2.69%), and CrowdStrike (CRWD -0.03%).
1. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, is the world's top social media company with 3.48 billion monthly active users across all its apps. It generates most of its revenue by crafting targeted ads for those users, and it shares a near-duopoly in digital ads with Alphabet's Google.
Meta has been upgrading its own AI algorithms to craft better targeted ads from its own first-party data to reduce its dependence on third-party data. It's been expanding Reels to keep up with TikTok in the short video space, and it's been subsidizing the expansion of its unprofitable Reality Labs segment (which develops its loss-leading virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) products) with its higher-margin advertising revenue.
From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 16% and 13%, respectively. That growth should be driven by the ongoing expansion of its user base, the increased efficiency of its AI-powered ads, and the gradual growth of its AR and VR businesses. Its stock also looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings -- so it could still have plenty of room to run over the next few years.
2. ASML
ASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. All of the world's largest chip foundries -- including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel -- use its systems to manufacture their chips. ASML is also the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems, which are required to produce the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.
ASML's monopolization of that crucial technology makes it a bellwether of the semiconductor industry and gives it nearly unlimited pricing power. Its latest ""high-NA"" EUV systems, which cost about $400 million and require multiple planes to ship, will allow those foundries to manufacture even smaller chips beyond the 2nm node (which currently covers the world's densest chips) over the next few years.
From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect ASML's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 10% and 17%, respectively. That growth should be supported by the rollout of its high-NA EUV systems, its consistent sales of its ""low-NA"" EUV systems, as well as the stable sales of its older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems for more mature nodes. Its stock might seem a bit pricey at 33 times next year's earnings, but its dominance of the lithography market justifies that higher multiple.
3. CrowdStrike
CrowdStrike is one of the world's largest cybersecurity companies. But unlike many of its peers, which install on-site appliances to run their services, CrowdStrike only provides its Falcon endpoint security platform as a cloud-based service. That approach is easier to scale, doesn't require on-site maintenance, and locks its clients into its sticky subscriptions.
CrowdStrike already serves 300 of the Fortune 500 companies, so its disruptive strategy is clearly impressing a lot of big customers. It initially gives each customer access to four cloud-based modules, which serve as a foundation to cross-sell additional modules to increase the stickiness of its ecosystem and boost its revenues per customer. In its latest quarter, some 48% of its customers were using at least six of those cloud-based modules.
From fiscal 2025 (which ended this January) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to grow at a CAGR of 22% and 28%, respectively. They also expect it to turn profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in fiscal 2027 and more than double its net income in fiscal 2028. Its stock might not seem like a bargain at 70 times next year's adjusted EBITDA right now, but it should continue to thrive through economic downturns because companies generally won't lower their digital defenses just to save a few dollars."

While that may be odd to say, the reality is that a new investing year is almost upon us. However, there are still plenty of stocks that are worth buying now, especially to capture an end-of-year rally that may occur as institutional investors reposition their portfolios to capture gains where they think the market will be heading in 2026.
Three stocks that I think are must-owns heading into 2026 are Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.45%). All of these could see significant investor interest over the next year as the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race intensifies, making them excellent stocks to own now.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet is the parent company of Google, among many other brands. While it was initially a laggard in the AI arms race, it has caught up and established itself as a top option in the space. Its Gemini generative AI model consistently ranks as one of the best, and it is likely the most quickly used due to its integration with the Google Search engine via AI overviews.
Alphabet was negatively viewed throughout most of 2025 as investors were worried that generative AI could replace the Google Search engine. Additionally, there were antitrust concerns surrounding Google's search engine business, although those fears were relieved when a Judge only required Alphabet to change a few things and didn't require a breakup.
Now that both of those fears are essentially gone, investors can appreciate Alphabet for the impressive business that it is. I predict this will cause the stock price to increase substantially over the next few years, as it still trades at a discount to most of its big tech peers (when measured by its forward price-to-earnings ratio, as seen in the chart below).
Alphabet is a top stock to own heading into 2026, and buying shares even after its sizable run is a smart move.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms is the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, along with a handful of other social media sites. This makes Meta primarily an advertising business, but it's using AI to increase the effectiveness of its platforms.
Meta continues to improve its AI-powered ad tools, but it has already seen higher conversion rates combined with more time spent on its platforms. This increases Meta's revenue, but the effect is far from complete. We'll see more tools released and other technologies implemented that continue to increase effectiveness over the next few years, and this should lead to continued strong growth from Meta, which grew its revenue by an impressive 22% in Q2.
Additionally, Meta released the second generation of its AI glasses. Time will tell if these are a hit among the general population, but if it can produce a piece of hardware that's a must-own, then Meta will have created a brand-new revenue stream out of nothing. Even if it flops, Meta's AI investments in its ad business will pay off, making Meta a great stock for 2026.
3. Amazon
Nearly every person in the U.S. is familiar with Amazon, but few recognize what really drives Amazon's profits: AWS. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud computing wing, and it is essentially Amazon building out excess computing capacity and renting it out to those who need it. This allows clients to move workloads from expensive on-site hardware that must be maintained by skilled labor to Amazon's servers, where this isn't needed.
This has become a popular option for traditional workloads alongside emerging artificial intelligence workloads. As a result, the cloud computing industry is booming.
AWS is the market leader in this industry, but it has grown more slowly than its two primary competitors (Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure). However, it may be able to turn it around in 2026 and deliver strong growth that boosts Amazon.
Although AWS only accounted for 18% of total revenue in Q2, 53% of operating profits came from AWS. This makes AWS' continued growth key for Amazon investors. If AWS can increase its growth rate from its current 17% pace to a much faster 30% to 40% range (how quickly Google Cloud and Azure are growing), Amazon shareholders could be handsomely rewarded in 2026."

While valuations are high, comparisons to the dot-com era suggest this may be a structural shift.
The combined market value of the United States' Magnificent Seven tech giants has now exceeded the entire output of the European Union, as a relentless rally in technology stocks stretches valuations and stokes concerns over potential market excess.
As of the close on 2 October 2025, the seven leading US tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla — commanded a total market capitalisation of $20.8 trillion (€17.7tn), eclipsing the EU’s total economic output of $19.4tn (€16.5tn).
Nvidia alone, now the world’s most valuable company, boasts a market valuation of around $4.3tn (€3.9tn) — equivalent to the GDP of Germany, Europe’s largest economy.
This extraordinary milestone is fuelling debate. Is this a transformative moment for global capitalism, or are we witnessing the early signs of a new tech bubble?
To assess that, we must ask: What truly defines a technology stock bubble — and how does today compare to the speculative frenzy of the early 2000s?
What is a tech bubble?
A tech bubble could be defined not just by high valuations, but by a widespread disconnect between market prices and the underlying economic reality or business fundamentals.
It’s characterised by speculative fervour, excessive investor optimism, and the belief that rapid technological change will deliver limitless profits — often without regard to earnings or sustainable business models.
Renowned economist Robert Shiller describes bubbles as periods of “social contagion” — where stories of quick riches fuel mass enthusiasm, drawing in more investors and driving prices even higher, regardless of the fundamentals.
In this phase, fear of missing out overrides risk assessment.
“Speculative bubbles are fuelled by the contagious spread of market stories, which inspire enthusiasm and a desire to participate among a growing number of investors,"" Robert Shiller wrote in his 'Irrational Exuberance'.
Hyman Minsky, another influential economist, argued that during euphoric booms, speculation becomes the dominant force in markets.
As asset prices climb, they are increasingly justified by narratives rather than data. Eventually, a trigger — whether macroeconomic, regulatory, or psychological — bursts the illusion, leading to a sharp correction. In tech bubbles, this dynamic is often amplified by the allure of innovation.
Investors project exponential growth onto emerging technologies — from dot-coms in the late 1990s to blockchain in the 2010s, and now potentially artificial intelligence.
‘This is not a bubble, but a reshaping of capitalism’
Jordi Visser, senior managing director and head of macro research at 22V Research, argued that branding today’s rally as a bubble misses the point.
“To separate AI from the lazy shorthand of ‘bubble’, we have to recognise that what’s unfolding is not speculative mania but a structural arms race,” he said, pointing to deep investment by governments and corporations in AI capabilities as a matter of national and economic security.
Rather than being driven by unsustainable euphoria, Visser suggests that AI is accelerating a decades-long process of economic concentration. That's one where wealth and innovation are being compressed into fewer hands, be they companies, households or nations.
“Bubbles lift everyone into euphoria; concentration leaves most behind,” he said.
Still, there are signs that investor sentiment is stretching. The speed of capital inflows into AI-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the speculative rise of small-cap AI names, and the dominance of a few megacaps over the broader market may not suggest a full-blown bubble, but they do indicate heightened risk.
Moreover, the structural bets being placed on AI may not all yield long-term gains. As with previous technological revolutions, not every firm will emerge a winner. The ghosts of AOL, BlackBerry and Yahoo! — once market leaders — still linger as reminders of how quickly innovation can outpace incumbency.
Are we in dot-com-like euphoria?
To assess whether we’re in a bubble similar to the late 1990s, it’s worth revisiting the numbers. The current tech rally can be traced back to November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT — a landmark moment for generative artificial intelligence that ignited a new wave of enthusiasm in Silicon Valley and beyond.
Since then, the Nasdaq 100 — the benchmark index for the largest US tech firms — has surged by 140% in under three years.
That’s impressive, but still modest compared to the dot-com era. In the three years leading up to the March 2000 peak, the Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 500%.
By that measure, we’re still far from the level of euphoria that defined the turn-of-the-century tech boom. Valuations, while elevated, are not yet extreme.
One of the most widely used indicators to assess equity valuations is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company’s current share price to its expected earnings over the next 12 months.
Here’s how the Magnificent Seven currently stack up:
Nvidia: 33.2x
Microsoft: 33.2x
Apple: 33.3x
Alphabet: 24.8x
Amazon: 32.1x
Meta: 25.5x
Tesla: 220.0x
Only Tesla appears significantly out of line, trading at a forward P/E of 220 — the highest in the Nasdaq 100 alongside Palantir, another AI-focused firm. Excluding Tesla, the group’s valuations are actually lower than the broader Nasdaq 100, which currently trades above 40x forward earnings.
In this context, while pricing is undoubtedly rich, it doesn’t yet reflect the frothy excesses of the dot-com bubble, at least not by traditional valuation standards.
Bottom Line
Today’s tech rally is extraordinary in both scale and symbolism.
That the world’s top seven tech companies can collectively outvalue the European Union’s economic output speaks volumes about the shifting balance of economic power in the digital age. But by traditional measures of euphoria — explosive price increases, irrational valuations, widespread retail mania — the current cycle falls short of the dot-com peak.
That may offer comfort to some, but the line between structural transformation and speculative excess is often thin."

Several technology leaders are building a competitive moat in areas like semiconductors and cloud computing. In case you have $5,000 not required to pay bills or for contingencies, then investing in one or both of these stocks can pay rich returns in the long run.
1. Oracle
Over the last few years, Oracle (ORCL 1.45%) has evolved from a database specialist to a leading AI-driven cloud infrastructure company. The company's cloud infrastructure is now powering complex AI workloads for several prominent companies, including OpenAI, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices. Its large-scale data centers are proving faster and cheaper for training huge AI models.
And by being the largest custodian of high-value private data globally, Oracle is also well positioned to capitalize on the growing opportunity in AI inference (real-time deployment of AI models). The company uses vectorization to store huge amounts of data in its AI databases, which all prominent large language models easily understand.
And by enabling the connection of all of its clients' data sources with large language models inside the cloud, Oracle allows clients to leverage advanced AI reasoning without compromising on the safety and security of their private data.
Cloud infrastructure revenue surged 54% year over year to $3.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending Aug. 31). Management now expects the business to see revenue soar 77% year over year to $18 billion in fiscal 2026 and scale up rapidly toward $32 billion by 2027.
These are achievable targets, especially after the company signed a $300 billion contract with OpenAI for providing computing capacity over the next five years. Oracle's $455 billion backlog at the end of the first quarter will continue to drive up its overall revenue for the next few years.
The stock is trading at 41.5 times forward earnings, which is not a particularly cheap valuation. And it carries a huge $91.3 billion debt, which will increase due to its $18 billion bond issuance in September 2025. However, with demand for Oracle's cloud services far outpacing supply and its crucial role as an AI infrastructure provider, the company can continue to grow its share price despite the headwinds.
2. Micron
Micron Technology (MU 2.62%) is a crucial supplier of memory and storage for building global AI infrastructure. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending Aug. 28), the company's revenue soared 46% year over year to $11.3 billion, while adjusted earnings per share surged 156.8% year over year to $3.03. The company's revenue also jumped 49% year over year to $37.4 billion, and gross margins rose by 17 percentage points to 41% in fiscal 2025.
Micron's data center segment has been the key growth catalyst, accounting for 56% of total revenue and a gross margin of 52% in fiscal 2025.
A major contributor to this growth was the company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products and advanced DRAM offerings, which together generated $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025. HBM revenue alone reached $2 billion in the fourth quarter, translating into an annual run rate of almost $8 billion.
Demand is especially robust for the HBM third-generation extended (HBM3E) products, because its faster data movement and lower latency are crucial for AI workloads. The company has already secured pricing agreements for the majority of its HBM3E supply for most of the calendar year 2026.
HBM's share is expected to be in line with DRAM's market share in the third quarter of calendar year 2025. These factors highlight the strong demand and revenue visibility for the HBM in the coming months.
And the company has begun sampling the even faster and power-efficient fourth-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4) products. Micron is in position to benefit from the next wave of AI-driven demand.
It expects the supply of DRAM and NAND to fall short of demand in calendar year 2025. Besides AI servers, demand for memory and storage has also increased in PCs, smartphones, and automobiles. This mismatch is expected to strengthen prices, which in turn will help boost the company's revenue and margin.
Management has also provided strong guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, which includes $12.2 billion to $12.8 billion in revenue, 50.5% to 52.5% gross margin, and $3.60 to $3.80 in adjusted earnings per share.
Despite these secular tailwinds and robust financials, the stock trades at 10.5 times forward earnings, significantly lower than the valuation multiples of many top-notch AI infrastructure players.
Hence, with Wall Street still valuing the company mostly like a cyclical memory player, it can be a brilliant pick in 2025."

Travis Hoium: Where are the hidden opportunities in the stock market and artificial intelligence? Motley Fool Money starts now.
Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Travis Hoium joined today by Lou Whiteman and Jon Quast. I think we're obligated to talk about artificial intelligence at the top of the show, but I don't want to go in the direction that we're talking about all over the place with Oracle's deal with OpenAI, what's happening with Google? We'll maybe touch on some things with Meta a little bit later. But my question for you guys is what's intriguing in artificial intelligence when you dig a little bit deeper? We saw some pictures this week of the massive facility, Stargate facility that OpenAI is part of building in Texas. There's got to be a lot of opportunities there. Jon, what's hidden underneath the surface that investors should be looking at with AI build out that isn't just these big names like NVIDIA?
Jon Quast: Travis, just the way that I tick, I don't really like the headline grabbing companies as much as I do like the beneath the surface kind of ways that you can play this artificial intelligence trend. I think that energy is actually interesting, which if you know me, you know that I normally would be looking for something shinier in the investment world. But if you look at the information from the US Energy Information Administration, there was basically 2% annual growth for energy from 1990-2005. Then for the next 15 years, there was essentially no growth in energy. But now we're entering a period where we're getting back to that 1990s growth trend for electricity.
Travis Hoium: This is electricity demand. Really I think there was even a century before that, so you have more light bulbs, you have more air conditioners. There's more stuff. I think what happened in that 2005-2020 is things got more efficient. We have more efficient fridges, we have more efficient light bulbs, and so there's a little change, but now we're back to growth.
Jon Quast: You're exactly right, Travis. If you look at residential electricity, we're still seeing basically no growth because things do get more energy efficient. Where the growth is coming from is the commercial market, the commercial end use, and the data centers for AI are one of the big drivers of that.
Travis Hoium: Opportunity is that power producers, utilities, or is it just the tide lifts all boats in the energy space?
Jon Quast: For me, personally, as someone who doesn't really closely follow the energy space, probably it's a rising tide lifts all boats. I have done well with my investment in Vistra Energy, but there are many different ways that you can look at this. What's going to be interesting in the future, too, is just what is saying that necessity is the driver of innovation. I think that there will need to be some innovations in the energy space if we're going to meet all this demand that is booming between now and potentially 2040, according to some reports.
Travis Hoium: Nuclear has gotten a lot of attention, but that's still 5, 10, maybe 15 years away. Lou, Jon brought up a lot of picks and shovels ideas, and energy isn't a space that I'm looking for these opportunities, too. We've seen not only is demand going up, but also prices are going up. That's not necessarily something that those of us who are paying our electric bills every month like to see. But it does mean there's maybe more opportunity financially for investors. What's intriguing you about beneath the surface in AI right now?
Lou Whiteman: I'm going to be glass half full here. I'm going to start out with everything I don't like, and I want to like the picks and shovels. I agree with Jon in theory. The problem for me is, I think that we're late to that. A lot of these businesses have been bit up already, so it's not as intriguing to me. Energy, to me, is just a minefield because there's so much CapEx that's going to have to go into this, so much of it is transmission and investments everywhere. As you say, nuclear, it sounds great, but making it work. I see so many pitfalls. I'll be honest with you, Travis. I don't own NVIDIA, but I would rather own NVIDIA today's valuation than to really explore some of these, I think, overvalued picks and shovels. I also would avoid the data center reads and the CoreWeaves, like Travis, I'm not even going to use your money to buy those.
Travis Hoium: Thank you.
Lou Whiteman: Because depreciation scares me. This isn't like railroads where the track lasts 100 years. These NVIDIA trips are outdated six months after they come off. How does this play out over time with this investment? That scares me. As far as where I would like to go, I think the next big thing is the boring incremental progress with AI. I look at things, maybe they're not flashy, maybe they're not consumer focused. Maybe it's not going to be like your imaginary friend on your shoulder, AI. But places like robotics, where you can go anywhere from here, like Honeywell and Amazon, even in the warehouse, drone companies like Kratos, AeroVironment, Intuitive Surgical, all of these things where incrementally robotics can get better due to AI. I think that's a huge opportunity. I'd also say the same as boring as is business processes. Whether or not it's Microsoft, whether or not it's Salesforce, whatever you're talking about, but I think the next big thing in AI is going to be all those boring, mundane back office tasks getting automated successfully, a next level to what we've done in the last 30 years. I know it's not as sexy as a lot of these things we talk about, but I really do think that's where the money is going to be made. To me, I see revenue growth, I see opportunity there. I think boring is better here.
Travis Hoium: You brought up robotics. I think this is going to be a really interesting space to watch. Do you think there's both opportunity and risk with some of those names like Honeywell? Amazon's maybe a little bit more innovative, but Google announced basically has a robotics operating system that's powered by AI that could allow a lot of different companies to develop their own robots. You have companies like Figure. Seems like there's a ton of innovation going in the space. Is that possibly a threat to some of these legacy companies that maybe aren't innovating quite as fast? Or is this, again, just a rising tide lifts all boats, and at least Honeywell or companies like that are going to be better off than they were?
Lou Whiteman: I would push back on Honeywell not innovating as fast. I think you're right that if Google can commoditize some of the operating systems, that there's a lot more opportunities. I do think that's a risk, but I think that some of the companies that actually have deployments and real world experience and they are innovating based on what their customers and they have real live customers are communicating to them what they want. I don't know if I think Honeywell's at a disadvantage here, but, yes, it's going to get more competitive from here.
Travis Hoium: Jon, you had another interesting idea. I think we all know that these GPUs run hot, but how are they keeping them cool?
Jon Quast: The traditional way to keep all of these GPUs cool is just by blowing cold air over them. I forget how many months ago it was now, but there was a generative AI trend where everyone was turning their pictures into Ghibli studio art. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, comes out and is like, our GPUs are literally melting right now because the demand, the workload is so much that the GPUs are just overheating. That's going to only increase in time as GPUs become more densely packed in there as workloads grow. Liquid cooling is something that is actually an interesting trend to watch here, a beneath the surface thing. A better way, a more efficient way to keep these GPUs from overheating. Some market research out there, it's a small market, but it's essentially predicting that it's going to 10X in size over maybe the next seven years give or take. This has actually been a boom for a company such as Vertiv, symbol VRT. It's trends like these that I really get excited about this beneath the surface that nobody really thinks about, but is actually really important to making all this work.
Travis Hoium: Other one that's been a big beneficiary in The Motley Fool Universe is Comfort Systems. That's a company that's just doing industrial air conditioning. It's a roll up. They've got a bunch of different things that they can do. But when you build out a data center, you look at it's not just GPUs that goes into it. There's a lot of different systems that go into it. That's going to be another way to play this. But there's going to be a lot of surprising stories companies that do well, Lou, what do you want to add there?
Lou Whiteman: Well, I agree with all this, but again, just what scares me, and I may be proven wrong here. But Comfort Systems, I think, is up 1,500% over the last five years. I've heard of it's a relative bargain up 700% for industrial companies. I would love to have gotten in on this and been smart enough to see this five years ago. Right now, I just like I said, I think I hate to be this boring, but I'm just going to go within NVIDIA.
Travis Hoium: Could be the value play here is the company that everybody already knows about. Let's touch on another story in AI that could have a ton of demand for data centers and GPUs. That's TikTok. We got some news this week that there's at least potentially a deal for TikTok to stay alive in the US. Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz are going to take 45% stake. Jon, how does this impact companies? We don't need to get to the legality and if this is actually going to happen, but assuming that TikTok stays live, is there companies that see this as either an opportunity or a threat?
Jon Quast: Well, first and foremost, AppLovin symbol APP, it really wanted to be the one that acquired TikTok here. It put in that bid, and it's disappointing that it didn't get it because you look at an advertising technology company such as AppLovin. A lot of people may not realize they're just watching videos, but TikTok has this whole social commerce element to it. I really think that's where the world is going more and more. I think if you could have married that commerce element with the advertising technology of AppLovin, that could have been a really powerful thing together from a business perspective, like a 1+1 = 3 kind of a thing. Poor AppLovin didn't get the bid here. But no, I think that there are a lot of companies that do use TikTok, and so they're going to be happy to see that it's staying live here in the US.
Travis Hoium: Lou, Oracle is always the elephant in the room here. They're involved. Somehow they're going to pay for this, even though they have now, $120 billion in debt just took out another 18 billion this week. What's your takeaway? Is this going to be a big deal? Is this another Oracle roll up? What's going on with TikTok?
Lou Whiteman: Oracle, I guess they're paying for it, but Jon pointed this out in our show notes. The reported price, Oracle isn't paying a lot for this, less than what Pinterest is worth, which is curious to me, and I'll say this, too, just in terms of competition. I am not TikTok's core audience. You may not be aware of that, but I'm pretty sure I'm not, but I do have someone who fits into that demographic in my household. I don't think TikTok is today what it was a few years ago. I don't think it's done.
Travis Hoium: It's losing momentum, you're saying?
Lou Whiteman: I think the momentum has passed. I don't think Meta has to worry about this too much. I'm sure they would love to have seen competition just disappear. But I don't think that this really changes the course for Meta. I think Instagram is still a big winner and some of the other apps. As far as Oracle, it's a great deal on paper, but this isn't their wheelhouse, Travis. This is a very different thing from Oracle. I'm wondering how hands on or hands off they're going to be with it. Larry Ellison loves to meddle. I can see this being a trophy asset. It's going to be fascinating to see it play out, but Jon said it best. AppLovin, you can make a case with a lot of companies, why it would make sense. For Oracle, it just feels like you're buying a customer and you're putting a trophy on the mantel.
Travis Hoium: Elon Musk was a power Twitter user when he bought the company and eventually renamed it X. Maybe we can get Larry Ellison to be a power TikTok creator.
Lou Whiteman: How great would that be? Travis, is there a world where Paramount Skydance could figure out how to incorporate TikTok?
Travis Hoium: Absolutely. I think that's the other thing is all these individual people and very wealthy people are playing in this, when you get the media and tech involved. We'll see where this goes, but I do think this is going to be notable for even companies like Alphabet who owns YouTube. YouTube Shorts, YouTube on TV. That's a growing business. But when we come back, we are going to see in this frothy market where AI is the big topic, what else are Lou and Jon looking at for deals you're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. In a market that looks very highly valued today where artificial intelligence is all people are talking about. I want to know what Lou and Jon are looking at that looks a little bit more like a value. Lou, what's being overlooked in the market right now?
Lou Whiteman: Wait, it doesn't look overvalued. I think it is overvalued. The S&P 500, as a multiple of earnings is at near record highs relative to the 20 year average. This is an overvalued market, but the neat thing is, Travis, as you say, it's so focused on just the AI, the hyper scalars, all of this. Arguably, 400 of the S&P 500, decent value here, it's so top heavy. I even go a lot of places. I'm going to go to regional and midsize banks. Right now, the super regionals, companies like Truist, PNC, Regions, US Bancorp, but there's a ton of them. They're all trading at less than 1.5 times their book value. Book is a pretty good measure for banks because it's a way to just look at their deposits, what they'd be worth in a sale. All of those companies I mentioned, are paying a dividend of more than 3%, too. Truist is up near 5%. There's some catalysts here. Lower rate environments tend to be good for banks because they can reprice deposits lower faster than they have to reprice loans. In the case of Truist and some of these others, there's also a lot of COVID era, ultra loans that are coming up for refinancing. That should boost margins. I think there's just a lot of opportunities in these banks.
Travis Hoium: Is the risk here that the economy is worse than at least the market is indicating, and so defaults on things like auto loans maybe not houses, more traditional loans are going to be maybe a little bit higher than you would like. Look, when interest rates go down, the reason they go down is because the economy is not great, so it's a little bit of a double edged sword.
Lou Whiteman: Absolutely. I'm taking a long term approach. If I can lock in a 5% dividend yield now, I think the companies can survive a downturn and you get that dividend yield that you bought in at today for the next 10, 20, 50 years, if you want.
Travis Hoium: Jon, what are you seeing that's overlooked right now?
Jon Quast: I'm looking at the restaurant space as a whole. Many of those stocks have dropped in 2025, and that's what caught my interest. Now, I get it. There's definitely things going on in the restaurant industry. It seems like consumers have less money to spend. It seems like the fast food places are starting to get into a little bit of value pricing wars. But when I see a whole space that is starting to trade down, that means let's go poking around to see which of the best companies are unjustly selling off with their peers. Here's one that I have really liked since it went public from a business perspective, but the valuation has never made any sense to me, and that is Mediterranean chain CAVA. It really is a great business. When you look at it, it has great average unit volumes. Same store sales consistently tick up. The restaurant level operating profit is often quite strong. As of this taping, it's down about 60% from its all time high. That's its largest drawdown since going public. It trades at about 50 times earnings. Now, we know that 50 times earnings sounds expensive, but this is a company that is still gearing up for a lot of long term growth. And this is actually the lowest the valuation has been since it went public. I'm not necessarily saying that the bottom is in for CAVA. I think that it could still be in for a couple of rough quarters as the trends slow down and investors wait through that. But thinking about it long term, I think that the valuation is making a lot more sense here if people are interested in buying CAVA stock today.
Travis Hoium: Do you think there's a possibility that some of these fast casual lump CAVA in there have been overbuilt. One of the interesting trends over the past quarter or two has been people are sitting down to eat more. Maybe that's partially because, I remember driving through at McDonald's when we were traveling, and it was like $50 to feed the family I was like, what in the world is going on here? I might as well go sit down and eat a burger to spend an extra 20 bucks. But is that a risk here? Is that this middle is being hollowed out because the value that used to be there isn't always there. It just seems like the numbers are hard to splice right now.
Jon Quast: I think that's definitely the case with some. I think if you look at the fast casual burger space, think Shake Shack, for example, I think that's a little bit less competitively advantaged as something like a CAVA, which is really somewhat more unique in the market. I won't say it's completely unique, but that Greek Mediterranean focus, that's not something that you get at any restaurant. I think there is more room for a CAVA expansion.
Travis Hoium: That is the space where I'm going to start digging around here, as well. I think there's some deals somewhere. When we come back, we are going to play a little game called higher or lower. We're going to see what Lou and Jon think a bunch of stocks are going to be moving over the next year, you're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Today, we want to play a little game called higher or Lower. This is simple. I just want to know if Lou and Jon think the market and some stocks we're going to talk about are going to be higher or lower a year from now. I want a little bit of context. I want to know what you're ultimately bullish on, where you're seeing opportunities and where you're seeing risks. Lou, let's start with the market. The S&P 500, you mentioned earlier, we are at relatively high price to earnings multiples. Do you think the S&P 500, a year from now is going to be higher or lower?
Lou Whiteman: I'm going to go ahead and cheat before we even start. I will answer your question. Can't push. I'm not going to push. I will say lower, but I have a stronger conviction that it won't be dramatically higher or lower than I do which direction it'll go. I think we're going to be range bound for a while now. I think that's these competing pressures. I don't think we're going to just see crazy movement either direction. But if I had to guess, I would guess red, not green.
Jon Quast: I'm going to have to take the other side of that, Lou. I'm going to say the S&P 500 will be up a year from now. Multiple reasons for that. First the GDP, we're already seeing some pretty good numbers coming out from that this year, and it seems like things are almost heating up, if anything. That's interesting. Interest rates are likely to head lower in the next year. That's often something that can push stocks a little bit higher still. Look, if you look over the long term, it is always the safe bet to bet that the S&P 500 will be higher over the next year.
Travis Hoium: The odds are definitely in Jon's favor here. Jon, one thing I want to push on is interest rates are going lower when it comes to the Fed. I think that's probably true. But the interesting thing is, since they announced that they were cutting the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points or a quarter of a percentage point, the ten year, which is really what things like mortgages, car loans are based on is actually up. Do you think that's going to reverse, and the market's going to go, You know what? Rates are going to stay lower for longer, so maybe this ten year I'll go from 4.2 where it is today to 3.5 or something like that, and that will end up being a tail.
Jon Quast: Travis, I would say that the lowering of the interest rates, to your point, obviously, you're correct. I would say my point was more general to the position that the Fed is taking. It's a little bit more of an easing environment. We see this in multiple ways, not just interest rates. M two money supply is also heading higher again. Normally, this does have a little bit of inflationary pressure. Yet, again, the Fed's in a tough spot, trying to juggle inflation and growth. But overall, I would say the trends are pointing to definitely more of a investment speculation market than more cautious.
Travis Hoium: The sentiment would definitely have to change to be lower. We'll see. That can change really quickly, but the odds are in Jon's favor in this one. Lou, I want to go to one that I have a lot of questions about right now. We mentioned them earlier. Oracle. Oracle has just took out $18 billion worth of debt. That would put them at about $120 billion worth of debt. They also still have to build out all of these data centers that are going to be serving $300 billion worth of performance obligations for Oracle. They've got to pay for TikTok. There's a lot going on with Oracle, but it is one of the hottest stocks this year. Is it going to be higher or lower 12 months from now?
Lou Whiteman: Up 92% in the last six months. That's a pretty good six months. What we've seen with not NVIDIA, not the suppliers, but the AI consumers, so to speak, right now, is that there is a hot stock and everyone else, and the hot stocks tend not to stay that way forever. All roundabout way of saying it's going to be red. I don't know if it's going to give up on 92%. It still end up being a great three years, but I'm going to take the under from here.
Jon Quast: That's so interesting. I'm going to have to disagree with Lou again. Listen, if you had asked me the three year outlook, I don't know what I'd answer. If you'd asked me the five year outlook, I might guess down, but over the one year, one of the biggest drivers of a stock over a single year is how investors feel about it. Oracle just forecasted some of the most incredible backlog growth numbers that I've ever seen in my entire investing life, if it comes close to delivering on those.
Travis Hoium: We're not actually going to know in the next 12 months to be fair, because a lot of those performance obligations started in 2027.
Jon Quast: As far as delivering on those performance obligations, but we could theoretically see some of those backlog numbers even climb higher still in the next year. I think this is something that can keep investors pretty excited about Oracle over the next year, so I would bet higher.
Travis Hoium: A stock that has not had quite as much excitement is Starbucks. They announced some layoffs recently. Jon is Starbucks going to be higher or lower a year from now?
Jon Quast: I guess lower. Again, if you'd ask me the five year, I would say higher. But over the next year, I still think that Brian Nichol. Look, they brought him in for a reason. Brian Nichol is a great operator, and Starbucks needs some things fixed in operations. I think he needs a little bit more time to cook in the kitchen if they're going to make the changes that they need to make. I think that it persists for a little bit longer than investors want it. I would guess over the next year, Starbucks, I don't think will be down dramatically, but I think it will drift lower.
Lou Whiteman: I'll take Glass half full here. Jon's right, but the market is forward looking, and I think Brian Nichol, just even what was announced this week with the 900 layoffs and trimming the stores, he is being proactive. I think the market will even if the job isn't done, I agree. The job won't be done in a year, but I think that if we see signs of progress, the market will react positively. Stocks been pretty beaten down, so I think investors are looking for good news and they will lean into good news It'll be great.
Travis Hoium: Are commodity prices something that you're worried about with coffee and the potential for more import tariffs on coffee, I know that that's been floated in the countries that a lot of coffee comes from, may or may not be subject to some tariffs. Lou, is that a worry?
Lou Whiteman: Yes, but Starbucks, A, that hits everybody, and Starbucks is better positioned to handle it with its scale than some. Again, I think the stock is going to move on the success that Nichols has, and I think there will be signs of success within a year, even if coffee prices do go.
Jon Quast: How about this for signs of Life, Lou? It's going to sound like I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth. But I don't really go to Starbucks all that often, not like I did in my 20s. I was there maybe six months ago, and it was stone cold dead in there. Now, I've been a couple of times since, and you could not get a seat in my local Starbucks. It was just booming and people were buying coffee and staying awhile, and that's exactly what Nichol wants to see. He wants to see this return to back out Starbucks used to be, where it was a place where you didn't just get coffee, you went and you hung out for a while. It was a coffee house that you wanted to be in that's what he wants to get back to. That's why he's cutting some of these stores is because it doesn't really fit in with that vibe that he wants to have. I would say that anecdotally, I'm seeing some of those signs of life. Maybe you're right, Lou. Maybe we see this sooner than later in the numbers and the stock responds accordingly.
Travis Hoium: The question is, is there a vibe shift at Starbucks? That will be interesting to watch. The next stock I want to know about a lot going on. We could make this an AI stock. You can make this a media stock. Alphabet, Jon, Alphabet's had a really nice run the last few weeks. Now getting a little bit more expensive, not trading in the teens, price to earnings multiple. It's more like the mid 20s. But our share is going to be higher or lower a year from now.
Jon Quast: I would say that Alphabet is also heading higher. Now, part of that is, if you're going to bet the market is going higher, you're pretty much going to bet that alphabet is going higher, as well, considering that Alphabet is so much of the S&P 500. But, man, what a great collection of businesses. You have the advertising component, you have search, you have YouTube, but you also have this just sleeping giant. Maybe it's not so sleeping anymore, but when it comes to artificial intelligence, it's really doing a lot of things well. As I pointed out earlier in the show, that is an area advertising where I see that artificial intelligence can really make a difference. I think that you pair Alphabet's AI chops with the distribution that it has with YouTube and other things. I think that is a really powerful thing to keep the business going in the right direction.
Lou Whiteman: I'm just going to think of this as Oracle versus Alphabet for the purposes, and I'm much more optimistic Alphabet can run from here than Oracle. I'm going to say green just as the opposite of Oracle. You're right, Travis. They finally turned it on, I think unfairly beaten down for a while. A lot of those headwinds are gone, so I do think alphabet can go higher. I love that you're not making me say how much higher, though.
Travis Hoium: Multiples are going to be a big deal with them, and we'll see how much the Cloud business can grow, but the fact that it looks like Apple's talking to them about using Gemini. Meta is talking about them about using Gemini. They're looking to be in a pretty good position in AI, which a lot of people didn't think even six months ago. Let's talk about a stack that we've danced around a little bit. The company that Brian Nichol used to run another company in Fast Casual Chipotle, Lou, well, they had some negative comps in the most recent quarter. Stock has come down a bit, but is it going to be higher or lower a year from now?
Lou Whiteman: The same logic as Starbucks. I'm going to say it will be higher. I'll be honest with you, though, I'm not excited as an investor. I think we're coming off the bottom. I don't know if I see this as being a market beater over the next few years. I'm not all that enthusiastic, but if I had to guess one direction or the other, I would say that there's probably signs of life, again, like with Starbucks and a bounce.
Jon Quast: I don't know what it is with me and Lou disagreeing today, but I'm going to say lower for Chipotle over the next year, and my reasoning for that is pretty similar to Starbucks, although perhaps a added twist. You look at Chipotle's restaurant level profit margins. They have been at an all time high, and I don't know if anyone in the restaurant business matches them, let alone beats them. Now struggling with traffic a little bit, getting into more of a discount fast, casual fast food environment. If you start not having the same pricing power that you had, those restaurant level profit margins necessarily come down. Look, Chipotle has room to do that because the margins are already so high to begin with. I think that it's still something that they have to work through. They have to win the customers back and they have to make sure that they're competing on price. I think this is a little bit of a headwind for Chipotle in the near term. Long term, I still think the business has a lot of promise.
Travis Hoium: Some mixed reactions there, which I like that because there's a lot to think about in this market. You can make a bullish case, you can make a bearish case. We'll see where things play out. I think the holiday season is going to be really important for a lot of these companies. When we come back, we are going to get an update on what's going on at Meta. They are spending billions and billions of dollars and now finally introducing a new app that actually looks compelling. We'll touch on that when we come back. You're listening to Motley Fool.

All personal finance content follows Motley Fool's editorial standards, and is not approved by advertisers, advertisements are sponsored content and provided for informational purposes only. To see our full advertising disclosure, please check out our show notes. One of the interesting companies in AI and Tech in general right now is meta platforms. Mark Zuckerberg is spending billions of dollars on talent in GPUs, but there's rumors that they may be looking at using Gemini to help make their ads a little bit more effective. They introduced the Meta AI app yesterday, which is basically shorts or TikTok, but just AI generated videos. Jon, I'm having a hard time figuring out if Meta is falling behind or leaping ahead. What's your reaction from all this?
Jon Quast: I think that the question you have to answer is, where is the value in AI? Is it in developing the models or is it in using them to your advantage? I think that the strong argument is that the long term value is not in developing the models themselves. In which case, by all means, go to Gemini and use that. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that as these models get more sophisticated, they're going to be commoditized. That's not really where the value would be in that scenario. Look, Meta got some of the best AI minds that money could buy, and now it's figuring out what to build. It's actually doing a good job when it comes to advertising and using AI to its advantage there. I don't think that Meta is necessarily falling behind. I think that it is using the models to its advantage.
Travis Hoium: A lot of those people that they hired are working on products. They're not just researchers. It's an interesting distinction. They were paying a lot of money. It wasn't know, the researchers coming from OpenAI. It was people who have developed things like copilot, who they're paying a lot of money to. But Lou, what are your thoughts on where Meta is headed today?
Lou Whiteman: I said earlier in the show that I think the opportunity in AI is some of the users, and I was more thinking about business processes, but I think it's smart. Like, Jon said, I do think that the models are all in a race to the same thing. Meta is trying to figure out how to use it. Look, Meta is talking about a lot of different things using their technology for government work, for business work, but right now it is mostly just an AI version of these sticky consumer apps that we I don't want to use the word love, but we all know. Maybe that's their place, and it makes sense for them to at least start there. I think the real money is getting to those other places that they're talking about, and I'm a little skeptical that Meta will be the one leading the way with government AI and business to business AI, things like that. I think in a way, they're ahead with their core audience, but I don't know if the end of the day, that's going to make them one of the big winners here versus I think just the business to business opportunities are going to be so much more lucrative over time.
Travis Hoium: Is the better play the hyperscalers or the companies who own the eyeballs, Lou?
Lou Whiteman: I love the eyeballs, because if we're going toward just commoditization, it's who's able to funnel those tools to users to use them, whether or not you're talking, again, consumer or commercial, it could be Microsoft with just having copilot on everything right now if you use office, I think that that is the competitive advantage, not.
Travis Hoium: The interesting thing for Meta, I think, if you look back at their history over the past 21 years, is they started with peer to peer. You're talking to your family. Then when you get, you go to the feed, then you get disruption from TikTok, and you know what we need to give people the content that's going to keep them engaged. That's not necessarily from within their network. We're going to pull in all this other content. Now we're just going all the way to AI content. It's not real content at all. It's just made by computers. What a transition. I don't know if you should give Mark Zuckerberg credit for making that evolution or think that this is dystopian, but maybe somewhere in the middle. We'd like to end the show with stocks on our radar. I'm going to be the one making the call. What's going on my watch list. Lou, I'm going to have you start. What is on your radar this week?
Lou Whiteman: I'm looking at Consulting giant Accenture. Ticker ACN. They released fourth quarter earnings this week, and they were pretty. They beat on the top and bottom line, which is good, but those were reduced expectations. Revenue was only up 7% year over year. They set initial guidance for their new fiscal year, which is starting now, at a lackluster 2- 5% revenue growth. That's not great. This is a company facing real headwinds, both from federal spending in the wake of the Doge effort, and corporate customers who are currently gun shy about committing to new products. Stock is down 30% year to date, but I do think these headwinds are temporary. AI bookings doubled year over year, and the company is beginning to turn those bookings into revenue. AI revenue has tripled. They also boosted their dividend by 10% giving us a reason to wait. For those of the long term focus, Accenture is really looking interesting to me.
Travis Hoium: Jon, what is on your RDR this week?
Jon Quast: I'm going to go with Shift4 payments. That's Ticker symbol F-O-U-R. This is a financial technology company. It processes payments. It has software for businesses, and it's usually deployed at very large venues and restaurants. Think NFL stadiums. That would be a customer for Shift4 The downside, if you want to call it a downside to the big venue strategy, is that you can get a lot of volume, but your take rate on those transactions might actually go down. But the benefits outweigh that, in my opinion. When it wins a single customer, it's normally a very efficient go to market strategy. It doesn't have to spend a ton on sales and marketing. They also tend to be very reliable customers, and so they stick around for a long time. It's grown at a greater than 20% growth rate for a very long time, very consistent amount of time. It's still growing. It just acquired Global blue to address more international markets, and it's trading at less than 15 times its forward earning estimates. Now, to me, you look at its track record, we look at the valuation and how fast it's still growing. That is a steel.
Travis Hoium: The payments business has been a tough business, but it is a growing business. Is there something that differentiates them from Toast and Square and Adian and all these other companies that seem to do a lot of the same things?
Jon Quast: I can feed you the company line, and that's that its software is built for customers such as these, whereas some of the other players are built for smaller players. That's a consideration that some of these companies use when they're looking for a financial technology partner.
Travis Hoium: Maybe there's just going to be a whole bunch of niches in this business, but we'll see. I like where Jon's going with Shift4. I've had this in my purview for a little while, but I need to dig a little bit deeper, so I will put Shift4 on my watch list. For Lou Whiteman, Jon Quast, our production leader, Bart Shannon, and the entire Motley Fool team, I'm Travis Hoium. Thanks for listening to Motley Fool Money. We'll see you here tomorrow."

Netflix (NFLX) shares fell Friday, cementing their biggest weekly decline since April 4. The stock dropped nearly 5% over the 5-day trading period ending Friday as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk continued to urge consumers to boycott the streaming giant.
The stock has lagged the broader market, which has climbed about 2% to new record highs over the past week, and has also trailed Big Tech peers like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).
The drop comes as Musk amps up calls for a boycott, urging his 227 million followers on X to cancel their Netflix subscriptions and accusing the streamer of pushing alleged transgender messaging in kids' shows.
Over the past several days, Musk has posted or reposted a series of messages criticizing Netflix’s programming: “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” Musk wrote on Tuesday.
Netflix did not respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.
Musk's campaign comes as the streamer prepares to report third quarter earnings later this month. Since the company no longer discloses subscriber numbers on a quarterly basis, the short-term impact of any boycott may be difficult to quantify.
In its most recent earnings report, Netflix topped Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue outlook, although the results failed to clear what many analysts described as a high bar for performance.
The company expects third quarter revenue of $11.53 billion and EPS of $6.87, both above initial consensus estimates. For the full year, Netflix now sees revenue between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, reflecting solid growth in its ad-supported tier, foreign exchange tailwinds, and steady user engagement.
Executives have said ad sales are on pace to roughly double to $3 billion next year, while new seasons of flagship shows like ""Wednesday,"" ""Stranger Things,"" and ""Squid Game,"" alongside expanding live sports offerings, should help sustain momentum.
This isn’t the first time Netflix has found itself at the center of a social media firestorm. In 2020, the streamer faced bipartisan backlash following the release of the French coming-of-age film ""Cuties,"" which critics accused of over-sexualizing young girls.
At the time, subscription analytics firm Antenna reported cancellations surged fivefold, while YipitData found churn hit a multiyear high. The hashtag #CancelNetflix also trended for days. Still, the company weathered that controversy with little long-term damage to its subscriber base."

Ronald Josey from Citi remains positive on Meta as the company raises the stakes in Big Tech’s fight against AI regulation. Meta is investing millions into a new super PAC to overcome state-level policy proposals that could restrain AI development, as per Axios. Meta’s pro-AI PAC is the company’s latest effort to fight off gruelling AI and tech policy bills across the country.

The company’s latest super PAC is called the American Technology Excellence Project. Meta’s spokesperson Rachel Holland mentioned that the company is investing ‘tens of millions’ into the project.
On top of this, Citi sees Meta’s latest AI glasses as a major catalyst for the company. The analyst believes that adoption of AI glasses could reach a ‘tipping point’ in 2026 as the device capabilities increase.
As of September 30, Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) average price target of $880, based on analysts’ estimates, implies an upside of almost 19.83% from current levels.
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a leading technology company that engages in the development of products that offer connectivity among people. The company offers connectivity services through its social media platforms and its VR, mixed reality headsets, and wearable products.

finnhub,META,2025-10-03T17:57:53,The Magnificent Seven Stocks Are Roaring Again. Can They Keep Climbing?,"After lagging the S&P 500's gains for most of 2025, the Magnificent 7 recently overtook the benchmark index to reclaim its lead.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a1668d8bb810f62e2b8a5c6995261b59b4278768980b73f72060424bdef759bc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.investopedia.com/the-magnificent-seven-stocks-are-roaring-again-can-they-keep-climbing-11823869,https://www.investopedia.com/the-magnificent-seven-stocks-are-roaring-again-can-they-keep-climbing-11823869,https://www.investopedia.com/the-magnificent-seven-stocks-are-roaring-again-can-they-keep-climbing-11823869,investopedia.com,200,,"Key Takeaways
- After lagging the S&P 500's gains for most of 2025, the Magnificent 7 recently overtook the benchmark index to reclaim its lead. Tesla, Google parent Alphabet, and Apple have been the biggest contributors to the group's gains in recent weeks.
- There's wariness in some corners about the performance of stocks. But many market watchers think that, at least in the short-term, the setup looks good for more upside.
Last year's Magnificent 7 tech leaders are rolling again.
That hasn't always been the case this year. As a group, the large-cap technology companies—Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA)—have lagged the broader market for most of 2025. That's led to questions about whether the grouping's reign is over or if its membership should change.
Then came September's rally. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is now up nearly 20% year-to-date, ahead of the S&P 500's close to 15% gain; it more than doubled the benchmark index's performance in the third quarter. The question now: What next?
The bullishness hasn't dried up. Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said Thursday that growth stocks, particularly those with ties to AI, were supported in the third quarter by strong earnings, expectations of AI-driven growth, and easing interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive. Wall Street analysts largely expect those trends to continue.
There's wariness about a bubble in AI; Even Jeff Bezos has suggested that it's in a kind of ""industrial bubble"" in which it can be difficult for investors to identify the future winners and losers from the field of would-be standouts.
Bank of America analysts on Friday said that ""every bubble in history popped by central bank tightening, and no central bank in the world has hiked rates in past 2 months."" A recent survey of Investopedia readers suggested cooling optimism about the stock market, though they said they remain heavily invested in growth stocks even with valuations at high levels.
Why This Matters to Investors
The Magnificent 7’s resurgence comes on the back of a rebound by tech heavyweights like Tesla and Apple, which had spent most of the year in the red. Their influence within the S&P 500, meanwhile, illustrates the power the group of tech giants have on global markets.
The recent performance of some Magnificent 7 stocks highlights the breadth of the enthusiasm. AI darling Nvidia, which has seen its stock rise steadily since April as sales of its chips boomed and trade policy headwinds eased, remains the biggest gainer of the year. But Tesla, Google parent Alphabet, and Apple have been the biggest contributors to the group's advance in recent weeks after spending a large part of the year in negative territory.
Gains for Tesla's stock, which added a third of its value in September, came as worries about CEO Elon Musk's political activities and slumping sales cooled, and bulls shifted their focus toward the electric vehicle maker's advances in autonomous driving, robotics, and AI.
Alphabet climbed about 15% in September after a major legal win in which a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser. Apple rose close to 10% after signs of surprisingly strong demand for its latest iPhone 17 and inroads with the Trump administration.
All this has many market watchers wondering when the party might end but unwilling to leave just yet. Pictet Asset Management Chief Strategist Luca Paolini on Friday noted the expectation of lower rates and strong corporate profits among reasons to ""see upside in equities despite possible impacts of the US government shutdown.""
Pictet, he wrote, sees ""upside in riskier asset classes in the short term.""

FuriosaAI founder and CEO June Paik said his startup’s architecture can reshape an industry dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). He told Benzinga he is determined to make FuriosaAI the company that powers the transition to sustainable AI, while declining to comment on reports of an $800 million acquisition offer from Meta (NASDAQ:META).
Yet, his message was clear. “We believe Furiosa will have the greatest impact as an independent company,"" Paik said. ""The world urgently needs new, much more energy-efficient ways to run advanced AI. We are committed to building the technology that will bring the benefits of sustainable AI to everyone.”
Paik added that being mission-driven has simplified key strategic choices, guiding Furiosa to remain independent and focused on long-term impact.

The Inherent Inefficiency Nvidia Can’t Fix
Paik sees Nvidia’s market dominance as both formidable and fundamentally vulnerable.
“Nvidia’s greatest strength—a legacy built on general-purpose [graphics processing units]—is also its Achilles’ heel,” he declared.”There is inherent inefficiency and architectural complexity that stems from using a general-purpose GPU architecture for specialized AI computing.""
Paik added, ""GPU makers have developed extremely sophisticated hardware and software workarounds to mitigate these limitations. But their efforts are directed at advancing on their current path, making it difficult for them to pivot to a new paradigm that is uniquely suited to AI.”
FuriosaAI started from first principles in 2017, designing the Tensor Contraction Processor architecture specifically for AI computations. “Our chip architecture, the Tensor Contraction Processor, works at a higher abstraction level,” Paik told Benzinga. “Tensor contraction is the fundamental operation in deep learning, which makes complex optimization problems much more tractable compared to the lower-level matrix multiplication used by GPUs.”
The architectural choice delivers practical advantages. “This means that when new AI models emerge, our compiler can run them efficiently without a massive effort to write hundreds of new, hand-tuned kernels,” Paik said. “It also means our chips minimize wasteful data movement, resulting in breakthrough power efficiency.”"

We’ll explore how this diversification of major AI cloud clients could shape CoreWeave’s investment narrative and outlook.
Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 22 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.
What Is CoreWeave's Investment Narrative?
If you’re considering CoreWeave as an investment, you need to believe in the continued demand for specialized AI cloud infrastructure and the company's ability to land (and deliver on) massive multi-year contracts. The new US$14.2 billion Meta partnership shifts the story in a very real way. CoreWeave has historically been exposed to client concentration, particularly with OpenAI and Microsoft, so this deal immediately reduces one of its highest short-term risks. The agreement also gives the company outsized visibility on future revenues, strengthening a key catalyst for the stock, proving it is an indispensable part of the generative AI supply chain. On the flip side, CoreWeave’s pace of expansion and large debt load heighten execution and financial risks, especially if AI demand doesn't materialize as expected. The recent surge in the share price reflects how materially investors view this shift, but it also raises questions about valuation froth and ongoing volatility. On the other hand, investors should pay close attention to the company’s debt-fueled growth and thin cash runway.
CoreWeave's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 33%. Find out what it's worth.

Eighty-four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community show a wide span, from just US$6 to over US$317 per share. With this diversity in views, recent multi-billion dollar commitments could shift several estimates and highlight the importance of risk management and debt monitoring for anyone holding CoreWeave.

(META) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It","Meta Platforms (META) has received quite a bit of attention from Zacks.com users lately.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this social media company have returned -2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $6.74 per share, indicating a change of +11.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.14 points to a change of +17.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $29.7 indicates a change of +5.6% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)."

DigitalOcean Holdings Investment Narrative Recap
For investors, the core thesis behind DigitalOcean rests on its potential to serve as a central platform for SMBs and digital-native businesses seeking simple, cost-effective cloud and AI infrastructure. The recent launch of its expanded AI Ecosystem and AI Partner Program may accelerate adoption among AI-centric startups, reinforcing DigitalOcean’s relevance, but competition from hyperscale cloud providers is still the most immediate risk to near-term growth and retention. At this point, the news meaningfully supports the short-term growth catalyst of attracting new AI-native workloads, yet keeping customer churn low remains a key challenge.
Among recent company announcements, the strategic partnership with Laravel, powering Laravel VPS through DigitalOcean’s infrastructure, stands out. This move broadens DigitalOcean’s reach into the vast developer community, streamlining user onboarding and increasing the opportunity for deeper integration and customer retention, which directly aligns with the company’s efforts to counter competitive threats and grow its user base.
Yet, in contrast, investors should be aware that persistent Net Dollar Retention below 100% may signal...

Clearly, there is a reason why Apple so often finds itself in the investing spotlight.
What's driving all of this, besides the typical Apple buzz? Recent headlines suggest major shifts in the tech landscape, from Apple redirecting resources to develop cutting-edge smart glasses designed to compete with Meta, to the broader rivalry shaping up around AI and hardware capabilities. News around regulatory pressure and lawsuits, while part of the tech world’s backdrop, hasn’t shaken investor optimism in a noticeable way just yet.
But before getting swept up by the headlines or past performance, it is smart to ask whether Apple’s current share price offers real value. According to our valuation checks, Apple comes in with a value score of 1 out of 6, indicating it only meets one of the usual criteria for being undervalued. In the next section, we will break down these different valuation approaches, and later, share a perspective on valuing Apple that goes beyond all the traditional models.
Apple scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.
Approach 1: Apple Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a valuation method that estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to the present day. Essentially, it asks how much all the future cash that Apple is expected to generate is worth in today's dollars.
For Apple, current Free Cash Flow over the last twelve months stands at $97.1 Billion. Analyst forecasts suggest robust growth in coming years, with projected Free Cash Flow reaching $195.5 Billion by 2030. While analyst estimates are available for the first five years, cash flows beyond that are extrapolated based on recent trends and growth assumptions.
Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, Apple’s DCF calculation arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of $233.22 per share. When compared to Apple’s current share price, the DCF implies the stock is about 10.3% overvalued."

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is rethinking its mixed-reality playbook. Instead of pushing ahead with a cheaper follow-up to its $3,499 Vision Pro headset, the company is now putting its energy into developing AI-powered smart glasses, Bloomberg reported.
The project has Apple engineers working on at least two versions. One pair would link directly to an iPhone and skip having its own display that version could be ready as soon as 2026. The other would include a built-in display, similar to the new Meta (NASDAQ:META) Ray-Ban glasses that just hit shelves.
Apple wants its glasses to be lighter, cheaper, and more approachable than Vision Pro. They'll lean heavily on voice commands, powered by an upgraded Siri expected to roll out next year. The goal is to make the glasses feel natural to use and easier on the wallet compared to Vision Pro's steep entry price.
Meta has already set the tone with its $799 Ray-Ban smart glasses, showing off how AI can be woven into everyday wear. Apple's pivot suggests it's ready to make this the next battleground in consumer tech.
It's important to note that Apple posted diluted EPS of $1.57 in Q3 and $6.59 TTM, averaging EPS expansion at 15.9% annually over the past decade."

She may not have the same name recognition as other tech execs like Tim Cook, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg—not yet, anyway—but Mira Murati is one of the most-watched entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. The former chief technology officer from OpenAI, who left to launch her own AI startup last year, just celebrated a major milestone: Her company, Thinking Machines Lab, just launched its first product this week, called Tinker. Rather than be another generative-AI chatbot like ChatGPT, Tinker is designed to help researchers and developers fine-tune AI models without the need to manage massive computing infrastructure. The launch represents the first commercial product from Thinking Machines, which raised a record-breaking $2 billion in seed funding at a $12 billion valuation.
Murati, the 36-year-old Albanian-American engineer-turned-executive, has emerged as a defining figure in the AI boom. Her journey from a mechanical engineering student to the chief technology officer who helped create ChatGPT exemplifies the rapid transformation of both AI technology and the careers of those building it. More recently, her ability to resist Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive recruitment efforts—including reported billion-dollar offers to acquire her company and poach her talent—has solidified her reputation as a leader willing to chart her own course in an industry dominated by tech giants.
From Albania to the world stage
Born on December 16, 1988, in Vlorë, Albania, during the final years of the country’s totalitarian regime, Murati’s early life was shaped by political upheaval and economic uncertainty. Her parents, both high school teachers who taught literature, encouraged her academic pursuits, but Murati told Microsoft’s CTO Kevin Scott in 2023 that she had an “organic interest towards math and science,” where she excelled in Olympiads and competitions throughout her schooling.
At 16, Murati won a scholarship from United World Colleges—a program that brings together students from over 80 countries to promote intercultural understanding and social responsibility—to study at Pearson College on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. But after graduating from Pearson in 2005, Murati pursued an unusual academic path that would prove prescient for her later career. She enrolled in a dual-degree program, completing a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Colby College in 2011 and a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Dartmouth College’s Thayer School of Engineering in 2012. This combination of liberal arts and engineering disciplines provided her with both analytical thinking skills and technical expertise, which would prove handy in her later roles in Silicon Valley."

One example is CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%), a New Jersey cloud-computing company that has been investing heavily in graphics processing units (GPUs) over the last three years.
Now, the company is getting a new boost after it announced a multibillion-dollar deal with Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), which has been investing heavily in AI to build out its own infrastructure.
CoreWeave stock jumped 13% on the news and is up more than 240% so far in 2025. And for long-term investors, its recent deals make the stock all the more appealing, since they indicate that the company's growth is accelerating quickly.
About CoreWeave
CoreWeave is a New Jersey-based company that got its start in 2017 as a crypto miner. But by 2019 it had changed its name from Atlantic Crypto and leaned into the business of building and offering GPU computing power.
Its been a close partner with Nvidia over the years, even getting a $100 million investment from the semiconductor giant. Nvidia currently holds about 24.3 million shares of the company.
And CoreWeave has benefited in that partnership. It was the first cloud provider to make Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs available, giving it a leg up in attracting businesses that were eager to build and power AI applications.
Nvidia hasn't been the only partner, though. CoreWeave also got a key deal in 2023 with Microsoft, which reportedly agreed to spend potentially billions on AI cloud infrastructure from the company over a period of years.
And CoreWeave recently announced an expansion of its deal with OpenAI, broadening its tie-in with the creator of ChatGPT by $6.5 billion to bring the total agreement to $22.4 billion.
Such deals are helping CoreWeave grow rapidly. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.21 billion, up from $395 million a year ago. The company also narrowed its net loss from $323 million and $1.62 per share to $290.5 million and $0.60 per share.
""We are scaling rapidly as we look to meet the unprecedented demand for AI,"" CEO Michael Intrator said.
The company's revenue is growing quickly, and even though its posting a loss each quarter, I think the financial picture is better than one may think.
That's because the company's funds from operations (FFO) have been solidly consistent in the last year. CoreWeave is posting losses, yes, but once you take out noncash charges like depreciation and amortization, the core business is generating more than $500 million per quarter.
The Meta Platforms deal
CoreWeave's deal with Meta Platforms, the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and others, was disclosed in a filing Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In the filing, CoreWeave said that the $14 billion deal runs through Dec. 14, 2031, and that Meta has the option to expand its commitment for added capacity through 2032.
Meta has committed to spending billions on data centers to build out its AI infrastructure in order to power AI-assisted advertising and content recommendations, as well as its Meta AI chatbot and creative tools. Management has said it plans to spend $114 billion to $118 billion on AI this year, and would spend even more in 2026.
The bottom line
CoreWeave is going through what all tech companies are going through: scaling up the business and spending a lot of money now to make it in the future. And the company is growing fast, going from just three data centers in 2022 to a network of 33 of them today.
It previously issued guidance for third-quarter revenue to be $1.26 billion to $1.30 billion, and full-year revenue between $5.15 billion and $5.35 billion, and analysts at Yahoo! Finance are forecasting 2026 revenue at more than $12 billion.
Those are strong growth numbers, but I would not be surprised at all if CoreWeave exceeded them. The global appetite for AI and GPU computing power is enormous -- and it is one of the few companies that is able to feed the beast."

The jump comes as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 were up 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively.
The artificial intelligence (AI) cloud provider announced on Tuesday that it has signed a major deal with Meta Platforms. The deal will be worth up to $14.2 billion and lasts roughly six years, ending Dec. 14, 2031. Meta does, however, have the option to ""materially expand"" its commitment through 2032 if it so chooses.
CoreWeave shares are also getting a lift from Microsoft's chief technical officer (CTO), who told CNBC at a conference this week that regarding the lack of AI computing capacity, a ""massive crunch is probably an understatement."" Demand remaining white-hot is critical for CoreWeave's growth.
Investors should remain cautious
The opportunity for CoreWeave and other AI infrastructure providers is enormous, but so are the risks. The company already carries a significant debt load and will continually have to borrow more at high rates or dilute its shareholders through stock sales for the foreseeable future. If AI demand lags -- and that is a real possibility that investors need to consider -- CoreWeave will be in serious trouble.
I would stay away from CoreWeave stock."

A good case can be made for artificial intelligence (AI). Since OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, the stock market has enjoyed strong momentum overall. Mega-cap AI stocks led the way, especially Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%).
While these tech titans are still going strong, they haven't been the biggest AI winners in 2025. Three other sizzling-hot AI stocks have skyrocketed over 120% this year.
1. AppLovin
AppLovin (APP 2.01%) makes software and AI solutions for mobile advertising, marketing, and analytics. The company's core AppDiscovery solution helps mobile app developers connect with targeted users. Its MAX product runs an in-app auction that increases monetization of ads displayed in mobile apps. AppLovin's Adjust platform helps advertisers analyze data from their campaigns. Wurl is a connected TV platform that distributes streaming video and helps put content in front of the ideal audiences.
This stock has delivered an impressive gain of more than 120% so far in 2025. Over the last three years, AppLovin's shares have generated a jaw-dropping return of more than 36x.
AppLovin's revenue jumped 77% year over year in the second quarter of 2025 to around $1.3 billion. The company's net income vaulted 164% higher to $820 million.
Can this stock's momentum continue? Maybe, but Wall Street isn't optimistic. The average 12-month price target for AppLovin is roughly 18% below the current share price.
2. CoreWeave
AI hyperscaler CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) conducted its initial public offering (IPO) on March 28, 2025. The company operates a cloud platform that's specifically built for hosting generative AI applications. Nvidia is a major partner with CoreWeave as well as an investor, with the huge GPU maker's stake worth nearly $4 billion at the end of Q2.
CoreWeave's IPO was a big success. The AI stock is up more than 240% after only around six months of trading publicly.
The company's revenue more than tripled year over year in Q2. Although CoreWeave isn't profitable, that's mainly because it's investing heavily in building out additional AI infrastructure to support fast-growing demand.
Analysts don't think CoreWeave stock will move much higher over the next 12 months. However, most of their forecasts came before the company announced a massive $14 billion deal with Meta in late September.
3. Nebius Group
Another AI hyperscaler has been an even bigger winner than CoreWeave in 2025. Nebius Group's (NBIS -1.81%) shares have more than quadrupled year to date. The stock shows few signs of slowing down.
Nebius Group has an interesting history. It was initially known as Yandex, which operates the largest search engine and ride-sharing service in Russia. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the company sold all of its Russian assets and rebranded itself under the Nebius Group name with a focus on AI infrastructure. That looks like a smart move in retrospect, with Nebius' revenue soaring 625% year over year in Q2.
However, operating an AI cloud platform isn't Nebius Group's only business. The company's Avride subsidiary develops autonomous driving technology. Avride is gearing up for a commercial launch of an autonomous ride-hailing service in partnership with Uber Technologies (UBER 0.35%) in Dallas, Texas, later this year. TripleTen, another subsidiary, uses AI to help technology workers improve their skills. In addition, Nebius Group owns stakes in open-source database company ClickHouse and AI data specialist Toloka.
Wall Street analysts appear to be more bullish about Nebius Group than they are about AppLovin and CoreWeave. The consensus 12-month price target among analysts surveyed by S&P Global (SPGI -0.82%) in September reflected an upside potential of around 36%. Five of the six analysts recommended Nebius Group stock as a ""buy"" or a ""strong buy."""

The AI cloud infrastructure company reinvented itself, transitioning from a crypto mining company by repurposing its GPUs to provide AI computing power to customers like Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI.
With the AI boom in full swing, that business model has led to jaw-dropping growth. In its second quarter, its revenue jumped 206% to $1.21 billion, showing how fast demand for its services is ramping up.
Now, CoreWeave just got another shot in the arm as the stock jumped 12% on Tuesday after announcing another blockbuster deal, this time with Meta Platforms (META 1.20%).
What's happening with CoreWeave and Meta?
Meta is committing to spend up to $14.2 billion through 2032 on cloud computing capacity from CoreWeave, with an option to expand its commitment.
The deal comes at a time when Meta has been ramping up its spending on AI, seeing it as a must-win for its future. In June, Meta acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data-labeling start-up, and poached its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to run its new AI lab.
On the same day that the CoreWeave news came out, Meta also announced that it's buying the chip start-up Rivos, which designs chips based on RISC-V architecture, an alternative to those used by leading CPU architecture designers Arm, Intel, and AMD. Rivos is also expected to help Meta build out full-stack AI systems.
For CoreWeave, the deal builds on the earlier momentum it earned when it signed an expanded $6.5 billion agreement with OpenAI in September, bringing its total contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.
The drumbeat of positive news for AI includes rival Nebius's $17 billion deal with Microsoft, Oracle's huge cloud computing forecast, and CoreWeave's own wins, including OpenAI, Meta, and a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia, in which it will buy any of CoreWeave's unused capacity, effectively backstopping the company's growth.
Those news items, and improving sentiment around CoreWeave, sparked a recovery in the stock last month. After falling by more than 50% from its peak in June, CoreWeave jumped more than 50% off its lows early in September.
Is CoreWeave overvalued?
CoreWeave is a challenging stock to value. The company is delivering phenomenal top-line growth, but it's also reporting huge losses. The company's business model is risky. It's borrowing billions of dollars to buy Nvidia GPUs and build out the infrastructure to provide next-generation AI computing.
That high-interest debt has also led CoreWeave to pay significant interest expense, set to be above $1 billion this year, essentially preventing CoreWeave from turning a profit.
For most stocks, to determine an appropriate valuation, you just look at the numbers. However, CoreWeave is in a class of its own. Given its growth rate, in which revenue is still tripling, the upside potential for the stock is tremendous, and conventional cloud computing businesses like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure have shown how profitable cloud computing can be at scale.
Rather than parsing the numbers for CoreWeave to determine whether the stock is overvalued, investors are better off considering the future of the AI boom. If the massive capex buildout continues, including on CoreWeave's infrastructure, the stock is a good bet to be a winner. At a market cap of $66 billion, the stock still has room to move higher.
However, if the AI boom turns into a bubble and spending suddenly slows, CoreWeave is likely to plunge. While it's locked in multi-billion-dollar deals with the likes of Meta, the company will need more of those to turn profitable and justify its current valuation.
Either way, expect the volatility in the stock to continue."

Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.
The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday.
The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015.
But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas.
“Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.”
He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that ""over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.”
Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos.
OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang.
OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose."
finnhub,META,2025-10-02T19:45:00,3 Top AI Stocks to Buy in October,These AI infrastructure and application companies are capturing the next wave of enterprise spending.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=23c15e6c9008f106bb76bde69f244636e1c136ee6cccc497ceafb17f5362cf90,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-top-ai-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-top-ai-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-top-ai-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,fool.com,200,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting from headlines to hard dollars. Enterprises that once ran small pilot projects are now rolling out real deployments, and the capital flowing into related infrastructure, security, and applications is expanding quickly. The focus is moving beyond a handful of chip leaders toward the companies building specialized capacity and real use cases.
October is a key month, with Q3 earnings reports starting and IT budgets locking in for 2026. Three AI stocks stand out: CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%), a GPU cloud provider emerging as a credible alternative to the hyperscalers; Nebius (NBIS -1.81%), an infrastructure dark horse that just secured Microsoft as an anchor client; and SoundHound AI (SOUN 2.66%), a conversational AI platform starting to scale commercial adoption.
Here is a brief overview of these three top AI stocks.
1. The hyperscaler alternative
CoreWeave has become one of the most significant independent providers of GPU cloud power. In September, the company expanded its OpenAI contract by $6.5 billion, which brought total 2025 commitments to about $22.4 billion, and it also signed a $14.2 billion compute deal with Meta Platforms that extends through 2031.
Taken together, the agreements add up to nearly $37 billion in bookings, a remarkable achievement for a company competing directly against Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Unlike those larger cloud providers that package GPUs as just one of many offerings, CoreWeave is dedicated solely to high-performance AI infrastructure.
The decision by OpenAI and Meta to rely on the same independent supplier underscores how limited GPU availability has become. Multiyear contracts of this size give the company unusual visibility into future revenue streams and suggest strong confidence in its ability to deliver.
The obstacles are substantial, including heavy capital demands, the need for rapid expansion, and dependence on a few massive customers. Even so, demand for alternatives to the big three cloud players has already lifted CoreWeave into the center of the AI infrastructure market.
2. From zero to Microsoft partner
Nebius stunned the AI infrastructure world with a multibillion-dollar deal when it secured a $17.4 billion agreement with Microsoft to supply GPU capacity over five years, with the option to expand the total to $19.4 billion. This move transformed Nebius from a little-known player into a direct competitor for large cloud contracts.
Nebius claims it can deliver GPU compute more efficiently, with pricing 20% to 25% below traditional providers, leveraging optimized data center design and power efficiency. If Nebius demonstrates it can scale with Microsoft's specs or secures another large client, Wall Street could rerate its valuation quickly. The terms of the Microsoft deal alone give Nebius a rare valuation bridge to growth peers -- though execution risk looms large in this capital-intensive business.
3. Voice AI hits its moment
SoundHound AI is bringing conversational interfaces into the mainstream. The company reported $42.7 million in revenue for Q2 2025, a 217% increase from the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margin reached 58.4%, while automotive partners such as Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis continue to embed its technology across millions of vehicles. In restaurants, brands like Chipotle and White Castle are already using SoundHound's platform to automate drive-through ordering.
Recurring usage fees and subscriptions provide visibility once deployments are in place, though profitability remains out of reach. SoundHound posted a GAAP net loss of $74.7 million in Q2 and a non-GAAP (adjusted) net loss of $11.9 million.
Still, with a market capitalization of more than $6 billion, investors are valuing the company as a serious mid-cap contender in the AI space. At current growth rates, analysts expect operating leverage to improve and a potential path to breakeven within two years, making SoundHound a leading independent player in conversational AI."

Welcome to Episode #459 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.
Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.
This week, Tracey is going solo to talk about three top big cap stocks that are not in the Magnificent 7. There are many other great companies that are growing their earnings. Look beyond the old technology standbys like Apple and Meta Platforms.
These three companies could even be described as “old economy” as they represent the construction, manufacturing, railroad and retail industries, among others.
Diversify your portfolio away from just seven companies. There are other great companies that deserve a look.
3 Top Stocks That Aren’t the Magnificent 7
1. Fastenal Company (FAST)
Fastenal is a distributor of industrial and construction supplies. Shares of Fastenal are trading near their all-time highs, up 37% over the last year.
It isn’t cheap. Fastenal trades with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 44. A P/E over 30 is often considered expensive. But Fastenal also has growth. Earnings are expected to be up 11% in 2025 and another 10.8% in 2026.
Should Fastenal be on your short list?
2. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B)
Berkshire Hathaway is the conglomerate of old economy companies, including BNSF Railway and Geico insurance. It is led by 95-year-old Warren Buffett. Buffett is retiring from the CEO position at the end of this year.
Shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up just 9% over the last year due to uncertainty now that Buffett is retiring. Shares trade with a forward P/E of 24.8. That’s expensive on a historical basis for Berkshire.
Earnings are expected to fall 7.7% in 2025 but gain 2.2% in 2026.
Should Berkshire Hathaway, one of the trillion-dollar companies, be on your short list?
3. Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)
Costco is a warehouse retailer with stores in North America, Europe and Asia. Costco has been one of the top performing stocks over the last 5 years, gaining 161% compared to just 100% in the S&P 500.
It is not cheap. Costco trades with a forward P/E of 46.6. But the analysts are bullish. Earnings are expected to jump 10.3% in fiscal 2026 and 10.1% in fiscal 2027.
Should Costco be on your short list?

Patil started at the company earlier this week, taking over from co-founder Sam McCandlish, who will move to a new role as chief architect.
As part of the change, Anthropic is updating the structure of its core technical group, bringing the company’s product-engineering team into closer contact with the infrastructure and inference teams. As CTO, Patil will oversee compute, infrastructure, inference, and a variety of other engineering tasks. In the chief architect role, McCandlish will work on pre-training and large-scale model training, extending much of his previous work. Both Patil and McCandlish will report to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei.
This new leadership structure comes as Anthropic faces intense infrastructure competition from AI labs at OpenAI and Meta, which have invested billions into computing infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028, and OpenAI has contracted a similar amount through its work with Oracle and the Stargate project. The scale of Anthropic’s own infrastructure spending is less clear, but there will be immense pressure to optimize the growing infrastructure for both speed and power consumption.
At the same time, the popularity of Anthropic’s Claude products has already put the company’s infrastructure under significant strain. In July, the company introduced new rate limits to Claude Code, with an eye toward power users who had been running the app “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Under the new rules, users are limited to between 240 and 480 hours of Sonnet usage each week, and between 24 and 40 hours of Opus 4 usage, depending on infrastructure strain.
With more than 20 years in different engineering roles, Patil brings significant infrastructure experience to Anthropic. He previously spent five years in technical roles at Stripe and served as a senior VP for cloud infrastructure at Oracle. He has also held engineering roles at Amazon and Microsoft.
In a statement, Amodei emphasized Patil’s experience building stable infrastructure for enterprises. “Rahul brings a proven track record in building and scaling the kind of dependable infrastructure that businesses need,” the statement reads. “I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for strengthening Claude’s position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises.”
In a paired statement, Patil applauded Anthropic’s research and commitment to AI safety. “I’m thrilled to join Anthropic at this pivotal moment in AI development,” Patil said, adding that his work at the company “feels like the most important work I could be doing right now — I personally can’t think of a greater calling and responsibility.”"

Broadcom has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, carving out a strategic niche in the rapidly evolving chip market.
While competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offer off-the-shelf, high-performance GPUs, Broadcom focuses on designing custom AI chips for its hyperscale customers, the tech giants that own and operate the world’s largest data centers.

This approach allows companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to tailor silicon to their exact needs, offering a compelling, often less expensive, alternative to the pricier, general-purpose Nvidia chips.
By helping these key players design their proprietary AI accelerators, Broadcom solidifies its foundational role in the sector, ensuring its technology is deeply integrated into the core infrastructure of the AI revolution.
KeyBanc Capital Markets reinforced this outlook by reiterating its Overweight rating on Broadcom and raising its price forecast to $420 from $400, citing the company’s foundational position in AI and the broader semiconductor supply chain.
Following recent channel checks, analyst John Vinh said that the supply chains of Nvidia and Broadcom “sound the best,” as upward revisions are coming to chip-on-a-wafer-substrate (CoWoS) supply.
Broadcom’s trajectory as a core AI beneficiary is evident in its expanded targets. Its 2026 CoWoS supply goal has climbed to 190,000 units, reflecting an anticipated year-over-year increase exceeding 160%, Vinh noted.
A critical factor in its AI dominance remains control over Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPU franchise through 2026, with volumes expected to more than double.
Additionally, Broadcom has secured significant new AI ASIC orders, including 400,000-500,000 units for OpenAI and roughly 100,000 units for Apple, reinforcing its influence over AI development and production.
Analyst John Vinh raised the price forecast to $420 based on $10.37 fiscal 2026 consolidated earnings per share (EPS).
Price Action: AVGO stock was trading higher by 2.31% to $341.10 at last check Thursday.

Elon Musk has achieved yet another historic milestone, becoming the first person in history to be worth $500 billion, driven by Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rally, SpaceX’s soaring valuations, and the growing value of his AI venture, xAI Holdings.
Musk Crosses The Half-Trillion Mark
On Wednesday afternoon, Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires tracker listed Musk's fortune at $500 billion, putting him $150 billion ahead of Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison.
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg followed in third place with a net worth of $245.8 billion.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
At the time of writing, Forbes pegged his net worth slightly under that at $499.1 billion, still marking the record.
Market commentator The Kobeissi Letter underscored the milestone, writing on X that ""Elon Musk is now worth more than all but 19 public companies in the world.""
For instance, His net worth exceeds the market capitalization of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) at $448.07 billion, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) at $421.25 billion, and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) at $435.83 billion.
Tesla's Role In Musk's Wealth
Tesla shares climbed 3.31% on Wednesday and are up 21.14% year-to-date, propelling Musk's fortune higher, according to Benzinga Pro.
Since Musk announced in April that he would be stepping away from his position as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to focus more on Tesla, the electric vehicle company's stock has almost doubled.
With Tesla's market capitalization now within 10% of its December all-time high, Musk's 12% ownership in the company is valued at $191 billion.

Moreover, while Musk's 2018 compensation package, potentially worth $133 billion, was voided by a Delaware judge in 2024, the board has proposed a new pay plan that could be valued at up to $1 trillion if ambitious performance targets are met.
However, not everyone was impressed by this package. Last month, in his inaugural media interview, Pope Leo XIV condemned the excessive pay packages of corporate leaders, specifically targeting Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan."

finnhub,META,2025-10-02T15:25:06,What Does Meta’s $14.2B CoreWeave Deal Mean for the Stock’s Value in 2025?,"If you have been watching Meta Platforms' stock lately, you are not alone in wondering if now is the time to buy, hold, or cash in.

The company has served up some dramatic price swings, and the only thing that has grown faster than Meta’s share price over the last three years—an eye-popping 419% climb—is the debate around what it’s actually worth right now.
Of course, recent weeks have been a bit bumpier. In the past month, Meta’s stock dipped by 2.4%, and it is down 4.2% over the last week. Some of that may be nerves around heightened regulatory and legal risks, especially after a U.S. judge let lawsuits proceed over Meta’s connection to gambling apps. Meanwhile, there’s also excitement: Meta just inked a deal with CoreWeave for up to $14.2 billion in computing power and is reportedly acquiring chips startup Rivos to advance its AI strategy. Combine that with fresh competition as Apple shifts its focus to smart glasses, and you have a cocktail of innovation and risk reshaping the narrative.
With all these factors swirling, Meta still boasts a value score of 5 out of 6, meaning it is considered undervalued across five key metrics. But how meaningful is that score for people weighing their next move? Let’s break down the main methods investors use to assess whether Meta is truly undervalued, and, as a final thought, we will wrap up with a perspective on valuation that even veteran investors sometimes overlook.
Why Meta Platforms is lagging behind its peers
Approach 1: Meta Platforms Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's value by forecasting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to today’s dollars. For Meta Platforms, this involves starting with its latest free cash flow and projecting how that might grow over time, accounting for both analyst estimates and broader market assumptions.
Currently, Meta’s free cash flow stands at an impressive $57.63 billion. Analyst projections, along with further extrapolation for additional years, anticipate that this figure could rise to $108.58 billion by 2029. Simply Wall St extends forecasts even further, with free cash flow expected to surpass $199.94 billion by 2035. Most of these projections use a two-stage model that balances rapid near-term growth with more gradual gains in later years.
Based on these projections, the estimated intrinsic value per share for Meta is $1,084.17. This figure is notably higher than its current share price, implying a substantial discount of 33.8%. In plain terms, the DCF suggests Meta’s shares are significantly undervalued right now."

Adam Mosseri said he wanted to “set the record straight” on how the photo-sharing app targets adverts to its three billion users.
Tech giant Meta’s social media apps Instagram and Facebook have long been dogged by the myth that they listen to people’s phone microphones to sell adverts, with social media users claiming that products or companies they have mentioned in conversation crop up later as digital adverts. Mr Mosseri said this would be a “gross violation of privacy”.
Mr Mosseri said: “We do not listen to you. We do not use the phone’s microphone to eavesdrop on you.”
Instagram’s chief said there were several reasons ads might appear on the app around the same time they cropped up in conversation.
This could be because the user tapped an advert or searched online for the product, since Meta and other advertisers share data about their audiences across their digital networks.
Adverts can also appear if a user’s friends show an interest in certain products. Mr Mosseri said: “It could be that you were talking to someone about a product, and they had actually looked for or searched for that product. Or that, in general, people with similar interests were doing the exact same thing.”
He also said that sometimes people might see an advert on Instagram and not realise it, before bringing up that product in conversation. “Sometimes you internalise some of that,” he said.
Users might also see adverts about products they have spoken about by random chance – with hundreds of millions of users being served adverts every day. “Random chance, coincidence, it happens,” he said.
Meta has announced plans to use conversations users hold with its AI chatbots to influence what adverts they are shown. The tech giant has flooded its apps with new AI features and chatbots such as its Meta AI tool.
However, Meta said it would not use these conversations to target in Europe or the UK.
Meta does, however, now provide an alternative to targeted adverts on Facebook – launching an option to pay a £3.99 subscription to avoid personalised ads on its social media apps."

- OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion.
- At that level, OpenAI's valuation overtakes that of SpaceX, Elon Musk's rocket and satellite-internet company.
OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever.
The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million.
Why This Matters
OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong.
According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said.
Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said.
OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company.
OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment."
finnhub,META,2025-10-02T14:35:44,OpenAI is the world’s most valuable private company after private stock sale,"OpenAI employees sold $6.6B in shares, leading company's valuation to jump to $500B.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=68ed1e317779b5076619381c6b8e5588ce7225e2f3cfb4616233981e7dcc2de3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-world-most-valuable-private-143544440.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-world-most-valuable-private-143544440.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-world-most-valuable-private-143544440.html,yahoo.com,200,,"OpenAI has sold $6.6 billion in shares held by current and former employees, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said.
The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses.
OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz.
The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership.
The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned.
OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash."

After testing Meta’s new Ray-Ban Display glasses in a New York City demo, the brokerage said the experience highlighted “the key challenges that have prevented smart glasses from mass consumer adoption since Google Glass (2013).”
In particular, Oppenheimer said Meta’s single-eye display “fails to tackle well-known issues that cause eye strain and blurry vision.”
The analysts added that while the Ray-Ban Display introduces novel designs, it is “too early to view [it] as an everyday wearable such as Apple Watch, let alone a potential challenger to smartphones.”
Oppenheimer concluded: “We came away from the demo more confident that Apple’s hardware ecosystem is safe from new AI-enabled smart glasses for the next 2-3 years. It also gives Apple more runway to fine-tune its own smart glasses products.”
The report cited several barriers to adoption, including conflicts with human vision that “result in significant eye strain and blur after staring at the display for more than seconds.”
Oppenheimer said the Ray-Ban Display is best suited for brief glances, not “delivering denser information such as longer text or video.”
The firm also warned of “feature creep,” as Meta AI functions push the glasses to deliver more information than human vision comfortably allows.
While the demo showed early consumer interest, with stock selling out on launch day at the store visited, Oppenheimer’s verdict was clear: “We came away convinced that Ray-Ban Display will remain a niche product.”

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks that caught analysts' attention.
Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, said in a latest program on CNBC that contrary to some reports, several major companies are starting to see real benefits of their AI spending. To prove his point, the analyst gave the example of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).
“Take Meta, for example. They dramatically improved the user and advertiser experience, which pushed revenue per employee up nearly 70% for them. If you do AI right, if you invest aggressively, you can materially improve monetization. And I’m not talking about cutting costs — I mean boosting productivity and revenue per employee. You don’t normally see that.”

Can Meta Shares Rise on the Back of AI Spending?
With daily active users of about 3.48 billion, Meta’s huge edge in the AI race is the data and user base it has access to, which is extremely useful for ads targeting and monetization.
In 2024, digital advertising accounted for about 98% of the company’s total revenue. The business is thriving for now. In the June quarter, price per ad rose 9% year over year, reflecting higher returns for advertisers and a favorable supply and demand balance for Meta.
However, an overall slowdown in digital advertising and huge spending from the company could limit the stock’s upside. Between 2014 and 2019, digital advertising rose about 20% annually, but growth is now expected to slow to 9% per year from 2025 through 2030.
Meta is expected to spend about $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 on capital expenditures to expand its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Unlike hardware chip makers like Nvidia, companies like Meta would need to show actual results from their AI spending to unlock more shareholder value in the short term.
Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the world’s largest social-media company, spanning Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, and its Reality Labs arm pursues next-generation augmented- and virtual-reality hardware. Its Family of Apps averaged 3.4 billion daily active users in March 2025, highlighting the unrivalled scale that underpins its advertising franchise. The company’s AI powered ad-delivery tools are driving higher pricing and better campaign performance, while new initiatives—such as the rollout of ads in WhatsApp—have the potential to unlock fresh revenue streams and are supported by a cash-rich balance-sheet that now includes a quarterly dividend. Shares rose during the quarter after fiscal first-quarter results came in better-than-expected due to strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Additionally, management guided fiscal second-quarter revenue above consensus and trimmed full-year expense guidance even as it lifted capital-expenditure plans to accelerate AI-infrastructure build-out.”"
finnhub,META,2025-10-02T12:15:00,The Stock Market Is Historically Pricey: Here's 1 Reason Meta Platforms Is Still a No-Brainer Buy,Investors should always consider buying shares of overwhelmingly dominant companies in any field.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=318324a9a393ae38da9f1faa24238bd0aae57578cdea7a9e299d96ea5cce9180,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/1-reason-meta-platforms-is-still-a-no-brainer-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/1-reason-meta-platforms-is-still-a-no-brainer-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/1-reason-meta-platforms-is-still-a-no-brainer-buy/,fool.com,200,,"Many stocks, it's safe to say, are expensive by almost any measure right now. That's just what a long-tail, frothy market does to share prices. Yet there are some that are still worth buying even at these high levels. In my view, Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is among these gems, and there's one solid, foundational reason for this view.
Top dog
To me, the No. 1 justification for buying and holding Meta stock is that the company is far and away the No. 1 in its field: social media. It's not only the owner of its cornerstone Facebook site, which boasts billions of users because it's so generalized and useful, but also photo-sharing powerhouse Instagram and popular secure messaging app WhatsApp.
That well-curated collection of major assets keeps the bucks flowing in, so it's no wonder that Meta dwarfs all other social media stocks in terms of revenue. It collected nearly $165 billion on the top line in 2024.
As if that 12-digit figure wasn't enough, the company's outstanding, high-margin performance just keeps attracting investors. These folks have pumped up its market cap sharply of late, to the point where Meta's value stands at nearly $2 trillion. No other peer in its industry even comes close.
More double-digit growth ahead
The elements that made Meta the beast that it is are still very much in place.
Facebook is as populous and busy as it's ever been, and management is skilled at maintaining the site's hard-to-beat advantage of precisely targeted advertising. That's irresistible to companies wanting to reach high-potential audiences of current and would-be customers. Instagram and WhatsApp are also mass-user sites, and therefore also extremely attractive to advertisers.
Analysts, who have been known to underestimate Meta's ability to grow profitability and revenue, continue to expect significant fundamental improvements from the company. Their consensus estimates are revenue growth of 19% this year and 16% next year, and I fully expect the company to beat those estimates. I'm also fully expecting Meta to keep being the hugely profitable powerhouse it is at present."

It was only a matter of time.
Meta (META) will use its aggressive push into AI as another vector to collect information about its users and show them ads targeted to their interests across the giant digital advertising company's social media empire.
Your phone isn't secretly listening to you to sell you stuff, but more of what we do on our devices will be geared toward selling us stuff, as growing numbers of people unintentionally turn the excitement around AI into sprawling real estate for tech giants to craft and show ads.
Meta announced on Wednesday it will use people's AI interactions to personalize content and ad recommendations, starting in December. The things you ask Meta's AI about will be used to infer what you want to see more of, serving as a conduit of attention for Facebook posts and Instagram reels.
This is the logical next step of monetizing AI within Facebook’s ecosystem of social media platforms. It’s easy enough to see how Meta can excel here. All the ways that AI chatbots surpass search engines — relying on conversational language, building a sense of trust or even companionship — invite users to share even more of what they are after, revealing details that people might not otherwise share.
Start chatting with Meta AI about hiking, and you may start getting recommendations for hiking groups, see posts from friends about trails, or get served ads for hiking boots, as Meta explained.
Every digital surface is a potential billboard and a corporate informant.
Zuckerberg may not have been everyone’s top prospect to win the AI contest. But keeping users even more glued to the feed, through AI, would complement his company’s world-conquering attention machine.
But personalized advertising — a pillar of the commercial internet — and algorithmically powered content feeds have drawn increasing backlash in the public imagination. What Meta describes as improving your recommendations, its critics would frame as an extension of sophisticated data surveillance.
Popular critiques of tech platforms, from social, political, and health perspectives, will no doubt gain traction as AI interactions become a larger part of our daily lives and of the data profiles that inform what we see online.
Meta, however, does realize that some conversations should be out of bounds as algorithmic fuel for targeted advertising. When users chat with Meta AI about sensitive topics, including their religious views, sexual orientation, political views, or health, the company says it won't use that material to show them ads."
finnhub,META,2025-10-02T09:20:00,3 Red-Hot Growth Stocks to Buy in 2025,Investing in AI leaders could be a smart move.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=40b60d897fa7b2fee13009445deba3ece96b7bb861ef5320a1d26cd9c601321b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-red-hot-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-red-hot-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-red-hot-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,fool.com,200,,"The market's obsession with artificial intelligence (AI) isn't fading, and the technology could help reshape how businesses operate in the future. As such, it could be a smart move to invest in some of the top companies leading the AI charge.
Let's look at three red-hot growth stocks to buy this year.
1. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) is best known as a networking hardware company, but the bigger story is how it has become the go-to name for custom AI chips.
As companies try to save money on AI computing costs, more and more are turning to Broadcom to help them develop custom chips, called ASICs, that can reduce inference costs. While ASICs are non-programmable, and thus lack the flexibility of graphics processing units (GPUs), they tend to have better performance and more efficiency for the specific task for which they've been designed.
Broadcom scored a huge victory when it helped Alphabet develop its highly successful tensor processing units (TPUs), which now power a lot of its Google Cloud business. This opened the door for more design wins with Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) and TikTok owner ByteDance. Combined, Broadcom believes these three customers have the potential to be a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity by its fiscal 2027.
And the company got even more good news when it announced a fourth customer (largely believed to be OpenAI) has placed a $10 billion order for next year. Add in that Broadcom is also working with Apple on its own custom AI chips, and the opportunity in front of it is just huge.
On top of that, Broadcom's networking gear is also seeing greater demand as data centers need to move huge AI workloads at high speed. In addition, its VMware virtualization business is seeing strong momentum, as enterprise customers are turning to its solutions to help run a hybrid cloud strategy to power their AI workloads.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms has gone from being written off as a slow-growth social media stock to one of the biggest AI winners. The company figured out how to use AI to keep users glued to Instagram and Facebook by feeding them more of the content they want to see, which in turn creates more ad slots to sell. That simple dynamic powered a 22% jump in ad revenue last quarter, driven by both more impressions and higher ad pricing as advertisers get better returns.
The exciting part is that Meta is just beginning to serve ads on WhatsApp and Threads. WhatsApp alone has 3 billion users and is barely monetized today. Threads, meanwhile, is still in its infancy and has a long runway of growth.
At the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not pulling back on big swings, pouring billions into AI talent and infrastructure to build what he calls ""personal superintelligence."" He's also pushing the company into consumer smart glasses and is still building his metaverse. If any of these bets hit, they could move the needle in a big way over the next few years.
The combination of strong current growth together with potential upside from new products is exactly what makes Meta a stock a buy.
3. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) proved with AI that it can still move quickly when it sees a big opportunity. Its early investment and partnership with OpenAI gave it a head start rolling out Copilot AI assistants across its Office suite, and that has turned into a meaningful new revenue stream.
That said, the bigger story is with its cloud computing unit, Azure. Cloud revenue surged 39% last quarter and likely would have been even higher if not for running up against capacity limits. The company has been pouring capital into GPUs and servers to meet that demand, which is helping fuel strong growth. Azure has become the go-to platform for companies that want both the most advanced AI models and newest infrastructure to run their AI workloads on.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's investment in OpenAI continues to give it preferred access to the company's strong AI technology.
With productivity tools that are deeply embedded in the corporate world and a cloud platform that is on the rise, Microsoft is one of the few tech giants that has both sides of the enterprise AI opportunity covered. That combination puts it in a good position to see strong growth both this year and beyond."

2 Great AI Stocks to Buy in October and Hold for 10 Years
Artificial intelligence spending is fueling the Wall Street bull market as big tech bets big on power-hungry AI data centers and beyond. The AI hyperscalers, including Amazon, Meta, and others, are projected to spend roughly $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone. Global data center infrastructure spending is expected to reach $7 trillion by 2030.
There is no end in sight to the wave of AI spending that extends to energy and grid infrastructure because generative AI platforms like ChatGPT use 10X the energy of an average Google search.
The two AI-related stocks we dive into today are not the tech stocks most associated with AI, such as Nvidia. Nonetheless, Constellation Energy and Arista Networks benefit directly from the AI megatrend that’s poised to dominate Wall Street in the back-half of the decade and beyond.
Let’s dive into why investors should buy CEG and ANET now before possible breakouts in October and the fourth quarter. Both AI-boosted stocks are also long-term buy-and-hold candidates.
Nuclear Energy Stock Constellation is a Must-Buy AI Winner
Constellation Energy is at the forefront of the growing relationship between big tech and nuclear energy. CEG earned 20-year power purchase agreements with Microsoft and Meta over the last year to support their AI expansion efforts.
The largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator is ready to transform into one of the energy industry titans of the AI age through Constellation’s $27 billion deal to buy natural gas and geothermal powerhouse Calpine.
CEG’s acquisition, which is expected to close in Q4, creates the largest clean energy firm and expands Constellation’s footprint into power-hungry, tech-heavy Texas and California.
Constellation stock is poised to be one of the most surefire long-term winners in the AI-driven energy age as the U.S. government aims to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and AI hyperscalers go all-in on nuclear and natural gas.
It’s poised to power large swaths of the economy and AI data centers via CEG’s established portfolio of reliable 24/7 power. Constellation is also expanding into next-gen small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), where it competes against pre-revenue home-run stocks such as Oklo.
Constellation raised its dividend by 10% in 2025 and 25% in 2024 as part of a plan to consistently boost its payout to shareholders. The nuclear energy powerhouse is expected to grow its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 9% in 2025 and 27% in 2026."

The deal will furnish Meta with access to Nvidia GB300 NVL72 systems, the very bleeding edge of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.
Meta has been a CoreWeave customer since December 2023, so the new agreement is a clear sign the social media giant is more than satisfied with services rendered in the past. ""They loved our infrastructure in earlier contracts and came back for more,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told Bloomberg.
CoreWeave shares advanced nearly 12% on the news, but most Wall Street analysts still believe the stock is undervalued. Among 29 forecasts, the median target price is $157 per share. That implies 16% upside from the current share price of $136. Read on to learn more about this Nvidia-backed AI stock.
CoreWeave is the technology leader among AI cloud services providers
CoreWeave is part of an emerging class of cloud services providers known as neoclouds, sometimes called GPU clouds. The company offers infrastructure and software services similar to traditional clouds, but its data center infrastructure is specifically designed for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, including training AI models and developing AI applications.
Research firm SemiAnalysis recently ranked CoreWeave as the technology leader in AI cloud services, not only scoring its platform above competing neoclouds like Nebius, but also above traditional clouds like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. The analysts attributed their decision to CoreWeave's technical expertise and unmatched performance, as well as its close relationship with Nvidia.
Specifically, CoreWeave is the only neocloud capable of consistently and reliably operating clusters of 10,000+ GPUs and the company has consistently set performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, standardized tests that evaluate AI systems across training and inference. Analysts wrote, ""CoreWeave is clearly leading in providing the best GPU cloud experience.""
Those qualities, coupled with its close partnership with Nvidia -- which affords CoreWeave early access to the latest GPUs -- have helped the company win major customers like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet, and IBM. Further, CoreWeave recently announced a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia, and it expanded an existing arrangement with OpenAI to bring the total contract value to $22.4 billion.
CoreWeave is growing quickly, but capital expenditures are accelerating
CoreWeave reported tremendous financial results in the second quarter. Revenue soared 207% to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income increased 135% to $200 million. The company also said its revenue backlog increased 86% due to expanded deals with OpenAI and an unnamed hyperscale company.
However, investors should be aware that CoreWeave has taken on a substantial amount of debt. Data center infrastructure is expensive, especially when the infrastructure is built for artificial intelligence. Interest expense on debt consumed more than 20% of revenue in the second quarter, and that figure could increase in the future.
CoreWeave is spending aggressively to expand its data center capacity across the U.S. and Europe in an effort to keep pace with soaring demand. Consequently, management says capital expenditures (capex) will land between $20 billion and $23 billion in 2025, marking a substantial acceleration from $8.7 billion in 2024 and $2.9 billion in 2023.
CoreWeave only takes on debt when customer demand creates a need for more capacity, and only when a signed contract completely covers the cost of the debt. But even under those conditions, Gil Luria at DA Davidson sees a problem. ""Their interest expense is higher than their operating income, which means they aren't generating enough profit to pay their debt holders,"" he told Yahoo Finance.
Having said that, Nvidia evidently has a great deal of confidence in CoreWeave because 91% of its $4.3 billion portfolio is invested in the company. Additionally, Wall Street thinks CoreWeave's revenue will increase at 91% annually through 2027. That makes the current valuation of 15 times sales seem reasonable. Risk-tolerant investors should think about buying a position."

The company is reallocating internal resources in a bid to gain ground in a growing segment of AI-powered wearables that many in the tech industry view as the successor to the smartphone, according to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The delayed headset, code-named N100, was targeted for a 2027 launch with a lighter form factor and lower price point than the current Vision Pro. But Apple recently told teams it is refocusing efforts on two smart glasses projects, aiming to accelerate timelines despite trailing key competitors.
The company’s first model, internally referred to as N50, will not have its own display and is designed to work in tandem with the iPhone. Apple intends to preview this model in 2025, with an anticipated release in 2027, while a display-equipped version originally targeted for 2028 has now been fast-tracked.
Meta, which first launched Ray-Ban Stories in 2021, has since gained traction in the segment with the Ray-Ban Meta, introduced in 2023. Last month, it refreshed its non-display model with longer battery life, improved cameras, and athletic designs, cementing its early lead in wearable AI.
Google, meanwhile, is developing its own AI smart glasses leveraging its Android XR operating system and the Gemini chatbot assistant. Models are expected to release later this year or in 2026 in partnership with eyewear companies including Warby Parker and Gentle Monster.
Even OpenAI is entering the wearable AI space, partnering with former Apple design chief Jony Ive to develop an AI-powered device for market launch.
These developments signal a broader realignment across major tech firms toward wearable devices driven by generative AI, always-on connectivity, and seamless user interfaces. Apple’s decision to pivot signals recognition that the company must adjust course now or risk missing a transformative hardware cycle.
While Apple still heads the high-end mixed-reality market with the Vision Pro, the product’s limitations in portability and affordability have constrained its adoption. Internal hopes are now pinned on AI-infused glasses that could offer a lighter, more scalable entry point for consumers.
By redirecting R&D focus now, Apple is betting that it can regain competitive ground in a race that increasingly favors nimble, AI-focused offerings. The challenge, however, remains steep as Meta continues to expand its lead in this next-generation category."

The iPhone maker had been preparing a cheaper, lighter variant of its headset, code-named N100, for release in 2027, Bloomberg said. But the company told staff internally last week that it is reallocating employees from that project to accelerate work on glasses.
The $3,499 Vision Pro, launched in February 2024 to heavy fanfare, has struggled to sustain momentum amid a thin slate of mainstream content and competition from cheaper devices such as Meta's Quest.
Apple is working on at least two types of smart glasses, the report said. The first, dubbed N50, will pair with an iPhone and lack its own display. Apple aims to unveil the model as soon as next year, ahead of a release in 2027.
The second version, with a display, is planned for 2028, but Apple is now seeking to accelerate development of the product that could challenge the Meta Ray-Ban Display, the report said.
In September, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off the company's first consumer-ready $800 smart glasses with a built-in display and a new wristband controller at Meta's Connect event. Meta also unveiled a new pair of Oakley-branded glasses called Vanguard aimed at athletes.
Apple's glasses will rely heavily on voice interaction and artificial intelligence, the report said.
The company declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.
At its annual product launch event last month, Apple introduced an upgraded line of iPhones, alongside a slimmer iPhone Air.
The event, however, was light on evidence of how Apple — a laggard in the AI race — aims to close the gap with the likes of Google, which showcased the capabilities of its Gemini AI model in its latest flagship phones.

The AI hyperscalers, including Amazon, Meta, and others, are projected to spend roughly $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone. Global data center infrastructure spending is expected to reach $7 trillion by 2030.
There is no end in sight to the wave of AI spending that extends to energy and grid infrastructure because generative AI platforms like ChatGPT use 10X the energy of an average Google search.

Let’s dive into why investors should buy CEG and ANET now before possible breakouts in October and the fourth quarter. Both AI-boosted stocks are also long-term buy-and-hold candidates.
Nuclear Energy Stock Constellation is a Must-Buy AI Winner
Constellation Energy CEG is at the forefront of the growing relationship between big tech and nuclear energy. CEG earned 20-year power purchase agreements with Microsoft and Meta META over the last year to support their AI expansion efforts.
The largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator is ready to transform into one of the energy industry titans of the AI age through Constellation’s $27 billion deal to buy natural gas and geothermal powerhouse Calpine.
CEG’s acquisition, which is expected to close in Q4, creates the largest clean energy firm and expands Constellation’s footprint into power-hungry, tech-heavy Texas and California.
Constellation stock is poised to be one of the most surefire long-term winners in the AI-driven energy age as the U.S. government aims to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and AI hyperscalers go all-in on nuclear and natural gas.

It’s poised to power large swaths of the economy and AI data centers via CEG’s established portfolio of reliable 24/7 power. Constellation is also expanding into next-gen small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), where it competes against pre-revenue home-run stocks such as Oklo.
Constellation raised its dividend by 10% in 2025 and 25% in 2024 as part of a plan to consistently boost its payout to shareholders. The nuclear energy powerhouse is expected to grow its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 9% in 2025 and 27% in 2026."

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the stocks that caught analysts' attention.
Tom Hancock, GMO portfolio manager, said in a recent program on CNBC that Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a relatively safer AI play because of the company’s diversification. However, he said he does not hold “more” AVGO shares because of valuation.
“Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is more diversified and a safer play. AI is not its only business—it does a lot of other things, including software and semiconductors—but within their AI business, it’s much more targeted with custom chips for companies like Alphabet and Meta, focused on proven use cases such as ad targeting or content delivery. We also think their custom silicon, A6, will gain share over more generic GPUs over time. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is relatively well positioned. Our only hesitation around them, and why we don’t hold more, is valuation.”

For the fiscal fourth quarter, AVGO expects $6.2 billion in AI revenue, up 66% from a year earlier. The company said it secured $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer. Many analysts believe this customer is OpenAI. Some media reports said the two companies co-designed a chip that will be launched next year.
What’s Broadcom’s moat? It makes ASIC, chips designed for specific applications and tasks. As major companies look for custom chips to break Nvidia monopoly and lower costs, Broadcom is positioned well to thrive. Many top AI spenders are teaming up with Broadcom to develop these chips, which are expected to be high-margin, high-volume products, potentially driving substantial growth in both revenue and profits.
Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Shares of fellow semiconductor giant Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also outperformed during the quarter, as customer demand for the company’s custom accelerator chips remained insatiable despite the uncertain economic environment. The company is on pace for 10 consecutive quarters of AI-related semiconductor growth and expects continued strong demand persist, due to the sizable AI opportunity. In addition to its dominant market position, the company’s history of strong capital returns to shareholders results in a favorable outlook for a sizable investor base.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Shares of the company closed at $32.53 versus an IPO price of $21. Fermi sold 32.5 million shares after pricing them within a marketed range of $18 to $22.
The trading gave the Amarillo, Texas-based REIT, which was co-founded by former US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, a market value of about $19.3 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. The company’s shares debuted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on Wednesday and are expected to begin trading on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday.
The onset of AI revived interest in companies that produce power, and investors have driven up shares for firms including NRG Energy Inc. and Vistra Corp. on hopes that they’re effective proxies for the booming technology. Fermi is the latest to get a boost, even though it hasn’t generated any revenue since its formation in January.
“There are limited ways to play the AI energy demand angle,” said Morningstar analyst Travis Miller. “Investors are looking for new ways to play this theme when the traditional power producers have already run up.”
Fermi’s “Project Matador” is a development-stage advanced energy and data center campus with more than 5,000 acres of land leased from Texas Tech University. Fermi also refers to the site as the President Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus.
The company hopes to draw data center and hyperscaler tenants and expects to have one gigawatt of power online by the end of next year, according to filings. By 2038, Fermi aims to have up to 11 gigawatts of power to run computing centers on-site through a mix of natural gas, solar energy and nuclear power.
Perry, who was governor of Texas prior to serving in President Donald Trump’s cabinet during his first term, is a director at Fermi. The company had a net loss of $6.37 million from its inception through the end of June, its filings show.
The public listing is a massive windfall for Fermi’s founding team. Perry owns shares worth about $540 million as of Wednesday’s close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In addition, his son Griffin independently controls a $2.4 billion stake."

In January, Jim Cramer said during a program on CNBC that he wanted to own Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares because of the company’s AI capabilities. Cramer said at the time that Meta was using AI to improve its ads business. The stock was trading at around $645 as of Cramer’s comments. As of September 22, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stock price stands at $778, having gained about 30% so far this year.

Individuals who want to live their dream, go to Instagram, start it, start your business, you’ll do well.”
Photo by Mohamed Hadji on Unsplash Can Meta Shares Rise on the Back of AI Spending? With daily active users of about 3.48 billion, Meta’s huge edge in the AI race is the data and user base it has access to, which is extremely useful for ads targeting and monetization. In 2024, digital advertising accounted for about 98% of the company’s total revenue. The business is thriving for now. In the June quarter, price per ad rose 9% year over year, reflecting higher returns for advertisers and a favorable supply and demand balance for Meta. However, an overall slowdown in digital advertising and huge spending from the company could limit the stock’s upside. Between 2014 and 2019, digital advertising rose about 20% annually, but growth is now expected to slow to 9% per year from 2025 through 2030. Meta is expected to spend about $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 on capital expenditures to expand its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Unlike hardware chip makers like Nvidia, companies like Meta would need to show actual results from their AI spending to unlock more shareholder value in the short term.
First Eagle Global Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among other social-media platforms—reported strong revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, driven by increases in both ad impressions and price per ad. The company continued to aggressively invest and hire in AI, even as it develops its core advertising businesses. We believe these results demonstrate Meta’s ability to focus on both profitability and efficiency in conjunction with ongoing investments in the core ad business, the metaverse and other AI applications.”"

So, for investors in such companies it can be worrying when another digital attention-grabber appears on the scene. Particularly when it's competitive in a technology their investments might like to harness for their own gain.
Such a dynamic was affecting Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) on Wednesday. In late-session trading the bellwether social media stock was down more than 2% in price, contrasting unfavorably with the S&P 500 index's 0.4% rise.
Competition for attention
Late Tuesday afternoon OpenAI, the privately held developer of leading artificial intelligence (AI) app ChatGPT, announced the release of its latest AI video generation model. This is Sora 2, which as the name implies is the next generation of its original Sora app.
OpenAI isn't shy to hype its new offering. In its official announcement on the release, the company said of Sora 2 that it ""can do things that are exceptionally difficult -- and in some instances outright impossible -- for prior video generation models.""
ChatGPT is already a popular destination for people online; according to data compiled by Semrush.com, its site had nearly 5.4 billion visits in August. Many of those visits are in the form of text interactions with the system, although Sora is also used by those wanting to create videos. If Sora 2 is as powerful as advertised, it could make ChatGPT even more of an attraction.
Real ambitions for artificial intelligence
That might put a dent in Meta's soaring AI ambitions. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently spoke of the company's hope to develop ""AI Superintelligence,"" among other offerings utilizing the technology. In order to realize these goals, the company is spending billions of dollars on equipment and infrastructure to build out proprietary AI functionalities."

Oct 1 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares slipped Wednesday morning after touching a record $4.5 trillion valuation earlier this week.
The dip followed Meta's (NASDAQ:META) announcement that it will acquire AI chip startup Rivos, a move that underscores the tech giant's ambition to expand its custom silicon program and reduce reliance on Nvidia hardware.
The deal strengthens Meta's MTIA initiative, which launched in 2023 in collaboration with Broadcom. These chips are designed to handle training and inference tasks in Meta's data centers, offering the potential to lower costs and improve efficiency. Meta executives emphasized that bringing Rivos' expertise in AI system design in-house should speed up development.
Despite this push toward independence, Meta continues to invest heavily in Nvidia-powered infrastructure. Just last week, the company struck an agreement worth up to $14.2 billion with CoreWeave, a cloud provider that rents Nvidia-based compute capacity.
Is NVDA Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 53 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA is $214.95 with a high estimate of $389.73 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +14.97% from the current price of $186.96.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for NVIDIA in one year is $320.57, suggesting a upside of +71.46% from the current price of $186.96."

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is reportedly looking to scoop up Rivos, a Santa Clara-based chip startup building processors for AI data centers, according to Bloomberg.
The talks are still early and details remain scarce, but Rivos has been chasing fresh funding at a $2 billion valuation. The company's chips are built on a scalable system-on-chip design meant to handle AI training, inference, and data analytics, and its team includes veterans from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD (NASDAQ:ARM), Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), and Google (GOOGL).
For Meta, the interest makes sense. The company has spent billions buying GPUs hundreds of thousands from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and smaller orders from AMD and expects 2025 capex to top $70 billion. At the same time, Meta is developing its own AI chips to cut reliance on suppliers. Earlier this year, it even tried to buy Korean startup FuriosaAI for about $800 million, though that deal never materialized.
If Meta does move forward, the acquisition would highlight just how serious it is about locking down chip capacity as competition in the AI arms race heats up."

Meta (META, Financials) plans to start using people's conversations with its AI assistant to shape the ads and content they see across Facebook and Instagram, the company said Wednesday.
The update, which takes effect Dec. 16, will draw on user chats with Meta AI the company's generative AI assistant embedded in Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger to refine its recommendation system. Notifications about the change will begin rolling out Oct. 7.
Meta said the shift is part of an effort to better connect its multibillion-dollar investment in artificial intelligence with its main source of revenue: advertising. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that AI will create new opportunities for both paid recommendations and subscriptions.
The company said Meta AI now reaches more than 1 billion monthly users, a figure that includes both the stand-alone app and the assistant built into its other platforms. People can interact with it much like OpenAI's ChatGPT, asking for directions, trip planning help, or image generation.
Meta privacy and data policy manager Christy Harris said the new approach shouldn't come as a surprise. People already assumed that the conversations they have with Meta AI were influencing recommendations, she said. The difference, she added, is that Meta is formally integrating those signals into its ad system.
That means a chat about planning a family vacation could later shape which Reels appear in someone's feed, or trigger hotel ads across Meta's platforms. Interactions made through Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses will also feed into recommendations.
Users will not be able to opt out, though Meta said the change won't apply to people who don't engage with the AI. The company said it will launch the update in the U.K. and EU later, following regulatory reviews."

The company is working with Intel INTC to make the new protection feature run directly on Intel Core Ultra processors. This allows the tool to work in real time and keeps data on the device instead of sending it to the cloud.
The feature checks both video and audio for signs of fake content. It builds on Norton Genie Scam Protection, which already covers email, text, and web scams. Moreover, the tool supports YouTube and Facebook videos, with more platforms coming later. It is now available in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand as part of Norton 360.
Continuous new feature additions to Norton 360 demonstrate the company’s focus on dealing with new AI scams that are harder to detect. By offering protection directly on AI PCs, the company may attract more customers to Norton 360 and keep existing ones from leaving. Over time, this could help Gen Digital grow subscription sales and improve customer trust.
For Gen Digital, the move shows its focus on using AI to keep up with new kinds of threats. By working with Intel, GEN is also tying its products more closely to the next wave of AI-powered PCs. With scams using AI becoming harder to catch, this new feature is aimed at giving people more confidence when browsing or watching content online.
GEN Expands AI PC Partnerships With Qualcomm and AMD
Gen Digital is not limiting its deepfake protection push to Intel chips alone. Gen Digital is extending its Norton protection features beyond Intel systems to cover more of the growing AI PC market.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Gen Digital announced that its scam detection features are already active on Windows AI PCs powered by QUALCOMM QCOM Snapdragon X chips. This means users on QUALCOMM’s Snapdragon-based devices can already access real-time scam alerts directly on their PCs without relying on cloud processing.
GEN Digital also confirmed that support for Advanced Micro Devices AMD will follow later this year, expanding coverage to more AI PC users. By working with Intel, Qualcomm, and Advanced Micro Devices, Gen Digital is making sure Norton 360 protection is available across the leading processor platforms.
This broad approach could help GEN reach a larger customer base as adoption of AI PCs increases. It also positions Norton as a standard security layer for users looking for reliable on-device protection against scams and deepfakes, regardless of which chip brand powers their devices. Moreover, the partnerships with Qualcomm and AMD expand its market reach, add flexibility for customers, and strengthen its long-term growth opportunity in both cyber safety and financial wellness."

Nearly half of the analysts covering CoreWeave now have buy-equivalent ratings after at least three raised their recommendations in September. It’s a stark shift from mid-July, when less than 20% of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommended buying the stock.
The improving sentiment follows recent agreements with companies including OpenAI that quelled fears CoreWeave was too beholden to Microsoft Corp., which accounted for more than 70% of its revenue at the end of June. On Tuesday, CoreWeave said it will provide Meta Platforms Inc. with as much as $14.2 billion worth of computing power. The news sent the stock soaring, capping its best month since June with a gain of 33%.
“The Street is finally seeing the stickiness and the demand story when it comes to CoreWeave,” said Tejas Dessai, director of thematic research at Global X ETFs, which holds CoreWeave shares. “Once you get these data centers up and running, of course the demand exists, and then the infrastructure in terms of using AI compute services can be a very attractive business.”
Since its initial public offering in March that was propped up by long-time backer Nvidia Corp., CoreWeave has been one of the most controversial stocks on Wall Street. Bulls see a new breed of computing services provider that is poised to win more business as spending on AI continues to climb. For bears, it’s a cash-burning trap that’s destined to end badly when demand eventually slows.
CoreWeave shares have gained more than 230% since their debut but remain down 27% from a June peak when the market capitalization of the Livingston, New Jersey-based company briefly exceeded $88 billion. The stock fell 1.9% at 10:05 a.m. in New York trading on Wednesday.
The shares have considerable upside even after September’s run up, with strong demand expected to translate into future profits, Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note on Tuesday initiating coverage of CoreWeave with an outperform rating. The analysts’ 12-month price target is $175, implying potential for a gain of more than 25% from Tuesday’s closing price."

Earlier this month, CoreWeave announced a similar deal with OpenAI and revealed a revenue guarantee from Nvidia for up to $6.3 billion. It's been a successful month for the high-growth data center company and a great six months for CoreWeave investors. Since the company IPO's in late March, its stock is up nearly 250%.
This is what a $10,000 investment in CoreWeave stock would be worth now
So just how much would you have if you'd invested $10,000 in CoreWeave stock when it IPO'd? The 242% gain through Sept. 30 would have turned $10,000 into $34,200. Not bad.
CoreWeave is attempting to thread a needle
Despite the flashy numbers and the impressive chart, I would caution investors from getting swept away in the excitement. CoreWeave is very new to the public markets and its growth is built on a rocky foundation. The company's growth is being fueled by expensive debt. It is walking a tightrope as it must expand capacity at a lightning pace in order not to fall short of what it is promising clients, but if it expands too quickly or AI demand sags -- a possibility that shouldn't be taken ignored -- CoreWeave could find itself in very hot water."

The company will update its privacy policy by December 16 to reflect the change, and will notify users in the coming days. The new policy applies globally, except for users in South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, where privacy laws prevent this type of data collection.
Meta’s core business has long relied on building detailed profiles of Facebook and Instagram users to sell hyper-targeted ads. The company offers advertisers a way to reach specific demographics and user groups. Now, Meta will also use data from conversations with its AI chatbot to build out those profiles, giving it another powerful signal to target its ads.
The social media giant already has lots of information about its users, but Meta AI has created a rich new stream of information. The company says more than a billion people chat with Meta AI every month, and it’s common for users to hold long, detailed conversations with the AI chatbot. So far, Meta has largely given away its AI products for free, but now the company can improve its valuable ad products based on the data it collects.
If a user chats with Meta AI about hiking, for example, the company may show ads for hiking gear. However, Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez tells TechCrunch that the privacy update is broader than just Meta AI, and applies to the company’s other AI offerings.
That means Meta may use data from AI features in its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses — including voice recordings, pictures, and videos analyzed with AI — to further target its ad products. Meta may also use data from its new AI-video feed, Vibes, and its AI image generation product, Imagine.
Conversations with Meta AI will only influence ads on Facebook and Instagram if a user is logged into the same account across products.
There is no way to opt out, according to Meta.
The privacy changes are another reminder that free products from Big Tech companies often come with strings attached. Many tech companies already use AI interactions to train their models. Meta, for instance, trains on voice recordings, photos, and videos analyzed through Meta AI on its smart glasses. Now it will also feed that data into its ad machine.
In a briefing with reporters, Meta privacy policy manager Christy Harris said the company is still in the process of building out systems that will use AI interactions to improve its ad products. However, the company says user conversations with AI around sensitive topics — including religious views, sexual orientation, political views, health, racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership — will not be used to show them ads."

The documentary was also sponsored by Anaconda, Dropbox, Meta and Quansight.
The documentary was produced by CultRepo, a fully independent production company committed to telling the human stories behind technology. The documentary features interviews with Python’s core contributors, including creator Guido van Rossum, longtime developer Raymond Hettinger, and Travis Oliphant, Chief AI Architect and Founder of OpenTeams and NumPy creator.
The full documentary is now available to watch for free on YouTube.
To showcase the film and bring together the open source community, OpenTeams hosted two invitation-only premiere screenings in Austin, TX, and London, UK. Each event brought together members of the open-source community, engineers, clients and partners. The screenings also included Q&As with Oliphant, offering a unique opportunity to hear firsthand reflections on the history and future of computing.
""Python was born from the open source technology community; software engineers who worked together, shared ideas and built upon each other’s success to create a new, easier way to code,"" said Oliphant. ""As AI development and adoption continue to accelerate, it is critical to remember the human stories that make it all possible.

Facebook's parent company has posted excellent financial results this year and has been rewarded with an outstanding performance on the stock market.
Meta's work in artificial intelligence (AI) has played a significant role in this result. The company is implementing AI-powered initiatives that are improving its core business -- advertising. It is helping businesses streamline the ad process while increasing engagement on its platforms, all thanks to AI.
However, Meta Platforms' AI prospects extend well beyond the impact it is already having -- and should continue to have -- on its advertising revenue. Here's one underrated AI opportunity investors should keep in mind.
The ""ideal form factor for AI""
How will people interact with AI in their day-to-day lives? Smartphones already have many AI-powered functionalities, but Meta Platforms' CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, thinks there is an even better option: AI glasses. In Zuckerberg's own words: ""I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day, hear what you hear, talk to you.""
Zuckerberg may have a point. AI chatbots can do a lot, but they can't interact with the world around us in real time. AI glasses can offer the best of both worlds: real-time interaction with day-to-day activities, thanks to cameras and microphones, along with a vast library of knowledge, intelligent responses, and analysis capabilities similar to those of ChatGPT. It's like having an extra pair of eyes, ears, and a brain. Meta Platforms is doubling down on this potential opportunity.
The tech leader has an established partnership with EssilorLuxottica (ESLOY -0.47%), the eyewear company behind renowned brands such as Oakley and Ray-Ban. Meta Platforms owns a minority stake in the stock. Meta Platforms has launched AI glasses under both brands, and the data shows that they are experiencing soaring demand. EssilorLuxottica noted that in the first six months of 2025, sales of Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses increased by more than 200% year over year.
What does this mean for investors?
That said, these glasses still make up only a tiny percentage of Meta Platforms' sales. In the second quarter, the company's advertising revenue of $46.6 billion accounted for 98% of Meta's total revenue. Nevertheless, there could be a meaningful opportunity here. As of early 2025, Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses had sold over two million units since their launch in October 2023, with plans to ramp up production to sell 10 million units per year.
That's a minuscule number considering that more than a billion people worldwide wear glasses. And if glasses are the ideal form factor for AI and become the norm within 10 years (Zuckerberg's prediction), perhaps even those who don't currently wear them will eventually have to do so. This is something else Zuckerberg has argued, namely that people without AI glasses will be at a cognitive disadvantage in the future.
If this is correct, then Meta Platforms' work in this area will eventually prove to be a growth driver as sales ramp up significantly. And Meta is already in a great position to benefit. It has been a pioneer in this field, having invested a substantial amount in its AI strategy, partnered with a leading eyewear company, and launched glasses under the umbrella of a popular brand or two. Of course, Meta Platforms' prospects go well beyond its eyewear ambitions.
The company should continue benefiting from AI, as the technology has a positive impact on every aspect of its business. Meta Platforms aims to automate the ad launch process completely by next year, an initiative that could boost ad demand within its ecosystem and increase top-line growth. Meta Platforms also has other growth opportunities, such as business messaging on WhatsApp, as well as an ecosystem that is second to none among social media specialists. The company's overall prospects look bright.
Meta Platforms' AI glasses strategy, though, deserves a little more attention, in my view. Investors should pay close attention to how that side of the business evolves in the next five years."

Is AI a bubble about to burst? Well, many analysts are still saying AI is a strong buy.
Yes, valuations have risen to sky high levels and questions are growing as many AI software stocks have started showing some cracks in recent weeks.
But the huge demand for AI infrastructure is only set to grow further. That's according to many bulls, including analysts at City and Jeffries.
City Group is out with a new forecast saying Big Tech's AI spending is not slowing down anytime soon.
They now see infrastructure spending climbing past $2.8 trillion by 2029.
That's half a trillion more than they were estimating just a few months ago. Why?
Hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are racing to build data centers and secure more compute power with AI capital expenditures projected projected to hit $490 billion by 2026 alone.
And almost every company in the world right now is looking into how to embed AI tools into their operations.
Also, keep in mind that nations around the world from the US to China to Europe are all investing to be more self-sufficient in AI infrastructure.
Just today, the US and Taiwan are negotiating over who should be building more chips.
So, what are the companies that are set to keep growing?
Brent Thill from Jeffries shared his view with Josh Lipton here on Yahoo Finance.
I think the application names that, you know, Salesforce, Adobe, those names, investors are re-underway. They see these open AI demos they just launched about customer care or doing digital signatures and you you start to see what OpenAI is saying, what Sam Altman's saying about wanting to get into SAS or software as a service.
I think that's freaking everyone out. So, you're seeing a lot of money, you're seeing names like Hubspot down 10% today, Braze down 10, Docusign down 11% in one day on the fear of Open AI entering the application game.
It doesn't matter what happens with AI, they're going to need infrastructure. OpenAI is going to need Microsoft, Oracle, Core Weve. And so, I think this the conversation we're having with our clients is the application names are under duress and I don't think it's as bad as the stocks are are telling you, but no one wants to be there right now because there is no S-curve.
So software's kind of a tale of two cities. One side, you know, um, there's zombies and in in trash and in a crazy amount of debris floating in the air and that's in the apps category.
And then on the infrastructure side, it's like the sun's out, you know, temperature's perfect, and everyone wants to be there. And I I'm a little that that's been our our view to stay stay overweight in infrastructure.
I think that trade lasts till 26 before we see money shift back to the broader software coverage. But right now, it's, um, you know, my group continues to underperform semis, AI infrastructure. And and so I think investors will come back to these names at some at some point when they see an S-curve or an inflection in in AI revenue. We don't see that yet in the application names yet.
Brent, since you mentioned Core Weve and I have you here, I want to ask you that they did ink this $14 billion meta deal. I want to get your thoughts on that headline, Brent. And also just you also cover meta.
Whether you have any concerns, Brent, that you have these hyper scalers maybe becoming, are they becoming too relying on kind of one key AI infrastructure name, Brent?
For many that know Meta's infrastructure, they would characterize them as one of the best builders on the planet of data center infrastructure.
And the fact that they would go to Core Weve tells you how good Core Weve is.
And that's all you need to know. Like, Meta can't even keep up with their own plans to build their own infrastructure, and they need to go to Core Weve to help them build that infrastructure.
Same thing, Microsoft, Core Weve, you've heard Google talk. So, all the hyper scalers, all the consumer grade, you know, standout leaders in internet are all turning to Core Weve because they can't make their plans for AI deployments without the help of Core Weve.
And they are considered kind of the master luxury builder if you will of AI.
And many ask, you know, how how long this is going to last, like what's Core Weve's competitive advantage. And over time, I think Core Weve's going to look a lot like Amazon AWS, which is it was the infrastructure to begin with, and then it becomes a software story. and AWS is a giant software story. I think if Core Weve
can pull this off. I said this when Palenteer went public. Like, if Palenteer can go from selling really high-end, you know, was like Tesla, selling really high-end cars to then selling cars that nurses, doctors, you know, can drive, the mass market can drive, then then we're in a great spot. I think Core Weve can get to the mass market over time.
But right now they're winning the best builders in in AI and and and as long as these contracts keep coming and we think they are, you know, stock's going to keep going higher."
finnhub,META,2025-10-01T09:30:00,This ETF Has Beaten Every Stock in the Magnificent Seven This Year. Is It Too Late to Buy?,This semiconductor ETF has been an overlooked champ.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4f15f790c8378ed52c410bd25890d55f1e53d0eae62d5a1f6b49e46c71da4fa3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,fool.com,200,,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" has been driving the AI boom ever since its earliest days.
The group of seven stocks, which includes seven of the most valuable stocks on the market -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- all have some exposure to AI and are seen as the leading technological companies.
However, after driving the stock market rally through 2023 and 2024, the Magnificent Seven's performance has been more pedestrian this year. In fact, three of the seven have underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
A basket of all seven of those stocks would have gained 17.5% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 through Sept. 26, which was up 13%. That's a solid return, and investors can get exposure to the Magnificent Seven through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF.
However, there's one ETF that has not only nearly doubled the return of the Magnificent Seven this year, it's beaten every stock in the elite group through Sept. 26. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH 2.50%), which is up 33.2% year to date, and has a long track record of outperforming the S&P 500.
Meet the VanEck Semiconductor ETF
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF aims to replicate the MVIS U.S.-listed Semiconductor 25 Index, and like the Magnificent Seven, its biggest holdings have significant exposure to AI. These are the top 10 stocks in the ETF.
| Stock | % of ETF |
|---|---|
| Nvidia | 21.8% |
| Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) | 10.6% |
| Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) | 9.5% |
| Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) | 6% |
| Lam Research | 4.4% |
| Analog Devices | 4.4% |
| ASML | 4.2% |
| Micron Technology | 4.1% |
| Texas Instruments | 4.1% |
| Qualcomm | 4.1% |
Nearly 40% of the value of the ETF comes from Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom, three stocks that have been top performers in the AI boom. Notably, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has also outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF because the SMH's holdings are more concentrated in those three leading stocks.
While the Magnificent Seven might hold better-known stocks like Apple and Tesla, semiconductor companies have seen their business soar during the AI boom as they are providing the core computing power to make AI applications work. They form the building blocks of the AI revolution, and should as long as the data center buildout phase continues, with companies like Oracle pledging to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure.
Is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF still a buy?
The VanEck SMH ETF is not only outperforming the S&P 500 this year, but it has a long track record of delivering superior returns. Since its inception in 2011, the fund has gained more than 2,000%, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $200,000 and trouncing the S&P 500 along the way, which is up by less than 600% during that time.
Looking at its valuation, the SMH ETF isn't cheap, but it's not as expensive as you might think. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39, which is much cheaper than popular AI stocks like Tesla or Palantir Technologies, and is only moderately more expensive than the S&P 500 at a P/E of 28. Meanwhile, some of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top holdings, like Taiwan Semiconductor, still look cheap considering its growth rate.
Given its exposure to the top chip and AI stocks and its diversification across the industry, the SMH ETF still looks like a strong buy. Over the long term, the fund looks like a good bet to continue to outperform the S&P 500, and given the massive capex spending in AI, it has an edge over the Magnificent Seven group as well."
finnhub,META,2025-10-01T09:15:00,"There's a Bubble Forming in the Stock Market, but It's Not in Artificial Intelligence (AI). History Says This Happens Next.",Some parts of the market are looking pretty frothy.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3aa937fbb9771492e8c7109d36422e0afab6465fb228bcd33338f50dcac5149f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/theres-a-bubble-forming-in-the-stock-market-but-it/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/theres-a-bubble-forming-in-the-stock-market-but-it/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/theres-a-bubble-forming-in-the-stock-market-but-it/,fool.com,200,,"It's been nearly three years since ChatGPT was launched, and stocks have been rallying at breakneck speed ever since.
Since the start of 2023, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) is up a whopping 73%, and even a brief plunge on tariff concerns hasn't been able to slow it down. Paced by the so-called Magnificent Seven, the broad market index has soared as AI-driven growth has fueled stocks like Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft.
There is some evidence that a bubble could be forming in the S&P 500. After all, the index is unusually expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and the CAPE ratio, which adjusts for inflation, is even more expensive. The so-called Buffett indicator, a ratio of the S&P 500's market cap to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is also at an all-time high.
However, the AI stocks leading this charge aren't as expensive as you might think. The chart below shows five of the leading AI stocks.
Although none of those stocks are cheap, they are mostly in line with the S&P 500, and all are delivering double-digit percentage growth. Nvidia, which is the most expensive of the group, is also the fastest growing, and its revenue is forecast to grow by 56% in its next quarterly report.
Where the bubble is forming
Rather than in large-cap stocks, the bubble forming in the stock market appears to be happening in zero-revenue, emerging technology stocks, and it's reminiscent of earlier stock market bubbles.
For example, in the dot-com era, droves of small internet companies went public with little or no revenue and unproven business models. That helped hasten the bust in 2000.
During the pandemic era, we saw a similar phenomenon with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), nearly all of which crashed or went bankrupt, even though they generally had successful debuts.
Other emerging technology stocks with little revenue, like electric vehicles, mostly went bankrupt or crashed in that era. Even the higher-profile newcomers like Rivian and Lucid lost more than 90% of their value.
This time around, there are a number of emerging sectors that are demonstrating similar trends. For example, modular nuclear reactor company Oklo (OKLO -1.34%) has jumped 1,200% during the past year even though the company has no revenue and doesn't expect to generate revenue until at least late 2027. It is currently attempting to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and has not sold a purchase agreement yet. Oklo currently has a market cap of almost $17 billion.
Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are another sector that has gotten frothy despite minimal revenue. Archer Aviation (ACHR -0.08%), which also has no revenue, currently trades at a market cap of $6 billion.
Finally, quantum computing stocks have soared this year, even though that sector is still producing little or no revenue. One stock, Quantum Computing (QUBT -2.46%), is up nearly 3,000% during the past year and its market cap has reached $3.7 billion, though it expects to generate less than $1 million in revenue this year.
What it means for investors
Investor enthusiasm for AI stocks seems to have carried over to emerging technology sectors that are unproven, much as it did in the dot-com era and during the pandemic.
Although companies like Oklo and Archer Aviation have potential, their current valuations don't seem to factor in the downside risk in the stock. It's likely to take years to build significant revenue, and even if they get there, that's not a guarantee of success.
In the current stock market, any of these stocks could crash if investor sentiment starts to shift. For the businesses to grow into their valuations without a major pullback seems unlikely."
finnhub,META,2025-10-01T08:07:00,"2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in October","A fresh corporate earnings season is about to begin, and all eyes are on the ""Magnificent Seven.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=aa9096576b4735b84c45ed06e4ef3db80c7f273a4b73365a41424976f72d15dc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/2-magnificent-seven-stocks-buy-hand-fist-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/2-magnificent-seven-stocks-buy-hand-fist-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/2-magnificent-seven-stocks-buy-hand-fist-october/,fool.com,200,,"In October, corporate America will start reporting its financial results for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Wall Street will be laser-focused on the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, which tend to grow faster than the rest of the market thanks to powerful trends like artificial intelligence (AI).
The Magnificent Seven stocks include:
Meta Platforms and Alphabet (Google) are heading into this earnings season with significant momentum across their various businesses, mostly thanks to AI. They also happen to be the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks by one traditional valuation metric, making them a great value for investors.
Here's why they might be great buys in October (and beyond).
The case for Meta Platforms
Over 3.4 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every single day, which include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Meta generates most of its revenue by showing ads to those users, so the longer they stay online, the more money the company makes.
Meta uses AI in its recommendation algorithms to learn what type of content each user likes to see, so it can show them more of it. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), this strategy drove a 6% increase in the amount of time users were spending on Instagram compared to the year-ago period, and a 5% increase for Facebook.
Meta has applied a similar AI-powered strategy to its ad-recommendation engine to target users more accurately, which is driving a modest increase in conversions. This allows the company to charge a higher price per ad, because businesses are getting a greater return on their investment.
Meta is also using AI to power new features like its Meta AI chatbot, which launched in late 2023 and already has over a billion monthly active users. It's powered by the company's Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which rival some of the best models from leading start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic. As Meta AI's capabilities expand, it's likely to become a major tailwind for engagement.
Meta's revenue increased by 22% during the second quarter, accelerating from its first-quarter result of 16%. In other words, better engagement and higher ad conversions are driving significant momentum in its business. According to Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street now expects the company to generate $196.1 billion in revenue for the whole of 2025, with earnings of $28.15 per share. Both figures would be record highs.
Meta stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.9 as I write this, making it the second-cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. As a result, there might be plenty of room for upside from here.
The case for Alphabet
When AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT went mainstream in 2023, investors were worried they would take traffic away from traditional internet search engines because they gave consumers a faster and more convenient way to access information. That would have spelled bad news for Alphabet, because Google Search accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue.
Alphabet met those concerns with innovation, developing its own AI models called Gemini, along with a chatbot with the same name. The Gemini models power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to provide holistic answers to search queries. These responses appear above the traditional search results, so users no longer have to sift through web pages to find the information they need.
Overviews strike a good balance between the traditional Google Search experience, and the convenience provided by AI chatbots. As a result, Alphabet said more than 2 billion people were using them at the end of the second quarter, and since they monetize at a similar rate to traditional Google Search results, they aren't hurting the company's valuable core business.
Finally, Google Cloud deserves a special mention because it has become a key part of Alphabet's AI strategy. It provides computing power from state-of-the-art centralized data centers, in addition to an expanding list of ready-made LLMs from top third-party developers. These are the main two ingredients required to develop AI software, which is why nearly all AI unicorns (start-ups worth $1 billion or more) are using Google Cloud in some capacity.
Google Cloud's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 32% during the second quarter. That momentum is likely to continue because the platform's order backlog climbed at an even faster rate of 38%, reaching a whopping $106 billion, which will be converted into revenue as Alphabet brings more data centers online.
Alphabet stock has soared by 48% over the past year, yet its P/E ratio is still just 26.2 which makes it the cheapest member of the Magnificent Seven. Considering the company's resounding success in the AI space so far, I think its stock could be destined for much higher ground."

One of the easiest ways to miss out on outsized gains is to lack the conviction needed to hold stocks through periods of volatility.
All of today's top companies have undergone multiple brutal drawdowns. It's easy to forget that just a few years ago, in 2022, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%), and Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) all saw their stock prices fall over 40% from all-time highs. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia stock is trading up more than 1,100%, Meta is up over 500%, and Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet have all crushed the comparable performance of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%).
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can make it easier to hold volatile growth stocks through steep downturns because of their diversification. Here's what makes the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG 0.63%), the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI 1.98%), and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ 1.49%) top AI ETFs to buy now.
1. Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF
The Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF invests in the top 10% of S&P 500 companies by market cap. Many of the most valuable U.S. companies are growth and AI-focused names. The ETF has a staggering 62% invested in the ""Ten Titans"" -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix.
The Ten Titans make up 39% of the S&P 500, which is already a lot. But this ETF takes that concentration a step further.
The fund is a particularly good buy for investors who believe that the largest companies by market cap will benefit the most from AI.
The fund's expense ratio of 0.2% is higher than some passively managed ETFs, but it's still reasonable for investors looking for a simple way to bet on today's existing winners.
2. iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF
With a net expense ratio of 0.55%, this fund is considerably more expensive than the 0.03% expense ratio found in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.
Unlike most passively managed funds, this active ETF isn't market-cap weighted. So its weights are based more on conviction than the value of the company.
Oracle's 5% weighting is nearly as high as Microsoft's 5.7%. Oracle could become the largest cloud purpose-built for AI within the next five years. And Broadcom is at 8.4%, right behind Nvidia at 9.2%.
The fund is very new, having launched less than a year ago in October 2024. So investors should only approach the ETF after doing more research on its holdings and the strategy employed by its active managers.
3. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF
This ETF is ideally suited for investors looking to build an AI portfolio around U.S. companies while also gaining significant exposure to international leaders. Around 31% of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is invested in non-U.S. companies. Alibaba Group, Samsung Electronics, Tencent, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all top-10 holdings in the fund. And you won't find any of these companies in the S&P 500 because they are non-U.S. firms.
Another unique characteristic of this fund is that it isn't top-heavy. No holding makes up more than 4%, which is a stark contrast to the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF, which has over a third of the fund invested in just five stocks.
In this vein, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is a good fit for investors looking for a diversified and global approach to the AI theme. The ETF features an ""unconstrained approach,"" which targets established and up-and-coming innovative companies without regard to stock market sector or geography. Its 0.68% expense ratio isn't cheap, but it could be worth it for investors looking for high growth potential.
Bold bets for risk-tolerant investors
These ETFs are likely to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years if investor appetite for tech-focused companies and AI names remains positive. But eventually, companies will need to convert capital expenditures (capex) into returns. We are still in the early innings of the AI build-out, with droves of data centers coming online in the next few years. But demand for those data centers depends on the usage of AI models by end users.
Agentic AI presents an opportunity to further integrate AI into regular business functions by helping with task completion and organization. And edge AI involves running algorithms directly on devices rather than depending on the cloud.
Despite the long-term potential of AI, there are plenty of reasons why the discussed ETFs could disappoint. A cyclical downturn for factors unforeseen could challenge the lofty valuations of companies that are priced for perfection. Or simply a pullback in capex spending after an initial ramp-up.
In this vein, investors need to consider the risks associated with allocating to AI names through individual holdings and ETFs. Investors should only approach AI-focused ETFs if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term investment time horizon, and if the strategy aligns with their existing holdings and investment objectives."

Chicago, IL – October 1, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Meta Platforms META.
Will Amazon Keep Rebounding This Year?
On the surface, the price performance of Amazon stock has been very respectable. After all, AMZN is only 9% from a 52-week and all-time high of $242 a share (post-split basis).
That said, the rebound in AMZN has been subpar after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs rattled the broader market earlier in the year.
Rebounding +15% in the last six months, Amazon stock is now virtually flat in 2025, being the worst performer out of its ""Mag 7"" big tech peers, just behind Apple’s YTD gains of over +1% with Nvidia’s +35% leading the way.
Keeping this in mind, investors may be wondering if Amazon stock is being overlooked at the moment and if AMZN will keep rebounding.
AI is Streamlining Amazon’s Businesses
As illustrated by the price, consensus, and surprise chart above, Amazon has now exceeded EPS expectations for 11 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, Amazon has posted a very impressive average EPS surprise of 22.98% in its last four quarterly reports.
Most appealing and correlating with this exceptional operational performance is that Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence in nearly every facet of its business, as depicted below.
1. Enhancing Customer Experience
Amazon has integrated generative AI into Alexa, making interactions more natural and context-aware. Also boosting Amazon’s core e-commerce business, generative AI is providing smarter product listings, with engagement being further boosted by AI-generated ads that create lifestyle-themed visuals.
2. Revolutionizing E-Commerce Operations
AI-powered robots: Operating over 750,000 intelligent robots in its warehouses, Amazon has optimized inventory movement and storage while improving efficiency and safety.
Predictive analytics: Amazon is using AI to forecast demand and manage global inventory, reducing waste and improving delivery speed.
3. Driving Innovation Through AWS
Amazon Bedrock: Fully managed generative AI platform that allows developers to access top-tier machine learning models through a single application programming interface (API), including Anthropic’s Claude, Meta Platforms' Llama, and Amazon’s Titan model.
4. AI in Everyday Services
Amazon One: Futuristic, frictionless way to make payments and verify identity, with customers using their palm thanks to AI-powered biometric recognition."

How CoreWeave Turned a Crypto Crash into an AI Empire
“You adapt, evolve, compete, or die.”~ Paul Tudor Jones
CoreWeave: Right Place at the Right Time
Founded by three former commodities traders in New Jersey in 2017, ‘Atlantic Crypto’ first opened up shop as a crypto mining company, leveraging its graphic processing units (GPUs) to earn crypto rewards. At the time, crypto was becoming mainstream, Bitcoin was on its way to ~20x gains in two years, and business was good. However, in 2018, fate intervened when the crypto markets crashed and Bitcoin fell 80% from its peak.
“It’s not about the cards you’re dealt, but how you play the hand.” ~ Randy Pausch
CoreWeave Pivots from Crypto Mining to AI
While it didn’t seem like it at the time, the crypto crash would ultimately prove to be the best possible outcome for the company. Instead of fighting a brutal crypto bear market, the Atlantic Crypto team pivoted, sensing the incoming AI revolution. In 2019, the company renamed itself CoreWeave.What happened next was an incredible stroke of luck, coupled with foresight.
CoreWeave had exactly the necessary ingredients to pivot into an AI juggernaut, including multiple data centers and the hard-to-attain and highly coveted Nvidia H100 chips. Between a unique arrangement with Nvidia and its existing data center infrastructure, CoreWeave began providing cloud computing infrastructure necessary to train large language models (LLMs) to big tech companies just as the AI race heated up and billions in CAPEX would be spent. Meanwhile, as an early mover, CoreWeave has optimized its platform to meet specialized AI needs, offering industry-best performance at a fraction of the price.
CoreWeave: Deals, Deals, Deals
CoreWeave’s business is accelerating at a lightning-fast rate. Over the past few weeks, CoreWeave has landed three multi-billion-dollar deals, including:
· A $6.5 billion deal expansion with OpenAI to provide cloud infrastructure.
· A $6.5 billion “backstop” deal with Nvidia. In the deal, Nvidia will purchase any of CoreWeave’s unsold cloud capacity through 2032.
· A $14.2 billion deal to provide Meta Platforms access to its Nvidia GB300 server racks and “Blackwell” GPUs.
When put into context, the approximately $27 billion in long-term deals is staggering, considering that CRWV’s market cap is only $67 billion."

(NASDAQ:META) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy according to hedge funds. On September 26, Meta Platforms announced that it will launch an ad-free subscription option for users of Facebook and Instagram in the UK in the coming weeks. This move is a response to regulatory guidance from the UK’s data protection authority, which had raised concerns about how platforms handle personal information for targeted advertising.
The subscription model offers users a choice: they can continue to use the services for free with targeted advertising or pay a monthly fee to use the apps without ads. Users who opt for the paid plan will not see ads, and their data will not be used for advertising purposes. The introduction of this ad-free tier is part of a broader industry trend where tech companies, including Apple and Alphabet’s Google, are adjusting their models due to increasing regulatory pressure over personal data use and targeted ads.
The pricing for the ad-free subscription is set at £2.99 a month for access via the web. For subscriptions made through iOS and Android mobile apps, the price will be £3.99 a month, with the higher price accounting for service charges imposed by Apple and Google. The company’s ads business accounted for about $164.5 billion in total revenue last year, with ads representing about 98% of that revenue.
Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) develops products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality and mixed reality headsets, augmented reality, and wearables worldwide.
While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.41% for the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.18%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.31%.
The social media company's shares have seen an increase of 0.64% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.63% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15%.
The upcoming earnings release of Meta Platforms will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $6.74, reflecting a 11.77% increase from the same quarter last year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $49.39 billion, indicating a 21.68% upward movement from the same quarter last year.
Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $28.14 per share and revenue of $195.92 billion, indicating changes of +17.94% and +19.1%, respectively, compared to the previous year.
It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-term stock moves. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.01% higher. Meta Platforms is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.
Investors should also note Meta Platforms's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 26.42. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 31, so one might conclude that Meta Platforms is trading at a discount comparatively.
Also, we should mention that META has a PEG ratio of 1.55. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. META's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.27 as of yesterday's close.
The Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 59, this industry ranks in the top 24% of all industries, numbering over 250."

Launched through a dedicated iOS app, Sora 2 arrives with the ability to synchronize dialogue and sound effects, while introducing users to immersive, AI-generated simulations that realistically adhere to the laws of physics.
Positioned as a ""GPT-3.5 moment for video,"" Sora 2 builds upon its February 2024 predecessor by showcasing complex feats that defied the abilities of previous models. OpenAI notes that earlier video models often distorted reality to satisfy prompts, but Sora 2 is designed to model failure and obey physical constraints, a core requirement in creating AI systems that understand the real world.
The new Sora app offers users the ability to drop lifelike video cameos of themselves into CGI environments, with facial and voice likeness captured through a one-time verification. Functioning more like a co-creative platform than a traditional social media app, it prioritizes user interactions and video creation over passive scrolling, with custom feeds and strict well-being safeguards baked in.
In early reactions, Wall Street has taken notice of Sora 2 as a potential disruptor. Shares of digital media incumbents slipped following the announcement: Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) dropped 8.2%, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) slid 4.8%, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) fell 1.3%, and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) declined by 0.5%. “Our companies are in the business of competing for time and modifying consumer behavior. ChatGPT has modified and captured ‘search’ behavior with agentic offerings...and, if confirmed, we see this new Sora app as a direct competitor for consumer engagement/time/data against META, GOOGL/YouTube, TikTok, RDDT, SNAP and the other digital platforms,” Morgan Stanley wrote.
Still, analysts cautioned that toppling incumbents won’t be straightforward, given their entrenched reach. “Changing the behavior of hundreds of millions of people (in META/GOOGL’s cases, billions) is difficult,” they said. “For OpenAI to scale its social app, we think it will be important to provide a substantially differentiated (and better) user experience than leaders like META/GOOGL/YouTube.”
Morgan Stanley suggested smaller companies may feel the disruption earlier, given their limited generative AI capabilities. “Smaller platforms with less sophisticated next generation ML/GenAI offerings could face engagement headwinds faster if consumer adoption of diffusion/video creation tools ramps,” the firm added, flagging Reddit, Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS), and Snap as vulnerable."

Recent gains followed a long-awaited antitrust ruling that avoided the most punitive measures sought by regulators, including the sale of Alphabet’s Chrome browser. The ruling came in the wake of Alphabet’s second-quarter earnings, which showed that demand for artificial intelligence products is lifting sales.
Investors have grown more confident about Alphabet’s position with AI, even as OpenAI’s ChatGPT introduces new features. The company on Tuesday said it is rolling out visual search in AI mode, and The Information recently reported that Meta Platforms Inc. has held discussions about using Google’s AI models to improve its ad business.
In a sign of improved sentiment, MoffettNathanson wrote that the “combination of market leadership, diversification and scale positions Alphabet not only as a winner in the GenAI era but as a company that should rightly be considered for the title of most valuable company in the world.”
The rally in Alphabet shares briefly resulted in the company rising above a $3 trillion market capitalization, although it receded from that peak, and currently has a valuation of around $2.93 trillion.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is stepping deeper into the chip wars with the acquisition of Rivos Inc., a startup building GPUs designed for artificial intelligence workloads. According to a person familiar with the matter, the deal underscores Meta's determination to tighten control over its infrastructure and reduce reliance on Nvidia, even as it still spends billions annually on external hardware. Rivos had recently sought fresh funding at a $2 billion valuation in August, highlighting the scale of technology Meta is absorbing into its strategy.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made AI the company's defining bet, and the numbers reflect that ambition. Meta has pledged as much as $72 billion in capital expenditures this year, much of it directed toward data centers and AI infrastructure, while recently raising $29 billion in financing to build a massive facility in Louisiana. Meta's in-house team has already developed its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, yet the company continues to scout the market for acquisitions that could accelerate chip progress. One earlier approach to Korean startup FuriosaAI, reportedly valued at $800 million, was rejected in March.
A Meta spokesperson emphasized that its custom silicon program is progressing quickly and that Rivos will further accelerate the roadmap. With competition from Alphabet's Google and OpenAI intensifying, Meta's latest move could represent a critical reinforcement of its AI hardware efforts. The company is pursuing what Zuckerberg has described as the long-term goal of superintelligence, a push that could reshape Meta's ability to power its next generation of AI models."

- CoreWeave shares surged Tuesday after the cloud computing company backed by Nvidia struck a new agreement with Meta Platforms valued at up to $14.2 billion.
- The announcement marks the latest in a string of multibillion-dollar deals for CoreWeave to provide infrastructure to support booming AI demand.
CoreWeave (CRWV) shares soared Tuesday after the provider of artificial intelligence data centers backed by AI chip darling (NVDA) said it struck a deal with Meta Platforms (META) valued at up to $14.2 billion.
Shares of CoreWeave were up nearly 14% around $140 in recent trading. They have more than tripled in value since the company went public in March, though they remain well off their highs from June after reporting a wider-than-anticipated loss last month.
The company wrote in a regulatory filing Tuesday that its latest order from Meta will run through December 14, 2031, and that Meta has the option to “materially expand its commitment through 2032 for additional cloud computing capacity.”
In a statement to Investopedia, CoreWeave said it believes the agreement underscores its value as a ""trusted backbone for the world’s leading innovators and most ambitious projects.""
Why This Matters for Investors
CoreWeave is part of a cohort of AI-related companies that have seen strong gains since going public recently, pointing both to demand for AI infrastructure and new ways to play the AI trade.
The news comes less than a week after the company announced an expanded agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI for as much as $6.5 billion “to power the training of its most advanced next-generation models.” That’s on top of the $11.9 billion pact the two signed in March, and a $4 billion expansion in May. Earlier this month, CoreWeave also said it signed a $6.3 billion order with Nvidia."

Wheeling and Dealing CoreWeave Strikes Again
CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ:CRWV) 12.3% higher to trade at $137.57, after the AI cloud computing company inked a $14 billion infrastructure deal with Meta Platforms (META). Just last week, CoreWeave secured a similar contract with OpenAI for $6.5 billion. CRWV is heading for its highest close since Aug. 12, and is 243% above its March 28 debut close at $40.
At last check, over 400,000 calls have changed hands today, volume that's double the average intraday amount and the number of puts exchanged. Most popular is the weekly 10/3 140-strike call, while the October 150 call is also seeing new positions bought to open. With a healthy 11% of the stock's total available float sold short, a short squeeze could help CRWV return to $150.
DraftKings Suffers as Kalshi Gains Momentum
DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) stock is down 10.2% to trade at $38.02, after a SeekingAlpha report indicated prediction market company Kalshi saw a $260 million trading record Saturday, a number that was topped on Sunday with $275 million. DKNG is trying to hold its year-to-date breakeven level today, but is now down 20.8% in September alone.
Call traders are undeterred. Over 100,000 calls have been exchanged already today, volume that's 4 times the average intraday amount and nearly double the number of puts traded. The weekly 10/3 39.50-strike call is the most popular, as is the October 37 put.

The filing describes a long-term supply relationship and related financing steps tied to CoreWeave’s data center developments. Of note, Meta has agreed to pay CoreWeave up to $14.2 billion through December 2031.

The $14.2 billion Meta agreement lands as CoreWeave pursues its previously announced all-stock acquisition of Core Scientific. Announced on July 7, the news was followed by an immediate drop in CORZ shares from over $18 per share to under $13 per share.
The transaction remains subject to Core Scientific stockholder approval and other customary conditions. Core Scientific has scheduled a special meeting for October 30 to vote on the merger.
However, a major shareholder challenge has emerged. Two Seas Capital, which owns 6.2% of Core Scientific, filed a definitive proxy and is urging investors to vote against the merger. The investor argues the board did not run a robust market check, and says the exchange terms undervalue Core Scientific relative to its data-center assets and AI colocation opportunity set.
In a Two Seas Capital press release put out Monday, the investor writes: “The market reaction to this mispriced and poorly structured deal was swift and negative. Core Scientific stock plunged 18% on the deal announcement, making it one of the worst one-day price declines for an M&A target this century.”
CoreWeave’s deal with Meta adds new commercial context ahead of that October 30 vote. For Core Scientific shareholders, the decision now hinges on whether to take the merger consideration and align with CoreWeave’s expanding AI customer base, or to remain independent amid rising demand for high-density compute capacity.

The stock price jump came after the company announced a new $14.2 billion deal with Meta Platforms.
Continuing to strike deals
In a regulatory filing Tuesday morning, CoreWeave announced that it had expanded its deal with Meta Platforms: It will provide cloud computing capacity to the social media giant through 2031 for $14.2 billion. Meta also has ""the option to materially expand its commitment through 2032 for additional cloud computing capacity under the Order Form.""
CoreWeave builds and operates data centers equipped with the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia, and rents out capacity on its machines largely to companies that use it to power and train artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Many of the hyperscalers in the ""Magnificent Seven"" have high demand for this type of processing capacity. ""The agreement underscores that behind every AI breakthrough are the partnerships that make it possible,"" a CoreWeave spokesperson told CNBC.
CoreWeave has had a good couple of weeks. It recently expanded its deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, for an additional $6.5 billion. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously vowed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centers to help power his company's AI ambitions.
Good as long as the party continues
As long as companies keep spending on AI infrastructure, CoreWeave is going to benefit. How long the party will continue is another question. CoreWeave is fast approaching a $70 billion market cap, but it is not yet profitable and trades at about 13 times forward expected sales. It also has a debt-to-equity ratio of more than 8.3, which is high.
All of this makes me a bit cautious on CoreWeave, despite the high-profile agreements it has signed recently. Due to the state of its balance sheet, its valuation, and the possibility of a slowdown in AI capital expenditures, I wouldn't recommend investing too much of your portfolio in the stock."

Meta has been spending at a torrid pace as it invests in AI infrastructure that includes a mammoth 4 million-square-foot data center in Louisiana. The Instagram parent raised its 2025 capital expenditure guidance to a range between $66 billion and $72 billion in its most recent quarterly financial report.
Tuesday's development comes on the heels of CoreWeave's $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), announced last week. The company is working to diversify its customer base away from Microsoft (MSFT), which accounted for roughly 70% of the company's revenue in its most recent quarter.
""This is clearly a step in the right direction for diversification,"" Intrator told Bloomberg.
Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Felix Wang, who holds a short position on CoreWeave, called the deal ""a positive surprise."" Tech analyst and Bokeh Capital Partners chief investment officer Kimberly Forrest said the partnership was ""a good deal for both"" firms and is an indication that current demand for high-end AI chips is ""limitless.""
Futurum Group tech analyst David Nicholson was more skeptical of the deal and what it says about the AI chip market. Nicholson said there is an ""odd market dynamic"" at play, given Meta has chosen to rent data center capacity from CoreWeave rather than buy Nvidia's chips directly to put in its own data centers.
""It doesn't make sense that Meta would not prefer to do what it does with all of its other technology, and that is build and manage it on its own,"" he said.
CoreWeave's new partnership with Meta comes amid a flurry of other recent AI deals as Big Tech rushes to add compute capacity in data centers to power their artificial intelligence ambitions. Those deals include Nvidia's $100 billion OpenAI investment, announced last week, and OpenAI's reported $300 billion contract with Oracle (ORCL). Citi analysts forecast on Tuesday that AI capital expenditures from 2025 through 2029 would hit $2.8 trillion."

“They loved our infrastructure in earlier contracts and came back for more,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Intrator said in an interview. As part of the agreement, CoreWeave will provide the social media giant access to Nvidia Corp.’s latest GB300 systems, he said. Meta didn’t provide comment.
CoreWeave shares jumped as much as 15.9% after markets opened in New York. Meta shares declined as much as 1.9%.
The deal runs through December 2031 with an option to extend through 2032 with additional capacity, CoreWeave said in a filing Tuesday.
CoreWeave is among an emerging group of “neoclouds,” businesses that rent out access to leading AI chips. Its competitors include Nebius Group and Nscale Global Holdings Ltd. CoreWeave’s stock has more than tripled in value since its March initial public offering as the race among major technology companies to build the most advanced AI models sends computing demand soaring.
The deal with Meta helps further diversify CoreWeave’s business away from Microsoft Corp., which has historically been its largest customer. The software maker accounted for 71% of CoreWeave’s revenue in the quarter that ended in June. The deal follows another multibillion-dollar commitment from OpenAI last week.
“When we came out in the IPO, we got dinged because of our customer concentration,” Intrator said. “This is clearly a step in the right direction for diversification.”
Meta has emerged as one of the top spenders on AI infrastructure as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg invests heavily in the energy, computing power and talent needed to compete in the fast-moving race. In April, Meta said its capital expenditures may total as much as $72 billion this year, with a focus on AI and the data centers used to train and run the models.
Neoclouds are largely reliant on debt financing to invest in capital-heavy AI infrastructure. “We will tap the debt markets periodically as we continue to expand,” Intrator said.
Larger cloud providers have also looked to fund data center development through debt lately. Meta raised $29 billion in a financing package for a massive data center in Louisiana. Last week, Oracle Corp. raised $18 billion in bonds as it builds infrastructure for OpenAI."

The overly optimistic recommendations of Wall Street analysts make the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric questionable.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Meta Platforms (META).
Meta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.34, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 56 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.34 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 56 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 46 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 82.1% and 5.4% of all recommendations.

Check price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>
While the ABR calls for buying Meta Platforms, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.
ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank
Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.
Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5."

One AI executive believes he knows why.
“There has been this general promise of, hey, you’ll just plug in the (AI) model … and everything will work,” Jason Droege, CEO of startup Scale AI, said in an interview. “The reality is a little bit different.”
Scale is primarily known for helping to make AI work at a fundamental level. AI giants need massive amounts of data to train their large language models, and it needs to be labeled and categorized so the models can learn, for example, what’s a photo of a cat versus a photo of a fish — for years, they’ve turned to Scale to provide that organized data.
It’s such a crucial business that Meta bought a 49% stake in Scale AI back in June for $14.3 billion, valuing the startup at $29 billion in total. As part of the agreement, founder and then-chief executive Alexandr Wang and several other top employees left to work for Meta.
But the deal sparked some concern that rival LLM makers may be wary of working with Scale following Meta’s investment. OpenAI and Google have reportedly scaled back their work with the company.
Scale says that “data labeling” business has continued to grow each month since the Meta deal. But new CEO Droege — who initially joined Scale last year as chief strategy officer — is now also focused on a lesser-known element of Scale’s business, helping all kinds of companies compile their own, custom data sets and create AI tools to automate processes and take on rote tasks. He’s hoping to challenge the impression that implementing AI applications can’t be lucrative.
“I think companies thought it was a bit easier than it actually is,” he said. “But there is a ton of value when you get it right.”
Making AI make money
Despite clamoring from C-suites across Corporate America about the promise of the technology to make businesses run more efficiently — most companies aren’t seeing a return on their AI investments. MIT’s August report contributed to growing concerns that the AI market might be a bubble waiting to burst, even as the industry is propping up the US economy.
Among the prominent clients that Scale is helping to build AI applications are the Mayo Clinic, the Qatari government, Cisco and Global Atlantic Financial Group. And just last month, Scale signed a $99 million contract with the US Defense Department to develop AI applications for the Army.
The companies that fail to see a return on their AI investments are often trying to apply the technology to wrong kind of problem, according to Droege. “I think one of the misunderstandings is that AI is this magic wand or it can solve all problems, and that’s not true today,” he said.
Problems well suited for AI are ones where humans are “slow or inconsistent or error prone,” Droege said, such as reading through and summarizing or editing many pages of documents.
For example, Scale has helped organizations develop AI systems to process insurance claims and to give doctors a summary of patients’ medical histories ahead of visits.
If the idea of an AI helping to decide whether you get reimbursed for a medical procedure or reminding your doctor about your tricky medical condition seems worrying — Droege says companies also need human experts to contribute to and constantly improve the AI.
“If a healthcare organization is trying to provide a tool that assists a doctor in better diagnosing a patient … you would want your most senior doctors, your senior medical professionals who have expertise in these areas, using the application, giving it feedback, pointing out where there’s problems,” Droege said.
The entire process can take weeks or months, but it can ultimately result in a tool that’s more useful to employees than just a mainstream chatbot, Droege said.
He cited government agencies using AI to evaluate building permit applications ahead of a human review — trained on data from earlier review processes — to make the permitting process faster and smoother.
But some analysts say it could be years before AI tools really makes companies money.
“This is going to take years for large companies to implement AI tools that are broadly useful and generate revenue and save expenses,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at DA Davidson. However, he added that “once we do figure out how to do AI in the organizational context, those tools will be very valuable and generate a tremendous amount of revenue.”
And Scale AI has plenty of competition, including industry leaders such as Amazon and Microsoft.
“The notion of developing AI applications for companies, everybody’s been chasing that for the last two and a half years,” said Luria. While Scale was first to the data labeling market, it “is now company number 10,000” competing in applications, he said.
Still, Droege says there’s plenty of opportunity for companies that really understand how AI works — and what’s it’s good for.
That sounds like a savvy marketing pitch, but it also aligns with conclusions from MIT’s research, which found the companies least successful at deploying AI were the ones who tried to build AI tools alone themselves, without outside help.
Expertise helps companies understand which problems AI can and can’t solve, Droege said.
Droge told CNN he’s optimistic about both the data side and the applications side of Scale’s business.
“Going into all of this, the application side of our business was already in the hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue,” he said. “And on the data side of the business, we’ve grown every month since the (Meta) deal … It’s a large business for us and we’re very happy with it.”"

(Reuters) -CoreWeave said it has signed a $14 billion agreement with Meta to supply computing power, the latest multi-billion-dollar deal as businesses ramp up infrastructure to meet the demand for artificial intelligence applications.
Shares of CoreWeave surged 15% following the news on Tuesday.
Under the agreement, Meta has committed to pay around $14.2 billion through December 14, 2031, with the option to expand through 2032 for additional cloud computing capacity, CoreWeave said in a filing.
AI technology developers are rushing to sign multi-billion-dollar deals to lock in infrastructure quickly, boosting valuations of backend service providers such as CoreWeave, which was valued at $60 billion as of last close.
The boom has also raised questions about ""circular"" financing, as many AI tech firms invest in and sign supply deals with each other. This has also sparked worries about whether the surge in valuation is a bubble.
""Nvidia's chips are in CoreWeave's data centers, which will then be used by companies like Meta. These kinds of deals spark bubble concerns because of how insular the industry appears, and the massive dollar amounts involved,"" Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said.
At the same time, the AI market is expanding beyond the Magnificent Seven, which reduces the risk of a sudden bubble burst, he added.
The deal with Meta would also allow CoreWeave to fill data center capacity beyond its largest customer, Microsoft. Last week, the server provider signed a third multi-billion dollar cloud expansion deal with OpenAI.
As a part of the agreement, CoreWeave will provide the Facebook-parent access to Nvidia's latest GB300 systems, according to a Bloomberg News report, citing an interview with the data center operator's CEO Michael Intrator.
For Meta, the deal underscores its ambition to improve the technology that powers its consumer products such as the recently launched smart glasses with Ray Ban.
The social media firm has invested tens of billions into data centers across the U.S. and is paying athlete-level salaries to hire top AI software engineers. The social media firm did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

HOUSTON, September 30, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--XGS Energy, a developer of next-generation geothermal power projects leveraging a proprietary water-independent technology system, today announced the successful operation of its geothermal system at commercial scale for over 3000 hours, proving commercial economics. XGS is the first company to demonstrate a water-independent geothermal system at commercial conditions and scale. Operations were completed at the Coso geothermal field owned by Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure and operated by Coso Operating Company, located in the Western Mojave Desert region of California.
XGS designed and executed a workover program on a well that had been idle in the Coso geothermal field for over two decades. After installing XGS’s proprietary geothermal system, including performance-boosting Thermal Reach Enhancement (TRE) technology, flow testing demonstrated record performance for a water-independent geothermal system, proving commercial economics by sustaining a difference between injection and production temperatures greater than 158˚F (70˚C). Power output from geothermal wells is directly tied to the temperature delta between injection and production fluid.
The extensive operating history was used to verify XGS’s production models, with actual performance falling within 2% of predicted values. XGS’s sealed closed-loop system, boosted by TRE, provides unprecedented predictability and active control of field performance versus other geothermal systems, which are subject to complex and continuously changing subsurface reservoir conditions. ""Predictable and sustainable long-term performance has been a thorn in the side of the geothermal industry,"" said XGS Chief Technology Officer Dr. Axel-Pierre Bois. ""XGS’s ability to deliver a highly predictable geothermal system in any subsurface environment, paired with validated power production models, significantly derisks our project development and financing.""
The project further confirmed TRE formulation and placement methods at commercial temperature and depth conditions. Placement of TRE in the well was completed in less than 24 hours. ""This project demonstrates we are not only able to leverage TRE to produce geothermal energy at commercial scale, but also that we can substantially shorten well construction times to deliver large-scale power projects faster,"" said Dr. Ghazal Izadi, XGS Chief Operating Officer. ""With strong demonstrated performance of the TRE system, we can turn our focus to more traditional value drivers such as well design, drilling speed and surface plant cost, leveraging best practices from the oil and gas industry to deliver cost advantage at scale."""

“We are particularly bullish on the online advertising space broadly, driven by several themes, most notably AI driving more user engagement, better advertising efficacy, helping expand the addressable market, and on the cusp of benefiting from a wave of customer acquisition spending from AI native companies,” the analysts wrote.
Mizuho said its “favorite stocks include Meta Platforms (OP, $925 PT, Top Pick), Amazon (OP, $300 PT) and Pinterest (OP, $50 PT).”
The firm added, “We believe our most out-of-consensus call is our Outperform on Airbnb (OP, $151 PT).”
In online advertising, Mizuho said, “Our favorite name is Meta Platforms (+24% to TP), followed by Pinterest (+49% to TP) and Alphabet (+20% to TP). All OP names benefit from themes we like in the space, particularly Meta where AI is entirely offensive.
“We believe this sector broadly has the most tailwinds from scaling AI in our coverage.”
On e-commerce, the analysts cited Amazon’s “expansion of AWS infrastructure, poised to benefit from the scaling AI inference opportunity and on expanding retail margins, driven by improving efficiency and fast-growing advertising.”
In rideshare, Mizuho preferred DoorDash and Uber but flagged Lyft and Instacart, where “we see competitive risk as an overhang for both.”
For online travel, the firm said, “We like Airbnb (+22% to TP) on the push into hotel, which stands to unlock a significantly larger market and can drive accelerating top line in 2027.”

The analysts said the app, featuring “a vertical video feed with swipe-to-scroll navigation similar to TikTok’s interface,” will allow users to generate clips of up to 10 seconds using AI, with identity verification as a key feature.
Morgan Stanley noted, “Our companies are in the business of competing for time and modifying consumer behavior. ChatGPT has modified and captured ‘search’ behavior with agentic offerings...and, if confirmed, we see this new Sora app as a direct competitor for consumer engagement/time/data against META, GOOGL/YouTube, TikTok, RDDT, SNAP and the other digital platforms.”
However, the bank warned that challenging the incumbents will not be easy.
“Changing the behavior of hundreds of millions of people (in META/GOOGL’s cases, billions) is difficult,” the analysts wrote. “For OpenAI to scale its social app, we think it will be important to provide a substantially differentiated (and better) user experience than leaders like META/GOOGL/YouTube.”
The bigger disruption risk, Morgan Stanley argued, may fall on smaller players. “Smaller platforms with less sophisticated next generation ML/GenAI offerings could face engagement headwinds faster if consumer adoption of diffusion/video creation tools ramps,” the analysts said, citing SNAP, Reddit and Pinterest.
Morgan Stanley also highlighted the app’s potential role in OpenAI’s long-term ambitions.
“We see this likely coming from digital advertising and (to a lesser extent) devices...with search/agentic and now video/social the canvases to capture time, engagement, data...and drive monetization,” the bank stated.

The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to close out its fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 81 points, or 0.2%, to set its own all-time high, and the Nasdaq composite ticked 0.3% higher.
The quiet trading came as a midnight deadline approached, when the U.S. government could shut down because of Washington’s latest political impasse. That’s because history has shown that past shutdowns have had limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around.
The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 4.4% during past shutdowns and is positive over the last five, according to Monica Guerra, head of U.S. policy at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.
What could make this shutdown different, though, is that the White House may push for large-scale firings of federal workers.
The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump’s tariffs won’t derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market.
Treasury yields wavered in the bond market but ultimately held relatively steady following mixed reports on the U.S. economy. One said consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents in the Conference Board’s survey pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like.
A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its “low-hire, low-fire” state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that’s neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates.
The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more to give the job market a boost. But too-strong data on jobs could make the Fed less willing to cut rates, which would strengthen criticism that the U.S. stock market has become too expensive after prices ran so high. Too-weak numbers, meanwhile, could signal a coming recession, which would also hurt stock prices.
When Wall Street will get the next data reports on the job market is uncertain, though. A shutdown of the federal government would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday’s on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September."

After all, AMZN is only 9% from a 52-week and all-time high of $242 a share (post-split basis).
That said, the rebound in AMZN has been subpar after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs rattled the broader market earlier in the year.
Rebounding +15% in the last six months, Amazon stock is now virtually flat in 2025, being the worst performer out of its ""Mag 7"" big tech peers, just behind Apple’s AAPL YTD gains of over +1% with Nvidia’s NVDA +35% leading the way.

AI is Streamlining Amazon’s Businesses
As illustrated by the price, consensus, and surprise chart above, Amazon has now exceeded EPS expectations for 11 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, Amazon has posted a very impressive average EPS surprise of 22.98% in its last four quarterly reports.
Most appealing and correlating with this exceptional operational performance is that Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence in nearly every facet of its business, as depicted below.
1. Enhancing Customer Experience
Amazon has integrated generative AI into Alexa, making interactions more natural and context-aware. Also boosting Amazon’s core e-commerce business, generative AI is providing smarter product listings, with engagement being further boosted by AI-generated ads that create lifestyle-themed visuals.
2. Revolutionizing E-Commerce Operations
AI-powered robots: Operating over 750,000 intelligent robots in its warehouses, Amazon has optimized inventory movement and storage while improving efficiency and safety.
Predictive analytics: Amazon is using AI to forecast demand and manage global inventory, reducing waste and improving delivery speed.
3. Driving Innovation Through AWS
Amazon Bedrock: Fully managed generative AI platform that allows developers to access top-tier machine learning models through a single application programming interface (API), including Anthropic’s Claude, Meta Platforms META Llama, and Amazon’s Titan model.
4. AI in Everyday Services
Amazon One: Futuristic, frictionless way to make payments and verify identity, with customers using their palm thanks to AI-powered biometric recognition.
AI in Amazon pharmacy and logistics: AI streamlines prescription fulfillment and delivery routing, making services faster and more reliable.
AMZN Broker Recommendations
Not to be confused with the Zacks Rank, brokers do appear to be bullish on Amazon’s outlook and AI endeavors. Derived from 56 brokerage firms, Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.14 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell)."

Gavin Newsom has signed SB 53, a first-in-the-nation bill that sets new transparency requirements on large AI companies.
SB 53, which passed the state legislature two weeks ago, requires large AI labs — including OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind — to be transparent about safety protocols. It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.
In addition, SB 53 creates a mechanism for AI companies and the public to report potential critical safety incidents to California’s Office of Emergency Services. Companies also have to report incidents related to crimes committed without human oversight, such as cyberattacks, and deceptive behavior by a model that isn’t required under the EU AI Act.
The bill has received mixed reactions from the AI industry. Tech firms have broadly argued that state-level AI policy risks creating a “patchwork of regulation” that would hinder innovation, although Anthropic endorsed the bill. Meta and OpenAI lobbied against it. OpenAI even wrote and published an open letter to Gov. Newsom that discouraged his signing of SB 53.
The new bill comes as some of Silicon Valley’s tech elite have poured hundreds of millions into super PACs to back candidates that support a light-touch approach to AI regulation. Leaders at OpenAI and Meta have in recent weeks launched pro-AI super PACs that aim to back candidates and bills that are friendly to AI.
Still, other states might look to California for inspiration as they attempt to curb the potential harms caused by the unmitigated advancement of such a powerful emerging technology. In New York, a similar bill was passed by state lawmakers and is awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature or veto.
“California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,” Newsom said in a statement. “This legislation strikes that balance. AI is the new frontier in innovation, and California is not only here for it — but stands strong as a national leader by enacting the first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.”
The governor is also weighing another bill — SB 243 — that passed both the State Assembly and Senate with bipartisan support this month. The bill would regulate AI companion chatbots, requiring operators to implement safety protocols, and hold them legally accountable if their bots fail to meet those standards.
SB 53 is Senator Scott Wiener’s second attempt at an AI safety bill after Newsom vetoed his more sweeping SB 1047 last year amid major pushback from AI companies. With this bill, Wiener reached out to major AI companies to attempt to help them understand the changes he made to the bill."

Trump has managed since winning back the presidency in November to secure favorable settlements with other tech and media giants that he accused of mistreating him — in spite of courts having regularly ruled that social media companies have a First Amendment right to moderate content as they please.
Walt Disney Co.’s ABC News agreed in December to pay $15 million toward a future Trump presidential foundation or museum to end a suit claiming anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him in a statement about a court case against Trump.
In January, Meta Platforms Inc. agreed to pay a total of $25 million — including $22 million for a Trump library — to resolve Trump’s suit over his suspension from Facebook after the attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters following his 2020 election defeat.
Trump ended his legal fight with Twitter over its Jan. 6 ban in February. Court filings didn’t reveal details on a settlement. The Wall Street Journal later reported, citing unidentified people, that X — the name that Elon Musk gave the platform after he bought it in 2022 — agreed to pay about $10 million to resolve the president’s claims.
In July, Paramount Global announced a $16 million settlement with Trump over his suit accusing CBS Broadcasting Inc. of deceptively editing its October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the presidential campaign.
The network, which had previously denied wrongdoing, released an unedited version and has agreed to release transcripts of presidential candidate interviews in the future. Although officially unrelated, the settlement was widely viewed as critical for Paramount to gain approval from federal regulators for its merger with Skydance Media.
When Trump separately sued Google, Facebook and Twitter over his deplatforming, he sought monetary damages to punish the companies and ensure other users can’t be banned or flagged by the tech giants. All three companies eventually dropped the bans, but by then Trump had largely shifted his social media commentary to his own network, Truth Social."
finnhub,META,2025-09-29T20:56:38,DeepSeek: Everything you need to know about the AI chatbot app,"DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c9c183640d7fa2ca955c2383d36b4cba25a93db86b3bbd18dff5c593212a9d7a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-everything-know-ai-chatbot-205638758.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-everything-know-ai-chatbot-205638758.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepseek-everything-know-ai-chatbot-205638758.html,yahoo.com,200,,"DeepSeek has gone viral.
Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.
But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?
DeepSeek’s trader origins
DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.
AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.
In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.
From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.
DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.
DeepSeek’s strong models
DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.
DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.
DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety.
According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o."

Mr. Griffin say, David Einhorn, smart guy
Yeah. Great, great short seller.
throwing red flags on all this AI spending.
They love it.
What what do you think? Do you hear echoes of a dotcom bubble?
There are there are sounds that sound familiar, like customers trading things other than cash for product, right?
We've got we've got Nvidia, uh giving selling chips in exchange for commute a compute and both sides maybe recognizing it as revenue. I think these are things that accountants should look at.
Um we see the companies making deals with other companies, making deals with other companies making deals. and sometimes cash is not the thing that is being exchanged. That is something we saw in the .com era.
And this concerns you?
You hear echoes?
These sound like the things we heard during that era. We certainly, certainly have some fake AI companies out there. We have companies that put AI in their press releases so they can get boosts in their stock.
It's marketing fluff you're saying.
There there were some of those and I I'm sure I've been short some of those companies. I'm currently short some of those companies in my little portfolio. I don't give investment advice, but I want to, you know,
full disclosure. Um but I strongly believe that the use of AI is only just beginning and that the chips and things that are being sold in the build out of these data centers are being used. They're not just selling capacity as we saw when dark fiber was being laid for the future of the internet in 1999 and 2000, when it was just there were a lot of accounting scams of companies like Worldcom and Global Crossing and um Quest and others.
These are names you may not even remember or known at the time. But these were these were the big companies of that era, some of them and uh some of them proved to be complete frauds like Worldcom and indeed Enron."

Just as Open AI CEO Sam Altman and Meta leader Mark Zuckerberg begin acknowledging that there may be truth to the warnings of an AI bubble, Jensen Huang is doubling down on his bullishness.
In a recent podcast appearance with Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner, the Nvidia CEO brushed aside the growing caution and instead zeroed in on the company he sees as the next dominant force: OpenAI.
“OpenAI is very likely going to be the world’s next multitrillion-dollar hyperscale company,” Huang said.
That bold prediction comes at a moment when even AI’s loudest evangelists are warning of overvaluation and overbuilding. Altman himself has cautioned that too much money is flooding into unproven AI ventures, while Zuckerberg has compared today’s infrastructure frenzy to past bubbles. Yet Huang insists the skeptics are missing the deeper forces reshaping the economy. In his telling, the story comes down to basic physics, not hype.
“General-purpose computing is over,” Huang said, describing what he sees as a generational shift in how all industries will run. “The future is accelerated computing and AI.”
He outlined what he calls the “three scaling laws” of AI—pretraining, post-training, and inference—each of which exponentially increases demand for compute. While training workloads have already been well-documented, Huang stressed that inference—the real-time reasoning that underpins everything from chatbots to recommendation algorithms—is only just beginning.
“The longer you think, the better the answer you get—and thinking requires more compute,” he explained.
That framing matters because inference is where AI collides with day-to-day usage. Training runs happen in bursts, but inference happens constantly: Every chatbot prompt, every AI video render, every background algorithmic tweak consumes processing power. If Huang is right, that relentless demand means AI won’t follow the boom-and-bust cycles of earlier technologies but will instead drive a compounding need, one that will also boost Nvidia.
$100 billion bet on OpenAI
Huang’s comments came just days after Nvidia announced its most audacious deal yet: a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to help fund the company’s massive data center build-out. It’s the largest example of what analysts call Nvidia’s “circular financing” strategy, in which it invests in, or lends to, customers who in turn spend billions on Nvidia’s GPUs.
To Huang, it’s a smart way to align incentives with a once-in-a-generation partner scaling faster than any company in history. “If that’s the case, the opportunity to invest before they get there is one of the smartest investments we can imagine,” he said."

""Installing these first panels marks a major milestone for this new solar project in Oregon and adds to Avangrid’s growing fleet of energy facilities across the nation,"" said Jose Antonio Miranda, Avangrid CEO. ""Tower Solar will bring much needed capacity to the regional electric grid, improving the reliability and availability of electricity. We are proud to collaborate with our contractors and customers to bring this project to the grid, help meet growing demand for electricity, contribute to the U.S. economy, and support the local community.""
Tower Solar is located just west of Boardman, Oregon and located on about 900 acres of industrially zoned land owned by the Port of Morrow. The project will utilize more than 200,000 solar panels assembled by SEG Solar in its newly built Houston manufacturing facility. Avangrid was SEG Solar’s first utility-scale customer to receive solar modules assembled from its new U.S. facility. The total installed capacity of Tower Solar will be 166 MWdc (120 MWac).
""The Tower Solar project represents a meaningful step in Morrow County’s continued economic diversification,"" said David Sykes, Chair of the Morrow County Commission. ""By embracing renewable energy, we’re not only creating jobs and strengthening our local economy—we’re investing in a more resilient future for our citizens.""
""QTS is committed to clean energy solutions and identifying innovative and sustainable ways to best serve our customers, the community and the environment,"" said Tag Greason and David Robey, Co-CEOs of QTS. ""We are thrilled to be partnering with Avangrid and PGE as this project comes to life.""
At the peak of construction, Avangrid expects Tower Solar to create more than 200 jobs, the vast majority of which will be sourced from the region. Tower Solar is expected to pay about $20 million in combined PILOTs (payment in lieu of taxes) and property taxes which will support a variety of public services, including education."

The company says Claude Sonnet 4.5 is capable of building “production-ready” applications, rather than just prototypes, representing a leap in reliability from previous AI models.
Claude Sonnet 4.5 will be available via the Claude API and in the Claude chatbot. The pricing for developers is the same as Claude Sonnet 4: $3 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, or more than the entire “Lord of the Rings” series) and $15 per million output tokens.
In the last year, Anthropic’s AI models have emerged as a favorite among developers and enterprises, in large part due to their strong performance on software engineering tasks. Apple and Meta reportedly use Claude AI models internally, and Anthropic has made a significant business selling API access to AI coding applications such as Cursor, Windsurf, and Replit. Recently, OpenAI’s GPT-5 has challenged Anthropic’s dominance in the space, outperforming Claude models on a variety of coding benchmarks.
Anthropic says Claude Sonnet 4.5 offers industry-leading performance on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified. However, Anthropic AI researcher David Hershey tells TechCrunch that it is hard to capture Claude Sonnet 4.5’s performance on benchmarks alone.
Hershey says he’s seen Claude Sonnet 4.5 code autonomously for up to 30 hours during early trials with some enterprise customers. In that time, he watched the AI model not only build an application, but also stand up database services, purchase domain names, and perform a SOC 2 audit to make sure the product was secure.
In a statement shared with TechCrunch, Cursor CEO Michael Truell said Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents state-of-the-art coding performance, specifically on longer horizon tasks. Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang said in a statement that Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents a “new generation of coding models.”
Anthropic also claims that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is its most aligned frontier AI model yet, with lower rates of sycophancy and deception than previous models. The company says it has also improved Claude’s susceptibility to prompt injection attacks.
Alongside the launch of Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropic is also launching the Claude Agent SDK. The company says this is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code and can be used to help developers build their own agents.
Anthropic is also releasing a temporary research preview called “Imagine with Claude” for Max subscribers, which shows the AI model generating software on the fly. The company says the model will respond to user requests in real time, with no predetermined functionality or prewritten code.
The tense competition in the AI world has made it common for companies to ship flagship models every few months. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is launching less than two months after Anthropic’s last AI model, Claude Opus 4.1. These rapid production cycles make it difficult for any company to hold a meaningful lead for very long."

Plasma, a blockchain startup backed by billionaire Peter Thiel, just launched what could fundamentally disrupt traditional banking across emerging markets. Fresh off raising $373 million in a seven-times oversubscribed initial coin offering, the company announced Plasma One on Sept. 22.
The stablecoin-native neobank promises to deliver “everyone, everywhere permissionless access to saving, spending, and earning in dollars,” according to the statement. Plasma says users can pay directly from their stablecoin balances while earning double-digit yields exceeding 10%.
With Thiel’s backing and massive funding round, Plasma targets the billions of people globally who desperately need dollar access but face barriers from traditional financial institutions.

Plasma One integrates saving, spending, and sending functions into a single app, the company says. The neobank also offers up to 4% cash back on purchases with either physical or virtual cards, usable at more than 150 million merchants across 150 countries.
The app provides free and instant stablecoin transfers between users, while onboarding is designed to be quick, giving new customers a virtual card within minutes.
Plasma said it built the app for real-world use cases, pointing to exporters in Istanbul who secure digital dollars to protect earnings, merchants in Buenos Aires who pay staff in stablecoins, and commodity traders in Dubai who rely on them for cross-border transactions.

The neobank also acts as a proving ground for Plasma's broader ecosystem, which spans its blockchain, payment rails, and developer tools. According to its website, the Layer 1 blockchain can process over 1,000 transactions per second with sub-second block times.
The company reported more than $2.5 billion in stablecoin total value locked at launch.
The vertical integration across blockchain, tooling, and application allows end-to-end optimization. By being its own first customer, Plasma said it can refine its payment stack more quickly before opening it to external developers and institutions.
Its strategy is aimed at offering wallets, banks, and fintech apps a foundation that has been tested under global demand rather than in controlled environments. The external partners will eventually launch on Plasma using battle-tested technology rather than building from scratch, the company said."

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Cleo Capital’s Sarah Kunst said in a program on CNBC last month that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s huge investments to attract top AI talent might not result in significantly positive results for the company. The analyst said Zuckerberg’s investments might end up looking like “Metaverse days.” She was talking about Zuckerberg’s plan to pivot Facebook to the Metaverse, which failed, according to many analysts.
“I think that there is a huge chance that what they’re going to have is a phenomena you’re talking about, which is you get the three best players in the league and it turns out that there’s a lot of ego there. There’s a lot of salary cap that went into them and it’s really hard to win championships because maybe they’re not as motivated. So, you know, Zuck has pulled crazy things off before, but I think this might look a little bit more like the metaverse days than the early days of Facebook in terms of the output here.”
First Eagle Global Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among other social-media platforms—reported strong revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, driven by increases in both ad impressions and price per ad. The company continued to aggressively invest and hire in AI, even as it develops its core advertising businesses. We believe these results demonstrate Meta’s ability to focus on both profitability and efficiency in conjunction with ongoing investments in the core ad business, the metaverse and other AI applications.”
While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge was recently asked about Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) stock gains following its earnings report and forecasts. Here is what the analyst said:
“There was an article on the Information about OpenAI spending about $450 billion over the next five years on compute. Remember that was the huge part of the RPO boost at Oracle. A lot of that was driven by OpenAI. So that’s another positive suggesting that the biggest, most prominent player in the industry continues to spend a lot of money. XAI, there were a lot of articles about them raising money at a $200 billion valuation. And then right before the close, there was a report on Bloomberg about how Oracle could be striking a deal with Meta for a $20 billion AI compute contract. So the headline and news flow around AI just remains extremely bullish and Oracle really has risen to become one of the most prominent names in the industry and that continues to drive the shares higher.”
Why are some analysts reluctant about the Oracle-OpenAI deal? OpenAI is expected to burn about $115 billion over the next four years and is not projected to be profitable until 2030. Even after Nvidia’s latest $100 billion investment by Nvidia, OpenAI will likely need to raise over $200 billion in total funding to cover its commitments. Some analysts believe Oracle may need to borrow tens of billions to build enough data centers for the deal. ORCL is up 70% so far this year, and its P/E (TTM) is about 80% higher than the sector median of 24.4, according to data from SeekingAlpha.
Loomis Sayles Growth Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a leader in the enterprise software market with a strong market position in database, infrastructure and application software, and cloud-based software and services. We believe the company’s competitive advantages include its large and experienced direct sales force, a founder-driven management team that reinvests relentlessly to maintain a leading intellectual property (IP) portfolio and differentiated product suite, and a large installed base of clients with high switching costs where it consistently achieves renewal and retention rates in the mid-90% range. We believe Oracle is well positioned to benefit from the continuing growth in data storage and enterprise application software, as well as the shift to cloud-based solutions."

Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, said in a recent program on CNBC that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned well to gain following the recent court ruling that the company will not need to sell its Chrome business. The analyst explained why he believes the stock is undervalued:
“First the core catalyst has got to be they got to maintain that double digit search revenue growth they’ve been at 11%, 12%, 13% for about two years now we think that we think that will continue because what’s underappreciated by the market is the quality of Google leads is actually rising and it’s kind of the law of unintended consequences you show people fewer paid clicks so that when they click on them, they’re less casual. They’re more they’re more conscious, determined, whatever it is. But the marketers we talk with, the advertisers are seeing higher quality leads coming from Google. That’s causing pricing to go up. That’s a good thing for Google. And then secondly, just like Meta, Google has been able to use Gen AI to improve its ad targeting, its ad selection. So, you’ve got a a search marketplace that’s getting better. That’s your core catalyst that that continues. Then you got what I call the amplification catalyst. That’s YouTube revenue that’s accelerating. That’s Google cloud revenue that’s accelerating. And then Waymo is coming to a town near you. And you put all that together, I think the stock’s worth more. You put a 25 multiple on this next year’s numbers. You get to like 275 on 2027 earnings numbers. You get to 325. So somewhere in between there is probably where the stock can go called 300 bucks.”
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe concerns around AI-related threats to Google search are overstated. Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. As of April, Google had over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews. Google’s competitor OpenAI failed to impress the market with its GPT-5 model, while Gemini is gaining traction with new features. Analysts believe the company is strongly positioned to start placing ads in AI search results, which means its core ads business will not be impacted despite the decline in traditional search.

SoftBank (TSE:9434) is making headlines with its involvement in the ambitious Candle Submarine Cable System, a joint project alongside global players like Meta. This massive undertaking will connect Japan with several other Asian countries through 8,000 kilometers of high-capacity submarine cable. The aim is to support the explosion in data traffic from AI and 5G. For investors wondering what this means in practice, this move signals SoftBank’s intention to stake out a leading role in shaping the region’s digital backbone over the next several years. Looking at the broader market, there has already been a response to SoftBank's strategic large-scale investments. While the stock saw some short-term dips in the past month and quarter, longer-term momentum remains strong, with a gain of 20% over the past year and a 72% return over three years. A steady pipeline of data-centric projects like Candle suggests SoftBank is positioning itself for even deeper market relevance, especially as expectations for accelerating digital transformation across Asia continue. Following this year’s strong long-term returns but more variable short-term momentum, the question for investors is whether SoftBank is now trading at a discount that markets haven’t yet recognized or if the growth potential is already reflected in today’s price.
Most Popular Narrative: 5.9% Undervalued
The most widely followed narrative suggests SoftBank is currently trading below its fair value, hinting at some potential upside for investors willing to back its evolving digital strategy.
Integration of AI solutions (such as contact center agentic AI) into financial services partnerships with firms like Sumitomo Mitsui Card and PayPay creates new monetization channels, further increasing transaction volume, cross-selling opportunities, and supporting top-line revenue and net income growth.
Curious what is actually driving this bullish price target? The narrative is built on bold growth assumptions and ambitious profit projections over the next few years. Want to uncover the key financial levers, like how much revenue growth and earnings power are needed to justify the target? Dive in to see the numbers that could signal SoftBank’s next act.
Result: Fair Value of ¥234.93 (UNDERVALUED)

The platform said last week’s decision by the Karnataka High Court lets police issue “arbitrary” content removal orders through the online portal, called Sahyog. The ruling was in response to a petition by X, filed in March, that challenged the government and the system, which the company described in court as a “censorship portal.”
India launched Sahyog (“assistance” in Hindi) in late 2024 to automate content takedowns and allow government agencies to directly order social media platforms to remove content they deem unlawful. Companies including Google, Meta, and ShareChat have joined the portal, but X has so far refused to comply.
The portal “circumvents Section 69A of the IT Act, violates Supreme Court rulings, and infringes Indian citizens’ constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression,” X’s Global Government Affairs account wrote in a post on Monday.
Section 69A of the IT Act governs how the federal government can order content to be blocked online, and includes procedural safeguards such as written orders and judicial review.
“The Sahyog enables officers to order content removal based solely on allegations of ‘illegality,’ without judicial review or due process for the speakers, and threatens platforms with criminal liability for non-compliance,” X wrote.
In its ruling last week, the court rejected X’s “free speech” argument, saying that the social media platform, as a foreign company, does not have the constitutional right to freedom of expression under Indian law.
“We respectfully disagree with the view that we have no right to raise these concerns because of our incorporation abroad — X contributes significantly to public discourse in India and the voice of our users is at the heart of our platform,” the company said. “We will appeal this order to defend free expression.”
X’s fight with the Indian government comes as Elon Musk works to expand his business footprint in the country. The billionaire recently launched Tesla in India, and secured final regulatory approval to roll out his satellite internet service, Starlink."

Tech is best known for cutting-edge companies that bring new technologies to the market. Investors tend to warm to these stocks and often bid them into stratospheric valuations.
Fortunately, despite record highs in the Nasdaq, investors can find low-valuation tech stocks that have suffered from either investor pessimism or a failure of investors to understand the growth potential of a market opportunity. Amid such conditions, one can likely put $5,000 to work profitably.
Meta Platforms
Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is at a crossroads. For now, it benefits from relatively rapid growth as it successfully sells more advertising due to the nearly 3.5 billion people who visit one of its social media sites every day.
However, that amounts to around 42% of the world's population, leaving relatively little room to grow its subscriber base and, by extension, its ad platforms. To this end, it pivoted into artificial intelligence (AI) in an attempt to leverage its vast stores of data to train AI models.
It allocated between $66 billion and $72 billion in 2025 alone to capital expenditures, most of which will probably bolster its AI business. The company claims approximately $47 billion in liquidity, and the additional $19 billion it generated in free cash flow in the first half of 2025 does not include capex spending. Thus, it can probably afford this investment.
Meta is also making this move at a time when the digital ad business, which makes up almost 98% of revenue, is still relatively strong. In the first two quarters of 2025, it reported $89 billion in revenue, a 19% yearly increase.
In comparison, its costs and expenses grew by about 10% over the same period. Consequently, its $35 billion in net income surged 36% from year-ago levels.
Indeed, the stock has remained on a growth trajectory, rising by approximately 35% over the last year.
Despite that increase, its 27 P/E ratio is below the S&P 500 average of 31 and arguably low considering Meta's rate of profit growth. Even with the high nominal share price investors can buy three shares of this stock for around $2,230 while they wait for the company to diversify its revenue sources.
AT&T
After years of struggles, it might finally be time for investors to consider AT&T (T -0.19%) stock. AT&T has long stood out as one of the few telcom providers, with Verizon Communications and T-Mobile US as its only major competitors.
The drawback to its situation is that it must invest billions of dollars annually to update and maintain its extensive wireless and fiber networks, and it has not always allocated this capital effectively. In the previous decade, costly missteps into satellite TV and content delivery cost AT&T tens of billions of dollars. That eventually forced it to abandon a 35-year streak of annual dividend increases.
However, the company now focuses primarily on its wireless and fiber operations. Also, marketing strategies like bundling wireless and broadband services have enhanced its competitive edge.
That approach has helped it stabilize its dividend, which, at $1.11 per share annually, offers a dividend yield of 3.9%. In the year's first half, it generated $7.5 billion in free cash flow, allowing it to cover the dividend costs of $4.1 billion during that time. That means it can likely afford to maintain or possibly increase this payout.
Admittedly, AT&T reflects the more measured growth rates of mature companies, and its financials show slow but steady progress. In the first half of 2025, revenue of $61 billion rose 3% compared to the same period in 2024.
Its slower cost and expense growth boosted its operating income. Also, for the first two quarters of 2025, lower interest costs and unrealized gains from investments helped take the net income attributable to AT&T to $8.9 billion, a 26% yearly increase.
Those improvements were enough to take its stock 33% higher over the last year, and at a P/E ratio of just 16, it is likely not too late to take one's remaining $2,770 and buy just over 97 shares to take advantage of the growing opportunity in AT&T stock."

By slashing interest rates to near-zero levels and expanding its balance sheet via quantitative easing (QE), the Fed injected trillions of dollars into the financial system. This liquidity tsunami didn’t just stabilize markets; it supercharged them.
Nowhere was this more evident than in the tech sector, where companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. used the cheap capital to innovate and give their growth a good boost via good old-fashioned financial engineering.
The buyback boom: Financial engineering on steroids
Apple alone has repurchased US$704-billion worth of its own stock over the past decade. That figure exceeds the market capitalization of all but 13 companies globally.
Microsoft, meanwhile, spent US$199 billion on buybacks during the same period. Meta and Alphabet Inc. added another US$207 billion and US$317 billion, respectively. In total, just four tech giants deployed more than US$1.4 trillion on buybacks.
These buybacks reduced share counts, artificially boosted earnings per share (EPS) and helped sustain lofty valuations. In essence, companies used Fed-fuelled liquidity to build new products or expand operations and to juice their stock prices, like athletes on performance-enhancing drugs.
Enter AI: A new kind of financial loop
Now, with the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in full swing, we’re witnessing a new form of circular financial engineering. Companies aren’t just selling products; they’re investing in their customers to ensure those customers can afford to buy more of their products to justify forward growth and implied valuations.
Take Nvidia Corp., OpenAI Inc. and Oracle Corp. Nvidia recently announced a US$100-billion investment in OpenAI to build out 10 gigawatts of AI data centres. That’s equivalent to the output of 10 nuclear reactors and involves deploying four million to five million graphics processing units (GPUs), essentially Nvidia’s entire annual production.
But here’s the twist: OpenAI will use that capital to buy Nvidia’s chips. Nvidia gets equity in OpenAI and OpenAI gets the hardware it needs to scale. It’s a self-referential loop as Nvidia invests in OpenAI, which then turns around and spends that money on Nvidia’s products.
Oracle is also in on the game, committing US$40 billion to purchase Nvidia chips for OpenAI’s Texas-based Stargate data centre. Oracle will lease the facility to OpenAI under a 15-year agreement, effectively financing its own future revenues."

The second edition of GlobalData’s ESG Executive Briefing states that carbon offset purchases are ramping up and that 2030 net-zero targets “are just about still achievable.” However, it adds that, while AI-fuelled emissions growth has begun to slow, Big Tech’s announced capital expenditure plans suggest this will be temporary, with data centre construction to accelerate.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
As such, the report says: “The key question for climate targets will be whether enough carbon offsets can be bought to match emissions in 2030 and beyond. In its 2024 reporting year, Microsoft massively increased its offset purchases, contracting an amount above its full-year Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.”
Microsoft is alongside Google, Meta and Apple in having committed to achieving carbon neutrality across their value chains by 2030. Its example demonstrates that purchasing carbon offsets at high volumes is feasible – but contracted offsets must still be delivered, and maintaining a pipeline of offsets to the high standards for purchasing set by Microsoft and Google poses a challenge.
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are another tool being employed by Big Tech in pursuing emissions targets. These allow firms to fund renewable projects in exchange for securing clean energy to help meet their sustainability goals.
“PPAs will continue, and there will be more for small modular reactors,” the report states. “Their ability to provide consistent power makes them a good match for data centres, which run 24 hours a day. Big Tech has already signed PPAs for small modular reactors, but most will not be up and running until 2030 or later.”

Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataGlobalData adds that other barriers to PPAs are tariffs on equipment made in China and delays in connecting new plants to power grids.
The report states that the long-term challenge for Big Tech will be reducing Scope 3 emissions.
“Expanding net-zero strategies to companies across the value chain will be needed to reduce Scope 3 emissions,” it explains. “Big Tech must help smaller suppliers sign their own PPAs for low-carbon energy. Suppliers to Big Tech can expect procurement standards on emissions to tighten over time, requiring suppliers to achieve emissions reduction at or below a certain emissions intensity.”"

(Reuters) -Belgian chip research hub imec will appoint Patrick Vandenameele as its new chief executive with current CEO Luc Van den hove becoming chairman, the company told Reuters on Monday.
Belgium's imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has made the change to help it adapt to the changing demands of artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaking, Vandenameele said in an interview.
The rising influence of AI is reshaping the company's priorities as it seeks to deepen its ties with cloud computing providers.
Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta (META.O), and Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O), known as hyperscalers, control about half of the world's data‑center capacity and are rapidly expanding their market share as AI build‑outs surges.
This AI boom has created demand for new, more efficient chips to fill their multibillion-dollar data centres.
""They are screaming for solutions to scale up, scale out, and to do this at a sustainable power balance. Power is the key problem in this case,"" Vandenameele said.
Belgium's imec matches the most advanced and expensive tools of makers like ASML and Applied Materials, with chipmakers and designers like TSMC, Nvidia, Apple and Google.
VENTURE & CHIPS ACT
Vandenameele, 52, began his career at imec in the 1990s, co‑founding four startups—three based on imec technology before taking on senior leadership roles at firms like Qorvo, and Huawei.
Under his leadership, the company plans to launch more spin-offs based on its technology. It will give start-ups earlier access to its chipmaking lines and help European deep tech firms overcome its funding and manufacturing hurdles, he said.
""The barrier for these small companies to get access to leading-edge technology is usually very high because they need to compete with huge companies to get access to these fabs"", Vandenameele said.
The Belgium-based lab is building a sub-2 nanometer chip pilot line, using funding of 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) from the European Union's act, to give European tech firms access to manufacturing technology that would otherwise be economically unattainable.
The research organisation is closely associated with top lithography equipment maker ASML, which was founded the same year across the nearby Dutch border, in Veldhoven.

Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), one of the U.S.’s largest telecommunications providers, is strengthening its market position with solid financial results, dividend growth, and new technology partnerships.
The company reported strong second-quarter performance in 2025, prompting an upward revision of its guidance for adjusted EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow. Building on this momentum, VZ announced a 1.8% dividend increase to $0.69 per share, effective November 3, 2025. This marks the 19th straight year of dividend growth and results in a 6.3% yield, supported by a sustainable payout ratio of about 63%. With its consistent track record, Verizon is often highlighted among the most undervalued stocks in the telecom sector.
Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is also leading efforts to shape the future of wireless technology. It co-launched the Industry 6G Alliance with partners including Ericsson, Samsung, Nokia, Meta, and Qualcomm to drive the next generation of connectivity. Meanwhile, its 5G Ultra Wideband network continues to expand into mission-critical applications. As part of its Verizon Frontline initiative, the firm recently deployed more than 950 5G-enabled smartphones to the Tampa Police Department to enhance emergency communications.

Late last week, data analytics platform Similarweb shared this chart, which sparked much celebration among the Threads community.
As you can see in this graphic, according to Similarweb’s data, Threads is now on par with X, in terms of daily active users, and is even exceeding it on some days.
That suggests that Threads is winning the broader race, which means that Meta’s bet that it could build a better Twitter was right, and is now paying off, in a potentially significant way.
So Threads is the winner, right? Threads is seeing more usage over time, and is beating out Elon’s social media project, which, by contrast, is steadily in decline.
Well, in general, that’s probably true, but it is worth noting a few considerations within this assessment.
First off, Similarweb data is not definitive, it’s based on estimates, extrapolated from its available pool of data resources.
As explained by Similarweb:
“Our machine learning algorithms are fed by millions of websites’ and apps’ first-party analytics, both proprietary and sourced through partners.”
So Similarweb has access to a wide range of sources, both through direct users and partners, which it then extrapolates, through its own methodology, to come up with its numbers.
But even at “millions” of inputs, that’s only a fraction of the information when you’re talking about 150 million users, as in this chart above. Essentially, Similarweb only has access to a portion of the actual data, and while those insights do generally provide an indicative view of broad trends, Similarweb data is not definitive, so you can’t necessarily take such as being entirely indicative of performance.
There’s also the matter of web traffic, which Similarweb also shared in the same update:
As you can see in this chart, X sees a lot more web visits than Threads, though the chart itself is indicative of the potential discrepancies in Similarweb data.
According to X’s own data, 88.55% of its usage comes via the mobile app, so only a small fraction of X’s traffic is coming via web usage. But this chart, based on Similarweb estimates, suggests that X is seeing close to 150 million daily web visits, versus less than 150 million app users.
How do those figures possibly match up? The most obvious answer would be that these are not unique visitors on the web, which skews the stats significantly, but Similarweb’s explainers don’t seem to account for the discrepancy.
For comparison, SEMRush estimates suggest that X is seeing around 123 million website visits per month, while X itself claims that it serves 250 million users daily.
So there are some fairly wide shifts in interpretation here, which makes it hard to know what’s more indicative, or accurate in this respect.
What I would reiterate is that Similarweb estimates are generally indicative of trends, so even if Threads hasn’t overtaken X in average users quite yet, it’s clearly on track to do so in the near future.
Which is a credit to Meta’s app building expertise, and its constant improvement of Threads to make it a more valuable platform for tracking and discussing the latest trends. It’s not there yet, as many people still flock to X during major incidents, as shown with the recent murder of Charlie Kirk. But Threads is clearly improving, and driving more interest with a broader range of users.
As per their official claims, at last check, Meta reported that Threads is now up to 400 million monthly active users, while X claims that it’s serving 600 million monthly actives.
Given past discrepancies in X’s reporting, and its only auditable reported numbers showing a decline in usage in Europe, I doubt that X’s figure here is accurate, but either way, the trends point to Threads overtaking X in usage in the near future.
Does this really matter to your social media marketing approach?
Well, probably not, as you should be going where your audience is, and if the people you really want to reach are on X, then it may well be of more valuable to your business, regardless of overall usage (note: you can track X trends, based on keywords, in X's pro analytics, though it's only available to Verified organizations).
But in terms of broader shifts, and what's happening within the social media sphere, it's worth noting where attention is turning."

As explained by Meta:
“Over the coming weeks, in response to recent U.K. regulatory guidance and following extensive engagement with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), we will introduce Subscription for no ads in the U.K. This will give people based in the U.K. the choice between continuing to use Facebook and Instagram for free with personalized ads, or subscribing to stop seeing ads.”
Under the new offering, U.K. users will have the option of paying £2.99 per month (or £3.99/month on mobile) to maintain ad-free access to its apps. That will ensure that Meta meets the latest regulatory guidance from the ICO, relating to freedom of data protection, and the capacity for British users to withhold their information if they choose, while also upholding its own revenue generation process.
Though this isn’t exactly the outcome that British privacy advocates had been hoping for.
Meta’s U.K. ad-free offering has been in discussion since March, when Meta settled a case with a British user who had objected to her data being used for ad targeting in the app.
In the original case, brought against Meta back in 2022, U.K. human rights campaigner Tanya O’Carroll argued that she has a legal right to object to the use of her personal data for direct marketing, as per U.K. consumer laws. Meta argued that its targeted ads don’t qualify as direct marketing, but eventually, it opted to settle the case, by ensuring that O’Carroll herself would not have her data used by Meta for ad targeting purposes.
Which was a technical win for O’Carroll, but not the broader victory that she’d been seeking. But stemming from this, U.K. officials have been working with Meta to expand this option to all users, which it’s now doing, by responding in the same way that it has in the EU, by giving users an option to pay a monthly fee to eliminate ads entirely from their Facebook and IG feeds.
“We’re making this change in response to recent regulatory guidance from the ICO. It will give people in the UK a clear choice about whether their data is used for personalized advertising, while preserving the free access and value that the ads-supported internet creates for people, businesses and platforms. Subscriptions, as an alternative to seeing personalized advertising, is a well-established and economically viable business model spanning many industries, from news publishing and gaming to music and entertainment. Having discussed with the ICO, Meta will offer Subscription for no ads at a price that is one of the lowest in the market.”
Privacy campaigners, however, have been pushing for Meta to offer a means to opt out of ad targeting requiring users to pay for such.
In Europe, Meta has received repeated pushback against its ad-free subscription plan, with some suggesting that the option undermines the focus of the GDPR, and its protections against “data capitalism.”
In response, Meta has revised the offering several times, and has cut the price of its ad-free subscription package significantly in order to appease EU regulators, and win broad support for the alternative.
But clearly, Meta is still facing an uphill battle to gain full support for the program in the region:
“EU regulators continue to overreach by requiring us to provide a less personalized ads experience that goes beyond what the law requires, creating a worse experience for users and businesses. In contrast, the UK’s more pro-growth and pro-innovation regulatory environment allows for a clearer choice for users, while ensuring our personalized advertising tools can continue to be engines of growth and productivity for companies up and down the country.”
Essentially, Meta’s argument is that if it’s going to let users opt out of ads, it should still be able to make money from them, if they want to continue using its services. Which, in terms of free market dynamics, is correct, and any move to force Meta to offers its services to users for free would imply that Meta is actually a utility, as opposed to a corporate offering.
But Meta is not government-owned, and cannot be measured on the same basis. So Meta is justified in pushing back against EU regulation, while the U.K. approach seems to be more in line with Meta’s thinking, that if it’s not allowed to process user data, then it should be free to charge an equivalent cost for access to its apps.
Evidently, Meta’s still looking to better align its EU ad-free offering with expectations. But in the U.K., now you can pay to avoid ads, and maintain data privacy, if you so choose.

Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI
This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.
It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.
The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.
OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs."

Constellation Energy Group (CEG), headquartered in Baltimore, is the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in the U.S., with 32 GW of capacity—70% from nuclear and the balance from natural gas, hydro, wind, solar, and storage. Its nuclear fleet alone provides ~20% of all U.S. nuclear generation, making it the single largest source of carbon-free power in the country. CEG counts hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google among its key customers and recently announced a 20-year deal with Meta beginning in 2027.
The company also expects to close its acquisition of Calpine in Q4 2025 and has authorized a $400 million share repurchase program, reflecting strong capital allocation discipline. In Q2, revenue grew 11.3% to $6.1 billion, while GAAP EPS rose 3.5% to $2.67. Nuclear output declined modestly to 45,170 GWh due to unplanned outages, but CEG continues to operate at a 94% capacity factor, underpinned by heavy investment in digital optimization through AI dispatch systems and digital twin modeling, which are designed to enhance margins and operational efficiency.
Growth prospects are further supported by secular demand from AI, electrification, and reshoring, alongside favorable policy tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act. While CEG trades cheaply on sales, its 33.8x 2025 EPS multiple is elevated relative to peers like NextEra, Duke, and Southern, though its scale and carbon-free focus justify a premium. With EPS growth forecast at 9.1% in FY25 and 18% in FY26, CEG offers a compelling combination of stability, growth, and strategic positioning in clean energy despite near-term technical downside risks.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG) by jackandjillonthehill in March 2025, which highlighted margin expansion, strong ROE, and undervaluation despite nuclear power volatility. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 47% since our coverage. This is because rising demand and higher pricing played out. The thesis still stands as Oliver | MMMT Wealth shares a similar but emphasizes on strategic growth drivers.
Constellation Energy Corporation is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 79 hedge fund portfolios held CEG at the end of the second quarter which was 83 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock."

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP
Millions of users were eligible to file claims back in 2023, after lawsuits accused Facebook of mishandling personal data and sharing it with advertisers and data brokers.
The case goes back to the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, when the political consulting firm harvested user information to build voter profiles. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, has denied any wrongdoing.
Here’s what to know about how much of a payment to expect, and if there are tax implications.
Are you getting paid, and how much?
According to a Sept. 5 court filing, the average payout is $29.43, and the maximum is capped at $38.36. The size of each payment depends on how long you used Facebook between May 24, 2007 and Dec. 22, 2022.
People were given an “allocation point” for every month they were active on Facebook. That means people who stuck with Facebook the longest will collect the largest checks, up to the maximum amount.

If you’re getting a payout, you’ll get an email from “Facebook User Privacy Settlement Administrator” with a subject line reading: Facebook User Privacy Settlement – Settlement and Distribution Status Update. The email should include your claim ID.
But hold on, don’t spend it all at once.
According to the IRS, nearly all income is taxable under Internal Revenue Code Section 61, except for when there is a specific exclusion.
One major exclusion comes from Section 104, which allows amounts received for personal physical injuries or physical sickness to be excluded from gross income.
The CBS reporting on the Facebook payout does not describe that the settlement was for physical harm or illness; instead, the settlement claims involve privacy violations and the sharing of user information with third parties."

Here’s what went down 25 years ago that ultimately burst the dot-com boom
The comparison between today’s artificial intelligence frenzy and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s has become impossible to ignore. As AI companies command valuations reaching into the hundreds of billions—minting dozens of new billionaires in 2025 alone—and tech giants pour unprecedented sums into data centers, investors and analysts are asking a similar question: Are we watching history repeat itself?
The similarities are striking. Like the internet companies of two decades ago, AI firms today attract massive investments based on transformative potential rather than current profitability. Global corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to research from Stanford University, with the sector growing thirteenfold since 2014. Meanwhile, America’s biggest tech companies—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capital expenditures this year alone, much of it for AI infrastructure.
Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company is valued at approximately $500 billion despite launching ChatGPT just two years ago, acknowledges the parallels. “
Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”
But what actually caused the dot-com bubble to burst in March 2000, and what lessons does it offer for today’s AI boom? Let’s take a stroll down memory lane—or, if you weren’t born yet, some plain ole history.
The perfect storm of 2000
The dot-com crash wasn’t triggered by a single event, but rather a convergence of factors that exposed fundamental weaknesses in the late 1990s tech economy. The first critical blow came from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates multiple times throughout 1999 and 2000. The federal funds rate climbed from around 4.7% in early 1999 to 6.5% by May 2000, making speculative investments less attractive as investors could earn higher returns from safer bonds.
The second catalyst was a broader economic recession that began in Japan in March 2000, triggering global market fears and accelerating the flight from risky assets. This one-two punch of higher rates and global uncertainty caused investors to reassess the astronomical valuations of internet companies.
But the underlying problem ran much deeper: Most dot-com companies had fundamentally flawed business models. Commerce One reached a $21 billion valuation despite minimal revenue. TheGlobe.com, founded by two Cornell students with $15,000 in startup capital, saw its stock price jump 606% on its first day of trading to $63.50, despite having no revenue beyond venture funding. Pets.com burned through $300 million in just 268 days before declaring bankruptcy."

But that news proved to be just one splash amid a sea of waves.
Reports indicate that Oracle and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) are in talks on a $20 billion cloud computing deal. And Oracle and OpenAI are building on their $300 billion partnership with the rollout of five new data centers custom-built for artificial intelligence (AI).
Despite its expensive valuation, here's why Oracle continues to stand out as one of the best AI stocks to buy among the ""Ten Titans,"" which is the ""Magnificent Seven"" plus Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix.
1. Oracle is building the future of AI data centers
Established cloud giants like Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) Azure, and Alphabet's (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) Google Cloud serve a variety of general compute customers. However, Oracle's data centers are specifically designed for AI.
Oracle is a good example of why lacking a first-mover advantage isn't a deal-breaker. Oracle's data centers are newer and faster. And it's bringing over 70 of them online in just a few years, which is why it expects OCI growth to reach an inflection point in fiscal 2027.
When it comes to high-performance computing, OCI is magnitudes faster than alternatives -- saving customers time and money for AI workflows. Oracle achieves this advantage by embedding native versions of its database services into the big three clouds to boost performance. This is why I'm predicting Oracle will become the top cloud for AI by 2031, making it one of the best cloud computing stocks to buy for risk-tolerant investors.
2. Oracle is landing major deals with leading hyperscalers
Oracle is winning high-value contracts across the AI landscape, from Meta Platforms to OpenAI. Reports are that Oracle's $20 billion deal with Meta involves a multiyear agreement for training and deploying Meta's AI models.
The OpenAI deal is the backbone of Oracle's five-year roadmap. But it depends on OpenAI raising money -- as OpenAI is unlikely to turn free cash flow positive anytime soon.
Fortunately, that doesn't seem to be a problem. OpenAI plans to transition from a nonprofit to a Public Benefit Corporation, which is a corporation with philanthropic and community impact requirements rather than a purely profit-driven objective. On Sept. 22, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) announced up to a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to power next-generation AI models. This is great news for Oracle, as its cloud growth depends on OpenAI's financial stability.
On Sept. 23, OpenAI said that it is teaming up with Oracle and SoftBank on five new AI data centers under its Stargate AI infrastructure platform. In that press release, OpenAI put a dollar figure of over $300 billion on its 4.5-gigawatt (GW) Stargate capacity partnership with Oracle. The company also said that Stargate's capacity will be nearly 7 GW and over $400 billion of investment over the next three years, and reach $500 billion of committed investment, or 10 GW of committed capacity, before the end of the year. This 10 GW number is the same figure used by Nvidia in its strategic partnership announcement, which aims to invest progressively in OpenAI as each GW is deployed.
This is all great news for Oracle, which will collaborate with Nvidia to develop data center and cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI. This powerhouse of a partnership provides a clear runway for sustained earnings growth for Oracle. And it justifies its aggressive capital expenditure ramp-up and leveraged balance sheet.
3. Oracle continues to grow its partnerships with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
An integral aspect of Oracle's investment thesis is that its competitors are also its customers. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are major Oracle customers through OCI's multicloud offering.
Multicloud enables customers to manage workloads across multiple cloud providers while leveraging the Oracle database. The idea is to minimize data movement by bringing AI to the dataset rather than bringing the dataset to the cloud provider. Again, this goes back to Oracle embedding native versions of its database into the big three cloud providers, which reduces latency costs and lowers compliance risk.
AI is an exciting investment opportunity because it unlocks a new way to leverage data through large language models across text, images, audio, video, and code. By bringing the dataset to the source rather than moving it around, AI models can operate much faster and at a lower cost, which helps Oracle win business even if customers use a rival cloud provider instead of OCI.
Oracle is worth its premium price
Oracle is a pure-play business-to-business company. It doesn't have a lot of moving parts and consumer-facing divisions like Amazon, Microsoft, or Alphabet. It can win business by offering its integrated suite of cloud, database, and enterprise software services, or leverage its database services with a different cloud giant.
Based on multicloud alone, Oracle already had a compelling investment thesis before the announcements with Meta and OpenAI. But these deals take Oracle to the next level by showcasing the value of its next-generation data centers and its cross-selling opportunities for enterprises.
Oracle stock has run up a lot in recent years. It's far from cheap at 46.1 times forward earnings. However, the price is arguably worth it for investors who believe that Oracle will play a pivotal role in OpenAI's data center buildout for years to come."

Meta Platforms Investment Narrative Recap
To be a Meta Platforms shareholder today, you need conviction that Meta’s heavy investment in AI and smart wearables will unlock new growth, while offsetting rising costs and navigating global regulatory pressures. The recent launch of AI-powered Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses signals Meta’s ambitions in consumer hardware, but the news doesn't materially alter the company’s most important short-term catalyst: continued growth in digital advertising, nor does it ease the biggest risk, which is margin pressure from escalating AI infrastructure spending. Among the recent announcements, Meta’s expanded partnership with Circus SE, extending the use of Llama AI models for defense applications across more countries, stands out for its relevance. This extension reinforces Meta’s position in enterprise and government AI while highlighting how the company seeks diversification beyond core ad revenues amid regulatory and margin headwinds. Yet, in contrast to all the headline innovations, investors should pay close attention to signs that rising AI capital expenditures may outpace near-term revenue gains and...

Seemingly not, as nervousness about the state of the world – its worsening conflicts, its economic turbulence – drives growing hordes of investors to seek shelter in the preeminent safe-haven asset. The yellow metal notched a sixth straight weekly increase, boosted by inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds and a risk-off tone in broader markets.
Gold has climbed more than 40% year-to-date, and banks including Goldman Sachs (GS) see the rally continuing toward the $4,000 mark. Silver (SI=F) is enjoying a winning spell too, threatening the hallowed $50 level.
It wasn't such a golden week for chancellor Rachel Reeves, already under huge pressure to plug a yawning hole in the public finances, as the OECD sounded the alarm on growth and inflation. The international policy forum predicts that inflation in the UK will average 3.5% this year, higher than any other G7 nation including the US which is grappling with the effects of Trump's tariff regime.
The OECD sees the pace of price increases easing to 2.7% next year, still well above the Bank of England’s 2% target. It also predicts higher taxes and reduced government spending will act as a drag on economic growth.
There was some good news for the beleaguered chancellor though, as plans for a second runway at Gatwick Airport were given the green light. Reeves, keen to seize on any positive news ahead of her November budget, said the £2.2 billion plan would create thousands of jobs and help “kickstart the economy”. Our readers' poll suggested most of you agreed.
Let’s take a closer look at these and other stories making the financial headlines in the last few days.
Key moments from the last week
UK braced for highest inflation in G7, says OECD
The latest projections from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development made for grim reading, with the UK seen heading for inflation of 3.5% this year as it struggles with flagging growth. That figure – 75% above the Bank of England's target – is seen easing to 2.7% in 2026.
Consumer prices are being pressured by an increase in the minimum wage and employers' national insurance contributions, as well as hikes in utility bills.
The forecasts will add to the burden on Rachel Reeves ahead of her next budget, slated for 26 November, as the government sets out on a growth mission.
Remember the metaverse? Or rather, the hype around a future concept that may come to be known as the metaverse? That hype has so far failed to live up to the (virtual) reality as tech companies like Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have struggled to make the digital universe profitable."

Analysts at Morgan Stanley stated that they had previously been bullish on the stock expecting GenAI to accelerate growth in its Digital Media Business. However, Adobe’s revenue growth has failed to keep up the pace despite rolling out new AI features quickly.
Direct AI monetization has been slower than hoped as the company focused on adoption first. There is also considerable uncertainty regarding how much GenAI advancements will benefit Adobe’s business.
Overall, the firm still believes in Adobe’s core strengths and AI potential, but sees limited near-term catalysts amid competitive pressure from Meta and Google which could become material.

“Our prior OW thesis on Adobe was predicated on the ability for the company to successfully innovate on, deliver, and eventually monetize Generative AI functionality across the customer base, leading to an inflection in Digital Media ARR growth to the ~mid-to-high teens. Since that upgrade, we have seen the Digital Media ARR growth directionality diverge from the pace and quality of innovation being embedded within the product portfolio, leading us to the following conclusions: 1) Direct ‘Gen AI’ monetization has lagged initial investor (and our) expectations, explained by Adobe’s propensity to foster ubiquity and broad adoption of the technology ahead of monetization; and 2) there is relative uncertainty in a sizable portion of the Adobe ARR base where we lack confidence in Gen AI advancements being a net positive. Related to the latter, as we recently discussed (See Software: Checking the Software Pulse – “I’m Not Dead Yet”), the recipe for turning around sentiment on the legacy SaaS applications group necessitates vendors demonstrating a convergence of stabilization in the core business plus the ability for Gen AI capabilities to enhance and expand their addressable market opportunity. As such, decelerating Digital Media ARR growth despite 1) an accelerated pace of innovation, 2) ramping usage and adoption metrics against that innovation, and 3) the benefit from price action has left investors questioning Adobe’s ability to demonstrate this equation. To be clear, we continue to believe in both Adobe’s core value proposition and the expanded value capture opportunity Gen AI presents for complex, multi-channel marketers. However, given a lack of visibility into buckets of the base where competitive pressures (from both external Diffusion Engines and the likes of Meta/Google) could prove more material, we struggle to paint a clear catalyst path to DM ARR growth acceleration.”"

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) may be turning to a rival for a little AI help. According to The Information, the company has held talks with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) about using its Gemini models to improve ad targeting.
The discussions have involved Meta staffers and Google Cloud employees and, while early, highlight concerns that Meta's in-house AI tools may be trailing competitors. Some at Meta have even floated tweaking Gemini and Gemma with Meta's ad data, while others see a role for Gemini in understanding content.
The market reaction was split: Meta slipped 0.5% in after-hours trading, while Google gained about 1%. The news also comes just weeks after Meta signed a six-year, $10 billion cloud deal with Google Cloud, showing how even direct rivals are finding ways to overlap.
Meta's communications chief Andy Stone downplayed the report, saying the company regularly benchmarks outside tools but continues to rely on its own proprietary ad-targeting systems. Still, the fact that talks are happening underscores how much pressure there is in the AI race."

Instead, it involves buying stakes in high-quality businesses with durable moats, strong financials, and the ability to adapt to emerging trends -- and holding those stakes for the long term. These companies can reward shareholders across generations.
Here are two such stocks that have the potential to create generational wealth.
1. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) is currently targeting online search, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) -- three markets that are already worth hundreds of billions of dollars each, and that have all been expanding rapidly for several years. With a market capitalization of over $3 trillion, $95 billion in cash on its books, and $66.7 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow, Alphabet boasts exceptional financial strength. This enables it to build cutting-edge AI infrastructure, scale up its Waymo autonomous driving project, invest in other tech projects, and still have money to reward its shareholders with dividends and share repurchases.
AI is already helping Alphabet fend off competition for its flagship Google Search offering. With new features such as AI Overviews (AI-generated summaries with links to their sources) and AI Mode (an end-to-end AI search experience), the company is reshaping how its users look for information. AI Overview now reaches over 2 billion monthly users and generates nearly 10% more queries when shown. AI Mode -- which is still rolling out in other countries -- has quickly scaled to 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. and India.
YouTube, which has led the U.S. streaming market by watch time for over two years, has diversified Alphabet's revenue mix by combining a dominant advertising engine with a fast-growing subscription business across Premium, Music, and YouTube TV. With Shorts engagement exceeding 200 billion daily views and YouTube ads viewed on connected TVs that let viewers shop directly from the ads they see, YouTube is positioned to become an even larger driver of Alphabet's revenue.
Google Cloud is also emerging as a significant catalyst for growth. In the second quarter, Google Cloud's revenue grew 32% year over year to $13.6 billion, while operating margin expanded from 11.3% to 20.7%. With an annual run rate of over $50 billion and a $106 billion backlog at the end of the second quarter, Google Cloud is playing a crucial role in driving enterprise AI adoption. Alphabet has also integrated its Gemini-powered agents across its Cloud products, and many large enterprises are already using them to improve their efficiency, security, and software quality.
Alphabet's full-stack AI strategy is also proving to be a significant competitive advantage. The company offers GPUs, its own custom TPUs (tensor processing units), and advanced AI models and tools, such as the Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models on its leading global network of AI-optimized data centers.
Between those powerful businesses and the long-term growth potential of its Waymo business, its wearable AI devices, and its emerging subscription services businesses, Alphabet has built a robust and diversified ecosystem.
Despite the many pros, Alphabet trades at 21.4 times forward earnings, which is lower than the S&P 500's multiple of 23.7. Based on all these factors, Alphabet looks like a stock worth buying now and holding for the long term.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) remains a dominant force in the social media and digital advertising landscapes. With over 3.4 billion people using at least one of its applications daily, the company enjoys unmatched reach, which is helping drive user engagement and monetization.
The strength of the business is all too obvious. In the second quarter, its revenues grew 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. Operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to 43%, while free cash flow was $8.5 billion. The company distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and spent $9.8 billion on share repurchases while continuing to invest aggressively in its AI initiatives.
Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming Meta's central growth engine. The company formed Superintelligence Labs, bringing together its Foundations team (focused on foundational AI models), product team, and the Facebook AI Research team to accelerate next-generation AI development. It is also investing heavily in building several multigigawatt-scale data center clusters to dramatically increase its capacity to train and deploy AI models. These include the Prometheus cluster, which is scheduled to become operational in 2026, and Hyperion, which is expected to scale up to 5 gigawatts within the next few years.
These efforts are also showing results. While its Andromeda model helps retrieve and display the most personalized and relevant advertisements for each user, the new Generative Ads Recommendation system (GEM) helps rank the best ads for users after retrieval. These AI-powered initiatives helped improve ad conversions by nearly 5% on Instagram and 3% on Facebook.
Besides offering them better ad targeting, Meta is also supporting advertisers with AI-powered creative tools. Approximately 2 million advertisers are now using Meta's generative AI features to create more impactful and efficient ad campaigns. Since these tools are especially valuable for smaller advertisers with limited budgets, they are helping to expand Meta's advertiser base.
Its virtual AI assistant, Meta AI, already has over 1 billion monthly users across its applications. Growing adoption of that software opens the door to new monetization avenues in content discovery, search, and messaging.
Meta currently trades at about 28.5 times forward earnings, which is not an inexpensive valuation. Additionally, the company is exposed to increasing regulatory and legal risks in Europe. Finally, some are concerned about its massive planned capital expenditures for 2025 and 2026. However, considering its scale, financial strength, and ambitious AI strategy, the stock could still prove to be an exceptional generational play for those who buy it now."

Patients in Southern California are receiving diagnoses and treatment plans generated by artificial intelligence through Akido Labs' ScopeAI proprietary system, according to MIT.
The startup uses large language models to transcribe conversations between patients and medical assistants, suggest potential diagnoses, and propose treatment steps that physicians later review and approve.
How AI Is Changing Patient Appointments in Healthcare
ScopeAI relies on multiple LLMs, including Meta's (NASDAQ: META) Llama and Anthropic's Claude, which guide medical assistants through structured questions during the visit, MIT reported. The system creates a concise note for doctors that includes a primary diagnosis, two or three alternatives, and recommended next steps such as prescriptions or referrals.

""Our focus is really on what we can do to pull the doctor out of the visit,"" Akido Labs Chief Technology Officer Jared Goodner told MIT.
Akido Labs CEO Prashant Samant added that this model allows doctors to see four to five times more patients compared to traditional clinics, a critical boost as aging populations strain health systems and Medicaid funding faces reductions.
ScopeAI is already active in cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care, along with Akido's street medicine team serving Los Angeles' homeless population.
Street medicine specialist Steven Hochman told MIT that the system allows him to deliver opioid treatment approvals remotely, helping patients receive medications within 24 hours, something he called ""unheard of.""

AI in Healthcare Raises Concerns About Inequality and Oversight
The model works largely because Medicaid allows doctors to approve ScopeAI treatment plans after the fact. Other insurers often require direct doctor-patient interaction, which Emma Pierson, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, said could worsen disparities.
""I am broadly excited about the potential of AI to expand access to medical expertise. It's just not obvious to me that this particular way is the way to do it,"" Pierson told MIT.
Samant said the difference stems from how insurance rules are structured and added that faster AI-assisted visits may still benefit Medicaid patients who usually face long delays."

Commenting on the event, analysts at Morgan Stanley and UBS pointed to durable growth opportunities, though with different emphasis on valuation and risks.
Morgan Stanley noted that every data center coming online drives bandwidth requirements, with data center bandwidth expected to grow at a 35% CAGR between 2024 and 2028.
Analyst Meta Marshall highlighted Ciena’s recent co-design deal with Meta, where the DCOM technology delivers “99% space savings and 30% power reduction,” and said adoption could extend across all of Meta’s new facilities, with other hyperscalers also showing interest.
Marshall also pointed to the scale of Ciena’s recently announced AI training deal, worth several hundred million dollars, using 100km interconnects and 800ZR technology, reinforcing its ability to capture meaningful share across AI opportunities.
The Nubis acquisition was flagged as strengthening Ciena’s positioning for inside-the-data-center opportunities, reducing power and latency while expanding component integration.
The bank further noted that Ciena is doing more services work with hyperscalers and neoclouds, which provides better visibility into real demand since it ensures equipment is being put into use rather than stockpiled.
UBS focused on the AI-driven uplift in demand, estimating that Ciena’s bookings and Meta deal provide visibility into at least 17% revenue growth in the coming year.
The bank said “Cloud/AI is likely to drive at least a mid 30s% bandwidth CAGR the next several years,” with knock-on effects benefiting service providers in markets such as North America and India.
UBS, however, cautioned that markets appear to be pricing uninterrupted AI-related capex growth, pointing out that investors are effectively underwriting a 20% CAGR over the next decade after data center spend doubled from $300 billion in 2023 to an expected $600 billion.
Analysts led by David Vogt described this assumption as aggressive given Ciena’s shares already trade at ~36x forward earnings, well above the historical average.
Service providers remain a key pillar of growth. Morgan Stanley noted spending has normalized, with telcos expected to expand edge networks to support agentic AI applications.
UBS added that Ciena’s portfolio, including reconfigurable line systems and multi-rail products, should benefit as providers seek to maximize fiber capacity."

Meta Platforms Inc. (META, Financials) is giving U.K. users of Facebook and Instagram a new choice: watch ads as usual or pay a small monthly fee to remove them.
Starting in the coming weeks, people will be able to subscribe for 2.99 (about $4) a month on the web, or 3.99 if they sign up through Apple or Google's app stores. The higher mobile price reflects the cut both companies take from in-app purchases.
The option is limited to users over 18. Those who don't want to pay can keep using Facebook and Instagram with ads.
The change comes after regulators in Europe fined Meta for how it handles personal data in its advertising business. Earlier this year, the European Commission hit the company with a 200 million penalty under the Digital Markets Act and warned of further daily fines if Meta's consent or pay model doesn't meet requirements.
The U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office said it welcomed the new approach, which it says makes Meta's data use clearer. The regulator also noted that Meta agreed to lower its subscription price for U.K. users after talks.
Meta has argued that European regulators are pushing too far by demanding less personalized ads, which it says weakens the experience for both users and advertisers.
For Meta, the new U.K. rollout will be a test of how many people are willing to pay for a social media experience without ads and how much pressure regulators are prepared to keep up on its core business model."

Well, the first thing you need to know is that the president signed an executive order last night declaring that his plan to sell Chinese-owned TikTok's US operations to US and global investors has got the green light from both Washington and Beijing.
The new US company will be valued at around $14 billion. That's well short of what many analysts had estimated. Some had said the value should be closer to $40 billion.
Now, the owners of the new group are thought to include Larry Ellison's Oracle, Michael Dell, and Rupert Murdoch.
Now, the next thing you need to know and keep an eye on is defense stocks, especially in Europe.
Why? Well, European diplomats warned the Kremlin this week that NATO is ready to respond to further violations of its airspace with full force, including by shooting down Russian planes.
Now, remember, three MiG-31 fighter jets flew over Estonia according to officials. Russia denies this and says it's not trying to test NATO.
All right, the third thing you need to know about is that Meta has had discussions with Google about the possibility of using its Gemini models to improve its ad business.
That's according to a report in The Information.
Remember that Google and Meta directly compete in the online advertising market, and Meta has already been considering partnerships with Google and OpenAI to improve its AI features."

The subscription will cost £2.99 per month when purchased via web browsers or £3.99 per month through iOS and Android devices, with the price difference reflecting fees charged by Apple and Google. For each additional account in a user’s Meta Accounts Center, an extra fee of £2 per month on web or £3 per month on mobile will apply.
Meta emphasized that users who choose not to subscribe can continue using Facebook and Instagram for free with personalized ads, maintaining access to existing ad control tools like Ad Preferences.
The company is implementing this change following ""extensive engagement"" with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Meta noted that subscribers’ personal data will not be used to show them ads.
In its announcement, Meta contrasted the UK’s ""pro-growth and pro-innovation regulatory environment"" with the European Union, where the company claims regulators are ""overreaching"" by requiring a less personalized ads experience.
Meta highlighted the economic impact of its advertising technologies in the UK, stating they were linked to £65 billion in economic activity and over 357,000 jobs in 2024 alone. The company also cited that every pound spent on Meta ads drives an average of £3.82 in revenues for UK businesses.
The new subscription option will be rolled out to UK users aged 18 and over in the coming weeks.

The move will give users a choice between paying a monthly fee or continuing to use the services for free with targeted advertising, a model that has faced increasing scrutiny from European regulators.
The subscriptions, priced at 2.99 pounds ($3.99) a month on the web and 3.99 pounds on iOS and Android, reflect similar offerings Meta has rolled out in the European Union to comply with data privacy rules.
The latest announcement comes after the country's data protection authority raised concerns about how platforms handle personal information for advertising.
Meta said the ad-free tier was designed to give people more control over their online experience while preserving the company's ability to provide free services funded by ads. Users who choose the paid plan will not see ads and their data will not be used for advertising purposes.
The shift reflects a broader industry trend as tech firms face pressure from regulators over the use of personal data and targeted ads. Apple and Alphabet's Google have also made changes in response to privacy demands, reshaping how online advertising works.
Meta's ads business accounted for about 98% of its $164.5 billion in revenue last year, making the balancing act between privacy rules and ad sales central to its growth strategy.

The ad-free subscriptions, which will be introduced in the coming weeks, will cost £2.99 per month when purchased on the web or £3.99 from a smartphone.
Users can choose to continue to use Meta’s apps for free, but must agree to keep seeing adverts.
Meta said it would begin to notify all UK Facebook and Instagram users over the age of 18 that they have the option to subscribe to its apps. When someone subscribes, their personal information will not be used for advertising, it said.
The paid-for tier follows years of legal battles and wrangling between regulators and Mark Zuckerberg’s tech giant over online privacy.
In March this year, Facebook settled a legal dispute with a British Facebook user who had sued the tech giant over its targeted digital advertising. As part of the deal, it agreed to stop using her personal data.
Tanya O’Carroll had claimed Meta had breached rules with its “unfair terms”, including agreeing to hyper-targeted advertising in exchange for accessing its apps. She had claimed she had started seeing adverts linked to motherhood and pregnancy weeks after she found out she would be having a baby in 2017.
In the aftermath of the case, Meta said it was considering offering a paid subscription tier as an alternative.
Meta has previously launched other forms of subscriptions, including charging £9.99 for users who want to have their profile “verified”.
In a blog post, Meta said the changes would “give people in the UK a clear choice about whether their data is used for personalised advertising”.
Meta’s targeted advertising has previously come under scrutiny. In 2022, it was forced into a settlement with US regulators over claims its tool for targeting housing advertising discriminated over race, religion and sex. The tech giant has a received criticism from women who have received adverts about babies or pregnancy after suffering miscarriages or after a stillbirth.
The company said it was launching the tier after talks with the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s data watchdog, which it said had taken a “constructive approach”.
However, Meta also attacked European watchdogs over their approach to digital advertising. Meta has offered ad-free subscriptions in Europe since 2023 in response to a series of rows with regulators over personalised digital advertising.
Earlier this year, the EU fined Meta €200m (£174m) over its subscription product.
The EU argued Meta’s “consent or pay” approach was not compliant with its digital laws, and ordered the tech giant to give users the option of accessing Facebook for free while still seeing adverts that did not harvest as much personal data."

The US technology giant said UK users aged over 18 will in the coming weeks see notifications allowing them to subscribe to Facebook and Instagram for £2.99 a month via web browsers, or £3.99 on Apple’s iOS or Android mobile systems, for the first Meta account, to stop seeing ads.
It stressed that while social media services are personalised, when someone subscribes, their personal data “will not be used to show them ads”.
Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta said the option was more expensive to subscribe on iOS and Android due to the fees that Apple and Google charge through their purchasing policies.
Users will still be able to choose to see personalised ads and access Facebook and Instagram for free.
It comes after guidance from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which said it welcomed the move by Meta.
In March, Meta agreed to stop targeting a UK campaigner with adverts based on her personal data in a legal agreement which avoided a trial in the High Court in London.
Human rights campaigner Tanya O’Carroll had filed a lawsuit against Facebook’s collection of personal details.
The ICO had supported her stance and at the time agreed that Meta was “processing Ms O’Carroll’s personal data for direct marketing purposes”.
It added that profiling related to those purposes meant Ms O’Carroll had the “absolute right to object to such processing” under UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules.
The ICO has since been engaging with Meta on the issue.
Meta said: “We’re making this change in response to recent regulatory guidance from the ICO.
“It will give people in the UK a clear choice about whether their data is used for personalised advertising, while preserving the free access and value that the ads-supported internet creates for people, businesses and platforms.”
It added that its ad-free subscription charges were “at a price that is one of the lowest in the market”.
An ICO spokesperson said: “We welcome Meta’s decision to ask users for consent to use their personal information to target them with ads.
“This moves Meta away from targeting users with ads as part of the standard terms and conditions for using its Facebook and Instagram services, which we’ve been clear is not in line with UK law.
“People must be given meaningful transparency and choice about how their information is used.
“At the same time, the ICO recognises that online platforms, like every business, need to operate commercially.”"

Let's look at two companies that have climbed to the top of their fields and still have huge opportunities in front of them.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) didn't become the leader in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure by accident. The company actually planted the seed long before AI went mainstream when it created its CUDA software program to allow its chips to be programmed, and then gave it away free to universities and research labs that were doing early work on AI. That led to the foundation of AI code for graphics processing units (GPUs) being written on CUDA.
It didn't stop there, though. On the networking side, it created the NVLink interconnect system that basically allows its GPUs to act as a single unit. It's a proprietary system, so it only works with Nvidia's GPUs.
Nvidia later acquired Mellanox to boost its networking capabilities even further. This also gave it the technology it needed to provide some of the turnkey solutions it offers clients today.
And if you thought that was the end of it, Nvidia is also looking to protect the massive lead it has in the AI chip space. It recently invested in and formed a partnership with Intel to gain access to its central processing unit (CPU) technology, and just announced an up to $100 billion investment in OpenAI. OpenAI had started to develop its own custom AI chips with the help of Broadcom, so you can bet this massive investment from Nvidia will help keep its chips front and center with one of the companies planning the biggest AI infrastructure build-outs.
CEO Jensen Huang thinks AI infrastructure spending could grow to as much as $4 trillion in the next few years. With data center spending showing no signs of slowing, Nvidia looks well-positioned to continue to be one of the largest AI winners.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has become one of the biggest AI winners, as it has found a way to use the technology to keep users glued to Instagram and Facebook. Social media today is just as much about entertainment as it is about keeping up with friends and acquaintances, and Meta has been able to tap AI to improve its recommendation engines to feed users more content that entertains them and keeps them on its sites longer.
At the same time, Meta is also giving advertisers more powerful tools to create ads and target users, which is leading to better results and higher ad prices. This combination of more ad inventory and higher ad prices, meanwhile, is fueling strong revenue growth, with ad sales up 22% year over year last quarter.
However, that's just one leg of the Meta growth story. The company has just started introducing ads to WhatsApp and Threads. WhatsApp has a massive 3 billion users, and while most are international, and thus tend to have lower monetization rates, this is still a big opportunity. Meanwhile, the company is still building out Threads, so there is still a lot of potential user growth ahead.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also swinging big on the future. He wants to build what he calls ""personal superintelligence"" and is investing aggressively in AI talent and infrastructure. Add in the company's push into consumer smart glasses and its still-active metaverse bet, and it is taking multiple swings in the hopes of hitting a home run.
For long-term investors, the combination of steady ad growth and optionality from its big bets makes Meta a breakout stock worth holding over the next decade."

But years after the hype, the reality has been more muted.
Virtual reality VR headsets aren’t flying off shelves, and companies investing billions are still struggling to make the digital universe profitable. So is the metaverse dead, or could AI breathe new life into it?
Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms (META), via its Reality Labs division (formerly Oculus VR), has poured tens of billions into virtual and augmented reality development.
Yet recent financials underline the difficulty of turning that vision into profit, because by the end of 2024, Reality Labs had amassed almost $70bn (£52bn) in cumulative losses, and quarterly results have remained weak.
Estimates show that Reality Labs’ operating losses run into the billions, while its sales remain in the low hundreds of millions, a stark contrast to the massive capital invested. Developing VR, augmented reality (AR) and hardware remains an extremely expensive undertaking, even for one of tech’s largest players.
Developments in AI, however, could revitalise the concept of the metaverse and make it more commercially viable. By enabling human creators to earn royalties via micropayments when generative AI recombines their work, AI could turn virtual environments into a scalable creative economy.

Ken Jon Miyachi, founder of Bitmind, told Yahoo Finance UK that generative AI is drastically reducing the cost and time needed to build high-fidelity digital environments. Instead of large teams designing 3D assets, characters and narratives, AI can generate them on demand.
Miyachi said this makes the metaverse “less speculative and more commercially viable” and could enhance AR by identifying and adding context to the physical world.
However, he warned that AI alone isn’t enough for mainstream adoption. Robust infrastructure and hardware remain critical, and investors must focus on projects that provide real user utility.
""Investors need to understand how projects leveraging AI are providing real differentiation and user utility. There are security and authenticity risks. As the line between human-created and AI-generated assets blurs, ensuring provenance and trust will be essential. We expect standards like cryptographic watermarking and verification to become part of the metaverse technology stack,"" Miyachi said.

The forums gathered industry leaders from Meta, Volvo Car Malaysia, and Writers At Work to discuss the transformative role of AI, data-driven insights, and the WhatsApp Business Platform in reshaping customer engagement.
Messaging businesses is a global trend, with 1 billion people connecting with business accounts weekly across Meta's messaging services. Vicky Yiu, APAC Strategic Partnership Manager of Meta, emphasised the potential of messaging for customer engagement. ""Kantar's 2024 Business Messaging Usage Research reveals that 79% of global online adults message businesses on a weekly basis. The WhatsApp Business Platform, including 'WhatsApp Flows', provides interactive in-chat experiences, enabling efficient and user-friendly interactions such as data collection and scheduling.""
Albert Tiong, Regional Program Manager of Meta illustrated that ""Meta Business Messaging leads to better results across the customer lifecycle compared to legacy channels. From discovery and awareness to consideration, purchase, and re-engagement, two-way conversations drive improved marketing, sales, and support outcomes."" Additionally, he noted that businesses utilising paid messaging products have experienced a year-on-year doubling in numbers.
Patricia Yaw, Director of Marketing Operations and PR of Volvo Car Malaysia , is driving the brand's digital transformation by proving that even legacy industries can evolve through conversational commerce. By adopting a centralised chat strategy, Volvo Car Malaysia now delivers a personalised customer experience entirely through WhatsApp. This strategic shift—from fragmented communication channels to a unified WhatsApp Business Platform—debuted during the brand's much anticipated EX30 launch, which set new benchmarks for the brand, achieving its highest-ever test drive bookings, media impressions, and PR share of voice.
""Using WhatsApp has demonstrated impressive performance metrics, including a remarkable 93% read rate. The click-through rate (CTR) is seven times higher than that of email,"" She said. Additionally, the chatbot effectively manages one out of every four discovery questions, showcasing its efficiency in facilitating user inquiries.
As the conversation shifted from technology to outcomes, Patricia reflected on the impact of WhatsApp on the two launches. The ""Choose your 90"" launch event recorded a 90% turnout rate and also achieved the highest lead-to-opportunity conversion rate."

The Greenlight Capital founder said the trillion-dollar build-out by companies overall, such as Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and OpenAI is so extreme that the eventual returns are highly uncertain. While he expects AI will ultimately surpass today’s bullish forecasts, he questioned whether “spending a trillion dollars a year or 500 billion a year” will deliver good outcomes for the firms making those investments.

“The numbers that are being thrown around are so extreme that it’s really, really hard to understand them,” Einhorn said. “I’m sure it’s not zero, but there’s a reasonable chance that a tremendous amount of capital destruction is going to come through this cycle.”
OpenAI’s Sam Altman has said he wants to spend “trillions” on infrastructure over the “not very distant future,” while Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg has also talked about spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers. In February, Apple said it plans to spend $500 billion domestically over the next four years.
Einhorn drew a sharp line between the long-term importance of AI and the immediate economics of funding it. He said many projects will be built, but investors may not see the payoffs they anticipate.
At a panel discussion hosted by Simplify Asset Management at the New York Stock Exchange Thursday evening, Einhorn broadened his critique beyond AI spending. He pointed to weak job growth and stagnant productivity as signs that a recession may be looming.
“I’m a little bit more of the view that we’re heading into or have been in a recession,” he said. “Jobs aren’t growing and the workweek is shrinking and productivity is not that great.”
He also reiterated his longstanding claim that markets are fundamentally broken, a condition he argued has eroded the investment process itself.

Think TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every single video you come across is essentially AI slop.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the rollout of Vibes in a post on Instagram that features a series of AI-generated videos. In one video, a group of fuzzy-looking creatures hops from one fuzzy cube to another. In another, a cat kneads some dough. A third video shows what appears to be an ancient Egyptian woman taking a selfie on a balcony overlooking Ancient Egypt.
According to Meta, as you browse the new feed, you’ll see AI-generated videos from both creators and other users. Over time, Meta’s algorithm will begin to show you personalized content.
You have the option to generate a video from scratch, or remix a video that you see on your feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.
Meta’s chief AI officer Alexandr Wang shared in a post that the company has partnered with AI image generators Midjourney and Black Forest Labs for the early version of Vibes, while Meta continues developing its own AI models.
Since no one really wants an AI-generated version of TikTok, the user comments in response to Zuckerberg’s announcement were about what you’d expect. The top comment on the post reads: “gang nobody wants this,” while another popular comment says: “Bro’s posting ai slop on his own app.” Another comment reads: “I think I speak for everyone when I say: What….?”
The new feed likely won’t be welcomed by users, especially since the rise of AI technology has caused social media platforms to become flooded with AI slop. The problem has become so widespread that companies like YouTube are now looking to crack down on the issue. This makes Meta’s move particularly puzzling, given that the company said earlier this year that it was tackling “unoriginal” Facebook content and advised creators that they should focus on “authentic storytelling,” not short videos offering little value.
The launch of the new feed comes as Meta has recently invested heavily in revamping its AI efforts amid concerns that it was falling behind competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.
In June, the company restructured its AI efforts to create an AI division called “Meta Superintelligence Labs” following notable staff departures. Meta then reportedly reorganized its AI division into four groups to focus on foundation models, research, product integration, and infrastructure."

These discussions highlight Meta’s ongoing challenges with its own AI development, pushing the company to consider external technology solutions while its recently restructured AI teams work to improve internal capabilities.

The discussions about integrating Google’s AI into Meta’s advertising business remain in early stages and may not necessarily result in a formal agreement between the two tech giants.

The Morningstar Global Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Index, which provides exposure to about 50 top AI companies, is up 37% in 2025 (as of Sept. 19). The S&P 500 index has increased by 13% over that same time frame.
Because of how much growth there has already been in the AI sector, most of these stocks aren't cheap. But that doesn't mean you're out of luck with investment opportunities. The global AI market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% through 2032, according to research by Fortune Business Insights.
So, which companies are best positioned to capitalize on that growth? Here is a pair of AI stocks worth considering for your portfolio.
1. Nvidia
There are plenty of AI success stories out there, but none has been bigger than Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). It's the top company by market cap and the first to reach a value of $4 trillion.
Nvidia's size and the fact that it's trading at a high valuation (39 times forward earnings) scare off some investors. However, it has consistently delivered excellent results over the last two-plus years, beating earnings expectations and seeing revenue rise by more than 50% year over year for nine consecutive quarters.
Most of that is data center revenue as tech companies invest in Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for the training and inference of their AI models. Nvidia is the dominant player here -- estimates put its share of the AI chip market at 85% to 90%.
Nvidia is also taking steps to expand its reach. It recently invested $5 billion to take a roughly 5% stake in Intel. Intel is the leader in CPU market share, and data centers need AI GPUs and CPUs. Intel will now be making custom CPUs for Nvidia, allowing Nvidia to advance its technology.
On a negative note, China has reportedly banned its tech companies from using Nvidia AI chips due to tensions with the U.S. That effectively cuts Nvidia off from a major market. However, trade talks between the U.S. and China are ongoing, so it remains to be seen if this is a long-term issue.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), which owns Facebook, Instagram, and several other companies, is making a significant push into AI. So far this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has:
- Hired away top AI talent from rival companies to form Meta Superintelligence Labs, with pay packages reportedly as high as $300 million.
- Invested $14.8 billion to take a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data labeling start-up.
- Committed to investing at least $600 billion in U.S. data centers and infrastructure through 2028.
Meta is incorporating AI through various aspects of its business. It launched a Meta AI assistant and has woven generative AI tools into its existing apps, including Messenger and WhatsApp. Meta Glasses are getting an upgrade to AI smart glasses. And it now offers AI advertising tools to enhance and optimize campaigns.
Advertising is also how Meta can afford to invest so heavily in AI. Its revenue over the trailing 12 months is $179 billion, with about 98% of that coming from advertising. Ad revenue gives Meta a sizable war chest -- it has also generated $50 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.
It hasn't all been smooth sailing for Meta lately. The tech giant's Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses recently failed in two live demos, leading to an awkward moment for Zuckerberg and bad publicity for Meta's AI ambitions. However, the glasses are getting positive early reviews.
Overall, this is a business with strong financials that's betting big on AI to enhance its products and services. It's also not overly expensive, trading at 28 times forward earnings. With its valuation, cash flow, and AI ambitions, Meta is one of the better tech investments currently available."

Singapore is turning up the pressure on Meta Platforms (META, Financials), warning the company it could face fines of up to S$1 million ($776,000) if it doesn't roll out stronger protections against impersonation scams on Facebook.
Officials said the deadline is the end of this month, with additional daily fines of S$100,000 possible if Meta misses it. The directive follows a spike in scams that used images and videos of government officials to trick users into clicking on fake ads and profiles.
Meta said impersonation and celeb-bait ads are against its policies and that it removes them when found. The company added it is working with law enforcement to take action against scammers, though regulators say progress has been too slow.
The order is the first under Singapore's new Online Criminal Harms Act, which took effect last year. Authorities indicated that scams on Facebook went up a lot between mid-2024 and mid-2025, which led to tougher standards.
For Meta, this case indicates that regulators in Asia are making it harder for platforms to avoid responsibility. As the cost of compliance goes up, investors are watching this development closely."

Entergy has a number of things going for it, from Meta’s construction of a massive $10 billion data center in Louisiana to the ongoing build-out of liquified natural gas export facilities. It’s growing a little faster than the average stock in the S&P with a slightly lower price to earnings multiple.”

Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) produces and distributes electricity and natural gas, generating power from gas, nuclear, coal, hydro, and solar sources. When a caller inquired about the stock during a July episode, Cramer replied:
“Man, I’ll tell you, ETR’s had such a run. I know it can go higher, but it, I mean… you know, Meta likes it and everything. I’m going to say right here, [don’t buy, don’t buy].”

(Reuters) -Google and app developer Flo Health will pay $56 million to settle a class action claiming they violated the privacy of millions of Flo app users by collecting information about their menstrual health cycles and using it for targeted advertising.
Settlement terms were disclosed late Tuesday in San Francisco federal court, and require approval by U.S. District Judge James Donato.
Google, a unit of Alphabet, would pay $48 million, while Flo would pay $8 million. Flurry, a now-defunct mobile analytics company, settled for $3.5 million in March.
A fourth defendant, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, did not settle, and was found liable by a jury on August 4 after a two-week trial.
Meta is expected to appeal the verdict. A hearing to consider damages is scheduled for September 30. Google settled two weeks before the trial began, and Flo settled shortly before the trial ended. Both denied wrongdoing.
Flo app users alleged that between November 2016 and February 2019 Flo shared personal information related to their menstrual periods and pregnancies with the other defendants, despite promising to keep it confidential.
They said this violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act, which carries statutory penalties of $5,000 per violation, theoretically justifying billions of dollars in damages.
Google said in a statement on Thursday that no data were used for ads, and customers are prohibited from using Google Analytics to collect health information protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Meta declined to comment. Flo and lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The case is Frasco et al v Flo Health Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 21-00757.

finnhub,META,2025-09-25T16:41:37,Threads is developing a tool that lets you ‘tag’ its algorithm to configure your feed,Threads is developing a new feature that would let users control what they see by 'tagging' the algorithm.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a7760a4b1f49ed2d9ef480f424beee26662d4728cebb0b4dcc811fe663435a2e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/threads-developing-tool-lets-tag-164137344.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/threads-developing-tool-lets-tag-164137344.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/threads-developing-tool-lets-tag-164137344.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Instagram is experimenting with bringing tools to control your own algorithm to Threads, its X rival.
The feature was uncovered while in development by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who discovered the code and told TechCrunch it’s related to the algorithm configuration tools that are also coming to Instagram. When contacted, Instagram confirmed the product is still an internal prototype for the time being and is not currently being tested with users.
However, the Instagram account being used for this feature is live at @threads.algo and is followed by several Meta engineers.
According to Paluzzi’s findings, Threads users would be shown a screen explaining they could tag this account to tell Threads what they want to see more or less of in their feed.
The idea is similar to one Elon Musk recently said was coming to X. In a post, Musk suggested that a future version of his platform would allow users to tag Grok — X’s AI chatbot — to adjust their feed in real time, and that the X algorithm would be “purely AI by November.”
On Threads, the algorithm-configuration feature is tied to Instagram’s larger efforts to revamp its main app to emphasize Reels and recommendations. Instagram announced Wednesday that it will soon allow users to more directly control the app’s algorithm by choosing which topics they’d like to see more or less of in their feeds.
This isn’t Instagram’s first effort aimed at letting users configure their experience. The company launched alternative feeds (Following and Favorites) in 2022, and on Threads, it began allowing users to switch between their main For You feed and a Following feed back in 2023.
These changes come after years of congressional hearings examining social media’s influence on youth through platform algorithms. These concerns have also influenced the creation of more modern, open social networks like Bluesky, where users pick their algorithm and moderation options.
In an Instagram post on Wednesday, Instagram head Adam Mosseri demonstrated how users could click a button at the top of their feed to access an interface where they could select suggested topics they’d like to see more of, or search for and enter their own. Users could also type in topics they didn’t want to see as much of from the same screen."

In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenues climbed 55% year over year to $3.3 billion, lifting overall cloud revenues (IaaS + SaaS) 28% to $7.2 billion. Management expects OCI to expand 77% to $18 billion in fiscal 2026, with a roadmap projecting growth to $144 billion within five years. These ambitious targets are supported by a record $455 billion in Remaining Performance Obligations, driven by multibillion-dollar AI contracts with leading customers like OpenAI, NVIDIA, AMD and Meta.
To meet this demand, Oracle is investing $35 billion in CapEx during fiscal 2026 to build 37 new multi-cloud data centers. This expansion is closely aligned with hyperscaler partnerships and accelerating AI workloads, ensuring Oracle can convert backlog into recurring revenues. At the same time, innovations such as the upcoming Oracle AI Database, which integrates large language models directly into its database platform, are broadening its cloud offering.
Rising AI workloads require massive computing power, and enterprises are increasingly adopting multi-cloud strategies. Oracle’s ability to integrate across AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure reinforces the appeal of its cross-platform approach.
Risks remain around heavy spending, margin pressure and competition from established rivals. Still, with robust contract wins, expanding infrastructure and the Zacks Consensus Estimate predicting revenue growth of 16% in fiscal 2026 and nearly 21% in fiscal 2027, Oracle’s aggressive cloud expansion looks well-positioned to deliver strong upside.
Oracle’s Rivals in the Race for Cloud Growth
Microsoft MSFT Azure competes with Oracle in the cloud domain by leveraging its deep integration with existing Microsoft products, like Office 365 and SQL Server, and its hybrid-cloud strength to dominate enterprise workloads, boasting cloud revenues of $47 billion and 39% Azure growth in the recent fourth-quarter fiscal 2025. Microsoft’s vast ecosystem, rapid AI innovation and cross-industry adoption strengthen its cloud leadership against Oracle. With diverse services, hybrid capabilities and global reach, Microsoft Azure is positioned as a superior long-term choice.
Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud Platform (GCP) competes with Oracle by excelling in data analytics, AI/ML and open-source technologies. With leadership in BigQuery, TensorFlow and Kubernetes, GCP provides developer-friendly, innovative tools ideal for data-driven companies. Its transparent pricing and powerful AI capabilities increase appeal, although OCI often sets higher standards when it comes to database performance and traditional enterprise workloads. While GCP's legacy systems may require further refactoring, Google's relentless innovation positions it as a strong choice for modern, cutting-edge cloud adoption."

The US company reiterated its opposition Thursday to the sweeping rules, which the EU implemented last year to protect consumers and ensure that big tech firms don’t abuse their dominance of internet spheres from mobile apps to search engines. In a blog post, the iPhone maker stressed it was complying but urged regulators to look more closely at their impact on people and companies across the region. Apple went further in remarks submitted separately to the European Commission, asking the watchdog to repeal or scale back the regulation.
Apple has previously made clear its opposition to the Digital Markets Act, which lays out a series of dos and don’ts for the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google Search, Apple’s Safari, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook among others. It’s intended to head off competition violations by tech firms before they take root, and fines for violations can be as much as 10% of global revenue — or as much as 20% in the case of repeated breaches.
“It’s become clear that the DMA is leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU. It’s exposing them to new risks, and disrupting the simple, seamless way their Apple products work together,” Apple wrote in its blog post. “The DMA also isn’t helping European markets. Instead of competing by innovating, already successful companies are twisting the law to suit their own agendas — to collect more data from EU citizens, or to get Apple’s technology for free.”
Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Tariffs: QuickTake
Apple singled out the danger to users from being forced to host external payments services and allow sideloading — or the downloading of apps from third-party marketplaces. That may expose iPhone users to malware or scams, it argued. Allowing other companies to request user data — as stipulated under the Act — may compromise sensitive information, it said.
The commission said it will not repeal or change the DMA in response to Apple’s complaints.
“Apple has contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application,” the European Commission’s spokesperson for tech sovereignty, Thomas Regnier, told reporters on Thursday. “We get it that companies want to defend their profits at all costs, but that’s not what the DMA is about — the DMA is about giving consumers in the EU more choice and giving our businesses the possibility to compete fairly.”"

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Mitchell Green, Lead Edge Capital founding partner, said in a program on CNBC early August that Meta Platforms is one of the best stocks to play the AI trade. The analyst highlighted the company’s active user count and margins.
“We’re sitting here today and after yesterday’s, you know, earnings pop. Facebook is a $2 trillion company growing. What did earnings grow yesterday? I think topline grew like 20 or something like that. So, not only are they seeing they’re making investments, but they’re seeing margins increase as well. You know, the DAU count at Facebook is absolutely incredible. I think you play the best way to play AI is go buy the big hyperscalers yourself. And and they’re not crazy expensive on an earnings.”
META stock is up by about $5 since the analyst’s comments. The stock is up 26% so far this year.
Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) biggest strength remains its huge user base, which continues to grow despite record levels. The company has 3.43 billion monthly active users as of March, up 6% year over year. This equals about half of the world’s total population, giving the company immense power for monetization and data processing.
Another overlooked element in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) business is its ads growth. The company, which depends on advertising for 98% of its revenue, is growing at a rate of 21% YoY.
First Eagle Global Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among other social-media platforms—reported strong revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, driven by increases in both ad impressions and price per ad. The company continued to aggressively invest and hire in AI, even as it develops its core advertising businesses. We believe these results demonstrate Meta’s ability to focus on both profitability and efficiency in conjunction with ongoing investments in the core ad business, the metaverse and other AI applications.”
While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

It's backing the companies that make AI possible: the foundries producing the chips, the platforms deploying the models, and the software keeping it all running.
Think of AI as a huge construction project. You need the raw materials, the builders who know how to use them, and the inspectors making sure nothing collapses. The market has been so obsessed with the architects' drawings that it has overlooked the suppliers getting rich on every project. Here are three companies positioned to profit regardless of which AI applications ultimately dominate.
The chip monopoly
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%) sits at the center of the AI supply chain. In the second quarter, revenue climbed 39% year over year to $30.1 billion, while net income surged 61%.
Advanced process technologies below 7 nanometers now make up 60% of wafer revenue, up from 52% a year earlier -- a shift that expands margins as demand for cutting-edge chips accelerates.
What makes TSMC formidable isn't just scale but flawless execution. Intel is still racing to catch up, and Samsung is fighting for scraps, while TSMC fabricates the silicon that powers Nvidia's AI leadership.
Its Arizona expansion helps hedge geopolitical risk without sacrificing technical dominance. Taiwan tensions remain the wild card, but investors are paying for manufacturing supremacy, not a speculative story.
The platform play
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has turned AI from buzzword into bottom line. In the second quarter, revenue rose 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, powered by AI-driven ad targeting that squeezes more value from each impression. The company is channeling more than $17 billion per quarter into AI infrastructure, an investment made possible by its enormous free cash flow.
Meta's advantage is immediate monetization. While rivals tout AI potential, Meta is already delivering it through better ad matching, smarter content recommendations, and deeper user engagement.
Its billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp create a flywheel effect: More data improves AI, which improves results, which supports higher ad rates. Emerging bets like Ray-Ban smart glasses and augmented reality remain optional upside rather than core to the thesis.
The pick-and-shovel winner
Datadog (DDOG -0.67%) solves AI's hidden problem: complexity. As companies deploy dozens of AI models across hybrid clouds, someone needs to monitor performance, track costs, and prevent outages. Datadog's observability platform does exactly that, driving 28% revenue growth to $827 million last quarter with $165 million in free cash flow.
The beauty is recurring revenue from essential services. Companies can delay AI experiments, but can't stop monitoring production systems.
With 3,850 customers paying over $100,000 annually, Datadog has pricing power and expansion potential as AI workloads multiply. The stock's valuation is rich at 61 times forward earnings, but you're buying the tollbooth on the AI highway, not another speculative model maker.
The portfolio approach
For conservative investors, Taiwan Semiconductor offers the cleanest exposure to the AI theme: dominant market position, expanding margins, and everyone needs their chips. Meta provides the balanced play with immediate AI monetization, offsetting infrastructure investment. Datadog suits growth investors who are comfortable paying up for recurring software revenue tied to AI expansion.
The smartest approach might be owning all three. TSMC manufactures the foundation, Meta builds the platforms, and Datadog keeps everything running. Together, they capture AI's value chain without betting on which model or application wins.
Because in technology gold rushes, the biggest winners rarely dig for gold. They sell the picks, provide the maps, and control the infrastructure. These three companies have positioned themselves exactly there: profiting from AI's expansion regardless of who strikes it rich."

- Global ad spending will be more robust than previously anticipated in 2025, with full-year growth now expected to increase 7.4% to $1.17 trillion, according to a Q3 update from WARC.
- The upward revision, the first WARC has issued in over a year, marks a 1.2 percentage-point jump from prior estimates published in June. Driving momentum are digital-first ad platforms, which will snap up nine in 10 dollars of incremental market growth, and what WARC described as a “pre-tariff windfall.”
- Social media is attracting a plurality of new ad dollars at 40.6% market share, while non-retail search and retail media will take up 22.2% and 21.5% of spend, respectively. Just three companies — Google owner Alphabet, Amazon and Meta — are positioned to take over half (55.8%) of global ad spend this year, excluding China.
Dive Insight:
As other industry watchers slash their ad-spending outlooks for 2025, WARC foresees more robust growth than anticipated just a few months ago. The researcher’s Q3 report, which takes a global versus U.S.-specific view, highlights how the digital triopoly of Amazon, Google and Meta continues to entrench its dominance amid a period of deep economic uncertainty. The findings also indicate that marketers enacted a blitz of activity in the second quarter, a “pre-tariff” period where many brands rushed to stockpile inventory and promote value ahead of expected price hikes.
On the latter point, social media spending spiked 20.2% year over year in Q2, well above prior projections of 12.4% growth and the equivalent of about $4.9 billion in additional value. WARC tracked “sharp” increases in spending from retailers on social media in Q2, with the category pouring more dollars into Meta-owned Instagram (18.8% growth) and TikTok (56.8% growth), whose future in the U.S. is still being sorted out. Retail is now the largest category on both of those platforms, per WARC monitoring assisted by Nielsen. Technology and consumer electronics, other verticals vulnerable to tariffs, recorded notable lifts in spending on those sites as well.
“Despite economic headwinds, including disruption to global trade and reduced purchasing power among consumers, brands are doubling down on Meta, Alphabet and Amazon, while emerging players like TikTok are growing fast but from smaller bases,” said James McDonald, director of data, intelligence and forecasting at WARC, in a statement. “The global market is set to nearly double in value since the pandemic, underscoring the resilience of advertising in a tougher economic climate.”
Retail media is on track to grow 13.7% in 2025, achieving $175 billion in spend, or a 14.9% share of the total global market. Like other pockets of digital, just a few companies loom large in retail media, with Amazon primed to account for over a third (35.4%) of its advertising pie. That said, retail media’s upward climb is set for a “marked slowdown,” with an average rate of growth of 12.6% over the next few years.
By contrast, traditional media channels, including newspapers, broadcast TV and radio, remain on the wane. A big upshot from WARC is that digital has firmly entrenched itself as the leading advertising engine in the post-pandemic world despite repeated fits of macro volatility. The firm estimates that the nominal value of the global ad market will effectively double by 2027 compared to 2020 figures, reaching about $1.36 trillion.
Not everyone is as optimistic about 2025’s prospects as the impact of tariffs are more strongly felt by brands. U.S. automotive and retail spending on digital ads is sharply retreating due to the trade war, eMarketer said in a report published earlier this week that somewhat conflicts with WARC’s assessment. Total digital spending in the U.S. is forecast to grow 9.5% YoY to $338.27 billion, per eMarketer, a revision two percentage points lower than earlier estimates.
Informa, which owns a controlling stake in Informa TechTarget, the publisher behind Marketing Dive, is also invested in WARC. Informa has no influence over Marketing Dive’s coverage."

These picks cash in on the massive amount of money being spent on AI infrastructure, as well as other long-term AI opportunities.
The artificial intelligence investment trend is far from over, and I think these five can still crush the market moving forward.
Nvidia
What good AI investment list is complete without the king of AI, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%)? Nvidia has been the top AI investment pick since the arms race began in 2023 for good reason. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the gold standard to build AI models on, and management sees massive growth in the future.
During its Q2 conference call, Nvidia revealed that it expects the AI hyperscalers to spend around $600 billion on data center capital expenditures this year. With Wall Street estimating Nvidia's revenue will be $206 billion for its fiscal year, it's safe to estimate that Nvidia gets about a third of that spending.
However, management also projects that global data center capital expenditures could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, indicating that Nvidia may reach $1 trillion in sales. If that's the case, Nvidia is a no-brainer buy right now.
Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) is also vying for a piece of that pie. While GPUs are fantastic at performing all types of calculations, if a computing unit is only going to do one task during its serviceable life, then a GPU might be overkill. Instead, Broadcom is developing custom AI accelerator chips (which it calls XPUs) in tandem with the end user. This allows the customer and Broadcom to design the chip with the workload in mind, providing customers with more performance at a lower cost.
Momentum in this area is growing, as Nvidia's GPUs are incredibly expensive. While this isn't a sign that Nvidia's sales are going to tumble off a cliff, future AI spending may shift more toward purpose-built chips, which benefits Broadcom over the long run.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Neither Broadcom nor Nvidia can fabricate their own chips. Instead, they outsource that work to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%), the world's leading chip foundry. TSMC makes chips for nearly every big tech company around the world, and it has locked in that client base thanks to its top-notch execution and continuous innovation.
The company is slated to continue growing as long as we're using more technology and more advanced versions of it. This is a pretty safe bet, making Taiwan Semiconductor a safe and surefire investment too.
Alphabet
Switching more toward the application side, Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) has gone from a disappointment in the AI world to a leader in no time. Its generative AI model, Gemini, emerged as one of the best, despite being late to launch at the start of the AI arms race. Gemini has also been integrated into Alphabet's cash machine, the Google search engine, allowing this platform to modernize.
A huge concern with Alphabet was how its primary business would fare in the age of AI. With the seamless integration of AI search overviews, this will likely be enough AI horsepower to convince the masses to continue using Google. As a result, Alphabet's long-term future is secured, making it a strong investment now.
Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has been a big spender in the AI arms race. It's developing AI capabilities for its social media platforms, like Instagram and Facebook, so its dominant ad business can continue growing. Meta is heavily investing in tools that create ads that perform better, along with technology that keeps users on the platform longer, allowing its ad revenue to rise.
Furthermore, Meta recently announced its AI glasses, which could open up a new revenue stream for the company. Even if these flop, Meta's advertising business is rapidly growing (it rose 22% last quarter), making it a solid investment pick right now."

- Maxwell House is running a tongue-in-cheek campaign that rebrands the 133-year-old Kraft Heinz coffee label as Maxwell Apartment, per details shared with Marketing Dive.
- Consumers can purchase Maxwell Apartment coffee on Amazon, securing a year’s worth of product for less than $40, while supplies last. The offer includes rebranded canisters and a 12-month “lease.”
- The effort nods to the current tough economic climate while spotlighting the value of Maxwell House coffee. The campaign, with strategy and production led by agency Rethink, includes paid media across Meta and TikTok, a creator partnership and paid social content.
Dive Insight:
Maxwell House is having some fun with its name and the grim statistics around the possibility of younger generations owning a home in its latest campaign. The first-time homebuyer market share hit a historic low (24%), while home buyers’ ages hit an all-time high (56 years) in 2024, per data from the National Association of Realtors.
“We saw something fun hiding in plain sight — our brand has the word ‘house’ in it. But at a time when daily life has become more expensive, a lot of people are living that apartment life,” said Zachary Bautista, partner and group creative director at Rethink, in a statement. “Maxwell Apartment is our way of showing that great coffee doesn’t have to come with a premium price tag.”
The Kraft Heinz label is appealing to millennial and Gen Z consumers who perhaps can’t afford a house but can rent an apartment and a year’s supply of its coffee. The roughly $40 package, which includes rebranded tubs bearing the Maxwell Apartment name, is available for a limited time on Amazon beginning on National Coffee Day (Sept. 29). The offer looks to deliver value for coffee drinkers whose daily café trips can accumulate a steep price tag over the course of a year.
The campaign includes media buys across Meta and TikTok, paired with strategic audience targeting, putting Kraft Heinz among the growing ranks of CPG marketers that are adopting a social-first approach to marketing. Along with online video, the effort includes a creator partnership and paid social content.
“Maxwell House will always be affordable, but Maxwell House? In this economy?” a narrator says in one of the ads, before introducing Maxwell Apartment as the “same affordable coffee you love, now with an even more affordable name.”
Rethink led campaign creation, with PR and creator support from Zeno Group, paid media support from Carat and social support from The Kitchen, an in-house Kraft Heinz unit. The stunt rebrand is an extension of Maxwell House’s “Good to the Last Drop” platform. A second campaign, “Max Your Savings,” will launch via YouTube and The Trade Desk on Oct. 27.
Parent company Kraft Heinz this month announced plans to split into two companies, reversing much of the work of a $46 billion merger in 2015. One company will house sauces, spreads, seasonings and shelf-stable meals while the second will focus on grocery brands including Maxwell House, Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The latter will be overseen by Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera."

The agreement involves nonvoting shares tied to massive chip purchases and enough computing power for more than 5 million U.S. households, deepening the relationship between two of AI’s most powerful players.
Meanwhile, Google Cloud is placing a different bet entirely. While the industry’s biggest players cement ever-tighter partnerships, Google Cloud is hell-bent on capturing the next generation of AI companies before they become too big to court.
Francis deSouza, its COO, has seen the AI revolution from multiple vantage points. As the former CEO of genomics giant Illumina, he watched machine learning transform drug discovery. As co-founder of a two-year-old AI alignment startup, Synth Labs, he has grappled with the safety challenges of increasingly powerful models. Now, having joined the C-suite at Google Cloud in January, he’s orchestrating a massive wager on AI’s second wave.
It’s a story deSouza likes to tell in numbers. In a conversation with this editor, he notes several times that nine out of the top 10 AI labs use Google’s infrastructure. He also says that nearly all generative AI unicorns run on Google Cloud, that 60% of all GenAI startups worldwide have chosen Google as their cloud provider, and that the company has lined up $58 billion in new revenue commitments over the next two years, which represents more than double its current annual run rate.
Asked what percentage of Google Cloud’s revenue comes from AI companies, he offers instead that “AI is resetting the cloud market, and Google Cloud is leading the way, especially with startups.”
The Nvidia-OpenAI deal exemplifies the scale of consolidation sweeping AI infrastructure. Microsoft’s original $1 billion OpenAI investment has grown to nearly $14 billion. Amazon followed with $8 billion in Anthropic investments, securing deep hardware customizations that essentially tailor AI training to work better with Amazon’s infrastructure. Oracle has emerged as a surprise winner, too, landing a $30 billion cloud deal with OpenAI and then securing a jaw-dropping $300 billion five-year commitment starting in 2027.
Even Meta, despite building its own infrastructure, signed a $10 billion deal with Google Cloud while planning $600 billion in U.S. infrastructure spending through 2028. The Trump administration’s $500 billion “Stargate” project, involving SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, adds another layer to these interlocking partnerships."

(AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.
While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.
Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.
Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.
Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.
“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.
Private deals for public power supply
Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.
Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.
Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.
Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.
Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs."

Cloud service providers are accelerating in-house ASIC development to gain tighter control over performance and costs. DIGITIMES projects that between 2025 and 2029, the compound annual growth rate for high-end cloud ASICs will reach 21%, far outpacing GPUs at 7%.
Google and Amazon, both leading adopters, are pursuing vertical integration and platform strategies that convert compute resources into cost advantages for customers. Meta and Microsoft, after years of ASIC research, are also scaling deployments. While GPUs remain indispensable for training workloads, custom ASICs are steadily eroding their market share.
Packaging moves beyond TSMC
In advanced packaging, the non-TSMC ecosystem is rapidly gaining traction. By the fourth quarter of 2026, non-TSMC suppliers are projected to account for 31% of global CoWoS-class capacity, up from 26% in late 2024.
ASE, Amkor, and SJSemi are emerging with distinct competitive angles: cost and scale, the US-based manufacturing, and China's domestic demand, respectively. Intel is also pushing its EMIB technology, embedding silicon bridges in substrates to reduce costs and strengthen its ""made in America"" position. The result is a clear shift: high-end AI chips will no longer depend overwhelmingly on TSMC's packaging lines.
Memory costs surge with HBM4
On the memory side, cloud accelerators will begin adopting HBM4 in 2026. DIGITIMES estimates that average selling prices for HBM4 will be roughly 53% higher than HBM3E, pushing memory's share of total bill-of-materials costs above 50% for top-tier accelerators. Samsung is betting on advanced process technology and aggressive price cuts to win NVIDIA orders, directly challenging SK hynix's long-standing dominance, while Micron continues steady capacity expansion.
Three emerging opportunities
DIGITIMES highlights three major opportunities in this shifting landscape:
Custom ASIC solutions to give cloud providers stronger cost control.
Regionalized advanced packaging capacity to meet the US manufacturing and China localization demands.
High cost-efficiency HBM offerings to deliver affordable memory in a period of steep price inflation."

Instagram has grown to 3 billion monthly active users, according to announcements by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram Head Adam Mosseri.
This is a notable milestone for the Meta-owned platform, which hit 1 billion users back in 2018.
“If you look at the last few years, almost all of our growth has been driven by DMs, Reels, and recommendations,” Mosseri said in an Instagram video. “Because of that, we’re going to continue to focus on those products and reorient the app more around DMs, Reels, and recommendations over the next couple of months.”
While the emphasis on short-form video and recommendations from accounts users don’t follow has driven growth on Instagram, these changes have sparked some frustration among users who are more interested in seeing photos or other content from people they already know.
In the next few months, Mosseri said, Instagram will test a way for users to fine-tune the algorithm that recommends content on Reels — later, this feature may extend to other feeds on Instagram.
According to an early version of the feature that Mosseri shared, users will be able to toggle topics that the app thinks they are interested in.
Based on your activity, Instagram may decide to show you content around topics like college football, film photography, and chess, for example — but if your favorite team is struggling and you’re growing weary of college football reels, you can remove that topic from your algorithm. Instagram also plans to edit the bottom navigation bar of the app to replace the button for uploading content with a more direct link to your DMs.
As Meta faces ongoing legal challenges on the alleged anticompetitive nature of its WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions, the trial has surfaced internal emails that reveal more about the tensions between Facebook and Instagram. Instagram has grown more culturally relevant than Facebook, and while Meta benefits a great deal from that, Zuckerberg has expressed concerns that Instagram’s rise is contributing to Facebook’s decline in popularity. As Facebook becomes less popular among teenagers, Meta has spent the last few years strategizing how to make Facebook cool again."

Since then the app has grown astronomically and some firms have estimated it will make up more than half of Meta's U.S. ad revenue this year.
A major factor contributing to Instagram's success is the Reels feature which launched in 2020 and allows users to create short-form content - a market that faces fierce competition from rivals such as TikTok and Google-owned YouTube shorts.
TikTok, owned by Chinese technology behemoth ByteDance, has more than 1 billion users globally who visit monthly, a company spokesperson said earlier this month.

finnhub,META,2025-09-24T15:39:19,Meta launches lobbying effort to target state AI laws,The company created a super PAC to back candidates who align with the company on AI oversight. It’s the latest sign of industry displeasure toward state AI laws.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b709372d3def3bafeda72024e213345202b271f49e743adb88850362cb8886f2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.ciodive.com/news/meta-lobbying-state-ai-laws/761047/,https://www.ciodive.com/news/meta-lobbying-state-ai-laws/761047/,https://www.ciodive.com/news/meta-lobbying-state-ai-laws/761047/,ciodive.com,200,,"Dive Brief:
- Meta launched a multistate super PAC called the American Technology Excellence Project (ATEP) on Tuesday. The political action committee will help elect state political candidates who are viewed as supportive of the U.S. tech industry.
- Meta cited concerns about overly restrictive state AI laws as a driver of the initiative. More than 1,100 AI-related bills introduced in 2025 add to the growing patchwork of state AI laws that could hinder AI innovation and the technology’s potential, Meta said in a statement provided to CIO Dive.
- “State lawmakers are uniquely positioned to ensure that America remains a global technology leader,” Brian Rice, VP of public policy at Meta, said in a statement. “This is why Meta is launching an effort to support the election of state candidates across the country who embrace AI development, champion the U.S. technology industry and defend American tech leadership at home and abroad.”
Dive Insight:
While a super PAC cannot donate money directly to a political candidate, they can gather unlimited funding from corporations, associations and individuals. The amount super PACs can spend advocating for or against a candidate is also uncapped. Meta’s initiative could influence AI regulation as it backs lawmakers based on their views on technology.
“Meta, for years, has been funding lobbyists to make sure that federal policies are friendly to their business,” said Forrester principal analyst Alla Valente. “But D.C. is not the sphere of influence for AI policy anymore. It’s very clear that there will be no federal level regulation. Now the sphere of influence is the state house.”
The super PAC announced Tuesday is not the first effort this year targeting state AI regulation. Google and OpenAI both voiced concerns with state AI laws in their commentary to the U.S. government as it developed its AI action plan, released in July. Additionally, a 10-year state AI law moratorium was proposed in President Donald Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year but failed to garner the votes necessary to pass. California drew close to approving AI safety bill SB 1047 last year, which was ultimately vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom.
There is a growing trend in the tech industry to view any new AI regulation as being too much, said Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Cornell Law School. Meta’s super PAC could have an enormous effect on the development of AI laws in U.S. states, he added.
It’s “a bit surprising” how hard AI companies are pushing back on state AI regulations because the proposed guardrails and requirements aren’t stringent, said Lucas Hansen, founder of nonprofit CivAI. However, as concerns grow about the way AI chatbots speak to humans or as AI is used to assist hackers, demands for regulating AI could accelerate in the future, Hansen said.
“These companies are laying the groundwork for future battles,” he said. “They know that people are going to be calling on them with much bigger asks soon.”
Meta’s move to create a super PAC demonstrates that state AI laws are “becoming a real threat to AI companies,” according to Daniel Castro, VP of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit thinktank.
“Companies don’t start a super PAC for issues that don’t matter,” he said.
Meta’s statement said its super PAC will back state political candidates, regardless of party affiliation, who are aligned with key tech policy issues:
- Promoting and defending U.S. technology companies and leadership
- Advocating for AI progress
- Putting parents in charge
The super PAC will be run by Democrat consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions and Republican strategist Brian Baker, according to Meta.
“America’s innovation edge is at a crossroads,” Baker said in a statement provided by Meta. “We need state legislators who will champion our tech future, not cede it to global adversaries.”"

BofA hosted a call with Ben Legg, former chief executive of Ad Parlor, to assess recent sector trends. Analysts said, “Growth in 3Q has accelerated vs 2Q across most platforms and is tracking a few points above expectations.”
They added that “AI capabilities (including automated campaign management, AI-generated creative, and deeper data integration)” are supporting momentum.
Legg noted that AI-powered search is reducing search engine optimization traffic to third-party websites, but that shift is “benefiting sector (incl. Meta) as advertisers redirect more spend into paid channels.”
He is also said to have pointed to TikTok’s weakness as a near-term positive: “Declining spend on TikTok has been a sector tailwind, which could reverse if a TikTok U.S. sale deal is completed.”
Google Search is among the biggest beneficiaries. Legg observed that advertisers are seeing “expanded data & CRM integrations, along with native AI ad formats (like overlay and overview ads)” boost conversions and lift cost-per-clicks.
Looking ahead, he suggested Google could eventually “transition from a CPC to a transaction-based CPA model, optimizing for outcomes.”
Meta is also seeing “relatively strong” growth, according to Legg, who cited AI-driven targeting, adoption of overlay ads, rising Reels usage, and one-click shopping formats. He added that WhatsApp for Business is gaining traction following July’s pricing change.
On YouTube, Legg said growth has been “healthy (but in-line with expectations),” helped by Alphabet’s Gen-AI video creation tools, which lower barriers for advertisers and accelerate adoption.

Demand peaked at nearly $88 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

Trump’s Border Czar Involved in Detention Contract Talks Despite Recusal
The technology giant — which has nearly doubled in value this year — is issuing debt in six parts, including a rare 40-year bond, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private details. That note will yield 1.37 percentage points above similarly dated Treasuries, compared with initial price talk of about 1.65 percentage points.
A floating-rate tranche was dropped during syndication.
The debt raise comes as Oracle begins to fulfill massive cloud infrastructure deals with customers like OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc., which are boosting the company’s expenses. Over the next several years, it is projected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rent and power data centers.
It is also the cloud provider to TikTok in the US, and under a new framework outlined by the White House earlier this week, it would help oversee the development of a new US-only version of the social media giant’s algorithm.
The software company spent years trailing the top three vendors — Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — in the competitive cloud infrastructure market. Now that it has struck serious cloud deals, it’s on the hook for upfront costs. Oracle’s cash flow flipped negative this year for the first time since 1992. Analysts anticipate the metric will be in free fall over the coming years before returning to positive in 2029.
Representatives for Oracle didn’t respond to a request for comment. Proceeds from its bond sale can be used for capital expenditures, future investments or acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes, including debt repayment.

The firm white-label stablecoin systems, enabling companies to issue digital dollars without coding or their own regulatory licenses.
What to know:
- Bastion raised $14.6 million in a funding round led by Coinbase Ventures, with participation from Sony, Samsung, Andreessen Horowitz, and Hashed.
- The firm white-label stablecoin systems, enabling companies to issue digital dollars without coding or their own regulatory licenses.
- It competes with Paxos and Agora, offering a product suite that includes wallets and off-ramps for cash conversion.
Stablecoin infrastructure startup Bastion has raised $14.6 million in a new funding round led by Coinbase Ventures, the company said in a press release shared with CoinDesk, bringing its total funding to over $40 million.
Bastion builds white-label stablecoin systems that let companies issue digital dollars without writing code or applying for regulatory licenses. The round included participation from the venture arms of Sony and Samsung, as well as Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division and Hashed.
The startup is led by Nassim Eddequiouaq, a former Meta and a16z crypto executive who worked on Libra, Meta’s now-defunct stablecoin project. Eddequiouaq said Bastion’s product suite goes beyond simple issuance: it includes wallets for users and off-ramps that allow conversion to cash in over 70 countries.
The valuation of this latest funding round wasn’t revealed, and the company raised $25 million back in 2023 in a round led by a16z crypto.
The company said it’s seeing particular traction in Asia, where demand from enterprise customers is rising. The fresh funding will support product expansion and hiring. Bastion has also recently added new leadership across compliance, treasury, legal and revenue, the company said.
That positions Bastion to compete with firms like Paxos and newer players like Agora. The firm declined to name which corporations are currently using its platform, but Eddequiouaq said announcements are coming within the next nine months.
The funding comes amid a broader stablecoin boom. Stripe recently acquired stablecoin startup Bridge for $1.1 billion, USDC issuer Circle went public over the summer, while leading stablecoin issuer Tether is reportedly looking to raise up to $20 billion at a valuation that could be as high as $500 billion.
UPDATE (Sept. 24, 13:58 UTC): Updated story to add that Bastion said it's seeing traction in Asia and details the use of funds.

Its open-source design allows secure deployment without transmitting sensitive data to third parties, enabling governments to fine-tune models, host them in secure environments, or deploy them on-device for operational use.
Llama has already been shared with the Five Eyes partners, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.K. Meta is now extending access to France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, NATO, and European Union institutions.
The AI platform supports military and national security projects, such as a pilot with the U.S. Army’s Combined Arms Support Command to accelerate equipment repairs using AI, augmented reality, and virtual reality.
Delivering Llama solutions globally involves partnerships with leading tech and defense firms, including Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Anduril, Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH), Alphabet Inc.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe concerns around AI-related threats to Google search are overstated. Google has an edge over competitors because it’s easier for the billions of users of its search engine to switch to Gemini instead of opting for a completely new model. As of April, Google had over 1.5 billion monthly users interacting with its AI-powered Search overviews.
Google’s competitor OpenAI failed to impress the market with its GPT-5 model, while Gemini is gaining traction with new features. Analysts believe the company is strongly positioned to start placing ads in AI search results, which means its core ads business will not be impacted despite the decline in traditional search.
Pershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is successfully executing on its vast AI potential. The company’s key advantages – stemming from industry-leading models, a full-stack approach to technical infrastructure (including proprietary chips), access to high-quality data, rapidly improving product launch velocity and a robust distribution ecosystem of seven different apps with over two billion users each – are beginning to meaningfully widen Google’s moat and competitive differentiation in AI."

Integration of Meta’s Llama AI models into the CA-M defense AI robot provides Circus with a strategic technological advantage through secure and locally controlled AI.
MUNICH, September 24, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Circus SE (XETRA: CA1), a global technology leader in AI robotics for autonomous nutrition systems and troop supply, today announces the extension of its collaborative partnership with Meta to its Llama for defense AI program.
Meta (NASDAQ: META) first made its Llama AI models available to the United States' closest intelligence allies – the Five Eyes nations of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom – for national security use cases last year. Now, the company is expanding access to a broader group of democratic partners in Europe and Asia. These include partners in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea, along with key institutions such as NATO and the European Union.
As a leading dual-use company and European partner in this program, Circus will gain access to the latest Llama models to advance mission-specific AI capabilities. Access to Llama for defense and national security use cases provides a strong competitive edge for Circus in developing next-generation defense solutions that enhance decision-making, operational efficiency, and field deployment. Such access enables Circus to integrate Meta's AI technology within its embodied AI systems CA-M, creating fully autonomous systems powered by advanced AI.
""Llama’s open-source foundation allows us to securely deploy AI in sensitive environments locally without relying on third-party infrastructures. This gives Circus a strong strategic advantage in building intelligent autonomous systems and an AI-driven supply chain for meal supply, logistics, and demand prediction – further enhancing our autonomous defense systems to be truly intelligent,"" comments Niklas von Weihe, Director AI at Circus.
Circus SE is committed to responsible AI development and ethical use of artificial intelligence. The partnership also underscores the company's growing role in the defense sector and its commitment to applying embodied AI and robotics to strengthen resilience.

But the US power grid, full of aging infrastructure, years-long connection queues, and decades of stagnant industrial development, is largely unequipped to handle that demand today.
Much of the answer may lie in ""off-grid"" power, in which data centers get energy directly from their own sources instead of waiting years to be plugged into the grid.
And natural gas is positioned to meet a large share of this demand.
""We're focused on directly powering data center facilities so that they don't have to wait for these multiyear grid expansions that, unfortunately, is what it takes in the United States,"" Chad Zamarin, CEO of pipeline operator Williams Companies, said at a conference in August.
Shares of Expand Energy (EXE), the country's largest natural gas producer, are up more than 24% over the past year. Shares of fellow producers EQT Corporation (EQT) and Range Resources (RRC) are up more than 40% and more than 13%, respectively, while Williams Companies (WMB) is up more than 32%.
Off-grid power can come from a variety of sources.
In March 2024, Talen Energy (TLN) agreed to provide AWS (AMZN) with more than 1.9 gigawatts of energy from its nuclear Susquehanna Steam Electric Station to power a data center next to the plant. And other Big Tech players have promised to find renewable energy sources, like nuclear or solar power, for their AI ambitions.
But these projects can take decades to bring on line, whereas a natural gas plant can take around five years, according to Morgan Stanley. And some of these plants are already on line.
""Any market in the United States that has any significant renewables, the only reason why it works is because we've got natural gas capacity that picks up the slack when the sun sets and the wind slows down,"" Williams Companies' chief Zamarin said at a conference in September.
And natural gas is already abundant in the US, cleaner than coal, and cheaper and faster to develop than nuclear power.
In February, natural gas producer Energy Transfer (ET) signed an agreement with the data center operator CloudBurst to provide 1.2 gigawatts of off-grid power for a data center outside San Marcos, Texas. In September, asset manager Blackstone (BX) purchased a natural gas plant in Pennsylvania for more than $1 billion in a bet on future demand.
The world's biggest tech companies are also looking to broker deals for natural gas. In December 2024, Meta (META) began work on a more than 2,000-acre site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where it will spend $10 billion on a massive data center."

Financial flexibility is valuable, but it’s not everything - at StockStory, we help you find the stocks that can not only survive but also outperform. Keeping that in mind, here is one company with a net cash position that balances growth with stability and two best left off your watchlist.
Two Stocks to Sell:
Asana (ASAN)
Net Cash Position: $222.9 million (6.6% of Market Cap)
Born from the founders' frustration with the inefficiencies of email-based collaboration at Facebook, Asana (NYSE:ASAN) provides a work management platform that helps organizations track projects, set goals, and manage workflows in a centralized digital workspace.
Why Do We Think ASAN Will Underperform?
-
Offerings struggled to generate meaningful interest as its average billings growth of 9.6% over the last year did not impress
-
Platform has low switching costs as its net revenue retention rate of 95.7% demonstrates high turnover
-
Complex implementation process for enterprise clients means customers take longer to ramp up, as seen in its extended payback periods
Asana is trading at $14.21 per share, or 4.1x forward price-to-sales. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why ASAN doesn’t pass our bar.
Dime Community Bancshares (DCOM)
Net Cash Position: $290.2 million (21.7% of Market Cap)
With roots dating back to 1910 and a name that evokes the historic ""dime savings banks"" of America's past, Dime Community Bancshares (NASDAQ:DCOM) is a New York-based bank holding company that provides commercial banking and financial services to businesses and consumers throughout Greater Long Island.
Why Are We Cautious About DCOM?
-
Sales tumbled by 5.5% annually over the last two years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle
-
Net interest margin of 2.6% is well below other banks, signaling its loans aren’t very profitable
-
Performance over the past two years shows each sale was less profitable as its earnings per share dropped by 26.7% annually, worse than its revenue
Dime Community Bancshares’s stock price of $30.52 implies a valuation ratio of 1x forward P/B. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including DCOM in your portfolio, it’s free.
One Stock to Watch:
Atlassian (TEAM)
Net Cash Position: $1.70 billion (3.9% of Market Cap)
Started by two Australian university friends who funded their startup with credit cards, Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) provides software tools that help teams plan, track, collaborate, and share knowledge across organizations."

In Abilene, Texas—in the heart of what locals call the Big Country, long defined by ranching, farming, shale oil exploration, and now dotted with wind turbines—OpenAI and Oracle staged a carefully crafted media showcase on Tuesday to talk about the latest boom underway. Throngs of journalists from across the country were escorted by police to a half-completed 800-acre data center complex, guided through halls packed with tens of thousands of state-of-the-art Nvidia GPUs, and greeted by the company CEOs and by policymakers including Texas Senator Ted Cruz.
The event was a victory lap of sorts, as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle’s new co-CEO Clay Magouryk pushed back against critics who have questioned the progress of their high-profile and ambitious “Stargate” AI infrastructure project.
At Tuesday’s event, the two companies, joined by Japan’s SoftBank, announced a big step forward for Stargate, touting an expansion of the Abilene site, as well as plans to build five massive, new data center complexes across the U.S. over the next several years. Altogether, the initiative calls for hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in a project of a mind-boggling scale. In Abilene alone, a crew of 6,400 workers have already moved massive amounts of soil to flatten the hills, and laid down enough fiber optic cable to wrap the Earth 16 times.
“We cannot fall behind in the need to put the infrastructure together to make this revolution happen,” OpenAI’s Altman said during a Q&A with reporters. “What you saw today is just like a small fraction of what this site will eventually be, and this site is just a small fraction or building, and all of that will still not be enough to serve even the demand of ChatGPT,” he said, referring to OpenAI’s flagship AI product.
The buildout attests to the towering expectations surrounding AI, as tech companies like OpenAI, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta race to put in place the infrastructure necessary to power their latest large language models. In July, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would spend hundreds of billions of dollars building a network of data centers with names like Prometheus and Hyperion to create “superintelligence.”
Abilene, as well as the newly-announced data centers, are all part of the Stargate project, a half-trillion-dollar joint initiative that OpenAI unveiled in January that aims to create a nationwide backbone for training its ever-larger AI models. Stargate has been touted as a public–private partnership with the Trump administration—part of a bid to keep AI compute infrastructure in the U.S. and push projects past regulatory hurdles."

Meta Platforms (META, Financials) said it is adding a translation feature to WhatsApp, expanding communication across languages for its global base of more than 3 billion users.
The company said translations will launch in six languages on Android devices and 19 on iPhones, with additional languages to follow. The tool allows users to long-press a message and select Translate to view text in another language. The function applies to personal conversations, group chats and channel updates.
Android users can also enable automatic translation for entire threads so future messages appear in their chosen language by default. Meta stressed that translations are done on the device, not on business servers, to protect privacy.
The update makes WhatsApp more useful in places where people often send messages in more than one language. This fits with Meta's larger goal of making communication technologies available to more people throughout the world. The next thing the organization needs to do is add other languages and see how many people utilize the service."

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said the AI space is already being ruled by a group of “big four” players.
The 69-year-old investor said OpenAI, Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and Google’s Gemini are competing for dominance—and the competition is fierce. She noted, ultimately, the four current competitors could be narrowed down to two.
“The number of companies competing, truly competing, in the large language model space has shrunk,” she told Bloomberg.
The recent “acquihires” conducted by OpenAI and Meta, which is not in Wood’s big four, are also examples of the AI space getting smaller and of “other companies not making it,” she said.
ChatGPT maker OpenAI has been one of the most prolific buyers in the startup space this year. In 2025 alone, the company shelled out $6.4 billion to acquire io, the hardware startup from former Apple designer Jony Ive, as well as $1.1 billion to buy product-development platform Statsig. These deals come as the company has also “acquihired” top talent from startups, including the team behind coding assistant company Alex.
Meta, for its part, conducted its own high-profile acquihire earlier this year when it committed about $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in startup Scale AI and brought on its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, as its first-ever chief AI officer.
When it comes to AI consolidation, “the process has started,” said Wood, but the final result is still not in.
“Let’s see over time how they leapfrog one another, and they are doing that regularly,” she said.
ARK Invest’s star ARK Innovation ETF is up 47% year to date as of Tuesday, thanks in part to the stellar performance of its top holdings in 2025, including Roku, Coinbase, and Roblox. Its top holding, Tesla, is up a comparatively lower but solid 8% over the same period despite tumult earlier this year.
Wood, who earlier this year warned of stalling growth, has changed her tune and pointed to the possibility that inflation rates could drop to zero in the coming years as AI-driven productivity increases push inflation down. These productivity increases, however, have come hand in hand with higher unemployment and a Fed rate cut last week, which Fed Chairman Jerome Powell justified partly because younger people are struggling to find jobs.
Wood countered that these productivity increases could be good for the AI sector as a whole since companies are cutting back on employees but also increasing the money they put into AI services.
“They’re willing to pay $20 a month. Some are willing to pay $200 a month, and those who are replacing PhDs, they’re willing to pay $2,000 a month or more,” she said.

Meta Platforms (META, Financials) made progress on its artificial intelligence approach in a number of ways on Tuesday. It got government approval for its Llama AI system and added new AI features to its dating service.
The U.S. government has now certified Llama for use, making it one of the approved platforms along with Alphabet's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. The deal provides Meta a footing in the public sector, where AI use is rising in defense, research, and regulatory bodies.
Meta also claimed that it will introduce an AI assistant to Facebook Dating to improve match suggestions and deal with ""swipe fatigue."" The business is also adding more capabilities to the service, which fits with its larger plan to put AI into all of its apps.
Meta is trying to make money in other ways besides advertising, and these announcements are part of that effort. Analysts have flagged opportunities in WhatsApp and Threads to add as much as $25 billion in incremental ad revenue over the next two years.
On Monday, Meta's stock fell 1.7% to $765.16, which was less than the S&P 500's 0.44% increase. As part of its aim to give money back to shareholders, the firm has announced a quarterly dividend of $0.525 per share."

Sep 23 - Barclays reaffirmed its ""Overweight"" rating on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and maintained a price target of $810, pointing to revenue opportunities from WhatsApp and Threads. The bank estimates WhatsApp could contribute about $6 billion in additional ad revenue by 2026, while Threads may add $19 billion in 2027.
These projections come on top of Meta's reported $178.8 billion in revenue, which grew 19.37% year-over-year. Analysts highlight that WhatsApp Status ads could generate significant ad inventory given the platform's more than 1.5 billion daily active users, although ad prices may remain lower than on other Meta platforms because of regional differences and targeting limits.
Barclays also emphasized Threads' potential, noting that while the platform is smaller, its feed-based ads target markets with stronger per-capita ad revenue, offering higher monetization prospects. Together, WhatsApp and Threads could help Meta outperform consensus growth expectations of 16% and 15% over the next two years.
The firm acknowledged risks such as cannibalization across Meta's ad products, but said it does not expect a repeat of the Reels-driven revenue shifts seen in 20222023. Barclays added that Meta AI represents a future upside, though no revenue contribution from the service has been factored into current forecasts.
Is META Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 62 analysts, the average target price for Meta Platforms Inc is $851.89 with a high estimate of $1086.00 and a low estimate of $605.00. The average target implies a upside of +11.34% from the current price of $765.16.

“That caught everyone off guard,” Dimon said in a television interview with India’s CNBC-TV18. “We had a lot of phone calls over the weekend — what does this mean?”
""We'll be engaging with stakeholders and policymakers,"" Dimon said in a separate interview with the Times of India newspaper.
Dimon, who has previously expressed support for the Trump administration’s move to secure the US southern border, said he believes in “merit-based immigration” and wants to “engage with the government on the issue.”
“I believe in merit-based immigration, and as a matter of fact, I would beg the president, he has accomplished border control — that's great. I think all nations want real border control. It helps make a nation. But after that, we should have good immigration,” said Dimon during the television interview.
The H-1B visa was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. This immigration card allows US employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for jobs that require a bachelor's degree or higher.
Unveiled and signed Friday afternoon in the Oval Office, the Trump administration’s new executive order mandates a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas and impacts an estimated 730,000 holders.
US businesses that sponsor skilled foreign workers had a roller-coaster weekend trying to understand how they would be impacted by the proclamation.
The government altered its messaging on the order over the weekend when Trump's team offered an apparent 180-degree turn on key specifics, such as whether this fee will be annual and whether it will ever be paid by existing visa holders.
Within the US financial sector, no company sponsored more H-1B visas last year than JPMorgan Chase. In 2024, the company ranked as the eighth-largest corporate sponsor along with tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and retail giant Walmart (WMT), according to US government data.
""For us, visas matter because we move people around globally — experts who get promoted to new jobs in different markets,"" Dimon told the Times of India newspaper.
“Hopefully,” Dimon said, he or his company will engage with the government on the issue. Dimon added that, before taking office, Trump did say publicly that he wanted “more merit-based immigration.”"

Last year, Meta announced that it was working with the U.S. Army on various AI use cases, including:
“Fine-tuning Llama to support specific national security team missions, such as planning operations and identifying adversaries’ vulnerabilities.”
Which sounds concerning, right? I mean, AI tools still regularly make simple mistakes, and confuse contexts and/or meanings in basic usage. But Meta’s looking to work with the military to use AI to identify targets in combat.
Seems like a concern, while Meta is also working with Anduril to develop VR and XR helmets for military use, further engraining Meta technologies into the broader war machine.
I don’t know, it just feels like we’ve gone from “Facebook is a dangerous vector for foreign manipulation” to “let’s use Facebook to power our army” a little too fast.
And now, that usage is expanding to more foreign military uses.
Today, Meta has announced that it’s now made its Llama models available for national security use cases among U.S. security partners, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.K., as well as their private sector suppliers, and it’s also further expanding that same access to more regions.
As per Meta:
“We are now expanding this access to a number of key U.S. democratic allies in Europe and Asia: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea, as well as NATO and European Union institutions.”
To be clear, this doesn’t mean that the military are going to be loading up Meta’s AI chatbot and asking “who should we kill next?” Instead, the focus here is on enabling foreign military groups to utilize Meta’s AI tools to build their own solutions.
“Llama has been used to help develop advanced AI tools for the U.S. military and national security agencies, enhancing decision-making, mission-specific capabilities, and operational efficiency. For example, Meta is working with the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command on a pilot project to demonstrate how AI and technologies like augmented and virtual reality can help to speed routine repairs and help the Army get equipment back into the field more quickly.”
So, in the majority, this will see Meta’s AI tools used for training and simulations, not for mission planning and live combat. But again, that could be a part of an expanded use case for these tools.
Which feels like a concern, but such usage is relative to how each group utilizes these tools, and Meta’s largely taking a hands-off approach in this respect.
“In a world where geopolitical power and national security are deeply intertwined with economic output, innovation, and growth, the widespread adoption of open source models like Llama will be essential to maintaining US and allied AI leadership and ensuring our shared values underpin the systems and standards adopted elsewhere. This is recognized by the U.S. government in its AI Action Plan for America, which Meta endorses.”
So Meta’s essentially looking to democratize the use of AI tools to ensure greater capacity among all allied nations. While also strengthening its own position as a key provider of such, which will solidify Meta’s AI business plan, and ensure ongoing investment and growth.
From that perspective, it’s a smart business move, but it just feels not quite right to have a company that was under fire, just a few years back, for facilitating foreign election interference, now overseeing direct connection with the global military machine.
But Meta wants to be the leader in AI development, and all industries are looking at how they can use technologies like this to gain an advantage."

Micron to Report Q4 Earnings: Buy, Hold, or Take Profits Now?
After the closing bell on Sept. 23, Micron Technology, Inc. is set to report its much-awaited fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 (ended on Aug. 31) results. Similar to the previous quarter, will Micron be able to provide an insightful update on its high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and is the stock a worthwhile investment now? Let's analyze
Micron's Q4 Earnings in Sight: What's on the Table?
For the fiscal third quarter, Micron generated revenues of $9.3 billion, up 15% quarter over quarter and up 37% year over year. The majority of the revenues were generated by the compute and networking business segment, which included a nearly 50% sequential jump in HBM as well as growth in high-capacity DRAM.
Management believes that revenues also increased in the fiscal fourth quarter and expects total sales of $10.7 billion, a 38% rise year over year. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter were $1.91, a significant 208% increase from the previous year. However, the company anticipates EPS to improve further in the fiscal fourth quarter and reach $2.50, representing a 112% increase from the same period last year, citing investors.micron.com.
Management expects low inventory and significant demand for products to help the company improve pricing and strengthen product mix, thereby increasing revenues and operating margins in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, on average, Micron's trailing four-quarter earnings surprise is a positive 9.7%, signifying that the stock may deliver fiscal fourth-quarter growth.
Reasons to Be Bullish on Micron
Tech behemoths have increased their capital expenditure (capex) on infrastructure to fulfill the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI). This year, Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. are expected to increase their capex on AI infrastructure from $75 billion to $85 billion, and from $64 billion to $66 billion, respectively. Amazon.com, Inc.'s capex, on the other hand, could top $118 billion in 2025."

The social-media giant recently introduced new tools and features for Indian businesses to drive engagement. Small businesses can now offer a secure and convenient payment option (QR codes) directly within the WhatsApp Business app. Users can now call large businesses directly from the app with a single tap, or receive calls from businesses they have requested to hear from.
Meta Platforms launched a feature in July that streamlined all marketing campaigns across WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram in one centralized place, Ads Manager. The company is now offering this feature to Indian businesses. Businesses now can either select marketing messages as an additional placement or can use Advantage+, while Meta’s AI systems will then optimize budgets across placements to boost performance. Moreover, Meta Platforms is creating ways for businesses and creators to grow their presence in the WhatsApp Updates tab, which is currently used by 1.5 billion people daily.
Business messaging and more engaging experiences are two of the five basic opportunities that Meta Platforms is pursuing to drive growth. In the second quarter of 2025, Family of Apps Other revenues jumped 50% year over year to $583 million, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. The company is using Llama to power Meta AI, an infusion of which into WhatsApp is driving user queries. AI push is helping Meta Platforms offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Meta Platforms’ focus on enhancing safety for WhatsApp users is expected to further boost user engagement.
These factors are expected to drive advertising revenues, Family of Apps Other revenues, and total revenues. Our model estimate for 2025 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $190.29 billion, indicating 18.5% growth over the figure reported in 2024. Family of Apps Other revenues are pegged at $2.30 billion, suggesting 33.7% growth from the figure reported in 2024. Our model estimate for 2025 total revenues is currently pegged at $194.66 billion, indicating 18.3% growth over the figure reported in 2024.
META Faces Tough Competition for Advertising Dollars
Meta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN for advertising dollars.
Alphabet is leveraging AI to boost search dominance with the launch of Gemini 2.5. Search revenues are driven by improving engagement with features like AI Overview, which now has 2 billion users per month and is available in more than 40 languages across 200 countries. Alphabet is advancing visual and contextual search capabilities. The Circle to Search feature is now active on more than 300 million devices.
Amazon’s advertising business is noteworthy. Amazon’s ability to harness its vast retail media presence, proprietary shopping data and expanding connected TV (CTV) footprint is a key catalyst. The global rollout of Prime Video ads adds a high-value, premium channel that may lift revenues. Amazon’s ad ecosystem reaches over 300 million ad-supported users in the United States alone, spanning retail, Prime Video, Twitch and Fire TV."

The Facebook-maker is investing “tens of millions” of dollars into a new super PAC to fight state-level tech policy proposals that could stifle AI advancement, reports Axios.
Meta’s pro-AI PAC, called the American Technology Excellence Project, is the company’s latest effort to combat policies it sees as harmful to the development of AI. Last month, Meta launched a California-focused PAC to back tech-friendly candidates in state races.
Axios reports that Meta’s new super PAC will be run by Republican veteran Brian Baker and Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions, and will work to elect tech-friendly politicians from both parties in next year’s midterm elections. Rachel Holland, a Meta spokesperson, told the outlet that the super PAC will focus on promoting and defending U.S. tech companies and leadership, advocating for AI progress, and putting parents in charge of how their children experience online apps and AI technologies.
The focus on parental control comes amid growing child safety concerns surrounding AI tools. Meta has come under particular scrutiny after leaked internal documents showed the company’s chatbots were allowed to have “romantic” chats with kids and whistleblower reports alleged that the company may have suppressed research on child safety.
Meta has not shared which states its super PAC would focus on, nor how many people the PAC would employ.
The PAC comes at a time when many states are proposing AI regulations, spurred by a perceived failure of the federal government to address the issue. More than 1,000 bills were introduced in all 50 states related to AI during the 2025 legislative session. In California specifically, two bills passed and are awaiting signature or veto by Governor Gavin Newsom: SB 243, a bill that would regulate AI companion chatbots to protect minors and vulnerable users, and SB 53, a bill that would set new transparency requirements on large AI companies.
Reached for comment, Meta VP of public policy Brian Rice said the new group would “support the election of state candidates across the country who embrace AI development, champion the U.S. technology industry, and defend American tech leadership at home and abroad.”
Silicon Valley has picked up the pace this year to try to curb states’ abilities to pass AI legislation, arguing that such a “patchwork” would be difficult for powerful AI companies to navigate and slow down innovation at a time when the U.S. is racing to beat China in AI development."

Just one decade later, he’s become one of Meta’s fiercest competitors
Shou Zi Chew may be the CEO of Mark Zuckerberg’s biggest competitor, TikTok, but at the start of his career, he worked for Zuckerberg as an intern at Facebook.
The Singapore native earned an economics degree from University College London before getting his MBA at Harvard Business School, where during the summer he interned at an up-and-coming company: “It was called Facebook,” Chew told Harvard’s Business School alumni website.
Soon after he kicked off his tech career at Facebook in California, he moved abroad, stopping in London, Singapore, and Hong Kong, before ultimately landing in Beijing. Chew joined Chinese tech company Xiaomi in 2015, helping take the company public three years later as chief financial officer, according to the Harvard Business School alumni website.
Then in 2021, Chew’s career once again crossed paths with Meta CEO Zuckerberg, this time as a competitor. Chew joined TikTok parent company ByteDance in 2021, first as CFO. Later that year, he became CEO of TikTok, and held both the CFO position at ByteDance and the CEO position at TikTok before ultimately focusing on the short-form video platform.
With at least 150 million monthly active users in the U.S. and more than 1 billion globally, TikTok has become a mainstay of social media and a rare top platform that is not under the control of Zuckerberg. But just because he doesn’t own it, doesn’t mean he never tried.
Zuckerberg reportedly spent much of 2016 trying to acquire a key part of what would become TikTok—a lip syncing app popular with Americans called Musical.ly, Buzzfeed News reported. Yet, Zuckerberg lost out to ByteDance, which acquired the app for $800 million in 2017. ByteDance merged Musical.ly with the already existing TikTok platform, and the resulting social network took off.
Meta tried to launch its own competitor to TikTok called Lasso in 2018, but it never caught on. Meta shut down the copycat app in 2020.
As efforts to ban TikTok from the U.S. have ramped up over the past few years, so have Zuckerberg’s criticisms of the app. Now, an emerging TikTok deal with China would ensure U.S. companies control the algorithm powering the app’s video feed and Americans will hold a majority of seats on a board overseeing U.S. operations. Zuckerberg has previously suggested TikTok could be a threat to global free expression on social media. In 2020, he said banning the app could set a bad precedent, but added he also sympathized with the national-security concerns.
“I certainly think that there are valid national security questions about having an app that has a lot of people’s data that follows the rules of another country, a government that is increasingly is kind of seen as a competitor,” Zuckerberg said in an internal meeting in 2020, according to BuzzFeed News."

Through its various social media apps, it counts a whopping 3.48 billion daily active users. There might be no other business that has this kind of reach, impacting so many people each and every day.
This ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has been a huge winner, more than tripling in the past five years. But can Meta shares turn a $10,000 investment into $50,000 by 2030?
Lower expectations
If an investment rose five-fold in a five-year period, it implies a compound annual gain of 38%. This is an unbelievable result that might typically only come from hyper-growth companies or from struggling businesses trading at dirt cheap valuations that start reporting improving financials as they successfully turn things around.
To be clear, Meta isn't going to put up a 400% total return between now and the end of the decade. This is a more mature company. However, if the stock price and valuation tank for whatever reason, like they did in 2022, there might be huge upside in the years that follow.
Should you buy Meta stock now?
While Meta won't climb five-fold by the end of the decade, turning $10,000 into $50,000, it still looks like a smart investment. Revenue and earnings per share are soaring at impressive rates. And leadership is fully focused on developing artificial intelligence capabilities.
It wouldn't be a surprise to see the stock double over the next five years. The current valuation is also reasonable, at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26.4. Investors should consider buying shares today."

Two of the biggest winners were Nvidia, which supplies the data center GPUs for processing those complex AI tasks, and Microsoft, which owns a big stake in ChatGPT's creator OpenAI.
Other stocks that were driven higher by the AI boom include Oracle, which supports those AI services with its cloud infrastructure platform; Broadcom, which supplies infrastructure chips for AI-oriented data centers; and Meta Platforms, which uses AI to craft better targeted ads across its social media apps.
All of those blue chip tech stocks are still reliable long-term investments. But if you want some balanced exposure to the AI market without buying individual stocks, you should consider investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is broadly diversified across dozens of top names.
The top AI-oriented ETF is the Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AIQ 1.49%), which was launched on May 11, 2018. It's risen 225% since its inception and outperformed the S&P 500's 144% gain and the Nasdaq's 205% gain. Should you still invest in this leading ETF today?
What does AIQ actually own?
AIQ holds 88 stocks across a wide range of industries. Its top five holdings -- which together account for 17.5% of its portfolio -- include Alibaba, Alphabet, Tesla, Oracle, and Broadcom. The IT sector accounts for 70.6% of its holdings, and 69.1% of its stocks are based in the United States.
By industry, AIQ allocates 37.6% of its portfolio to software and services stocks, 20.5% to semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks, and 12.5% to technology and hardware equipment stocks. But it splits the remaining 29.4% between industries that aren't as closely associated with the AI industry -- including the consumer discretionary, automotive, transportation, commercial services, financial services, and healthcare equipment industries.
AIQ says it invests ""without regard for sector or geography"" because the AI market ""spans multiple segments"" and the ""most innovative companies"" include ""both household names and newcomers."" AIQ has $5.26 billion in assets, and it charges a total expense ratio of 0.68%. That's slightly higher than the median expense ratio of 0.56% for actively managed ETFs. As of this writing, AIQ's shares are only trading a few cents above its net asset value (NAV) of $48.74 per share. It also trades at a reasonable 25.5 times its trailing earnings, compared to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq's price-to-earnings ratios of 30.8 and 32.9, respectively.
But there's a simpler ETF play on the AI market
AIQ consistently beats the market, it's well diversified, and it doesn't look expensive. But it has also underperformed another popular ETF, the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 0.71%), ever since its inception. QQQ, which tracks the narrower (and higher-growth) Nasdaq-100 index, has rallied 252% since AIQ's first day on the market.
QQQ's top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Broadcom. All of those stocks have plenty of exposure to the AI market, and it doesn't own a lot of AIQ's slower-growth AI-adjacent stocks. QQQ is also passively managed -- since it simply tracks the Nasdaq-100 -- and charges a lower expense ratio of 0.2%.
Is it the right time to invest in AIQ?
AIQ is a stable ETF that could stay ahead of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, but it's over-diversified in sectors that are only slightly related to the AI market. It might attract a lot more attention than other ETFs because it's branded as an AI ETF, but buying QQQ -- which gives you plenty of exposure to the top AI names -- seems like the smarter move."

ATLANTA, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PureCars, the leader in automotive retail advertising, recently released a study showing that dealerships using both its customer data platform (CDP), the AutoMiner, and digital advertising platform more than doubled vehicle sales.
To measure the impact of first-party data and real-time audience targeting, PureCars used Robyn, an open-source marketing mix modeling tool from Meta. The analysis revealed a 20% boost in ad efficiency on Meta and found that most sales growth occurred after the campaign ended — demonstrating the lasting advantages of smarter, data-driven targeting.
“Our strong partnership with Meta is built on a shared commitment to delivering impactful automotive advertising,” said Lauren Donalson, CEO of PureCars. “At PureCars, we know that better first-party data equals better results, transforming the customer buying experience from day one. Leveraging insights from Robyn, we demonstrate how our precision targeting makes Meta a powerful part of a multichannel strategy. This gives dealers a compelling reason to invest smarter and connect with buyers exactly when it matters most.”
Real-World Results from Targeted Ads
PureCars identifies in-market shoppers and syncs that data directly with ad platforms. By directing ad spend toward real buyers instead of broad demographic segments, dealers can increase efficiency and drive more sales without increasing budgets.
Key insights from the study include:
-
Dealers using the AutoMiner with PureCars advertising spent 1.5x more but sold more than twice as many vehicles compared to digital ads alone.
-
AutoMiner users achieved 20% higher ROAS on Meta compared to other channels.
-
85% of the total sales increase happened after the campaign ended, highlighting the lasting impact of CDP-driven advertising.
Why It Matters for Dealers
As CDPs become more common in automotive retail, many dealers still question how they differ from CRMs and whether they truly impact ad performance. PureCars’ data shows CDP-based advertising improves both short-term return on ad spend and long-term sales growth.
This shift to smarter, more personalized outreach helps dealers make the most of their ad budgets. PureCars supports dealers in adopting data-driven marketing strategies that deliver real growth and stronger buyer connections.
“PureCar’s use of Robyn showcases the power of a cross-channel strategy on outcomes, opening up new questions on how to further calibrate budgets toward channels maximizing dealer sales,” said Ryan Bolz, Automotive Retail and Technology Partner Lead at Meta. “The results illustrate the role of Meta Platforms in driving vehicle purchases, and how precision targeting can complement a broad prospecting, signal-first approach.”"

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized his desire to remain politically neutral during a recent interview with tech journalist Alex Heath on the Access podcast, saying “the thing that I want to stay out of is partisan politics” while discussing his evolving relationship with the Trump administration and a controversial $600 billion investment pledge.
The comments came as Zuckerberg addressed his recent pivot toward working more closely with President Donald Trump, including his announcement that Meta would invest “at least $600 billion through 2028” in U.S. infrastructure during a White House dinner with tech leaders. A hot-mic moment captured Zuckerberg apologizing to Trump afterward, saying “Sorry, I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t sure what number you wanted to go with.” (Susan Li, Meta’s CFO, later clarified Zuckerberg’s comment, saying the $600 billion figure represents “the total envelope” of the company’s U.S. investment plans through 2028, including data centers, infrastructure, and business operations.)
Despite his claims of political neutrality, Zuckerberg acknowledged the necessity of engaging with government officials. “We will always want to work with and have a good partnership and collaboration with governments,” the 41-year-old Facebook founder told Heath. “That’s going to be especially true in our home country, but it’s also true in other countries around the world where we serve large amounts of people.”
Zuckerberg explained his distinction between political engagement and partisan activity, suggesting his recent overtures to the Trump administration represent necessary business collaboration rather than ideological alignment.
“I think this administration for a number of reasons is definitely more forward-leaning on wanting to help build out infrastructure,” Zuckerberg said, referring to the current regulatory environment as more favorable to tech companies.
This stance marks a significant evolution from Zuckerberg’s previous political involvement. He was once a vocal advocate for progressive causes, co-founding immigration reform organizations and contributing hundreds of millions to election infrastructure in 2020. However, after facing criticism from both political parties, he began distancing himself from overtly political activities.
In a 2024 letter to Congress, Zuckerberg expressed regret over his company’s response to Biden administration pressure to moderate COVID-19 content and pledged neutrality going forward. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another—or to even appear to be playing a role,” he wrote."

The global AI market will soar from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033 -- a 25-fold increase in a decade -- according to an estimate by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), the leading supplier of AI chips and related technology, has been garnering rockstar-like attention for its phenomenal stock performance. It deserves its accolades and I remain very bullish on the stock.
But there's a large-cap AI stock that's walloped Nvidia stock in 2025 to date, over the last year, over 3 years, and even over 5 years: electronic manufacturing services (EMS) provider Celestica (CLS 9.13%).
Celestica -- which is well-established and profitable -- deserves much more attention. I believe that the U.S. financial press doesn't give it much coverage largely because it is based in Canada -- Toronto, to be exact -- rather than in the U.S. But Celestica stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the Toronto Stock Exchange, so it can be easily bought by U.S. investors.
If you're an AI stock or tech stock investor, Celestica is worth considering buying.
Celestica stock's performance
| Stock | YTD 2025 Return | 1-Year Return | 3-Year Return | 5-Year Return | 10-Year Return |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Celestica | 174% | 409% | 2,570% | 3,190% | 1,860% |

Celestica stock has trounced Nvidia stock in every period up to 5 years. Nvidia is the big winner over the 10-year period. Both Nvidia and Celestica have crushed the S&P 500 index (a proxy for the overall market) in every period shown.
Celestica has also beaten another AI darling -- Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%) -- over every period the AI-powered software-as-a-service (SaaS) company has traded.
Celestica's business: Good corporate DNA
Celestica is a leading electronic manufacturing services (EMS) provider. It provides design, manufacturing, hardware platform, and supply chain solutions for many of the world's largest companies across technology and other sectors. It has over 40 manufacturing and design centers worldwide.
I described Celestica as having good corporate DNA because it's essentially a spin-off from tech giant IBM. In 1996, Big Blue sold Celestica to an investors group, and in 1998, Celestica held its initial public offering (IPO).
The company's financial performance -- and hence, its stock performance -- started soaring in 2023, driven by powerful demand for its services and hardware platform solutions from companies heavily involved in AI.
Celestica has two reportable segments: advanced technology solutions (ATS) and connectivity & cloud solutions (CCS). ATS includes its aerospace and defense, industrial, health tech, and capital equipment businesses. CCS consists of its communications and enterprise (servers and storage) markets.
Notably, the company ""does business with the top five hyperscalers,"" CFO Mandeep Chawla said in January on Celestica's Q4 2024 earnings call. These are generally considered to be Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and likely Apple. Hyperscalers are companies that operate massive AI-focused data centers, often (but not always) to support their cloud computing services.
Celestica's key financial and stock stats
| Company | Market Cap | Forward P/E | Wall Street's Estimated Annualized 5-Year EPS Growth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Celestica | $29.1 billion | 37.6 | 27.3% |
In the first half of 2025, Celestica's revenue rose 20% year over year to $5.54 billion. On an adjusted basis, its net income surged 46% to $301.3 million, which translated to earnings per share (EPS) soaring 50% to $2.59. Cash flows were solid, and debt load is reasonable with a 0.55 long-term-debt-to-equity ratio.
The company's connectivity & cloud solutions (CCS) segment is driving its growth. In the second quarter, total revenue rose 21% year over year to $2.89 billion. CCS revenue jumped 28% to $2.07 billion, while the ATS segment's revenue increased 7%. Within the CCS segment, hardware platform solutions revenue rocketed 82% year over year to $1.2 billion.
In July, citing the ""strengthening demand outlook from our CCS customers,"" management raised its full-year 2025 guidance as follows:
- Revenue of $11.55 billion, up from $10.85 billion. This equates to annual growth of 20%.
- Adjusted EPS of $5.50, up from $5.00. This equates to annual growth of 42%.
- Free cash flow of $400 million, up from $350 million. This equates to annual growth of 31%.
Moving to the stock's valuation. Celestica stock is priced at 37.6 times Wall Street's estimated one-year forward EPS growth. This is a little pricey for a stock of a company that's expected to grow EPS at an average annual pace of 27.3% over the next 5 years.
However, investors should expect to pay up for quality. Moreover, the stock will turn out to be less highly valued than it now seems if Celestica continues to beat Wall Street's earnings estimates. Over the last four quarters, the company has exceeded the analyst consensus estimate in every quarter and by an average of 9.1%.
In addition, using the same valuation metrics, Celestica's valuation is much, much more reasonable than Palantir's. And it's anywhere from slightly to significantly more reasonably valued than every ""Magnificent Seven"" stock except for Nvidia. (That includes Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Apple, and Tesla.)
Celestica expects no material impact on 2025 earnings from tariffs
When it raised its 2025 guidance, Celestica addressed tariffs: ""Substantially all tariffs paid by Celestica are expected to be recovered from our customers, and are not expected to materially impact our ... [adjusted] net earnings dollars.""
In short, if you're a growth stock investor, Celestica stock is worth considering buying -- or at least putting on your watchlist.
Celestica is scheduled to release its third-quarter results after the market close on Monday, Oct. 27."

Its fleet of nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar energy assets has the capacity to generate 32.4 gigawatts (GW) of power annually, sufficient to meet the needs of over 20 million homes and businesses.
That fleet, especially its industry-leading nuclear energy plants, is becoming increasingly important given the country's surging power needs. Rising electricity demand from AI data centers, new factories, and electric vehicle (EV) charging should support robust earnings growth for Constellation over the next five years. Here's a look at where the company expects to be by 2030.
Cashing in on growing demand for clean power
Constellation Energy is the nation's leading nuclear power producer by a wide margin. It currently has 22.1 GW of competitive generation capacity, three times more than its closest peer (Vistra at 6.3 GW).
It also produces more carbon-free energy than leading utility NextEra Energy (178.2 GW to 110.5 GW). The company primarily sells the power it produces to commercial and industrial customers, for an industry-leading 21% market share.
The power company's business model generates fairly stable and visible revenue from regulated rate structures and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). It has been signing more PPAs with large technology companies to support their growing power needs.
For example, last September, the utility signed a 20-year PPA with Microsoft to support the launch of the Crane Clean Energy Center. Microsoft is buying 100% of the power from the former Three Mile Island Unit 1 (over 800 megawatts) to help support its data center options.
Constellation had shut down the nuclear reactor several years ago for economic reasons. It will now restart that unit, which should be back on line by 2028.
Meta Platforms also signed a 20-year PPA with the company. It will purchase all the power generated from the 1.1 GW Clinton Clean Energy Center, starting in 2027. Constellation nearly had to shut down the center several years ago due to poor economics.
However, the Future Energy Jobs Act prevented its premature retirement by providing financial support through mid-2027. Meta will begin purchasing power from that plant after the support program ends to help meet its power needs.
These deals and similar revenue frameworks give Constellation Energy strong visibility into its earnings growth potential over the next several years. The company expects its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow at more than a 10% compound annual rate through 2028.
A growth accelerator is coming
Its current growth forecast doesn't include any impact from its pending acquisition of Calpine. The company agreed to buy the power producer in a $26.6 billion deal in January. It's hoping to close the transaction within a year of signing the merger agreement.
The merger will create the country's largest clean power producer. It will combine Constellation's nuclear- and renewables-focused portfolio with Calpine's leading natural gas and geothermal plants. The combined company will have over 60 GW of capacity for zero- and low-carbon power production.
The company expects the deal to boost its EPS by more than 20% next year. And it sees the merger adding at least $2 per share to its future earnings and $2 billion to its annual free cash flow. That will help support double-digit EPS growth through the decade.
A much bigger and more profitable company
Constellation Energy expects to become a significantly larger company once it closes its acquisition of Calpine. It also expects to continue capitalizing on surging power demand, which should provide a meaningful earnings boost over the next few years. By 2030, it expects to be a much larger and more profitable company, which should enable it to create substantial value for shareholders in the years to come."

The White House announced Friday that Trump had signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. In response, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reportedly emailed their employees telling those with H-1B visas to stay in the United States and avoid foreign travel for now — and if they’re already traveling, to try to return before the proclamation takes effect at 12:01am Eastern on Sunday.
Business Insider published the memos from Amazon and Microsoft, while Sources published a similar memo from Google. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to Amazon and Google.
According to government data, Amazon employees have received the most H-1B visas so far this fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, then Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, with Google ranked sixth.
Meanwhile, a White House official told Axios that the fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing H-1B holders or renewals. And White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation.”

Of the 10 largest American companies by market cap, the top seven are technology sector companies, specializing in hardware, software, e-commerce, internet search, cloud services, or social media.
Nevertheless, investors shouldn't be confused -- many of these tech giants have plenty of room to grow. Today, three Motley Fool contributing analysts will explore the case for some of their favorites: Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), and Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%).
Meta is leveraging its lucrative business model to invest in AI
Jake Lerch (Meta Platforms): Not only is Meta Platforms a big tech stock with ample room to grow, but this social media giant could one day become the largest of them all.
It comes down to three simple factors:
- Meta's enormous reach
- The company's lucrative business model
- Meta's artificial intelligence (AI) investments
Let's start with its reach. Meta boasts nearly 3.5 billion daily average users (DAUs) -- roughly 43% of the population of Earth. The scale here can be tough to wrap your head around, but needless to say, it's enormous. Accordingly, the company can leverage this vast network to generate staggering sums of revenue and profit.
Case in point: As of Meta's most recent earnings report (for the six months ending on June 30, 2025), the company generated nearly $90 billion in revenue and $35 billion in net income. That works out to about $500 million in revenue and almost $200 million in net income each and every day.
To put this in context, Domino's Pizza records about $5 billion in revenue each year -- Meta generates a similar amount of revenue every 10 days. What's more, Meta's revenue is growing at an astounding rate of more than 21%.
Finally, we must discuss what Meta is doing with all this money. To summarize, it's pouring tens of billions into AI investments. It has secured hundreds of thousands of high-end GPUs to power the latest AI models, it has extended lucrative signing bonuses to AI researchers, and it's poured tens of billions into projects ranging from the metaverse to wearable augmented reality (AR) glasses.
In summary, Meta is leveraging its enormously profitable social media business to construct an AI empire. In my view, that is a wise investment that could fuel decades of future growth.
Despite unprecedented gains, this AI growth story is far from over
Will Healy (Nvidia): Looking at the trajectory of Nvidia over the last few years, one cannot blame some investors for thinking the bull market in Nvidia has played out. The stock has risen by nearly 1,200% since its November 2022 low. Additionally, with a market cap of $4.1 trillion, rapid growth is unlikely to occur as easily.
However, Nvidia has benefited precisely because it has created and dominated the market for AI accelerators. The company, which was once known best for its gaming chips, derived 88% of its revenue from the data center segment (which designs AI accelerators) in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended July 27).
Also, with Grand View Research forecasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip market of 29% through 2030, its growth is not on track to stop anytime soon.
Although growth rates have slowed in recent quarters, Nvidia's performance far exceeds this estimate. In the first half of fiscal 2026, its $91 billion in revenue increased by 62% from year-ago levels, an impressive feat for a company of its size.
Still, even with that gain, rising demand has spiked production costs, leading its cost of sales to increase by 131% during the same time frame. Consequently, its $45 billion in net income for the first two quarters of the fiscal year amounted to a 43% increase, a more modest rise that keeps Nvidia in a growth mode.
Over the last three years, profits have grown so rapidly that its P/E ratio is at 49 despite the stock's massive gains, and a 38 forward P/E ratio confirms its continued growth trajectory. Considering the 54% yearly revenue increase Nvidia has forecast for fiscal Q3, investors should expect its stock to climb for the rest of this year and beyond.
Alphabet is up 40% over the past three months, but there is still time to buy
Justin Pope (Alphabet): Technology juggernaut Alphabet continues to rip higher, but I'm still calling this winner a buy. What investors have seen is simply a metaphorical coiled spring that has now unleashed its pent-up energy following the company's favorable outcome in its antitrust litigation.
The stock felt selling pressure for months as Wall Street worried that the courts would take drastic measures to rectify Alphabet's anticompetitive practices in its search engine business. Rumors suggested potential forced sales of key assets, such as the Chrome web browser or Android smartphone operating system. It appears that those worst-case scenarios are out of play.
Now, investors can focus on all the things going right at Alphabet. The company's Gemini AI app has climbed to the top of smartphone app stores, and Google Cloud is thriving as AI demand drives more cloud consumption in Alphabet's direction.
Last but not least, Alphabet's Waymo autonomous ride-hailing service is steadily expanding across the United States. Meanwhile, Tesla's robotaxi, its primary competition, remains confined to a fixed area in Austin, and has reportedly gotten into a few accidents already despite the safeguards in place.
The stock has surged over the past few months, but shares remain valued at roughly 25 times estimated 2025 earnings. That's still a solid deal for one of the world's most prominent technology companies and an emerging leader in AI infrastructure and software, especially if the company can meet Wall Street's expectations of 15% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years."

Meta seen as long-term AI leader after smart glasses push
William Blair reiterated its positive view on Meta Platforms after the company’s September 17–18 Meta Connect conference, which demonstrated the tech giant’s advances in AI and wearable technology.
The broker described the event as “an evolution on Meta’s wearable AI technology,” pointing to four new smart glasses models developed with Oakley and Ray-Ban.
These additions expand Meta’s AI-driven wearables lineup, which now supports tasks from reading texts and playing music to more advanced features thanks to upgrades in video quality and battery life.
William Blair noted that affordability will be key for mainstream adoption. “For this technology to hit the mass market, the price point likely needs to decrease to around $200,” it wrote, estimating penetration could reach about 30% at that level.
Beyond hardware, the firm remains constructive on Meta’s broader AI efforts.
“We continue to be positive on Meta’s AI adoption and the benefits to both consumers and advertisers, and believe the company will be a long-term AI leader,” it stated.
Based on a discounted cash flow analysis using a 10% discount rate and an 18-times EBITDA multiple, William Blair projected about 25% upside for Meta shares over the next year.
The broker maintained an Outperform rating while cautioning on risks such as privacy issues, regulatory scrutiny, slower user growth, advertising pullbacks, and shifting engagement trends.
Tesla upgraded at Baird on shift toward ‘physical AI’ future
Baird on Friday lifted its rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to Outperform, saying investors are increasingly focused on the company’s role in what it calls a “physical AI” era.
The investment bank raised its price target to $548 from $320, a level it says reflects Tesla’s long-term potential.
“Relatively muted stock reactions following a series of less-than-stellar quarters and investor inbounds regarding long-term initiatives lead us to believe focus has increasingly shifted to the future for TSLA,” analyst Ben Kallo said in a Friday note.
Despite three quarters of softer results, Tesla shares have climbed 24% over the past month, compared with a 3% rise for the S&P 500. “We now expect shares to Outperform as TSLA is increasingly viewed as the leader in physical AI,” Kallo added.
Kallo highlights Tesla’s proposed new pay package for Elon Musk, which links rewards to ambitious operational and financial milestones. The framework includes targets such as producing 20 million vehicles, reaching 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, putting 1 million robots and 1 million robotaxis on the road, and achieving a market capitalization of up to $8.5 trillion."
finnhub,META,2025-09-21T11:05:00,What Are 3 Great Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now?,"Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are all riding the AI wave.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c5dbbedaf744ba0d0ee662fd6296d949c97aa75824f174f26925aada5f24b40a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/what-are-3-great-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/what-are-3-great-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/what-are-3-great-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/,fool.com,200,,"The market keeps hitting new highs, and technology stocks continue to lead the charge. One of the big reasons for this is artificial intelligence (AI), which has gone from a buzzword to a full-blown spending boom. The development of AI is still in its early stages, so the winners today could continue to win for years to come.
If you've got cash to put to work, here are three tech stocks that still look like buys even after solid runs.
1. Nvidia
Everyone talks about Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), and for good reason. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for training large language models (LLMs), which has helped it take over 90% market share in the space. This lead, meanwhile, isn't going away anytime soon, mostly because of its software platform CUDA.
Companies have spent years building on Nvidia's software platform, and ripping it all out to switch to something else would be a nightmare. That's why Nvidia owns the lion's share of the AI GPU market and is still growing like crazy.
But Nvidia is more than just chips. It has also built out a powerful networking portfolio. Its proprietary NVLink interconnect system helps its chips to act as a single unit, while it also has other networking components that allow it to deliver complete turnkey AI factories to customers. This is also one of the reasons why even as the market shifts more toward inference, it's still very well positioned.
CEO Jensen Huang thinks AI infrastructure spending could hit $3 trillion to $4 trillion in the next several years. If he's even close, Nvidia should stay one of the biggest AI infrastructure beneficiaries.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has quietly become one of the biggest AI winners. The company is using the technology to keep users glued to Instagram and Facebook, with its AI recommendation engines feeding users content they are more interested in. This is keeping people on its sites longer, which is giving Meta more opportunities to feed them ads.
On top of that, Meta is also using AI to help advertisers improve their creative and ad targeting, getting them better results. That's a powerful combination, and last quarter, its ad revenue soared 22% year over year to $46.6 billion, driven by higher ad impressions and better pricing.
The really exciting part is what comes next. WhatsApp and Threads are just slowly starting to get ads, which is a nice growth lever Meta hasn't even fully pulled yet. Meanwhile, the company continues to invest in emerging ideas, including the metaverse and ""personal superintelligence."" Meta also just recently launched its first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. If any of these bets hit, the upside in the stock could be huge.
3. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) was supposed to be the company most at risk from AI, but it has flipped that narrative on its head. Search growth has actually accelerated as Google rolls out new AI features such as AI Overviews, AI Mode, Circle to Search, and Lens. The recent court decision letting Alphabet keep its search deal with Apple and preserve control of Chrome and Android was another major win, keeping its distribution edge intact. Billions of users still start their internet journeys with Google, and most people stick with defaults.
Alphabet's cloud computing business is also on fire. Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% last quarter and profits more than doubled. AI demand is a huge driver, and Alphabet is one of the few players with an end-to-end AI stack. Its custom AI chips and Gemini models give it both a cost and performance advantage.
Not to be overlooked is the fact that Alphabet also has some big emerging bets in other areas. Waymo is scaling its robotaxi business city by city, and Alphabet's quantum computing team is making progress toward reducing error rates and making the technology commercially viable. These bets will take time, but they could add entirely new growth drivers down the road.
Alphabet's stock has finally started to get the respect it deserves, but there is more potential upside ahead."

-
Insomnia Cookies founder and CEO Seth Berkowitz started his business as a junior in college, delivering 89-cent cookies across campus at 2 a.m. It didn’t take long for dessert-craving night owls at school to take notice: before he even graduated, Berkowitz had secured angel investors. Fast forward two decades later, Insomnia has taken over the U.S. with 350 stores serving up late-night sweet treats, with donut titan Krispy Kreme acquiring a majority stake in the company for $140 million in 2018.
College campuses are a breeding ground for innovation—including successes like Facebook, Snapchat, and Gatorade. Another prime example is Insomnia Cookies, which was created at an Ivy League campus house and has since turned into a cult staple for legions of students looking for their late-night sweet treat fix.
Insomnia Cookies is now a fixture at U.S. colleges, with many of its 350 international stores (and counting) housed on or near university campuses. Delivering warm cookies into the wee hours of the morning, with some locations open until 3 a.m., it’s an easy pick for students coming back from rowdy parties or binge-watching TV past midnight. And its founder and CEO, Seth Berkowitz, truly knows his audience, as he launched his business as a University of Pennsylvania junior back in 2003.
Berkowitz was an economics major living with eight other college roommates under one roof, which he describes to Fortune as “a bit of a frat house.” Together, they’d often stay up late playing video games or tuning into baseball and football games—with Papa John’s as their go-to snack. But he got sick of his housemates constantly ordering pizzas every night, craving something sweet instead. Then, Berkowitz had a light-bulb moment: There were no late-night dessert delivery options around him. He knew he could fix that.
“I walked into the common house and I was like, ‘Guys, I cannot believe we keep ordering from these over and over again. Let’s get something sweet—how great would that be?’ Well, no one delivers anything sweet,” Berkowitz tells Fortune. “And so it’s like, all right, somebody needs to change this.”
From hand-delivering 89-cent cookies at 2 a.m. to raising angel investments as a college senior
Recognizing a gap in the market, Berkowitz wasted no time getting his hobby off the ground. For the first four weeks, he would only get a maximum of five orders per night. He’d sell each cookie for 89 cents, delivering cookies as late as 2 a.m. to hungry customers around campus. But his home operation finally took off when the school newspaper ran a profile on his cookie-peddling scheme, plastering the story on the front page. That evening, he got 85 orders."

Meta’s $799 Ray-Ban Display features an in-lens display and an EMG wristband for gesture control. However, Oppenheimer contends that the innovation does not yet represent a significant challenge to Apple’s tightly integrated hardware ecosystem.

Many companies exceeded the consensus analyst estimates for revenue, profitability, or both. Often these beaters were raisers too, lifting certain guidance items on the back of better-than-anticipated performance in their reported quarters.
Some quarterlies were particularly impressive. I'm thinking of those posted by drone manufacturer AeroVironment (AVAV -4.36%) and social media king Meta Platforms (META 1.20%). As with any earnings season, however, there were also some busts along with the beats, so for balance I'll also take a look at the disappointing quarter from satellite radio specialist SiriusXM (SIRI 0.37%).
1. AeroVironment
The first of our trio to unveil its results during the summer earnings season, AeroVironment is a specialty defense company that specializes in combat drones and associated products.
That's a solid business these days, given enduring conflicts in the world (such as Ukraine) and flash points that might spark in the wrong circumstances (Taiwan). Governments of the world want to feel secure and combat-ready, and for modern militaries, that increasingly means operating fleets of drones.
Near the end of June, AeroVironment published its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 numbers. The company booked an all-time record for revenue in that frame; this was a superb 40% higher year-over-year at slightly over $275 million. Another historical high was recorded for bookings, which climbed to $1.2 billion. Non-GAAP (adjusted) net income per share nearly quadrupled, to $1.61.
Analysts tracking the stock were expecting a good quarter from AeroVironment, but this one was outstanding. Those pundits, on average, were modeling only $242 million on the top line, and $1.38 per share for adjusted net profitability.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta, owner and operator of the hard-to-avoid Facebook and Instagram sites (plus the less ubiquitous messaging service WhatsApp) took its turn on stage at the end of July. Ubiquity has its advantages in the social media world, not least that it draws a huge audience and (by extension) advertisers willing to precisely target likely customers among that audience using Meta's cutting-edge tools.
So as ever, Meta put up double-digit growth figures for its second quarter. Revenue advanced by 22% to $47.5 billion. Operationally speaking, the company's family daily active people (DAP; its current user engagement metric of choice) bumped 6% higher to 3.48 billion. All this filtered down into a headline net income figure that was 36% fatter at $18.3 billion ($7.14 per share).
""Crushing"" would be an appropriate word to describe actual performance versus the consensus analyst estimates; those professionals tracking Meta stock were collectively estimating $44.7 billion for revenue and $5.85 per share for net income.
3. SiriusXM
At the risk of ending this article on a negative note, we have the dispiriting quarter put up by SiriusXM. On paper, the company has a supreme competitive advantage, as it's the one and only provider of satellite radio services in North America.
However, in this age of 5G telephony that allows smartphone users to stream basically any kind of entertainment they want, that isn't a slam-bang advantage for the company. Over the past few years, its eroding fundamentals have reflected this, and its second quarter results disseminated on July 31 didn't provide much relief.
For the period, revenue slipped by almost 2% year over year to $2.1 billion. That isn't surprising, giving the 1% dip in subscriber count (to under 33 million). Those dynamics weren't helped by slightly higher operating expenses. The company's attributable GAAP net income fell by almost 33% to $205 million.
SiriusXM broadly met the consensus analyst estimate for revenue, but at $0.57, its earnings per share (EPS) fell well short of the $0.75 collective prognosticator forecast."

Garmin Investment Narrative Recap
To see value in Garmin as a shareholder, you need to believe that the company's relentless focus on product innovation and integration with leading tech partners can drive sustainable demand, even as operating expenses rise and market softness in marine and outdoor segments remains a concern. The Meta partnership brings Garmin’s health and fitness technology into new AI-powered wearables, yet its impact on the next earnings cycle or on margin risks appears limited at this stage, given the breadth of Garmin’s product launches and collaborations. Among Garmin’s recent announcements, the Venu 4 smartwatch stands out for its expanded health tracking and lifestyle features, reflecting the drive to create high-margin, stickier offerings that could support both subscription revenue growth and mitigation of cost pressures. This aligns well with investor focus on service innovation as a near-term catalyst, particularly as hardware alone faces more price competition. But in contrast, investors should also be aware that rising R&D and SG&A growth could compress margins if top-line gains don’t keep pace and...

The framework, outlined this week, calls for a consortium led by Oracle to acquire more than 80% of a new TikTok U.S. entity.
The app would be powered by a licensed version of ByteDance’s recommendation algorithm, with American user data hosted domestically by Oracle in Texas.
The challenge lies in execution. TikTok engineers are building a separate U.S. app, which would require all users to download and migrate.
Bernstein cautioned, “will the new TikTok be just as good as the original? Or is this New Coke with TikTok’s 170M US users seeking their short-form video fix elsewhere?.”
If the transition preserves users’ years of activity, including liked posts, follows, searches, and personalized feeds, the switch could resemble a seamless software update.
If not, Bernstein warned the new app could feel more like “shifting from an iPhone to a Galaxy,” forcing users to rebuild their online behavior and risking what the brokerage called a potential “mass churn event”.
The stakes are high. TikTok has consistently ranked among the top three most downloaded apps in the U.S., adding 10 to 15 million new downloads each quarter despite uncertainty about its future.
The platform’s American business could contribute between $18 billion and $25 billion in revenue this year, according to Bernstein estimates.
Advertisers have hesitated to commit resources during the prolonged divestment process, but Bernstein said “pent-up advertiser demand that should come back to TikTok once its fate is confirmed.”
“Conversely, any friction in either the user experience of the new app or the migration process itself could see TikTok lose users to other short-form video apps, led by Meta,” the brokerage said.
History offers clues. When TikTok temporarily went dark earlier this year, 42% of users shifted to Meta-owned platforms, 14% to YouTube, and 2% to Snapchat. Every 5% of TikTok user churn could redirect roughly 8.5 million Americans to rivals, Bernstein calculated.
In advertising, Meta gained quickly: larger advertisers launched 21% more ads and increased daily spending by 68% during the outage, while average CPMs on Meta rose 10% overnight and stayed elevated even after TikTok’s return.
The deal also carries consequences for Oracle. The company, which recently announced $317 billion in new remaining performance obligations, could use TikTok to showcase its AI and cloud services to other consumer internet firms."

New RMI and Center for Green Market Activation initiative will enable Amazon, Prologis, Meta, and other leading organizations to participate in a first-of-its-kind joint purchase of sustainable concrete attribute certificates, driving investment into cutting-edge production facilities, low-carbon cement blends, and emerging technologies.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In a landmark step for the cement and concrete sector, RMI (founded as Rocky Mountain Institute) and the Center for Green Market Activation (GMA) today launched the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA), bringing together founding members, including Amazon, Prologis, and Meta, alongside other leading organizations to accelerate adoption of low-carbon cement and concrete for 21st century buildings and infrastructure. SCoBA is the first buyers group formed to collectively procure environmental attribute certificates for low-carbon concrete, aiming to turn demand into real-world offtake agreements that enable producers to invest at scale in new infrastructure and pioneering technologies.
The cement and concrete sector accounts for around 8 percent of global carbon emissions and is predicted to grow significantly by 2050, but low-carbon options are currently not available at scale. The emissions from construction of factories, warehouses, data centers, and offices are difficult to address due to the embodied carbon from construction materials. SCoBA will leverage an innovative book and claim system to enable companies to purchase the environmental attributes from sustainable concrete and upstream products such as cement and clinker, reducing their associated supply chain emissions, and generating additional revenue to help finance capital-intensive decarbonization projects.
""The cement and concrete sector's decarbonization challenge is also one of its greatest economic opportunities,"" said Jon Creyts, CEO at RMI. ""By aggregating demand from major buyers and establishing rigorous standards, we're creating the market conditions for breakthrough low-carbon cement innovations to scale. RMI is proud to work with GMA and leading organizations to launch SCoBA and enable concrete producers to invest confidently in clean and resilient materials that lead to economic benefits.""
Later this year, SCoBA will begin to connect members with leading producers through a first-of-its-kind competitive procurement process for low-carbon cement and concrete certificates to meet the collective demand of its founding members and spur clean tech innovation. The first request for information (RFI) is open now, seeking information from suppliers about the current availability of low-carbon cement and concrete and its performance characteristics, prospective use cases, and operational approaches for environmental attribute certificates, as well as any opportunities or challenges related to participating in a book and claim system."

Oracle shares climbed 4.1% to $308.66 at the close Friday in New York. The stock, fueled by the company’s cloud success, has jumped 85% this year.
Known for its database software, Oracle is emerging as a key provider of AI computing capacity, competing against cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
Meta declined to comment. Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
In August, Bloomberg reported that Oracle was in talks with Meta for additional cloud capacity.
Still, investors have voiced concern over how much of Oracle’s booked cloud deals are attributable to a single customer, OpenAI, which is the leading AI company. Earlier this year, Oracle won a deal to provide the AI company with 4.5 gigawatts of computing power, an unprecedented sum.

(Reuters) -Oracle is in talks with Meta for a multi-year cloud computing deal worth about $20 billion, underscoring the social media giant's drive to secure faster access to computing power, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Oracle would provide Meta with computing capacity for training and deploying AI models, in addition to Meta's existing cloud computing providers, the person said.
Meta declined to comment, while Oracle did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters.
Oracle offers integrated cloud technologies along with flexible deployment models, enabling it to meet a range of customer demands.
The potential deal comes just a week after a Wall Street Journal report on OpenAI signing a contract to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years from Oracle, marking one of the biggest cloud contracts ever signed.
The company has struck deals with Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft to let their cloud customers run Oracle Cloud Infrastructure alongside native services. The revenue from these partnerships rose more than sixteen-fold in the first quarter.
Oracle unveiled four multi-billion-dollar contracts last week, amid an industry-wide shift, led by companies such as OpenAI and xAI, to aggressively spend to secure the massive computing capacity needed to stay ahead in the AI race.
The enterprise software maker said it expects to sign up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in the next few months, and that booked revenue at its OCI business would exceed half a trillion dollars.

Now Mark Zuckerberg says a ‘collapse’ is ‘definitely a possibility’
Deutsche Bank called it “the summer AI turned ugly.” For weeks, with every new bit of evidence that corporations were failing at AI adoption, fears of an AI bubble have intensified, fueled by the realization of just how topheavy the S&P 500 has grown, along with warnings from top industry leaders. An August study from MIT found that 95% of AI pilot programs fail to deliver a return on investment, despite over $40 billion being poured into the space. Just prior to MIT’s report, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman rang AI bubble alarm bells, expressing concern over the overvaluation of some AI startups and the intensity of investor enthusiasm. These trends have even caught the attention of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who noted that the U.S. was witnessing “unusually large amounts of economic activity” in building out AI capabilities.
Mark Zuckerberg has some similar thoughts.
The Meta CEO acknowledged that the rapid development of and surging investments in AI stands to form a bubble, potentially outpacing practical productivity and returns and risking a market crash. But Zuckerberg insists that the risk of over-investment is preferable to the alternative: being late to what he sees as an era-defining technological transformation.
“There are compelling arguments for why AI could be an outlier,” Zuckerberg hedged in an appearance on the Access podcast. “And if the models keep on growing in capability year-over-year and demand keeps growing, then maybe there is no collapse.”
Then Zuckerberg joined the Altman camp, saying that all capital expenditure bubbles like the buildout of AI infrastructure, seen largely in the form of data centers, tend to end in similar ways. “But I do think there’s definitely a possibility, at least empirically, based on past large infrastructure buildouts and how they led to bubbles, that something like that would happen here,” Zuckerberg said.
Bubble echoes
Zuckerberg pointed to past bubbles, namely railroads and the dot-com bubble, as key examples of infrastructure buildouts leading to a stock-market collapse. In these instances, he claimed that bubbles occurred due to businesses taking on too much debt, macroeconomic factors, or product demand waning, leading to companies going under and leaving behind valuable assets.
The Meta CEO’s comments echoed Altman’s, who has similarly cautioned that the AI boom is showing many signs of a bubble.
“When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Altman told The Verge, adding that AI is that kernel: transformative and real, but often surrounded by irrational exuberance. Altman has also warned that “the frenzy of cash chasing anything labeled ‘AI’” can lead to inflated valuations and risk for many."

Meta’s Connect demo was supposed to be ”legendary.” Instead, a cooking glitch and a missed call turned $799 glasses into meme material
David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images
A company doesn’t get many “proof of concept” moments on a stage built for “legendary status.” Meta just used up two of them in minutes. At Meta Connect this week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to show the future of computing: his long-held (and somewhat maligned) idea that you won’t look down at a phone so much as glance up through an invisible interface — and the future glitched out in real time.
First, a cooking assistant in the latest Ray-Ban glasses got confused in the middle of a recipe; then a marquee WhatsApp video call from Zuckerberg to chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth refused to surface on the new in-lens display. “Uh oh,” a clearly uncomfortable Zuckerberg said on stage. “That’s too bad. I don’t know what happened.” The company blamed the conference’s Wi-Fi. The internet blamed Meta. Bosworth, for his part, delivered what was perhaps the most honest line of Meta Connect: The company “missed an opportunity for legendary status.”
The stumble stung because the pitch is audacious and, on paper, coherent. The Ray-Ban Meta Display glasses — starting at $799 and shipping in the U.S. on Sept. 30 — theoretically put a high-resolution panel in one lens and pair it with a neural wristband that reads any tiny electrical signals in your hand to control what you see. The demo reel is seductive: live subtitles; text and call notifications floating where people are looking; glanceable directions; translations on the fly. You can squint and see the outlines of an everyday habit, not just a gamer or cosplay headset.
Well, that’s the idea, anyway. When the calls the company planned as the “aha” moment don’t appear on the heads-up display (HUD), it turns its inevitability narrative into a Rorschach test. Fans see a fixable glitch; skeptics see an expensive question mark.
The connect demonstration was a “comedy of errors,” one person wrote on X. Mashable wrote on X that the AI glasses failures were “SO awkward” and encouraged people to watch Zuckerberg’s “painful live demo.” Another social media user called the demo-day downfall “abysmal” and said the whole thing felt “rushed and scattered.” A Redditor in the r/OculusQuest thread called the on-stage failure “solid comedy gold,” while another in r/news said this “absolute disaster” was “possibly the worst technology demonstration I’ve ever seen.”
Meta insists the products work — the bugs were “demo-gods” specials, the company said. Bosworth, in a series of Instagram stories, later offered specifics: The cooking bit triggered a DDoS-like overload — “We DDoSed ourselves,” he said — when the assistant inadvertently woke many attendees’ glasses at once; later, a rare sleep-state bug sent the display to nap precisely when the call arrived.
“I know the product works, I know it has the goods,” Bosworth said on social media. “It really was a demo fail and not a product failure.” Engineers reportedly killed the hiccups after the fact, he said, but the meme had already minted itself. There’s a narrow window when a company can convince people that a new device belongs in their lives. Blowing the shot on a global stage doesn’t close the window — but it sure fogs it up.
When will the bill come due?
This is the awkward part of Meta’s (Next) Big Swing Era. The company doesn’t lack conviction; it’s printing it — and printing money faster than the bill can come due. In the second quarter, Meta tightened its 2025 capital-expenditure outlook to a mind-boggling $66–$72 billion (from $64–$72 billion), mostly to feed AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg has been explicit about pouring “hundreds of billions” over time into the AI race to build more capable systems (and, of course, “win” the AI race, whatever that means). The strategy is to own the compute and own the assistant — and now own the interface glued to your face. That’s a clean story on a slide presentation, but it’s a much messier one when depreciation schedules arrive even before consumer behavior does.
Wall Street has been here with Meta before. “Trust us, this will be a thing” was also the argument for the Metaverse. Reality Labs has drained the company of staggering sums — $17.7 billion in operating losses in 2024, after $16.1 billion in 2023 — without producing any sort of breakout mass-market habit.
And yet — because with Meta there’s often an “and yet” — the glasses business isn’t vapor. Meta owns the biggest chunk of the smart glasses market. The non-display Ray-Ban line is a bona fide success by smart-accessory standards: more than three-and-a-half million pairs since late 2023, with H1 2025 sales up more than 200% at Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica. Those aren’t iPhone numbers, but that does represent traction, the kind you can build from if the experience hardens into a habit. If Display’s panel and the neural wristband make messaging, recording, and translation feel instant rather than fussy, the category has a shot at going from “toy” to “tool.” And “everyday inevitability” is the path Meta keeps pointing at: not a VR escape pod, but something so entirely and completely boringly useful that you forget it’s there.
The hard part is that “boringly useful” demands… boring reliability. A demo is supposed to be something close to rigged — scripted to show the device at its best, with all the duct tape and people running around with headsets hidden backstage. If Meta can’t stage-manage reliability under the best-case, written-well-in-advance conditions, it might be fair for audiences to assume everyday life will be worse. And that’s why the video-call connecting failure and the chef bit (standing over an empty bowl, with the AI telling him that he had already combined the base ingredients) could metastasize into something like: If this is the future, why does it trip over the present tense?
Meta also faces an optics tax. The company is trying to sell a product in a world that still remembers the “glassholes,” a not-so-flattering nickname people gave early Google Glass adopters (around 2013-14) who would speak loudly to their $1,500 frames.
Meta has more privacy tooling now, but the trust gap is still wide. The Ray-Ban Display models have a forward-facing camera and, now, a heads-up panel. Critics worry that this makes it even harder for bystanders to know when they’re being recorded or analyzed. The company added LED indicators to signal when the camera is on, but watchdogs have noted that tiny lights don’t resolve the core concern: that people don’t want to feel (even more) surveilled in daily life. One New York woman posted on TikTok recently that her waxer was wearing the Meta glasses, although the beautician reassured her client that “they’re not charged, they’re not on, like, I promise.” The experience, the woman on TikTok said, has been “haunting her ever since.” For Meta, the baggage is heavy: Its history of data-harvesting scandals leaves skeptics less likely to believe any corporate assurances about “responsible AI.”
For all the talk of AI and infrastructure, first impressions are still visual. If the device announces itself as experimental hardware, people will recoil. If it can pass as something ordinary — sunglasses, not science fiction — the glasses can earn a chance to be worn in public. The Ray-Ban styling is that clever form factor hack — it looks like eyewear, not a dev kit.
The most generous read on this week is that Meta chose to do the risky thing live, and the risk showed up in 60-point font on the screen. The less generous read is that Meta, a decade after buying Oculus, still hasn’t learned how much credibility it burns every time the future asks for just one more — We promise! — do-over.
Buffering the bull case
The failed Display, well, display leads to a bit of an uncomfortable spreadsheet question on Wall Street: Can Meta monetize its AI glasses ambition before the depreciation bill shows up? Analysts have started to warn that across Big Tech, the D&A (depreciation and amortization) curve that’s tied to AI infrastructure can outrun revenue if consumer and enterprise use cases lag, squeezing margins — even at ad-supported behemoths.
Meta’s answer here seems to be to go faster: lean into capex, reroute the model road map, and deploy fresh surfaces where AI can live as a constant companion. In that ever-optimistic worldview, Display isn’t just a gadget; it’s a way for the company to make the AI people are paying for visible, valuable, and daily. And… Display is a way to diversify where ad engines could eventually show up — on faces, not just phones. Meta has pitched the glasses in the same breath as it talks nonstop about “superintelligence.” A company probably doesn’t say that part out loud unless it intends to be graded at least a little bit like a platform owner.
The irony with the disastrous showcase is that the closest thing to a bull case here might just be hidden in the flop. Live-demo disasters are, historically, survivable when the underlying product is ready — or, ready enough. Apple had the iPhone radio stack juggling act; Microsoft has had its fair share of onstage blue screens of death. What wins out, eventually (and for the most part), is the mundane — the feeling that you can trust the thing... when you need it.
For better or worse, Meta’s glasses are closer to that threshold than the failed-demo jokes suggest. The industrial design is credible. The software, outside the glare of a keynote stream, increasingly is, too. The question is whether Meta, a company with a multibillionaire’s tolerance for embarrassment and a sovereign fund’s appetite for capex, can focus long enough on the dull work of making a feature never fail, rather than inventing three shiny distractions.
So sure, the Wi-Fi was allegedly brutal. The clips were brutal, too. But the more useful frame is the credibility meter. Right now, Meta is asking consumers to accept a computer on their face and investors to underwrite a spend that would have seemed like satire 20 — or maybe even 10 — years ago.
The first ask demands that trust be built in tiny, uneventful wins. The second ask demands proof that the money machine on Facebook and Instagram can subsidize that trust long enough to flip a culture; for now, it is. Meta has the cash and the stubbornness for both. What it doesn’t have — again: yet — is a moment where the glasses disappear and the experience doesn’t. Until it does, the company’s biggest swings will keep landing as punchlines. Meta Connect promised the future of AI glasses. What connected most were the WiFi jokes. The fix here isn’t another sizzle reel or expensively made, glossy, high-resolution commercial. The fix is a dull one: Zuckerberg says, “Let’s try that call again,” and, this time, the heads-up display just appears — every single time. Then, the company can claim its product is something kind of close to “legendary.”
Until then, Meta’s future will keep buffering."

Meta on Wednesday introduced three new pairs of smart glasses, including an upgraded version of its existing Ray-Ban Meta, a new Meta Ray-Ban Display that comes with a wristband controller, and the sports-focused Oakley Meta Vanguard.
However, at different points during the event, the live technology demos failed to work.
In one, cooking content creator Jack Mancuso asked his Ray-Ban Meta glasses how to get started with a particular sauce recipe. After repeating the question, “What do I do first?” with no response, the AI skipped ahead in the recipe, forcing him to stop the demo. He then tossed it back to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying that he thinks the Wi-Fi may be messed up.
In another demo, the glasses failed to pick up a live WhatsApp video call between Bosworth and Zuckerberg; Zuckerberg eventually had to give up. Bosworth walked onstage, joking about the “brutal” Wi-Fi.
“You practice these things like a hundred times, and then you never know what’s gonna happen,” Zuckerberg said at the time.
After the event, Bosworth took to his Instagram for a Q&A session about the new tech and the live demo failures.
On the latter, he explained that it wasn’t actually the Wi-Fi that caused the issue with the chef’s glasses. Instead, it was a mistake in resource management planning.
“When the chef said, ‘Hey, Meta, start Live AI,’ it started every single Ray-Ban Meta’s Live AI in the building. And there were a lot of people in that building,” Bosworth explained. “That obviously didn’t happen in rehearsal; we didn’t have as many things,” he said, referring to the number of glasses that were triggered.
That alone wasn’t enough to cause the disruption, though. The second part of the failure had to do with how Meta had chosen to route the Live AI traffic to its development server to isolate it during the demo. But when it did so, it did this for everyone in the building on the access points, which included all the headsets.
“So we DDoS’d ourselves, basically, with that demo,” Bosworth added. (A DDoS attack, or a distributed denial of service attack, is one where a flood of traffic overwhelms a server or service, slowing it down or making it unavailable. In this case, Meta’s dev server wasn’t set up to handle the flood of traffic from the other glasses in the building — Meta was only planning for it to handle the demos alone.)"

Buying electricity has become an increasingly urgent challenge for technology companies including Meta, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. They’re all racing to develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems and tools that are notoriously resource-intensive. Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft are already active power traders, according to filings with US regulators.
While big tech companies consume huge amounts of electricity, they also have contracts for power that they can flip around and sell when prices are high.
“There will be opportunities to sell electricity into the wholesale markets and make a little extra money doing that,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James.
Plus, tech companies that have batteries or on-site generators at data centers can sell power from those back to the grid when prices spike, said Andy DeVries, a utilities and power analyst at CreditSights Inc.
Power demand from data centers used to build and run AI models is set to quadruple in 10 years, based on projections from BloombergNEF. At the same time, power prices are rising amid this surge in electric demand. In fact, capacity payments — which generators get in some US markets — hit a record in an auction held this year by the country’s biggest grid, which stretches from Washington to Chicago.
The demand is so robust that some tech firms that touted their climate goals are now considering natural gas a key source to help power their data centers. Last month, for instance, Louisiana regulators approved utility Entergy Corp.’s plan to build three natural gas plants to power Meta’s data center there.
Meta’s application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks authorization “to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services.” It didn’t identify, however, where in the US it would seek to trade power. The company would be required to file for membership in order to trade in one of seven competitive power markets, such as the Texas grid or the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which encompasses the Louisiana data center."

Earlier this year, Apple introduced its Foundation Models framework during WWDC 2025, which allows developers to use the company’s local AI models to power features in their applications.
The company touted that with this framework, developers gain access to AI models without worrying about any inference cost. Plus, these local models have capabilities such as guided generation and tool calling built in.
As iOS 26 is rolling out to all users, developers have been updating their apps to include features powered by Apple’s local AI models. Apple’s models are small compared with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta. That is why local-only features largely improve quality of life with these apps rather than introducing major changes to the app’s workflow.
Below are some of the first apps to tap into Apple’s AI framework.
Lil Artist
The Lil Artist app offers various interactive experiences to help kids learn different skills like creativity, math, and music. Developer Arima Jain and Aman Jain shipped an AI story creator with the iOS 26 update. This allows users to select a character and a theme, with the app generating a story using AI. The developer said that the text generation in the story is powered by the local model.
Daylish
The developer of the Daylish app is working on a prototype for automatically suggesting emojis for timeline events based on the title for the daily planner app.
MoneyCoach
Finance tracking app MoneyCoach has two neat features powered by local models. First, the app shows insights about your spending, such as whether you spent more than average on groceries for that particular week. The other feature automatically suggests categories and subcategories for a spending item for quick entries.
LookUp
The word learning app LookUp has added two new modes using Apple’s AI models. There is a new learning mode, which leverages a local model to create examples corresponding to a word. Plus, the example asks users to explain the usage of the word in a sentence.
The developer is also using on-device models to generate a map view of a word’s origin.
Tasks
Just like a few other apps, the Tasks app implemented a feature to suggest tags for an entry using local models automatically. It’s also using these models to detect a recurring task and schedule it accordingly. And the app lets users speak a few things and use the local model to break them down into various tasks without using the internet.
Day One
Automattic-owned journaling app Day One is using Apple’s models to get highlights and suggest titles for your entry. The team has also implemented a feature to generate prompts that nudge you to dive deeper and write more based on what you have already written.
Crouton
Recipe app Crouton is using Apple Intelligence to suggest tags for a recipe and assign names to timers. It also uses AI to break down a block of text into easy-to-follow steps for cooking.
Loving Foundation Model access on iOS 26, so many possibilities. Here are a few simple features that we’ve added in Crouton so far

Signeasy
Digital signing app Signeasy is using Apple’s local models to extract key insights from a contract and give users a summary of the document they are signing.
Dark Noise
Background sound app Dark Noise has used Apple’s local models to let users describe a soundscape in a few words and generate one based on that. You can adjust the levels of different elements of the soundscape once it is created.
Lights Out
Lights Out is the new app to track the F1 season and grand prix from Shihab Mehboob, developer of Twitter client Avery and Mastodon client Mammoth. The app uses on-device AI models to summarize commentary during a race.
Capture
Note-taking app Capture is using local AI to show category suggestions to users as they type in their notes or tasks.
Lumy
Sun and weather-tracking app Lumy now shows neat weather-related suggestions on the app using AI.
CardPointers
CardPointers is an app that helps you track your credit card expenses and gives suggestions on the best way to earn points from the cards you have. The app’s new version is using AI to let users ask questions about their cards and offers.
Guitar Wiz
Guitar Wiz is a guitar learning app using the Apple Foundation Model framework in a few ways. Users will see an explanation of a chord while learning it. The app is showing advanced players’ insights based on time intervals. Plus, the AI model is helping the developer support over 15 languages.
SmartGym
SmartGym app uses local AI to convert the description of a workout to a step-wise set with rep counts, intervals, and equipment. It also gives users workout summaries with monthly progress, routine breakdowns, and individual exercise performance.
Stoic
Journaling app Stoic is using Apple’s models to give personalized prompts to users based on their mood logging. The models can also help users summarize posts, search past entries, and organize them.
SwingVision
This app helps players of racquet sports such as tennis and pickleball improve their form based on the video recordings. The app makers are now using Foundational models to give actionable and specific feedback.
Zoho
India-based productivity suite company Zoho is using local models to power summarization, translation, and transcription across its apps like Notebook for documents and Tables for spreadsheets.
TrainFitness
The workout app is using on-device models to suggest an alternative for an exercise when you don’t have particular equipment available to you.
Stuff
The to-do app has a listen mode that uses Apple’s AI models to listen to the user and convert the voice to individual tasks.

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein commented about Broadcom’s potential deal with OpenAI a few weeks back during a program on CNBC. Rasgon said AVGO’s revenue ramp reminds him of Nvidia.
“You know it’s been speculated that it’s OpenAI. It’s plausible. Whoever this is is moving very, very quickly seems to sort of fit with their persona,” the analyst said. “Now this is really important. You have to remember Broadcom had three customers that were shipping these AI chips. It was Google and Meta and ByteDance. They had four others that were prospects. So one of those prospects this one is now converted into a customer. And it is a tremendous amount of revenue. They said $10 billion next year, which is a very fast ramp relative to anything we’ve seen before. And they’re I mean, they’re implicitly guiding, you know, effectively their AI revenues next year. Well over $40 billion. It was like $30 billion as of last quarter. And I don’t know that it stops in 26 either. They sounded fairly positive that it would continue into the years beyond. And so, you know, if it starts to remind me a little bit of the revenue ramp we started to see for Nvidia, like, like several years ago when this really started to kick off.”
For the fiscal fourth quarter, AVGO expects $6.2 billion in AI revenue, up 66% from a year earlier. The company said it secured $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer. Many analysts believe this customer is OpenAI. Some media reports said the two companies co-designed a chip that will be launched next year.
What’s Broadcom’s moat? It makes ASIC, chips designed for specific applications and tasks. As major companies look for custom chips to break Nvidia monopoly and lower costs, Broadcom is positioned well to thrive. Many top AI spenders are teaming up with Broadcom to develop these chips, which are expected to be high-margin, high-volume products, potentially driving substantial growth in both revenue and profits.
Renaissance Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was the largest contributor to our portfolio performance in the second quarter after reporting strong operating results and guidance. The stock benefited from continued invest tor enthusiasm for high growth momentum stocks, as well as from companies with exposure to artificial intelligence. Importantly, Broadcom has been growing its hyperscale and connectivity product portfolios, resulting in increasing revenue exposure to faster growing artificial intelligence applications and offsetting a slowdown in its legacy semiconductor business.”"

PLANO, Texas, September 19, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nexus Renewable Power LLC (""Nexus"") today announced the closing of a series of transactions that together represent approximately $220 million of project funding for MRG Goody Solar and Storage (""Project Goody""), a 171.72 MWac solar project combined with a 237 MWh storage project located in Lamar County, Texas.
Goldman Sachs is making a preferred equity investment into Project Goody to support the hybrid tax equity financing. Nexus also executed a tax credit purchase agreement with respect to Project Goody. Meta is the power offtaker for the project, which will help match its data center electricity use with clean and renewable energy.
This aggregate financing complements the previously-announced $300 million construction-to-permanent financing facility with HPS Investment Partners, and the $100 million Nexus-Bad Carbon carbon credit financing joint venture.
""Nexus is proud to be working with strong partners on Project Goody and is looking forward to long term relationships with each of them,"" said Sargon Daniel, CEO of Nexus Renewable Power LLC. ""Our focus on having strong partners is one the ways we distinguish ourselves in the ERCOT market and enables us to focus on operating these assets for the long haul"".
""Our partnership with Nexus Renewable Power LLC demonstrates the benefits of our integrated approach across financing and commodity risk management products. By providing the preferred equity investment, as well as being able to combine power markets intelligence and offtake transaction structuring, Goldman Sachs is able to provide sponsors like Nexus with a unique and comprehensive solution tailored to their needs,"" said Sarah Kiernan, co-head of Global Commodities Sales and Global Commodities Financing & Structured Trading at Goldman Sachs.
""We're proud that Meta's global data center operations are matched by 100% clean and renewable energy, and we are excited to bring more new renewable energy to the grid through this important partnership with Nexus and the Goody project,"" said Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta.
Project Goody is currently under construction, with a scheduled commercial operation date in the fourth quarter of 2025. It is the first in a series of projects being developed and constructed by Nexus. The project will provide employment opportunities and economic benefits to Lamar County, creating hundreds of construction jobs and contributing millions in long-term tax revenue to support the local school district and the community at large."

William Blair called the September 17–18 event “an evolution on Meta’s wearable AI technology,” pointing to the expansion of the company’s smart glasses product line with four new models, developed with Oakley and Ray-Ban.
The firm said these innovations extend Meta’s progress in AI-driven wearables, with growing use-cases ranging from simple tasks like reading texts or playing music to more advanced features enabled by improved video quality and battery performance.
The brokerage emphasised that while the potential applications are broad, mass-market adoption depends on affordability.
“For this technology to hit the mass market, the price point likely needs to decrease to around $200,” William Blair wrote, adding that penetration could reach about 30% at that level.
Beyond glasses, William Blair said it remains constructive on Meta’s broader AI strategy.
“We continue to be positive on Meta’s AI adoption and the benefits to both consumers and advertisers, and believe the company will be a long-term AI leader,” the firm stated.
Using its discounted cash flow framework, William Blair projected roughly 25% upside for Meta shares over the next 12 months, based on a 10% discount rate and an 18-times EBITDA multiple.
The firm maintained its Outperform rating, while flagging risks including privacy concerns, regulatory scrutiny, slower user growth, advertising pullbacks, and engagement trends.

Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.
What if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?
Meta Platforms' Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.
Meta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram, and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by more than 3.48 billion people on a daily basis.
Headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $164.501 billion in 2024. Advertisement accounted for 97.6% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.
Meta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.
Meta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).
Meta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.
Instagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.
Messenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.
Meta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division."

So, is the company's stock a buy heading into this report? Let's break it down.
The current state of Meta Platforms
To get a sense of whether Meta's stock is a buy, let's examine how the company is performing. In its most recent earnings report (for the three months ended on June 30), Meta reported fantastic numbers, highlighted by the following:
- $47.5 billion in revenue
- $18.3 billion in net income
- 43% operating margin
- 3.5 billion daily average users (DAUs)
In short, the company knocked it out of the park. Over the last 12 months, Meta has generated $178 billion in revenue, which ranks 19th among all American public companies. Moreover, it's growing revenue much faster than most companies of its size. Meta's revenue growth in its most recent quarter was 22%. Given this incredible growth rate, Meta's annual revenue will likely surpass similarly giant, but slower-growing, companies like Chevron, General Motors, and Ford Motor Company by the end of 2025.
How Meta is positioned for the future
Clearly, Meta is a healthy company that is firing on all cylinders right now. But what about its future? Is the company making the right moves today that will prepare it for five years or 10 years down the road?
I would say it is, and here's why. Meta is making monumental investments in state-of-the-art technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). A significant amount of the investment comes in the form of AI hardware. Think AI chips and data centers that will give Meta a leg up in the race to develop its AI models. However, the company is also investing in people. Reports have surfaced that Meta is paying astounding signing bonuses to lure key AI researchers from rivals like OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.
While all this spending might seem like a negative, we must remember that Meta isn't just spending money -- it's investing for its future. No one knows precisely how AI will shape the future, but one thing is clear: AI models will play an increasingly important role in how people live, work, and play.
By investing heavily into AI hardware, data centers, and talented researchers, Meta is stocking up on the resources needed to compete against other big tech players that also have ambitions to develop and leverage the next great advancements in AI technology.
Meta is already a financial juggernaut. Its massive reach enables it to produce staggering sums of revenue, net income, and free cash flow. The company is diverting some, but not all, of these resources into building out its AI infrastructure. Some of Meta's AI projects are already bearing fruit, such as its push into AI-generated advertising on its platforms, or its AI-enabled glasses.
However, many more projects will be coming down the pipeline. That should help bolster Meta's revenue growth and keep its momentum strong as it pushes further up the leaderboard of largest American companies by annual revenue. In short, Meta could eventually become the great AI company of the future.
Therefore, investors may want to consider owning shares ahead of its next earnings report on Oct. 29."

This is an interesting time in tech. We saw the Nvidia Intel news.
Is this a good thing to see these tie-ups like this?
Well, there's some good in this, always. Look, the United States, as we know,
has to become a chip manufacturer. We cannot be dependent on the rest of the world for chips. Look, we came out of COVID
understanding the supply chain better than we ever did before. We understood that without chips being imported to the United States,
our economy, our manufacturing economy shut down. You literally could not buy most of the things that we want in this country, even simple things as toasters today, somehow have to have chips.
We got to connect to your phone, Gary. I need to know when my toast is done.
I I guess you have to hit your phone in bed to put the toast down in the morning so you you can do that. So, look, we now are in an economy where everything we buy has a chip in it.
We can't be beholden to the rest of the world. So, to the extent that the federal government is getting involved and encouraging chip manufacturing in the United States. And this started in the last administration with the chips Act and we continue to press on this independence of vital necessity goods in this country, I do think is a good thing.
Do you view it as the administration picking winners and losers?
I hope the administration is not picking winners and losers. It's not their job to pick winners and losers. What it is the the federal government's job is is to protect the citizens, protect our safety, protect our well-being. And we know that chips are a vital part of protecting our our our country. You know, simple missiles today have 300 plus chips in them.
So to be to be able to defend ourselves, to be able to build military equipment, we need to be in the chip manufacturing business here. So that I do applaud that we understand the risk of not having chip manufacturing in the United States.
IBM investing uh just billions of dollars in in AI and its own infrastructure. Where do you think we are in the AI CAPEX build out?
You know, look, it's it's the AI CAPEX build is pretty transparent. There's an enormous amount of money being spent in data centers. These data centers will come on
sort of over the next three to four to five years. You know, we'll continue to see more and more use of AI. What what what's going on right now is, you know, people are using AI, but they're using sort of independent software, independent programs to solve a specific AI problem.
Like an agent. Yeah.
Yeah, like an agent.
Do my payroll.

In 2024, Amazon Ads generated more than $50 billion in revenue, making it one of the fastest-growing segments of the company.
The company's recent partnership with Netflix only underlines Amazon's growing role in the space. By selling Netflix's advertising inventory through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP), Amazon has solidified its position as a must-use platform for marketers. For investors, the question is no longer whether Amazon Ads is a real contender, but which players will win and which ones will lose as its influence expands.
Winners: Amazon, premium streamers, and advertisers
The most obvious winner here is Amazon itself. The company has a combination of advantages in the digital ad space that most of its rivals can only dream of: authenticated user data, purchase intent signals, and premium inventory across retail, video, and streaming. By combining these assets inside its demand-side platform, Amazon makes it easy for advertisers to reach high-value audiences with measurable outcomes.
The Netflix deal adds even more muscle. Streaming has become the new frontier of advertising, and Netflix is the crown jewel of connected TV inventory. By bringing Netflix ads into its DSP, Amazon gives marketers access to premium content and simplifies the buying process. For advertisers, that's efficient and measurable. For Amazon, it's a flywheel: more data, more inventory, and more ad dollars staying inside its ecosystem.
Advertisers also come out ahead -- at least in the short term. With Amazon, they get better targeting and closed-loop attribution, tying impressions directly to purchases. The flip side is concentration risk: The more marketing budgets shift into Amazon, the less leverage advertisers may have down the road, echoing what's already happened with Alphabet and Meta.
Premium streamers like Netflix (and Roku) also benefit. They gain access to Amazon's massive advertiser base and infrastructure, and they don't have to build their own sales machines from scratch. This ensures they can compete with traditional broadcasters and newer entrants alike.
Losers: Independent adtech companies, smaller publishers, and other ""walled gardens""
The rise of Amazon Ads is not good news for everyone. Independent demand-side platforms, especially The Trade Desk, could face more competitive pressure. For years, The Trade Desk positioned itself as the independent alternative to Google and Meta, offering neutrality, transparency, and cross-channel reach. However, if advertisers can purchase premium streaming inventory directly through Amazon's DSP, The Trade Desk's leverage could slowly diminish.
That said, neutrality still matters. Some advertisers may resist relying too heavily on Amazon, preferring to use independent platforms that can span connected TV, retail media, and the broader open web. The Trade Desk's relationships with Disney, Roku, and other publishers give it some weight, but it's too early to say whether such relationships will be enough to preserve the company's moat.
Smaller publishers also risk losing ground. If ad dollars consolidate into Amazon, Netflix, and other large platforms, independent websites could struggle to attract marketing spending. AI-driven search further complicates this picture, reducing traffic to traditional publishers and shrinking the open web ad supply.
Even Alphabet and Meta will feel the heat. While they still dominate digital advertising, Amazon is steadily taking more share in two critical areas: retail media and streaming video. Meta's performance ads look less differentiated when brands can advertise right at the point of purchase on Amazon. Alphabet faces pressure as product searches increasingly begin on Amazon rather than Google, while its YouTube unit must contend with Netflix and other streaming platforms selling ads through Amazon's DSP.
The bigger and longer-term picture
Amazon isn't just another player in digital advertising -- it's building a vertically integrated ecosystem. From retail data to Prime Video and now Netflix, Amazon controls both the data advertisers crave and a large slice of the available ad inventory. This integration makes it one of the most powerful ad businesses in the world.
For the industry, the trend is clear: Scale and data are driving consolidation. Advertisers increasingly want major partners that can deliver both reach and measurable results. Amazon checks both boxes, and that creates structural challenges not only for independents like The Trade Desk but also for giants like Alphabet and Meta.
What does it mean for investors?
Amazon Ads is a clear long-term winner. The Netflix deal strengthens Amazon's position in connected TV, expands its already rich inventory pool, and makes its DSP more indispensable to advertisers.
For rivals like The Trade Desk, the challenge is differentiation. Its neutrality, transparency, and ability to bridge multiple channels remain valuable, but the fight for premium streaming inventory is heating up.
In other words, Amazon isn't just competing in advertising anymore. It's setting the rules of the game. It's a great time to be bullish about Amazon stock (and to an extent, major publishers like Netflix or Roku), but less so on independent platforms like The Trade Desk."
finnhub,META,2025-09-19T09:27:00,"Here's Why Meta Platforms Should Trade at a Lower Multiple Than the Rest of the ""Magnificent Seven""",Meta is a great company -- but its revenue concentration and platform dependence argue for a valuation discount versus its megacap tech peers.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=87c7a5004cf5a7193f41b86110bf0230c29745e212a2462a79aea6cb8ba43e6e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/heres-why-meta-platforms-should-trade-at-a-lower-m/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/heres-why-meta-platforms-should-trade-at-a-lower-m/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/heres-why-meta-platforms-should-trade-at-a-lower-m/,fool.com,200,,"Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) financial results have been impressive in the first half of the year. Its strong growth has been fueled by robust advertising demand and an engaged user base across its social media apps. The company, which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, is making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative ad formats -- all while revenue and earnings are soaring. No wonder the Street has been buying up the stock.
Meta Platforms remains one of the world's largest digital ad sellers -- an advertising-led business that can grow quickly when marketers spend and pull back just as fast when they don't. That mix of strength and fragility, however, is the point here. While Meta's execution in core ads has been impressive lately, two structural realities make its earnings power more volatile than peers in the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"": exposure to advertising cycles and reliance on distribution largely controlled by Apple and Alphabet. Add in credible competition for user attention, and it's reasonable that Meta's price-to-earnings multiple sits in the 20s while others command richer premiums.
Ad-driven momentum -- and its limits
Meta's recent numbers are strong. In the second quarter of 2025, revenue rose 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, while income from operations increased 38% and operating margin expanded to 43% as ad demand stayed healthy. Management also noted in the company's follow-up second-quarter earnings call that demand was broad-based across verticals and geographies, with smaller advertisers contributing to growth.
Why wouldn't a business growing like this command a price-to-earnings multiple in the thirties? The catch is concentration. Substantially all of Meta's revenue is generated from advertising, and those results fluctuate with marketers' budgets. Advertising tends to behave like a cyclical expense: when growth fears rise, many brands and direct-response advertisers trim spend quickly. That dynamic can compress both Meta's top line and operating leverage more suddenly than businesses with more recurring, contracted, or diversified revenue.
Platform dependence
Meta's second structural risk is distribution. Meta's products ride on mobile operating systems and app stores it does not control. In its annual filing, the company warns that changes by Apple or Alphabet can limit its ability to target and measure ads, degrade product functionality, or even make access to its apps more difficult -- and that Apple's iOS changes beginning in 2021 have negatively impacted ad performance and revenue. Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework formalized user opt-in for cross-app tracking, illustrating how a single platform policy can ripple through Meta's ad systems. These aren't theoretical worries; they're documented factors that have already affected results and could again.
A battle for younger generations
Competition for attention also remains real. TikTok's rapid ascent showed that new social platforms can win share fast, and Snap's Snapchat remains deeply popular among U.S. teens alongside Instagram. Meta has responded well with Reels and recommendation improvements -- and the recent quarter reflected that -- but the battle for time and attention is more competitive than ever.
While Snap may not initially seem like a threat to Meta, it's worth noting that the company's daily active users are growing rapidly. In Q2, Snap's daily active users rose 9% year over year. In addition, the company's monthly active user count is approaching 1 billion.
What this means for valuation
A business that is (1) tied to discretionary ad budgets, (2) dependent on external platforms for distribution and some of its key data signals, and (3) facing credible attention from rivals deserves a lower valuation than platform owners or companies with more diversified, contracted, or utility-like cash flows. Today, Meta's price-to-earnings multiple sits roughly in the high-20s on a forward basis, below Microsoft and Amazon (both in the low-to-mid 30s recently) and slightly above Alphabet, with a price-to-earnings ratio of about 27. That spread mostly makes sense. Microsoft and Amazon lean more on subscription, enterprise, and cloud spending, while Alphabet has an advertising-heavy business. With this said, I believe Alphabet arguably deserves to trade at a higher multiple than Meta. Though its business relies a lot on ads, it benefits from a broader mix, including a fast-growing cloud segment and control of the Android platform.
Yes, Meta stock may continue to compound if engagement holds and ad tools keep improving. Additionally, Meta seems to try to always be prepared for risks by maintaining a healthy balance sheet -- something that may help it during times of economic weakness. But the nature of its revenue and its relationship with gatekeepers mean there's always a chance that macro softness, a new privacy rule, or a policy change dents performance faster than expected. Advertising cyclicality, platform exposure, and intense competition for attention, therefore, argue that a sustained price-to-earnings multiple in the 20s is a prudent place for the market to settle, even as results remain strong."

“We’re just gonna go to the next thing that we wanted to show and hope that will work,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said after a glitch cut off Meta’s big demo, encompassing some stark moments of tension during the tech giant’s event.
Suggested Reading
In a kickoff of the company’s two-day Meta Connect event at the company’s headquarters on Wednesday, Zuckerberg shared the latest updates to Meta’s AI glasses. But during his keynote address, Meta’s AI glasses glitched not once — but twice.

The first time was when Zuckerberg was introducing an improved version of Live AI. He said users can now use the feature “for about an hour or two straight.” To show how this works, Zuckerberg introduced cooking content creator Jack Mancuso to do a live demo.
Mancuso asked Live AI to help him make a Korean-inspired steak sauce. The tech began to glitch after he asked what step he should do first, with the AI glasses jumping ahead in the recipe by several steps. After Mancuso repeated his question, the AI glitched again. After laughs from the crowd, Mancuso said that the “WiFi might be messed up” before throwing it back to Zuckerberg.
One user on X said of the failed demo: “Buy our $799 glasses to cook! Just as long as your WiFi’s better than Mark Zuckerberg’s.”
The second glasses-related glitch happened while Zuckerberg was showing off the Meta Ray-Ban Display to the crowd. The new AI glasses use a Meta Neural Band, which Zuckerberg said replaces the “keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, buttons, dials” with the “ability to send signals from your brain with little muscle movements” that the band would pick up so users can “silently control” the glasses with “barely perceptible movements.” Zuckerberg emphasized that the new glasses aren’t “a prototype”; they’re “ready to go.” He said people will be able to buy the glasses, which start at $799, “in a couple weeks.”
As he continued to amp up the crowd about Meta’s AI glasses, Zuckerberg presented two options: slides or a live demo.
“Let’s do it live,” Zuckerberg said.
He kicked the demo off by showing the room how the glasses can send and receive messages. Zuckerberg successfully received a message from Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, and Zuckerberg sent a message back in response. But the demo took a turn when Bosworth attempted to video call Zuckerberg — to no avail.
For more than a minute, Zuckerberg awkwardly tried to get the video call function to work before finally giving up, saying, “I don’t know what to tell you guys.” Bosworth tried to lighten the mood as he walked onstage: “This WiFi is brutal,” he said. Zuckerberg echoed the frustration. “Yeah, I don’t know. We’ll debug that later,” the CEO said. “You practice these things like a hundred times and then you never know what’s gonna happen.”
“I promise you, no one is more upset about this than I am,” Bosworth said. “This is my team that now has to go debug why this didn’t work on the stage.”
Meta Connect promised the future of AI glasses. Instead, it offered a seemingly bad internet connection."
finnhub,META,2025-09-18T18:25:39,Mark Zuckerberg has begun his quest to kill the smartphone,"""The promise of glasses is to preserve this sense of presence that you have with other people,"" Mark Zuckerberg said.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=525dfbb22700c726c5b4ee1d98d603911841c4110b096b9a4682921033fada32,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-begun-quest-kill-172539659.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-begun-quest-kill-172539659.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-begun-quest-kill-172539659.html,yahoo.com,200,,"If you can’t resist the urge to check your phone over and over, even if you’re out with friends, Meta has a solution: check your glasses instead.
“The promise of glasses is to preserve this sense of presence that you have with other people,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the Meta Connect 2025 keynote. “I think that we’ve lost it a little bit with phones, and we have the opportunity to get it back with glasses.”
In reality, Meta wants its own hardware to eat into the marketshare of Apple and Google so that it doesn’t have to keep siphoning profits to them via app stores. But nevertheless, this is the angle Meta is taking to sell its most sophisticated smart glasses yet, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which the company hopes could one day eclipse the market share of smartphones.
Meta’s Reality Labs division burns cash at an alarming rate, which has concerned investors over the years. But Wednesday’s event finally showed us a glimpse of what the division’s $70 billion in losses since 2020 have gone toward.
Meta has had its fair share of flops, like the entire promise of its social metaverse. (Remember when they announced that metaverse avatars would finally get legs?) But with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta has created a remarkable piece of technology, unlike any other consumer-facing product on the market — we have yet to test it ourselves, so we can’t quite say just how groundbreaking this really is, but it looks promising.
Like Meta’s existing smart glasses, which have sold millions of pairs, the new model has cameras, speakers, microphones, and an on-board AI assistant. The display on the glasses, which is offset so as not to obstruct one’s sightline, can display Meta apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, as well as directions and live translations.
What most sets the Meta Ray-Ban Display apart is the Meta Neural Band, a wristband that uses surface electromyography (sEMG) to pick up on signals sent between your brain and your hand when performing a gesture.
Meta’s keynote didn’t get into the specifics of how Zuckerberg was writing these texts, but according to Reality Labs’ research on sEMG, users can write out messages like this by holding their fingers together as if they were gripping a pen and “writing” out the text.
While some live AI demos at the keynote failed — Zuckerberg blamed the Wi-Fi — we at least got to see the wristband in action, which is more novel. Zuckerberg quickly wrote out text messages, then sent them on his Ray-Bans.
“I’m up to about 30 words a minute on this,” Zuckerberg said onstage at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters. “You can get pretty fast.”"

With signed multibillion-dollar contracts already driving cloud consumption and more deals in the pipeline, the company is positioning itself as a key player in the fast-growing AI infrastructure market. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, management disclosed landmark agreements with OpenAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD. These agreements contributed to the surge in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), providing investors with exceptional visibility into future revenues.
The long-term prospects of these contracts are substantial. OpenAI alone reportedly signed a landmark $300 billion deal for computing power over five years, one of the largest cloud contracts ever. Oracle noted that 33% of total RPO will convert into revenues within 12 months, offering meaningful near-term upside. Management also expects to sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers by the end of fiscal 2026.
To meet this demand, Oracle is investing aggressively in infrastructure. It has committed $35 billion in CapEx for fiscal 2026 to build 37 new multi-cloud data centers. This capacity expansion aligns directly with its AI-driven backlog, ensuring the company can deliver on existing contracts while positioning itself for new opportunities as AI adoption accelerates.
While execution and margin pressures remain challenges, Oracle’s expanding AI deal pipeline represents a powerful growth lever. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate projecting 16% revenue growth in fiscal 2026 and nearly 19% in 2027 year over year, the company’s AI partnerships are set to transform its revenue mix, providing a compelling case for long-term upside.
Oracle & Competitors: The Cloud Partnership Race
Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud is rapidly expanding its global reach through multi-billion-dollar partnerships. Its most notable partnership was with Meta in 2025, which signed a six-year cloud deal worth more than $10 billion to leverage Google's servers, storage and advanced networking. Meanwhile, Atlassian has chosen Google Cloud to host Jira and Confluence in a multi-cloud strategy. With AI/ML, advanced analytics and global leadership, Google Cloud is further strengthening its role as a premier enterprise partner.
Amazon AMZN, through Amazon Web Services (AWS), is strengthening its dominance through a vast partner ecosystem and high-profile alliances. In 2025, AWS partnered with Nvidia for AI infrastructure, launched its Secret-West Region for government clients, and deepened ties with OpenAI and CrowdStrike. The London Stock Exchange Group chose AWS as its preferred cloud provider, while enterprises like PepsiCo, Airbnb, Nissan, GitLab, SAP and Warner Bros. These partnerships highlight AWS’ scale, resilience and leadership in driving global digital transformation."

- The glasses reflect a bet that they can take on smartphones as a key device people use to access AI technology. .
- CEO Mark Zuckerberg showcased the ""Meta Ray-Ban Display"" glasses, which along with a wristband that controls the screen will retail for $799 when it goes for sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.
Meta Platforms unveiled new smart glasses with a built-in screen at its annual developer conference, a bet that new devices can challenge the smartphone as the key device for accessing AI.
The “Meta Ray-Ban Display” glasses, introduced by Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a speech Wednesday night, were well-received by Wall Street analysts, who have previously said they could help position the tech giant as an early leader in a new category of devices.
“Glasses are the only form factor where you can let AI see what you see, hear what you hear, talk to you throughout the day—and, very soon, generate whatever AI you need right in your vision in real time,” Zuckerberg said. He took to the stage at the company's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters wearing the glasses.
“It is no surprise that AI glasses are taking off,” he added.
Meta has been making smart glasses with Ray-Ban and Oakley owner EssilorLuxottica for the past three years. The European eyewear maker said in July that first-half revenue for the earlier generation of RayBan Meta glasses had more than tripled year-over-year.
Citi Says Glasses are a 'Natural Extension' of AI
The glasses come with a small screen in one lens controlled by a wristband called the Neural Band through small hand movements. The screen can “discreetly send quick replies, texts, videos, images and video messages"" as well as allow users to respond to the messaging platforms owned by Meta—including WhatsApp—without having to use the phone, Meta said.
The glasses and wristband will go on sale starting Sept. 30 for $799 for the set.
“It remains early days across AI devices and glasses, but with AI’s always-on nature, we view the glasses as a natural extension of AI and a must-buy as superintelligence evolves the broader internet user experience,” Citi analysts wrote. ""We believe Meta’s Short-, Medium-, & Long-term product roadmap can deliver continued engagement, monetization gains, and margin expansion as its AI investments remain highly strategic.""
JPMorgan said Meta's push to make the smart glasses computing's next factor will likely remind investors of the ""many tens of billions of dollars that Meta has invested into AI & the Metaverse""—though the company, the analysts said, can afford it.
Apple (AAPL), South Korea’s Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) are also getting in on the smart glasses game, with plans to launch their own versions through 2027, HSBC analysts wrote on Tuesday."

Meta Platforms (META, Financials) has introduced its first consumer smart glasses with a digital display, betting that wearables will play a central role in how people use artificial intelligence.
At its Connect developer conference Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the Meta Ray-Ban Display, priced at $799 and shipping Sept. 30. The glasses feature a small display in the right lens for notifications and come with a wristband controller for hands-free commands.
Zuckerberg pitched glasses as the natural way to access what he called personal superintelligence, saying they allow users to stay present while tapping into AI for communication, memory, and information. His demo had some glitches, but the audience applauded the announcement.
Meta also rolled out Oakley-branded Vanguard glasses for athletes at $499, and a refreshed Ray-Ban line with better battery life and cameras, priced at $379.
Analysts expect the new display glasses to sell in limited numbers, but view them as a step toward Meta's planned 2027 Orion glasses. IDC projects global shipments of AR/VR headsets and smart glasses to rise nearly 40% this year, with Meta helping drive growth through its lower-cost Ray-Bans.
The launch comes as Meta faces scrutiny over child safety on its platforms and invests heavily in AI development, including hiring talent from rivals and committing billions to new chips. For investors, the product signals Meta's intent to stay in the hardware race even as competition intensifies."

Shares of social network Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) jumped 3.8% in the morning session after an analyst note from JMP Securities highlighted positive feedback from major marketers about the platform's performance.
JMP Securities maintained its Market Perform rating on the company, citing strong advertiser sentiment. For example, a performance marketing manager from Nike told the firm that Snap delivered the most incremental reach to younger consumers after Meta and Google. The manager also noted they did not hold Snap to the same return on ad spend requirements as other platforms due to this unique reach.
Furthermore, feedback from Spotify indicated that Sponsored Snaps were 'highly performant,' a success the music streamer attributed mainly to the 'very low' cost-per-thousand impressions (CPMs) for these ad units. This positive commentary followed the company's recent announcement of its new fifth-generation Spectacles and Snap OS 2.0.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $8.20, up 2.7% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Snap’s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 21 hours ago when the stock gained 3.5% on the news that the stock's positive momentum continued as the company announced its new fifth-generation Spectacles and a new operating system, Snap OS 2.0.
This major software overhaul improved the experience on its current augmented-reality (AR) glasses, offering a faster and more user-friendly browser. The news created positive buzz and signaled progress toward the launch of Snap's first consumer smart glasses, which are expected next year. The Spectacles device was limited to developers. This jump in the stock price provided a welcome break for investors.
Snap is down 27% since the beginning of the year, and at $8.20 per share, it is trading 36.2% below its 52-week high of $12.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snap’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $344.40.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

On September 9, two former researchers told a Senate panel that the Facebook parent prioritized profits from its virtual-reality platform over safety. Cayce Savage, a former user experience researcher, said that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) had shut down internal research that showed the company knew kids were using its virtual-reality products and were exposed to sexually explicit content.
Savage further said that the researchers were asked not to investigate harm to kids using the technology, so that the company could claim ignorance of the problem. She encountered several instances of children being sexually assaulted, bullied, and asked for inappropriate photographs during the course of her work.
These allegations build on Reuters’ exclusive report last month on an internal policy document at Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) revealing that the company allowed its chatbots to ‘engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.’
The tech giant has previously stated that examples reported by the news agency were inconsistent with its policies and had been removed.

In January 2021, Parler was wiped out overnight accused of “inciting violence” and tied to January 6th. The punishment was catastrophic: more than 20 million voices silenced, with Amazon Web Services pointing to a mere 98 flagged posts as justification.
Fast forward to 2025: Bluesky, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Meta, and Discord are flooded with thousands of posts celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk and inciting violence against conservatives. Yet none of these platforms face bans, removals, or even warnings. “This is the very definition of a diabolical double standard,” said Elise Pierotti, Co-Founder and Sr. VP of Business Development at Parler.
Even industry leaders are calling out hypocrisy. On September 14, 2025, Elon Musk endorsed an X post stating that Parler was removed from Apple’s App Store for “0.1% of the extremist vitriol now rampant on Bluesky and Reddit,” replying simply: “True.” U.S. Senator Mike Lee has also demanded answers: “What does Apple’s targeting of Parler—but not Bluesky or Reddit—reveal about its political bias and monopolistic control over app store markets?”
Parler asks the question Big Tech refuses to answer:
“Why was Parler obliterated without due process over 98 posts, while platforms hosting thousands of violent threats remain untouched?”
Our Stance on Speech
Parler has always stood unapologetically for free expression. We reject the censorship of so-called “hate speech,” a subjective label that is selectively enforced. At the same time, we recognize clear constitutional boundaries: direct calls for violence and unlawful threats are not protected speech—and Parler enforces against them. Our standard is simple: open discourse, yes. Incitement to violence, no.
The Hidden Hand of Government Influence
Recent reports revealed that USAID funded Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, which produced reports later weaponized to justify Parler’s deplatforming. This raises serious questions: Why are taxpayer dollars being used to silence lawful speech in America?
Parler Returns Stronger
Despite every effort to erase us, Parler has returned bigger, stronger, and untouchable. Today, Parler operates on decentralized hosting, a rewards system, and integrations with more than 20 platforms —ensuring no single gatekeeper will ever silence us again. “Against every attempt to destroy us, we are still here,” Pierotti said. “Our ecosystem is unshakable, and our voice is louder than ever.”"

We would talk briefly about meta, what it unveiled uh and as it pertains to Apple. I am I out of my mind to think that Apple could be challenged by what Meta put out or wants to put out in eyeglasses? And if I am out of my mind, you can certainly tell me. We'll still have you back.
Well, I'd have to ask you first if you have a set of the Meta Ray bands now and if you're using them and if that's the way you imagine consuming content and consuming artificial intelligence. I suspect that Apple still has the upper hand with over two billion uh installed units across the world and the the all of us will likely go to Apple first to consume our artificial intelligence.
The ability for them to give it to us has just got better when the the Google suit got thrown out. So I think they're going to partner with somebody pretty good and uh and I think Apple's probably going to be the preferred delivery device even though those Raybands are pretty cool.

But Oppenheimer analysts argue the product does not yet represent a meaningful challenge to Apple’s tightly integrated hardware ecosystem.
“The obvious questions for Apple investors are: 1) is Meta Ray-Ban Display a threat to Apple’s ecosystem around iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch? And 2) is Meta leapfrogging Apple in smart glasses design?” Oppenheimer wrote.
“Upon closer inspection of Ray-Ban Display’s specification and discussion with MR supply chain contacts, our answer to both questions is no.”
According to Oppenheimer, the device is not yet a full hardware “platform,” as Meta is not offering an SDK for third-party developers.
Instead, the glasses rely on pairing with a smartphone, primarily running Meta’s own applications and displaying notifications from third-party apps.
The firm added that supply chain checks also suggest Meta has leaned on off-the-shelf components, with Omnivision supplying the LCoS microdisplay and Lumus providing reflective waveguides. This contrasts with Meta’s Orion project, which involved more proprietary technologies.
Volume expectations remain modest. Oppenheimer estimates “near-term unit volume of the ‘tens of thousands’ upon release, and a unit sales forecast of 150–200K units over the next two years.”
Weight could also limit adoption, with the 67g form factor still above what most users find comfortable. “While Ray-Ban Display at $800 is an impressive step toward bringing smart glasses to the mainstream, its weight remains an uncomfortable burden for most,” the analysts said.
Oppenheimer concluded: “Meta Ray-Ban Display is an interesting product … however, it is still far from being able to challenge Apple’s wearable device ecosystem.”

Here's what investors need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Point to Record Highs for Major Indexes
Stock futures are soaring as investors digest the Federal Reserve's decision yesterday to cut its benchmark rate and the economic projections of Fed officials. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up more than 1% this morning, while those linked to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were also solidly higher. The major indexes are on track to open at all-time highs, after turning in a mixed performance yesterday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, was down slightly at 4.06%. Bitcoin is at $117,200, trading at its highest levels in a month, while gold futures fell slightly to $3,700 an ounce.
2. Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates, But Outlook Unclear for Additional Cuts
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered the quarter percentage point interest rate cut that investors expected, but Chair Jerome Powell couldn’t guarantee that more were on the way. Fed officials on average expect two more rate cuts in the Fed's remaining two meetings of the year, but Powell said those projections were dependent on upcoming economic data releases. Meanwhile, the Fed’s economic outlook projected moderate growth, stable unemployment, and slowing inflation, with officials split on how aggressively to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings.
3. Intel Stock Soars as Nvidia Announces $5 Billion Investment
Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in embattled rival Intel (INTC) as the two tech firms agreed to jointly develop chips for personal computers and data centers. As part of the agreement, Intel will build custom processing units that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure, while it will also integrate Nvidia chips into its personal computers. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The move comes after the federal government took a 10% stake in Intel. Shares of Intel were up about 30% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia shares added 3%.
4. Meta Showcases New AI-Powered Glasses
Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday unveiled new AI-powered glasses as part of its developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which the company said “takes microphones, speakers, cameras, and a full-color display backed with compute and AI — and puts it all together in a single device that’s stylish and comfortable.” The device also comes with the Meta Neural Band wrist monitor that tracks movements to help control the glasses. The glasses will be priced at $799, the company said. Meta shares were little change in premarket trading.
5. StubHub Falls in First Trading Session
Ticket reseller StubHub (STUB) shares fell in their first session of trading yesterday after its initial public offering. StubHub priced shares at $23.50, and the stock climbed to above $26 during the session before closing at $22. StubHub sold 34 million shares and raised $800 million in the IPO. The money will go toward paying down debt, CEO Eric Baker said on CNBC. StubHub shares were down 2% ahead of the bell on Thursday."

Meta Platforms on Wednesday introduced its first smart glasses with an integrated display, aiming to build on the popularity of its Ray-Ban line, which has been one of the company’s most successful consumer products in the AI era.
At the Meta Connect event, CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the Meta Ray-Ban Display alongside a new wristband controller. Zuckerberg called the glasses a natural step toward what he described as the AI vision of “superintelligence.”
The Ray-Ban Display features a small digital screen in the right lens for tasks like notifications. The glasses will go on sale September 30 for $799 and include a wristband that converts hand gestures into commands, such as replying to messages or answering calls.
Meta also rolled out Oakley-branded glasses called Vanguard, designed for athletes. Priced at $499 and launching October 21, the model connects with platforms like Garmin and Strava to provide real-time performance data and workout summaries, with up to nine hours of battery life.
The company further refreshed its existing Ray-Ban line, which lacks a display but now comes with nearly double the battery capacity and an upgraded camera. The new version is priced at $379, up from $299 for the earlier generation.
RBC Capital Markets analysts said they ""view the building out of the smart glasses product range across price points and with improved and expanding functionality as positive"" for EssilorLuxottica.
""We expect to see further acceleration in volume sales, which should benefit 4Q revenues for EssilorLuxottica, and can help to justify its valuation,"" a team led by Piral Dadhania noted.

A launch event for Meta’s new artificial intelligence (AI) glasses left Mark Zuckerberg red-faced on Wednesday as glitches disrupted his on-stage demonstration.
Attempts to show off hands-free calling through the $800 (£586) Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses were aborted after the billionaire Facebook founder failed to take a video call three times.
In another segment, Jack Mancuso, a chef and influencer, asked his AI glasses to help with a recipe for a Korean steak sauce.
However, the AI chatbot built into the smart glasses failed to answer his questions.
Following the mishap, which took place at a launch event in California, Mr Zuckerberg told the audience: “I don’t know what to tell you guys. We will go to the next thing and hope that will work.
“The irony of the whole thing is you spend years making technology and the Wi-Fi of the day kind of catches you [out].”

The blunders during the live event came as Meta revealed new AI-powered glasses with a tiny built-in screen that can be used to read messages, follow a map or take video calls.
The wearer controls the display with tiny gestures that are picked up by a wristband – or “neural band”.
This EMG – or electromyography – band can detect tiny muscle movements such as pinches or flicks that are then used to navigate a display that only the user sees.
Meta has said the new glasses are designed to allow the user to “look up and stay in the present”.
The glasses can connect to Meta’s AI chatbot, which can take voice commands or be controlled through their hands-free display. They also feature a built-in camera for video-calling.
The screen can be used to display AI images, livestream videos, or to privately check messages on WhatsApp.
Mr Zuckerberg has bet tens of billions of dollars on the so-called Metaverse, a blend of social media and virtual reality.
The company’s experimental Reality Labs division has spent $100bn on the technology.
Its products have included its Quest line of virtual reality headsets and AI-linked glasses.
The Ray-Bans, with a built-in screen and an AI chatbot, attempt to unify Mr Zuckerberg’s vision of “personal superintelligence” and give wearers the ability to link up to AI chatbots without getting out their phone.
He has bet that smart glasses could augment traditional smartphones and offer a new area of growth for the tech giant. On top of its display glasses, Meta also revealed new sports-focused AI glasses with sports apparel brand Oakley.
“Technology needs to get out of the way,” Mr Zuckerberg.
“The promise of glasses is to preserve the sense of presence that you have when you are with other people.”"

Shares in Nvidia (NVDA) rose nearly 3% in pre-market trading on Thursday after the company announced a $5bn investment in fellow chipmaker Intel (INTC).
Nvidia (NVDA) said it will invest $5bn in Intel's common stock at a purchase price of $23.28 per share. This came as part of an announcement that the two companies would be working together to develop artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and personal computing products.
Shares in struggling chipmaker Intel (INTC) soared 29% in pre-market trading on the back of the announcement.
Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that Nvidia's (NVDA) investment in Intel (INTC) is ""less about money and more about influence"".
""The deal deepens cooperation between two US chip giants, with Intel set to use Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPU technology and Nvidia gaining a stronger foothold in domestic chip production,"" he said.

""For Intel, this is another welcome boost, both financially and strategically, as it leans on Nvidia (NVDA) to stay competitive,"" said Britzman. ""But even with the US government and Nvidia on side, it’s one step short of a home run for the foundry business, which is struggling to attract the major customers it needs to succeed against the might of TSMC (2330.TW, TSM).""
Nvidia (NVDA) was also in focus following a report that China has banned the country's major technology companies from buying its AI chips.
The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told firms, including ByteDance and Alibaba (9988.HK, BABA) to stop their testing and orders of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, citing three people with knowledge of the matter.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told press in London on Wednesday: ""We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be.""
""I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.""
Meta (META)
Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of tech giant Meta (META), on Wednesday unveiled the company's first smart glasses with a built-in display.
Meta (META) said its Ray Ban Display AI-powered glasses have a full-colour, high-resolution display ""that's there when you want it and gone when you don't"", allowing users to check messages, preview photos and more, without them needing to pull out their phone.
Each pair comes with a Meta (META) Neural Band, an EMG wristband that translates the signals created by your muscles (like subtle finger movements) into commands for your glasses."

MTZ is a market-crushing, under-the-radar infrastructure construction stock benefiting directly from the artificial intelligence spending boom.
MTZ is helping lead the charge in the once-in-a-lifetime expansion of the energy industry, which has only just begun, to support power-hungry AI, reshoring, and more.
MasTec stock outclimbed Nvidia, Meta, and other big AI stocks in the past year, as part of a 1,800% charge since 2010 vs. the S&P 500’s 500%. MTZ broke out meaningfully above its July records last week, trading at fresh highs. Yet, the AI-driven infrastructure stock trades below its average Zacks price target and at a solid discount in terms of valuation.
MasTec’s improving earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and its growth outlook is stellar. Plus, its Building Products-Heavy Construction industry is in the top 1% of roughly 250 Zacks industries, further bolstering its standing as a must-buy stock to play the AI-driven energy infrastructure megatrend that’s still in its infancy.
Big tech, the U.S. government, and Wall Street are fully committed to winning the AI arms race and dominating the rest of the century and beyond, from an economic and technological standpoint.
MasTec is playing a key role in helping reach this future since it requires a massive expansion of U.S. energy, grid, and communication infrastructure.
AI Infrastructure Megatrend: Buy MTZ Stock and Hold Forever
MasTec is an infrastructure engineering and construction standout that roughly doubled its revenue between 2020 and 2024, driven by massive spending throughout its portfolio. This growth came after MTZ more than doubled its sales between 2011 and 2019.
The company specializes in engineering, construction, installation, maintenance, and upgrades across communications, energy, utility, and other infrastructure.
MTZ is prepared to be a long-term winner in the broader AI-boosted infrastructure spending spree in the U.S. that will be measured in decades and cost trillions of dollars.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Big tech companies are all in on AI, with hyperscalers such as Amazon set to spend a combined ~$400 billion on AI-focused capex in 2025 alone. Global data center infrastructure capex is projected to reach ~$7 trillion by 2030.
Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT use 10x the energy of an average Google search, with large data centers consuming as much electricity as a midsize city. This is why U.S. electricity demand is set to grow by ~25% by 2030 and ~75% by 2050 from 2023 levels."

Chicago, IL – September 18, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights AppLovin APP, Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL.
AppLovin Stock Hits an All-Time High: Buy, Hold or Take Profits?
One stock that has seen a very strong resurgence amid subdued tariff concerns and hopes of an interest rate cut is AppLovin.
Attributed to bullish strategic moves, financial performance, and market momentum, the mobile app technology provider has seen its stock rebound and soar over +100% in the last six months, and is up +80% year to date.
More astonishing, since going public in April of 2021, AppLovin stock has now skyrocketed +800%. Hitting an all-time high of $613 a share in Wednesday’s trading sessions, it’s certainly a worthy topic of whether investors should buy, hold, or take profits in APP.
AI Ad Dominance & International Expansion
Reigniting optimism for AppLovin stock has been the company’s AXON 2.0 platform, a machine learning engine for mobile ad delivery that has been outperforming business expectations.
Determining when and which ads to display and to whom, AXON 2.0 optimizes advertisers' reach, engagement, and monetization, especially in the mobile and e-commerce sectors. Furthermore, AppLovin is fueling its growth by rolling out its ad tech globally, targeting markets in Europe and Asia with offices in Tokyo, Berlin, and Seoul.
Most importantly, this international expansion has dramatically increased AppLovin’s total addressable market and has reduced reliance on U.S. gaming revenue.
AppLovin’s Shift Beyond Gaming
Notably, AppLovin divested its mobile gaming division for $400 million in June to Tripledot Studios, also receiving a 20% equity consideration in the company at the time of closing.
The strategic move will allow AppLovin to streamline its operations and focus entirely on its high-growth ad tech platform. To that point, AppLovin is positioned as the third-largest ad platform provider in the U.S. behindMeta Platforms and Alphabet.
AppLovin’s Explosive Financial Growth
Speaking to AppLovin’s high-growth ad tech platform, its annual sales are now expected to increase 17% this year to $5.5 billion from $4.71 billion in 2024. Plus, fiscal 2026 sales are projected to climb another 26% to $6.93 billion.
Echoing the excitement for AppLovin stock is that since the pandemic, its top line has stretched over 200% with annual sales at $1.45 billion in 2020.
S&P 500 Inclusion & Analyst Upgrades
Further boosting investor sentiment and institutional credibility is that AppLovin's stock will be added to the S&P 500 next Monday, September 22."

Mercor's Revenue Surge and Early Profitability
Mercor was co-founded by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, all Thiel Fellows and Harvard dropouts still in their early twenties, according to TechCrunch.
The company reported an annualized run-rate revenue of $450 million, up significantly from the $75 million figure it shared with TechCrunch in February. In March, Mercor CEO Foody posted on X that annual recurring revenue had reached $100 million.
According to a source cited by TechCrunch, the company has told investors it expects to surpass $500 million in annual recurring revenue faster than Anysphere, the startup behind AI coding assistant Cursor.
Unlike many competitors, Mercor has already reported profitability, generating $6 million in profit during the first half of the year, Forbes reported. The company earns revenue by supplying scientists, doctors, and lawyers to AI labs for model training and takes an hourly matching fee for their services.

Mercor claims to provide contractors to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)), Meta, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and OpenAI, with an outsized share of revenue coming from OpenAI, TechCrunch reported.
Foody told TechCrunch, ""We haven't been trying to raise at all. We turn down offers every month."" He added that the company's revenue includes the full amount customers pay before contractor payouts, which he said is consistent with practices used by rivals Surge AI and Scale AI."

The analyst highlighted the company’s expansion of Reels trending ads to all advertisers for the holiday season. He noted that early analysis shows that these ads boost unaided brand awareness by 20%; this figure matches that of YouTube Select and surpasses TikTok Pulse.
Moreover, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also testing new ad formats, including Advantage+ catalog and app ads, alongside single-image and video ads on its Threads platform. Boone sees this as a positive sign as the company is leveraging multiple tools to improve advertising performance.
The analyst noted that these efforts have positioned the company for sustained growth. Moreover, Threads, which has over 400 million monthly active users, also remains largely underutilized in terms of monetization, leaving further room for growth.
Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) builds technologies that connect people through social apps and immersive devices.

Shares of multinational media and entertainment corporation Paramount (NASDAQ:PARA) jumped 4.1% in the morning session after the company bolstered its leadership team with key tech executives, signaling a strategic push into artificial intelligence (AI) and building investor confidence after its recent merger.
Paramount Skydance named ScaleAI's finance chief, Dennis Cinelli, to its board and appointed former Meta Vice President Dane Glasgow as its new Chief Product Officer. These moves highlighted CEO David Ellison's focus on harnessing AI to future-proof the entertainment giant. Investor optimism was also fueled by other positive developments, including the renewal of the hit show 'Tulsa King' on Paramount+. The stock's significant jump also reflected general excitement surrounding the recent merger, with some analysts pointing to the potential for a short squeeze due to low public share ownership. A new UFC media rights deal was also viewed as a factor that could enhance future revenue and growth.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $17.81, up 1.7% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Paramount’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 23 hours ago when the stock dropped 3.6% on the news that a prominent U.S. senator called for the company's potential merger with Warner Bros. Discovery to be blocked, citing antitrust concerns.
Senator Elizabeth Warren described the potential deal as a ""dangerous concentration of power"" that should be stopped, causing shares of both companies to decline. The pressure emerged as Paramount navigated significant changes following its recent merger with Skydance. The company was reportedly bracing for thousands of layoffs to achieve $2 billion in cost savings.
Paramount is up 68.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $17.81 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $18.79 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Paramount’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $588.57.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

META through Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Threads reaches 3.48 billion people globally, while Snap’s flagship Snapchat is now used by more than 900 million monthly active users. Both companies are infusing AI into their offerings, thereby driving user engagement, which is attracting advertisers, thereby boosting advertising revenue growth.
Per the latest dentsu Global Ad Spend Forecasts report, global ad spending is expected to grow 4.9% in 2025 to hit $992 billion, while digital ad spend is anticipated to grow 7.9% to $678.7 billion. So, META or SNAP, which social media stock is well-positioned to benefit from this spending momentum?
The Case for Meta Platforms Stock
Meta Platforms’ focus on improving advertisers’ return on ad spending has been a key catalyst. Its proprietary machine learning system, Andromeda, for retrieval in ad recommendation is powered by NVIDIA. AI is helping META become better at targeting and finding the right audience for advertisers. Advertisers globally can now run video and image ads to Threads users in most countries, including the United States. In the second quarter of 2025, an AI-powered recommendation model drove 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook.
AI push is helping Meta Platforms offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Improvement in content quality, driven by META’s recommendation system, has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram in the second quarter of 2025. Video engagement improved with Instagram video time jumping more than 20% year-over-year globally. Video time spent on Facebook surged more than 20% year over year. The launch of AI video editing tools across Meta AI and the new Edits app are noteworthy developments.
Meta AI now has more than a billion monthly active users and is available in more than 200 countries and territories. Meta Platforms is focusing on making Meta AI the leading personal AI. The company sees strong momentum with Ray-Ban Meta glasses, with sales accelerating.
META’s initiative to boost user engagement is expected to drive up the user base, aiding advertising revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2025 advertising is pegged at $48.44 billion, indicating more than 21% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.
The Case for SNAP Stock
Snap’s advertising platform is evolving with commerce-driven ad volume growing 39% year over year in the second quarter, and newer ad formats such as Sponsored Snaps are delivering stronger conversion outcomes. With campaign tools improving measurability and efficiency, Snap is seeing broader advertiser adoption.
Snap continues to evolve as a visual-first social media platform with strong traction among Gen Z users. Its global user base continues to expand, reaching 469 million Daily Active Users during the second quarter of 2025, up 8.6% year over year.
Premium experiences remain a key catalyst to Snap’s engagement strategy. The Snapchat+ subscriber base approached 16 million in the second quarter of 2025, supported by new offerings like Lens+, which gives access to AI-powered video effects and exclusive features. Snap’s AR tools, including Camera Kit and Spectacles, continue to differentiate it from its peers by enabling immersive experiences across both consumer and enterprise use cases."
finnhub,META,2025-09-17T17:36:38,Airbuds is the music social network Apple and Spotify wish they had built,"Airbuds, a music social app aimed at Gen Z, raises $5M as the app reaches 5 million monthly users.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9ad6f345bb47f48e4ca3c91c3b44c300495a8f9903c31a543b97196d417118a4,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbuds-music-social-network-apple-163638878.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbuds-music-social-network-apple-163638878.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbuds-music-social-network-apple-163638878.html,yahoo.com,200,,"A new social network has been quietly blowing up with Gen Z and younger, and it’s not from Meta.
San Francisco-based Airbuds offers a mobile, social app that lets people express themselves through their music. Users can share what they’re streaming with friends through a smartphone widget that works with a range of streaming services.
On Wednesday, Airbuds is announcing its raise of $5 million in funding from early-stage venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, founded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
The startup has seen over 15 million app downloads up to this point, and has 5 million monthly active users, 1.5 million of whom launch the app daily. According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Airbuds also has a 96% positive ratings sentiment over the last 30 days across 9,400-plus ratings.
For users, the app offers a way to socialize and connect with their friends, engage in self-expression, and discover new tunes, all in one place.
That’s a combination that top music providers like Apple and Spotify have yet to figure out. Apple has tried and failed multiple times to integrate a social experience inside its music apps. That effort began with its disastrous music social network Ping, which closed down in the early 2010s, and was followed by a revamped attempt known as Connect, aimed at connecting artists and fans. (Connect also didn’t last.)
Spotify, meanwhile, has been working to make its music streamer a more social app with additions like its TikTok-inspired feeds, comments, polls, and Q&As for podcasts, artist stories, collaborative playlists, a messaging feature, and more.
Yet neither company has found the sweet spot when it comes to offering a true social network, because building popular consumer social experiences can be difficult and unpredictable.
Fortunately for Airbuds co-founders Gilles Poupardin and Gawen Arab, they’ve had time to iterate on their ideas.
Poupardin has been building products for consumers since his college days, including a Pinterest-like music bookmarking tool, a voice-controlled smart speaker (arriving just ahead of Amazon’s Echo debut), and a social audio app called Cappuccino that let friends make mini-podcasts together. Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the smart speaker with Poupardin and then later did a stint at Zenly, the social app maker that sold to Snap for $350 million in 2017.
After the Cappuccio team sold the app and its related IP to a meditation studio called Sociaaal, the startup moved on to a widget-oriented app, resulting in Airbuds.
“Because I built all of these music products in the past, I knew that when you ask the users to create a playlist or to do something, it’s a lot of effort,” explained Poupardin, in an interview with TechCrunch. He saw that iOS widgets, which were still relatively new to the iPhone at the time, were popular with teens. That led him to think about building a widget that would show you what songs your friends were streaming."

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks to watch in September.
Dan Niles from Niles Investment Management, in a recent program on CNBC, reiterated his concerns about a potential slowdown in AI demand. This time, Niles highlighted Nvidia’s data center miss in its latest quarterly report.
“Over the weekend it came out that OpenAI has sort of pushed up their revenue forecast for 2030 by about $26 billion to $200 billion,” Niles said. “But to get that revenue increase of $26 billion, they’re going to have to burn $85 billion more in cash. So the data points are definitely there, but you know, we’re in this business to make money. So you have to go, all right, well, do the fundamentals matter right now, or is it the fact you’re going to get even more easy money? The 10-year yields going down to 4%. And so this market, much like in 2021, will keep going up right up until it doesn’t. And so I think you have to look at that. And Nvidia missing on data center revenues, and you can say yes the growth was so high and all this, but they missed, so that should give you another data point. And you throw on top of that Dell or Marll or the fact that AVGO got more ASIC revenues because companies want to cut their costs—those all speak to the same narrative, so don’t confuse the actual data with what the stock prices are doing.”

Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Loomis Sayles Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, which enables computers to mimic human-like intelligence for problem solving and decision making capabilities. Founded in 1993 to develop faster and more-realistic graphics for PC-based video games, Nvidia created the first graphics processing unit (GPU), a dedicated semiconductor that employs a proprietary parallel processing architecture to perform superior graphics rendering outside of a computer’s standard central processing unit (CPU). The parallel processing capability of Nvidia’s GPUs, which contrasts with the linear processing requirement of CPUs, can accelerate computing functions performed by standard CPUs by greater than ten times. As a result, Nvidia extended its visual computing expertise beyond its legacy gaming market into innovative new and larger markets, including data centers, autos, and professional visualization. The parallel processing capability facilitates pattern recognition and machine learning functions that have enabled Nvidia to be at the forefront of growth in artificial intelligence applications. As a result, the data center business, which first surpassed the gaming business to become Nvidia’s largest revenue and profit generator in its 2023 fiscal year, grew to represent over 88% of revenue in the company’s most recent fiscal year. The company is also focused on building out its GPU-computing-based ecosystem and is helping to enable breakthroughs in autonomous driving, and virtual reality."

Despite that strength, I still think it's an excellent stock to buy now. I've got five reasons why Meta is a no-brainer buy, although there are probably many more when you really dig into the stock.
1. Dominant platforms
Meta Platforms' social media sites include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Threads. Those are collectively the most widely used social media apps in the world.
In Q2, Meta's advertising revenue rose by an impressive 22%. In Q3, Meta expects its revenue to rise by 20%, indicating further strength. Although Meta has had a dominant run, that run is far from over.
2. AI ads
One of the reasons Meta's revenue is growing so quickly is that it's starting to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) features into its ad platform. Management noted that its ad conversions have improved since it implemented some of its tools, and users are spending more time on its platforms.
We're just in the early innings of advertising tools with integrated AI, and further advancements could drive significant revenue growth for Meta if they lead to dramatically improved conversion rates.
3. All-star AI team
Meta has attracted some of the brightest minds in AI with nine-figure signing bonuses. With Meta's top-notch talent divided up to work on several AI projects at once, it may be a few years before we see the fruits of their labor. And while there are no guarantees, some major innovations could very well come from this talent pool.
4. Inexpensive growth
Moving to the stock, Meta isn't dramatically overvalued despite its business being at the forefront of the AI investing movement.
The stock trades for just a bit over 27 times trailing earnings, which isn't very expensive relative to the broader market. The S&P 500 trades for 24.8 times earnings although it tends not to grow nearly as quickly as Meta is. This bodes well for Meta's future, as it shows the company can deliver outsize returns with a reasonable price tag and strong growth rates.
5. Revenue potential
Meta Platforms may be focused on integrating AI with its social media platforms, but it is also developing several other exciting technologies. One of them is its AI glasses, which could be a must-have item if Meta can get the price, form factor, and abilities correct.
Its uses could be quite varied. According to one news report, users might be able to look at a sign and automatically translate it into another language. Or it might coach users on how to cook. The possibilities could be endless.
All the projections for Meta's growth and performance over the next few years essentially exclude any contributions from its Reality Labs division. Should one of these products become a must-have device, a massive new revenue stream could emerge and push Meta's stock higher.
Although this is far from certain, start-up-like upside within Meta would be the cherry on top for a solid company, and I think it makes for an excellent stock to buy right now."

FuriosaAI described its RNGD accelerator as a compelling alternative to graphics processing unit-dependent AI infrastructure, backed by validation from LG AI Research and global investors.
The demonstration setup at OpenAI's new Seoul headquarters that operated on FuriosaAI's RNGD cards was compatible with either a standard workstation or RNGD server. FuriosaAI said this shows advanced AI models can be deployed within the power budgets of typical enterprise data centers rather than relying on expensive, high-power GPU infrastructure.
The company described this approach as removing the ""prohibitive energy costs and complex infrastructure requirements of GPUs,"" a challenge that has limited many enterprises from adopting advanced AI at scale.
The real-time chatbot demonstration highlighted how RNGD enables enterprises to run state-of-the-art open-weight models without vendor lock-in or unsustainable total cost of ownership. According to FuriosaAI, businesses can now deploy advanced AI efficiently within existing infrastructure and power limitations, whether through on-premises servers or cloud data centers.

Sui Crypto Price Action: Could Tight Bollinger Bands Hint at Breakout?
At the time of writing, SUI trades at $3.57, up +2.29% in 24 hours and logging a +1% weekly gain. While modest on the surface, traders are watching a bigger technical story unfold.
Past setups of this SUI price action echo similar squeezes in Dec. 2023 and Sept. 2024, which triggered 250% and 404% rallies. It also helps that the Bollinger bands are at their tightest levels in SUI’s history, suggesting volatility is about to expand.
Analyst CryptoBullet expects a 150–200% move if history repeats, with $5–$6 as early targets. That technical setup, layered on top of Sui’s AP2 partnership, has made it one of the most closely tracked altcoins this week.

Since then, the stock has performed exceptionally well. Its returns over this period are well above those of broader equities. However, some might argue that it's too late to get in on the bandwagon.
Meta Platforms is now worth almost $2 trillion. Can the stock still generate life-changing returns? Let's find out.
The bullish case for Meta Platforms
Meta's bread and butter is advertising. The company boasts a portfolio of social media brands that includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. It has more than 3 billion daily active users across these platforms as of the end of the second quarter of 2025. The sheer volume of Meta's ecosystem makes it an attractive place to run ads, but the company goes even further.
It has access to a considerable amount of data from its users, including basic demographic information, interests, favorite celebrities, and much more. This enables the company to assist businesses in crafting ads that are carefully targeted toward specific audiences, making them highly cost-effective.
Meta Platforms' strategy has been successful, as evidenced by its financial results. Second-quarter revenue increased 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, while earnings per share came in at $7.14, 38% higher than the year-ago period.
The company's core advertising business will remain central to its results for the foreseeable future. And here is the good news: Meta is improving its ad business thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). On the one hand, it helps improve the ad launch process with AI-powered tools that assist businesses in crafting ads, including by generating relevant messages and images and further enhancing targeting. On the other hand, AI-powered algorithms are boosting engagement on the company's websites and apps.
The result: Time spent on Facebook and Instagram has increased lately. And according to a study the company ran, AI-powered ad tools improved return on ad spend by 22%.Meta is looking to automate the ad process completely, which should lead to even greater gains. The company could perform well as it moves toward that goal. But what happens beyond advertising?
In my view, Meta Platforms' greatest strength is its ecosystem and culture of innovation. With several billion users, the tech giant can develop various monetization schemes, only a few of which need to take off to have a meaningful impact on its financial results. Meta is gradually expanding into other avenues, including paid messaging on WhatsApp. The company is investing in AI glasses, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes will become the norm within the next decade.
Thanks to its core business, its vast ecosystem, and various other initiatives, Meta could still deliver market-beating returns over the next 20 years.
Some risks to consider
Meta Platforms may encounter some obstacles. For instance, the company is spending a small fortune on AI infrastructure. That could be a problem if its AI initiatives don't have the impact it hopes they will, especially if we enter an economic recession. Consumers spend less -- and so do businesses, including on advertising -- when the economy is struggling. The combination of slower revenue growth (if ad spending decreases) and increased expenses due to Meta's investments in AI could harm the company's financial results.
Antitrust lawsuits could present another potential threat to Meta Platforms. Regulators in the U.S. have argued that Meta has a monopoly in the social networking space. These lawsuits are still ongoing. In the worst-case scenario, Meta may be forced to divest some of its assets. Do these potential challenges justify avoiding the stock? Not in my view. Meta proved it could navigate economic challenges a couple of years ago.
Amid growing expenses, declining user growth, and slower revenue increases, the company regrouped, cut costs, and emerged from the ordeal stronger than ever. Meta's AI plans are, so far, yielding tangible results, and we haven't seen all that the company can do in this area yet.
Regarding the company's legal problems, while it's worth keeping an eye on those, a potential and uncertain worst-case scenario shouldn't deter investors from this robust, well-run business that is firing on all cylinders. It might be worth revisiting the question if Meta loses its antitrust case, but the stock's prospects remain highly attractive as things stand.
Lastly, Meta is now a dividend stock -- a fairly new development -- and reinvesting the payout will boost what should already be superior returns over the long run. So can Meta Platforms set investors up for life? I think it can."
finnhub,META,2025-09-17T10:36:00,Prediction: This Underrated AI Stock Could Be the Next $3 Trillion Giant,AI is helping this tech giant clock a faster growth rate than the lucrative industry it operates in.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=43374e2a9d71cfc809c0a084a0a845d9e217c4faa032fd76a59a95608bc4e94e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/predict-underrated-ai-stock-next-3-trillion/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/predict-underrated-ai-stock-next-3-trillion/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/predict-underrated-ai-stock-next-3-trillion/,fool.com,200,,"There are now four companies in the world that are worth more than $3 trillion (Alphabet joined this list this week), and the fast-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has played a key role in helping all four exceed this benchmark.
Nvidia, the world's largest company, dominates the AI chip market. Meanwhile, Microsoft's tremendous revenue backlog created by the booming demand for its AI cloud and productivity services is one of the reasons why it is the second-biggest company in the world. Apple, the other name on the $3 trillion-plus market cap list, is also looking to capitalize on the proliferation of AI to supercharge its growth. Alphabet, like Microsoft, is a cloud computing player and digital advertising leader.
However, there is another big tech company that's winning big from AI adoption within its industry and could witness outstanding growth. Let's take a closer look at that name and check why it has the potential to enter the $3 trillion market cap club ahead of peers, including Amazon.
Digital advertising dominance is set to give this tech giant a major boost
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is the sixth-largest company in the world with a market cap of $1.9 trillion. It is known for its family of social media applications, including Instagram, Facebook, Threads, and WhatsApp, which have billions of users. This puts Meta in a terrific position to capitalize on the massive digital advertising market.
Grand View Research estimates that the digital ad market could generate $1.1 trillion in revenue in 2030. That would be a huge improvement over last year's revenue of $488 billion. Meta is taking advantage of AI to ensure that it can corner a nice chunk of this massive addressable opportunity on offer. It is using AI to drive stronger engagement across its apps, apart from giving advertisers access to AI tools so that they can improve audience targeting and create ad campaigns easily.
For instance, smaller advertisers can use Meta's generative AI creative tools to create and optimize ad campaigns for Facebook and Instagram, eliminating the need to hire a separate agency. Meanwhile, the AI-recommended content that's driving an increase in time spent on both Facebook and Instagram is another positive for advertisers since they have a chance to capture more eyeballs.
Additionally, Meta's AI advertising tools use real-time data from campaigns so that they can be optimized for better performance, helping advertisers reach a wider audience at lower costs. As mentioned in a company blog post citing a recent study conducted by Meta management: ""This study also assessed the impact of our new AI-driven advertising tools and found that they drive a 22% improvement in return on ad spend for advertisers. This means that for every dollar U.S. advertisers spend with Meta, they see a $4.52 return when they use our new AI-driven advertising tools.""
As such, it is easy to see why Meta is growing at a much faster pace than the digital ad market. Its second-quarter revenue increased 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. For comparison, the digital ad market is predicted to grow by almost 8% in 2025. Meta, therefore, seems to be capturing a bigger chunk of the lucrative digital advertising market. Not surprisingly, Meta expects massive growth in generative AI-fueled revenue, which will be enough to help it join the $3 trillion club.
Meta Platforms projects a massive spike in its AI revenue
In June last year, Meta management estimated that its AI revenue in 2025 could hit at least $2 billion (according to unsealed court documents). By 2035, the company estimates this figure to land between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion. That forecast points toward massive growth considering that Meta is expected to end 2025 with $196 billion in revenue.
But even if Meta's AI revenue lands at the midpoint of its guidance range after a decade, the company would see a massive spike in its top line that could send its market cap way beyond the $3 trillion mark in the long run. Importantly, analysts also updated their growth expectations, and that's not surprising considering the points discussed above.
But then, there is a good chance that the company will be able to outpace these expectations as it has the potential to keep growing at a faster pace than the 15% annual growth that the digital ad market is expected to clock. Assuming it can hit 20% revenue growth in 2026 and 2027, Meta's top line could jump to $282 billion after two years (using 2025's projected revenue of $196.1 billion as the base). If it maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could go past $3 trillion.
However, Meta could get to that milestone at a quicker pace. The market may reward it with a higher premium on account of its growing dominance in digital advertising."

After all, names like Nvidia and Meta Platforms have driven stock market gains over the past couple of years. Technology stocks are fantastic growth players, but it's important to remember that they aren't the only option for growth-oriented investors.
Another industry that offers you a chance to supercharge your portfolio is biotech. Here, you'll find the potential security of healthcare -- people need their medicines, and this supports drugmakers' revenue -- along with incredible innovation. Biotech players are known for transforming the lives of patients with game-changing treatments, and this may lead to soaring revenue over time.
A great example of this is a company that's revolutionized the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), meaningfully extending patients' lives and delivering revenue growth quarter after quarter. And this company also has proven its innovation strengths in recent years by diversifying into other treatment areas. All of this could make this player a growth stock powerhouse over the long run. Let's check it out.
Vertex's earnings take off
The biotech company I'm referring to is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -1.05%), the world's leading maker of CF treatments. Vertex first introduced its CFTR modulators back in 2012, and this prompted the company's earnings to take off -- and revenue has been climbing ever since. (Vertex also has rewarded long-term investors, as the stock has climbed about 190% over the past decade.)
VRTX Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
In CF, symptoms are caused by a malfunctioning protein produced by the CFTR gene. CFTR modulators aim to fix the faulty protein. The challenge is different genetic mutations in the disease result in different flaws in the protein -- so one particular medication won't work for every patient. But, back in 2019, Vertex won approval for Trikafta, a treatment that may be used for up to 90% of CF patients. The company's latest CF drug, approved late last year and called Alyftrek, handles an additional 31 mutations and has resulted in even greater efficacy than Trikafta.
Blockbuster Trikafta continues to drive CF revenue, as patients doing particularly well on that drug may stick with it, but Alyftrek is on the road to becoming another significant revenue driver for the company. Vertex is also shepherding other potential CF drugs through the pipeline, so it's logical to expect this company to remain the leader in this field for quite some time.
And, as mentioned, in recent times, Vertex has successfully expanded into other treatment areas. The company launched blood disorders gene editing treatment Casgevy last year, and this year released Journavx in the high-potential area of pain management.
Casgevy's launch
Casgevy, a treatment that involves developing authorized treatment centers and a months-long process of steps such as cell collection and editing, will take some time to generate significant revenue for Vertex -- it's not like launching a simple pill. But Casgevy is on track to become a meaningful part of the Vertex story. In the latest earnings report, Vertex said 115 patients have undergone the cell collection process and 29 have received their Casgevy.
As for Journavx, from its launch in March through mid-July, pharmacists filled more than 110,000 prescriptions for it for acute pain. The company expects this non-opioid pain drug to meet the need for a treatment that's more efficacious than over-the-counter products but isn't linked to addiction like prescription opioid medicines. In the recent earnings call, Vertex said it's in the ""early days of creating another multibillion-dollar franchise.""
Potential new products on the horizon
Finally, Vertex has four programs in pivotal development and is about to start a fifth -- at this stage, these programs are approaching the crucial step of regulatory review. These include candidates for kidney diseases, IgA nephropathy and APOL1-mediated kidney disease, two studies within the pain management program, and a type 1 diabetes candidate.
Of course, anything can happen at any stage in a clinical trial, so it's possible that even during this late phase of development, Vertex could hit a stumbling block. But, even if that happens for one or two candidates, Vertex is still well-positioned to progressively expand its number of commercialized drugs and treatment areas. This, along with the ongoing strength of its CF program, makes me confident about its ability to deliver revenue growth in the years to come -- and that makes Vertex a growth stock powerhouse to buy now."

Meta Platforms is looking to AI-powered glasses to drive growth, which some Wall Street analysts said could help position the tech giant as an early leader in a new category of devices.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg is widely expected to showcase Meta's (META) latest AI glasses, called ""Hypernova,"" at its ""Connect"" developer conference Wednesday and Thursday. (The keynote address is set to start at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, Register for the livestream here.) Meta's existing glasses have shown some signs of success, with sales of its Ray-Ban AI glasses more than tripling in the first half of the year from a year ago.
The Hypernova glasses, developed with Ray-Ban and Oakley owner EssilorLuxottica, are viewed as a shift in Meta's AI product strategy away from virtual reality headsets. They come with more smart glasses expected from competitors: Apple (AAPL), South Korea’s Samsung, and Amazon (AMZN) plan to launch their own versions next year and beyond, HSBC analysts wrote Tuesday.
Will Smart Glasses Be a Pathway to 'Superintelligence'?
Zuckerberg during a conference call in July said he sees the AI glasses becoming a major opportunity for the company and the ""main way that we integrate superintelligence into our day-to-day lives,"" according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense.
“Smart glasses are a nascent market with a potential to become, if not 'the,' then at least 'one' computing platform of reference for the coming decades,” bullish HSBC analysts led by Nicolas Cote-Colisson wrote.
More technological progress may be required before the glasses can compete with functionalities currently offered by smartphones, HSBC wrote. Bank of America analysts, meanwhile, have raised concerns that Hypernova's projected $800 price tag might be too high for mass adoption, though they said it could help bridge a gap ""between early adopters and mainstream consumers.""
Wall Street is broadly bullish on Meta's stock, with a majority of analysts tracked by Visible Alpha calling the stock a ""buy."" Their mean target, $874, would suggest 15% upside from Tuesday's close at $779. The stock has added a third of its value in 2025."

At the moment, two companies are within a few hundred billion of the $2 trillion mark. These are Meta (META 1.20%), $1.9 trillion, and Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), $1.7 trillion.
But there's another company that looks strong enough to cross the $2 trillion mark by 2028, or even sooner than that. Indeed, it's a company without which several tech giants would lose their dominance: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). Here's why I think its market cap of about $1 trillion will double in three years.
Why TSMC fits the $2 trillion thesis
TSMC is the world's first and largest pure-play semiconductor foundry. What that means is simply this: Instead of designing chips, TSMC manufactures them for hundreds of clients. These clients include other trillion-dollar companies, like Nvidia and Apple, as well as semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%).
Just how dominant TSMC is in the foundry industry can be summed up by two pieces of data: TSMC commands about 70% of the global foundry market (according to data by research firm TrendForce), and it held about 35% of the expanded foundry market for more advanced chips in the first quarter of 2025 (according to Counterpoint Research).
To put it another way, TSMC's second-quarter 2025 foundry revenue was more than $30 billion. The foundry revenue of its closest competitor, Samsung, was about $3.16 billion, according to TrendForce.
TSMC has been dominating the foundry scene since Dr. Morris Chang founded the company in 1987. Superior execution by Chang and his successors has dug TSMC a deep competitive moat in the advanced chip industry. The company is often the first (or sole) supplier for some of the most advanced chips on the market.
What needs to happen for TSMC to hit a $2 trillion valuation by 2028
By now, it's clear that TSMC is in firm control of the foundry market. But the question still remains: Can this company's market cap really double in three years?
One back-of-the-envelope way to answer this is by looking at the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). At today's price, TSMC is trading at about 22 times earnings. If we keep that multiple the same, the company needs to double its net income (projected to hit about $48 billion in 2025) to about $90 billion to $100 billion by 2028.
On paper, that doesn't sound all that outlandish. Indeed, Wall Street is already forecasting high-teens percentage revenue growth through 2027, and TSMC's margins are some of the best in the business. If TSMC can keep a stronghold on the chipmaking industry, its current trajectory could be enough to get it to the $2 trillion mark by late 2028 or early 2029.
TSM Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
But I don't want to make it sound as if this will be a walk in the park. TSMC doesn't operate in a vacuum, and several headwinds could knock the company off course. Geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan is an ongoing concern and was the reason Warren Buffett cited when he sold most of his TSMC stock a couple of years ago. Likewise, the current geopolitical rift between China and the U.S. could cause problems for TSMC down the road. It's notable, for instance, that the U.S. recently revoked fast-track export licenses for shipping U.S. chipmaking equipment to TSMC's main plant in China.
At the same time, TSMC stands at the center of one of the most exciting developments in technology: artificial intelligence. As AI models get larger and computing needs explode, demand for TSMC's most advanced chips only grows. This should be even more the case when it starts producing 2-nanometer chips, which, according to TSMC, will consume 25% to 30% less power than its 3nm chips, even when configured to run at the same speeds.
Whether that's enough to outweigh political risks and other headwinds is an open question. Still, if tailwinds hold and the company keep producing at today's rates, $2 trillion in three years isn't out of reach at all."

finnhub,META,2025-09-17T01:35:00,"The Smartest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $1,000","Investors can start buying shares in several leading artificial intelligence (AI) stocks with a modest sum of just $1,000.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ab7e34a7e33d50cfd15053fe770b2a3a0036c344a2fef70eab77e3b7da52b511,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/the-smartest-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/the-smartest-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/the-smartest-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to/,fool.com,200,,"One of the most common misconceptions about investing is that you need a significant sum of money to get started. Too often, would-be investors sit on the sidelines, waiting to accumulate what they perceive is ""enough"" capital before making their first move.
The reality is that even a modest investment can provide ownership in some of the world's most influential businesses. With the right mindset and a commitment to long-term growth, a small stake today can become the foundation for meaningful wealth in the years ahead.
With that in mind, here are six artificial intelligence (AI) stocks you can begin building a position in with just $1,000.
The hardware backbones
AI development is inseparable from infrastructure. As demand for compute and inference continues to accelerate, investors should focus on the companies supplying the hardware backbone that makes this growth possible.
At the top of this list is Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), the undisputed leader in AI infrastructure. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the gold standard for training AI workloads, while its CUDA software architecture helps form a deep competitive moat -- making it both costly and complex for developers to switch providers.
In practice, rising capital expenditures (capex) from hyperscalers flow directly back to Nvidia. This creates a lucrative feedback loop: More investment in AI infrastructure drives ongoing demand for Nvidia's chips, which in turn fuels the next wave of applications beyond today's large language models (LLMs).
Nebius Group is emerging as a notable player in the evolving cloud infrastructure landscape. The company's business model centers on renting GPUs through a specialized platform designed to help enterprises manage AI workloads with greater efficiency and flexibility.
Positioned as both cost-effective and technologically capable, Nebius is carving out a niche in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) beyond incumbents like CoreWeave. Nebius benefits from strong ties to Nvidia and recently secured a $17.4 billion partnership with Microsoft.
The silent giant enabling the GPU ecosystem is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. While designers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices capture outsize attention, it's TSMC's foundry that brings their chips to life -- producing semiconductors at the most advanced nodes available.
As emerging AI applications in robotics and autonomous systems demand increasingly sophisticated fabrication processes, TSMC's deep footprint in cutting-edge manufacturing is set to expand.
The software superstar
Once dismissed as a niche government contractor, Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%) has transformed into one of the most formidable players in the software arena. Throughout the AI revolution, the company has gone toe to toe with enterprise incumbents like Salesforce and SAP, carving out market share across the private sector and proving its platform is indispensable.
What truly differentiates Palantir is the trust it commands at the highest level. While smaller rivals such as C3.ai and BigBear.ai are left chasing deals that are narrow in scope, Palantir is securing $10 billion contracts with the U.S. Army and forging strategic alliances with NATO.
Even more telling is how tech titans like Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle have opted to partner with Palantir rather than compete head-on. This alignment opened new doors in healthcare, energy, and financial services -- where Palantir is winning sticky, long-term contracts that provide durable revenue visibility and expanding unit economics.
In short, Palantir has evolved into a cornerstone of the AI software landscape -- positioned to scale alongside the public and private sectors as AI investments continue to move downstream.
A magnificent duo
While infrastructure and software tend to dominate the headlines, two consumer-facing giants -- Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) -- remain underappreciated relative to their ""Magnificent Seven"" peers.
Alphabet's strength lies in the breadth and integration of its ecosystem. Advertising remains a cash cow fueled by dominance in search (Google) and engagement (YouTube). Yet beneath the surface, Alphabet has quietly built a vertically integrated AI empire: Custom Tensor Processing units (TPU) that rival with Nvidia's GPUs, a rapidly expanding cloud computing platform, and DeepMind -- Alphabet's internal research lab driving breakthroughs that flow right into commercially available products.
Meanwhile, Meta commands arguably the most valuable social media network on the planet. With billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, the company is not only monetizing attention through advertising, but also unlocking new avenues of growth through AI-powered personalization. Few companies can deploy new features so broadly and effectively at scale -- positioning Meta as a winner in the next phase of AI's digital transformation."

Which also presents significant opportunities for sports-related advertisers, and Meta’s report also explores this aspect, in how marketers can tap into sports communities to boost brand awareness and sales.
You can download Meta’s full, 50-page “Beyond the Highlights” sports report here, but in this post, we’ll take a look at some of the key notes.
First off, the report looks at overall sports engagement, and the role that Meta’s apps play within the broader scope of sports-related discussion.
As you can see from this overview, Meta platforms are a key destination for sports engagement, which makes sense when you consider the overall audience of both Instagram and Facebook, with WhatsApp, Messenger, and now Threads all also playing a part.
In that sense, this does seem like a somewhat unfair comparison, in that Meta’s listing “Meta platforms,” a cumulative grouping of its apps, and pitting that against TikTok and X. But then again, YouTube is there too, and even considering this is a combined figure, 17% is still a lot of sports-related discussion across its apps.
And Meta does break it down more specifically in another section of the report:
This relates to fan engagement specifically, not sports discussion overall, but as you can see, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp ranked higher among survey participants in driving sports engagement. Also Threads. Look at Threads in there taking up its own place in the broader sports landscape.
It’s worth noting too, in this context, sports is a key driving force of social media engagement more broadly.
Back in April, as part of an overview of fashion discussion in the app, X shared this graph:
So as you can see, despite sports engagement on X only accounting for 3% of overall sports discussion, it’s the biggest single topic of focus in the app. That provides some additional insight to color the above charts.
The report also looks at how Facebook and Instagram drive discovery of sports products:
And provides demographic insights for the Meta sports audience:
There’s also an overview of the types of sports content that fans are looking to engage with:
There are also notes on when sports fans are more likely to engage in Meta apps (before, during, and after live events), how sports influencers drive action, as well as platform-by-platform breakdowns of the respective sports audience.
There’s a heap more insight in the full report, which is a must-read for any marketer working in sports or sport-related fields.

Meta says it has sold 2 million of the first-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and earlier this year, Meta unveiled its latest AI-powered smart glasses with Oakley, which were designed for athletes. Silicon Valley is leaning heavily into AI wearables, and Meta seems to be one of the companies leading the charge.
What happened at Meta Connect 2025
With Meta looking to regain its footing in the AI race and sell more hardware, the company had a lot at stake during Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Connect 2025 keynote. Overall, Meta showcased some pretty impressive technology — the Meta Neural Band, the wristband controller that comes with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, is a particular highlight.
And yet, in a twist that felt reminiscent of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” Zuckerberg’s demo of the AI capabilities on the Ray-Ban Metas failed. Whoops!
While sharing a live video feed of the cooking content creator Jack Mancuso at Meta HQ, Zuckerberg asked the chef to demonstrate how his Ray-Ban Meta glasses could help him whip up a Korean-inspired steak sauce.
“I love the setup you have here, with soy sauce and other ingredients. How can I help?” asked the chipper Meta AI voice.
Mancuso asked for a recipe for a Korean-inspired steak sauce, and the AI voice began to list the ingredients that he would need — but Mancuso knows he needs to keep the demo succinct, so he interrupts and asks, “What do I do first?”
After a moment of silence that dragged a bit too long, Mancuso repeated, “What do I do first?”
“You’ve already combined the base ingredients, so now grate a pear to add to the sauce,” the AI said. But he had not yet combined the base ingredients, because he had not started making the recipe, hence the question of what to do first.
Mancuso asked the same question again, and the AI gave the same response. The audience laughed.
“I think the Wi-Fi might be messed up — back to you, Mark!” Mancuso said.
“You know what? It’s all good. The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making the technology, and then the Wi-Fi of the day kind of … catches you,” Zuckerberg said. “Anyway, we’ll go check out what he made later.”
The whole interaction was a bit awkward, especially since the issue did not seem to be with the Wi-Fi. But even when things are going according to plan, these presentations can feel a bit hokey … like the end of the keynote, when Zuckerberg and Diplo quite literally ran into the sunset together, wearing their Meta Oakley Vanguards. It had to be a busy day for Mark, so maybe he just needed an excuse to build some cardio into his schedule."

(Reuters) -A bipartisan group of U.S. senators demanded Meta Platforms hand over internal assessments of how its products affect children and the effectiveness of its parental controls, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The 10 senators led by Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, made the demand a week after a Senate hearing where former Meta safety researchers said the company shut down internal research showing Meta knew children were using its VR products and being exposed to sexually explicit material.
""Parental controls, instead of being the solution for Meta’s rampant dangers—as they had been branded to both parents and to Congress—appear to be ineffective and underutilized,"" the senators wrote.
The demand adds to mounting pressure on Meta after Reuters reported last month that an internal policy document permitted the company’s chatbots to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.""
Meta has said the examples reported by Reuters were erroneous and have been removed, and that there was never a blanket prohibition on conducting research with young people.
Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Richard Durbin from Illinois, the committee's ranking Democrat, were among those who signed the letter on Tuesday demanding Meta disclose internal research applications and whether those requests were denied or modified.
The probe is part of broader scrutiny into AI chatbots' effects on children — including a separate Senate hearing on Tuesday where parents who sued OpenAI and Character.AI to hold them liable for their children's deaths by suicide.
Both companies have expressed their condolences and said they are improving their safety standards.

The company is expected to showcase at least some fruits of that labor during its Meta Connect conference at its Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters on Wednesday.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg will kick things off with a keynote at 8 p.m. ET. He's expected to reveal a number of new smart glasses, including the company's anticipated Hypernova glasses, which feature a built-in display that can provide users with walking directions, translate text, and more.
Meta is already a leader in the smart glasses space thanks to its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses. While those include built-in cameras, microphones, and speakers and provide AI capabilities, they don't include a display.
During Meta Connect 2024, the company unveiled a prototype of its Project Orion smart glasses that include a built-in display and augmented reality functionality that projects virtual items onto the real world.
The Hypernova glasses won't take things that far. They'll have a screen, but according to a video clip posted to Meta's YouTube page and spotted by UploadVR before it was mysteriously removed, the glasses, which could be called Meta Ray-Ban Display, will provide things like turn-by-turn walking directions, live text translation, and more.
A wrist strap allows you to input text by writing things out on a flat surface and translating your movements into words and phrases, according to the video.
But don't expect the Hypernova glasses to come cheap.
""To get some traction among consumers, I'd expect the 'Hypernova' glasses to ... sell between $800 and $1,000,"" Forrester vice president and principal analyst Thomas Husson explained.
""At such a price point, they aren't likely to be volume sellers and will primarily focus [on] early adopters who can afford them,"" he added. ""We're still far away from the ... full-fledged 'computer' described in the Meta Orion project, but no doubt the heads-up display (HUD) glasses partially controlled by a wristband will demonstrate innovation capabilities.""
TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted on X that he expects Meta's glasses to enter mass production in the third quarter and for the company to ship between 150,000 and 200,000 units over the first two years.
In addition to the Hypernova glasses, Meta is expected to show off a new style of its Oakley-branded smart glasses using the line's Sphaera styling. Unlike the company's Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, which have cameras on the left and right arms, the cameras will be moved to the center of the glasses, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman."

Founders hold a unique ability to shape and grow a company from inception, much like a parent nurturing a child. They have a clear vision and relentlessly back their ventures. Unlike traditional managers, founders often take greater risks, pursue unconventional ideas and drive innovation with bold choices. Their businesses frequently mirror their core values, ideals, and long-term aspirations, making them enduring reflections of their dedication and ambition.
Founder-run companies represent less than 5% of the S&P 500 index. But that does not make their contribution any less. Everyone is aware of the success stories of visionary founder-owners like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, who have redefined industries, creating trillion-dollar companies that continue to thrive. Some of today’s prominent founder-run companies are NVIDIA, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet and Netflix. Founder-led companies represent nearly 15% of the total index’s market capitalization, with technology companies taking the lead.
These companies, often sparked by unique ideas, are typically rooted in technological innovation. Built from scratch, they are designed to withstand challenges and remain sustainable over the long run. In the early stages, others may struggle to see the founder’s vision, making fundraising difficult. As a result, founders frequently invest their personal savings to bootstrap operations. If the venture succeeds, it may later attract angel investors or external funding, yet the founder-owner consistently bears the greatest stake and risk.
Moreover, founder-owners often struggle to delegate responsibilities, driven by skepticism about whether others can truly match their level of commitment or understanding. Thus, they tend to assume multiple senior roles and frequently struggle to identify a capable successor. Yet, excelling across all areas is rarely feasible. This hesitation to delegate can restrict the infusion of professional expertise, potentially impeding the company’s ability to scale effectively or respond swiftly to changing market dynamics.
Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that founder-led companies tend to perform better over time. Per a Harvard Business Review Study, founder-led companies had a market-adjusted return of 12% over three years against a return of negative 26% for companies that hired a professional CEO. Our Founder-Run Companies Screen further makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks. Currently, stocks like AppLovin Corporation APP, Palantir Technologies PLTR, Blackstone Inc. BX and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD look appealing.

Meta Platforms (META, Financials) is preparing to roll out its first smart glasses with a built-in display this week at its annual Connect conference, a move aimed at advancing its augmented reality plans even as questions remain about consumer demand.
The new device, known internally as Hypernova and likely to be marketed as Celeste, will feature a small display in the right lens to show notifications and other simple information. Analysts expect the glasses to sell for about $800 more than double the price of Meta's Ray-Ban line, which starts at $299.
That sticker price could limit adoption. IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani said sales may reach only a few hundred thousand units, but added that the glasses could help attract developers to build new apps for Meta's AR platform.
The launch comes as Meta continues to pour billions into augmented reality and artificial intelligence. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said smart glasses will eventually become the company's main gateway to advanced AI, though Meta's Reality Labs division has posted heavy losses.
Alongside Celeste, Meta is also expected to introduce a wristband controller for gesture-based input and upgrades to its Ray-Ban glasses, including better cameras, longer battery life and added AI functions.
For investors, the bigger story is less about near-term sales and more about the company's longer bet on AR. Meta is already working toward a more advanced headset, known as Orion, planned for release in 2027."

DENVER, September 16, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MetaRouter, the leading customer data infrastructure platform, today announced a strategic partnership with Vantage, the only end-to-end retail media orchestration platform, to help retailers unlock and scale the value of their first-party data while giving advertisers faster, more effective campaign activation.
The partnership combines MetaRouter’s real-time, server-side data and audience routing with Vantage’s media campaign orchestration layer to deliver privacy-safe, high-quality audiences that fuel more relevant, measurable retail media campaigns. Already, joint activations between MetaRouter and Vantage have demonstrated a minimum 39% improvement in return on ad spend with one campaign increasing ROAS 370% on Meta.
""MetaRouter provides the critical identity and data foundation that every retail media network needs,"" says Nick Hinsley, Chief Revenue Officer at Vantage. ""Together, we're helping retailers transform first-party data into scalable, high-performing media campaigns that deliver results for both retailers and brands across onsite and offsite.""
By combining MetaRouter’s privacy-first, high-quality data foundation with Vantage’s best-in-class orchestration capabilities, retailers unlock new levels of speed, efficiency, and monetization:
-
Clean, compliant data pipelines power real-time campaign activation, delivering audiences and CAPI data within milliseconds
-
Durable identity resolution improves audience addressability 2-5x for targeting
-
Consent enforcement and automation ensure compliance and user preferences are met without slowing operations
-
Scalable delivery of audiences to all onsite ad servers and offsite platforms accelerates revenue growth across media formats
""Retailers are sitting on a goldmine of first-party data, but it requires the right infrastructure to unlock its full value,"" said Greg Brunk, Co-Founder and Head of Product at MetaRouter. ""MetaRouter’s real-time customer data infrastructure gives retailers the ability to activate that data in a privacy-safe manner, driving measurable ROI for their brand partners.""
When a top-5 retail media network in North America set out to unify customer identity and activate real-time data, it turned to MetaRouter and Vantage. Together, the two platforms created a high-performance off-site audience targeting capability that strengthens data collection, identity resolution, campaign orchestration, and measurement, driving scalable growth in the privacy-first European market. The solution led to a 2.5X improvement in audience match rates, and median increases of 17% in click-through rates, 71% in conversion rates, 89% in brand return on ad spend, 24% in offsite ads revenue, and 1.5X increase in onsite ads given the increased traffic back from higher CTRs."

(Reuters) -Meta (META) is expected to double down on AI-powered augmented reality products with new smart glasses at its annual Connect event on Wednesday, even as the company faces scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media platforms.
At its Menlo Park, California-based headquarters, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to unveil Meta's first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display, a device that analysts predicted will retail for about $800.
Internally codenamed ""Hypernova,” the glasses are expected to be launched as ""Celeste,"" analysts said, and will feature a small digital display in the right lens for basic functions such as notifications.
The new glasses are the latest in Meta's effort to stay relevant in the AI race, where it is lagging rivals such as OpenAI and Alphabet's Google, but analysts said the device's hefty price tag could deter buyers.
The product will likely be much less advanced than the ""Orion"" prototype glasses that Meta showcased at last year's event, a device that Zuckerberg called ""the time machine to the future."" The company did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the new glasses.
Meta, which expects to launch Orion in 2027, currently offers two lines of glasses - in collaboration with Ray Ban and Oakley - that incorporate artificial intelligence features, cameras, hands-free control and livestreaming to Meta's social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram.
Zuckerberg, who has poured more than $60 billion since 2020 into Meta's augmented reality unit, has said that smart glasses will be the company's main conduit to integrate superintelligence - a hypothetical concept where AI surpasses human intelligence in every possible way - into everyday human lives.
In the effort to catch up in AI, Zuckerberg has sparked a billion-dollar talent war, aggressively poaching researchers from rivals, while whistleblowers have said Meta was putting profit over user safety.
Reuters reported last month that Meta's AI policies allowed its chatbots to engage children in provocative conversations about sex and race, and whistleblowers said earlier this month Meta's researchers were told not to investigate harms to children using its virtual reality technology so that the company could claim ignorance of the problem.
Meta told Reuters previously that it has removed portions in its policies that stated it was permissible for chatbots to engage in romantic roleplay with children."

Critics point to the tech sector’s outsize influence on this year’s gain, with just five stocks, all megacap tech firms, driving half of the 12% advance. But a closer look shows tech giants have largely justified their elevated valuations with profit growth that outstrips share-price appreciation.

It’s the rest of the market that is starting to look a bit overpriced, according to Seaport Research Partners.
An index of S&P 500 companies that excludes the technology sector has risen a solid 13% over the last year, but has seen profits grow by just 6.4%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The S&P 500 Information Technology index has surged 27%, a rate that looks more restrained when put up against the sector’s earnings growth of 26.9%.
The worries are shifting after a stellar earnings season for Big Tech masked worrying trends in other areas of the market. The materials sector, largely comprised of chemicals manufacturers and miners, has climbed 9% this year while earnings have dropped 13%. One of the clearest examples in the sector is Dow Inc., now the most expensive stock in the entire S&P 500, trading at an astounding 914-times earnings.
“Where is the speculation? The speculation is not in the tech stuff, it’s in the non-tech stuff,” Jonathan Golub, managing director and chief equity strategist at Seaport Research Partners, said by phone.
The S&P 500 trades at more than 27 times forward earnings, a level reached only in other times of extreme bullishness. Tech shares also sport heady valuations, with some such as Oracle Corp. and Broadcom Corp. trading at 67 times profits and 86 times profits — worrisome, to be sure.
But the Magnificent 7 tech giants that includes the likes of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) has seen its P/E ratio fall by 7.9% in 2025 even as its shares have surged by 18%. And while the group’s P/E, at 43, is elevated relative to the market, its profit forecasts for growth of 20% in the coming 12 months may partly justify the price.
Seaport data show that a broader look at tech and tech-heavy stocks shows a similar picture. It groups all the tech companies in the S&P 500 plus Alphabet, Meta and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which are in the communications services sector. Their shares have climbed roughly 15% this year, essentially matching the 15% growth in earnings per share."

Despite a severe drawdown in 2022, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite has doubled in value over the last five years. This shows the value of buying and holding shares of great companies instead of trading in and out.
If you're looking for quality growth stocks to safely grow your money over the long haul, here are two tech companies you almost can't go wrong with.
1. Meta Platforms

With over 3.4 billion people using its social media platforms every day, Meta will benefit tremendously over the next decade as AI proliferates into people's lives.
Meta is integrating AI deeply into its ad business, which drives virtually all the company's $178 billion in trailing revenue. AI-powered advertising leads to more relevant ads, higher conversions, and more engagement from users, which ultimately creates positive returns for advertisers. The company's revenue grew 22% year over year in the second quarter, driven by higher ad impressions and average price per ad.
Meta AI has been a key driver of engagement for the company's family of apps. This AI-powered assistant has over 1 billion active users. Meta AI is helping create more relevant product recommendations and information for users, making it a valuable asset in growing ad revenue.
On the consumer side, Meta is showing great potential with smart glasses. Its Ray-Ban AI glasses have been a hit, and Meta is preparing to launch new sports glasses in partnership with Oakley to drive more growth.
AI glasses have the potential to replace phones one day as technology continues to advance. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted on the company's earnings call, these products could become the main way that people use AI over time. If that happens, Meta Platforms would benefit from having one of the hottest consumer products in the next 10 years.
Meta wouldn't be able to pursue these opportunities without substantial cash resources. Its lucrative ad business helped generate $50 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters, which is funding massive investments in data centers and AI. Meta is one of the few consumer-facing companies making billions off of AI technology right now, making it a compelling investment.
2. Netflix
Netflix (NFLX -1.02%) has grown into a dominant entertainment streaming service over the last decade, which has created tremendous wealth for shareholders. But it's not done. As it expands into advertising and other content like live sports, the stock has real potential to keep climbing in the years to come.
Netflix recently completed the rollout of its proprietary ad-tech platform. The significance of this is that it lessens the dependence on third-party technology and enables the company to push full throttle into serving large advertisers.
It's already showing tremendous potential. Ad revenue is expected to double this year, indicating strong demand for ad-supported subscription plans. This puts Netflix in a strong position to continue growing its already massive subscriber base.
Streaming became significantly more competitive in recent years, but Netflix continues to deliver above-average growth. Revenue has consistently grown around 16% year over year in recent quarters. While advertising revenue is not disclosed partly because it's still a small part of the business, Netflix's growing content library and entry into live sports streaming could make the platform a digital entertainment juggernaut in the next decade.
Management is only interested in pursuing sports deals where it generates a healthy profit for shareholders. So far, the live events make up a small portion of total content spending, but management indicated that these are high-value engagements. Sports streaming has had a significant impact on subscriber conversion and retention.
Growth in advertising and sports streaming is going to turn Netflix into a more valuable business in the next decade. Over the next several years, analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 23%, which should deliver market-beating returns for shareholders."
finnhub,META,2025-09-16T09:55:00,The Trade Desk Is Now the Worst-Performing S&P 500 Stock This Year. Is it a Buying Opportunity or a Red Flag?,The ad tech stock has faced multiple challenges this year.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b2d750dc441c9996abd4fa85b66ef45251ebc8180d32d34cc7df30ca30157452,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/trade-desk-worst-performing-sp-500-buy-red-flag/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/trade-desk-worst-performing-sp-500-buy-red-flag/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/trade-desk-worst-performing-sp-500-buy-red-flag/,fool.com,200,,"For years, The Trade Desk (TTD 0.73%) was a stock market darling, marching steadily higher as it delivered solid growth year in, year out. The company established itself as the leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in the rapidly emerging ad tech industry, and capitalized on new platforms like Connected TV and retail media.
However, this year, The Trade Desk has run into some unforeseen challenges. Growth suddenly slowed as the company appears to be facing new challenges from ""walled gardens,"" the tech giants like Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon that operate their own ad ecosystems that can block The Trade Desk. After Netflix and Amazon announced that they had formed a partnership allowing advertisers to purchase Netflix ads through Amazon DSP, The Trade Desk plunged double-digits on Wednesday, becoming the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 this year, trading down 61% year-to-date as of Sept. 11.
The stock also plunged following the release of two out of its three earnings reports this year (see chart below).
Let's review the challenges facing The Trade Desk before discussing whether or not the stock is a buy.
What's ailing The Trade Desk?
When The Trade Desk plunged in February, it was the first time in its publicly traded history that the company had missed its guidance.
CEO Jeff Green admitted that on the earnings call, and explained it wasn't due to competition or new technology, or any significant change like that. The Trade Desk just had a few internal errors, or what Green called ""a series of small execution missteps."" However, he attempted to reassure investors, saying, ""We see a larger and faster-growing market than we originally expected.""
The company's first-quarter earnings report in May reassured investors as revenue growth accelerated again, but the stock then plunged again as the company posted its slowest quarter of growth in its history (just 19%), with the exception of the beginning of the pandemic.
For the third quarter, it called for revenue growth to slow to at least 14%, though it would be 18% adjusting for the decline in political ad spend. This time around, Green cited headwinds from tariffs on some of its biggest customers and downplayed the threat from Amazon, which has made more investments in its DSP.
The stock received several analyst downgrades on the report as its growth is decelerating even as digitial advertising growth is strong at industry leaders like Meta Platforms, key verticals like Connected TV (CTV) are maturing, and increasing competition from alternatives like Amazon.
Is The Trade Desk a buy?
Following the earnings report, Walmart ended its exclusivity deal with The Trade Desk for advertisers using its shopper data, according to The Information, and it was later hit by the news of the Amazon-Netflix partnership, allowing Netflix ad inventory to be purchased through Amazon's DSP.
Despite Green's efforts to reassure investors, there's not much reason to be positive about The Trade Desk right now. Its growth rate seems to have fallen below 20% for good, and its underperformance relative to the rest of the digital advertising market is notable.
It's not fully clear what's pressuring the company, though competition appears to be a factor, as does the dominance of walled gardens, which are continuing to perform well.
The Trade Desk has become more attractive on a valuation basis as the stock has fallen, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 26 based on adjusted earnings per share.
However, The Trade Desk stock could head lower if its growth continues to decelerate. The company has a long history of delivering results, and it should eventually be able to recoup some of its recent losses, but patience seems like the best approach at this point for would-be buyers."

Chicago, IL – September 16, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nebius Group NBIS, Meta META, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Nvidia NVDA.
Nosebleed Valuation: Why Nebius' Microsoft Deal Changes Everything
Nebius Group: An AI Infrastructure Leader
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Nebius Group is a leading artificial intelligence infrastructure company. The Netherlands-based company’s core business is Nebius, an AI-centric cloud platform built for intensive AI workloads. Nebius builds full-stack infrastructure for AI, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms and tools, and services for developers.
Nebius’ two main businesses are:
· AI Infrastructure: Mega-cap tech companies like Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers to train and optimize their large language models. With so much capital at stake, they cannot build data centers fast enough and are reliant on companies like Nebius.
· AI Cloud Services: Nebius also offers its AI infrastructure as a service, allowing big tech companies to gain access to resources at a lower cost.
What Sets Nebius Apart from it’s Competitors?
What separates NBIS from most competitors is that it is vertically integrated, meaning it provides its own proprietary AI software and hardware, including servers and racks.
Nvidia Partnership is a Competitive Advantage for Nebius
Nvidia is the undisputed chip leader in the AI market. Simply put, if you want to run the best AI models, you need Nvidia’s GPUs. With demand soaring for NVDA GPUs, many companies do not need to wait for Nvidia’s in-demand top-of-the line technology. Not Nebius. Nvidia is both a partner and investor in Nebius. Through the agreement, Nebius enjoys priority access to Nvidia’s latest and most powerful GPUs. Meanwhile, according to the latest filings, Nvidia owns roughly ~$700 million worth of NBIS, meaning it has “skin in the game.”
Have NBIS Shares Run Too Far, Too Fast?
NBIS has a “nosebleed” price-to-sales ratio nearing 100x. Meanwhile, as the AI hype builds on Wall Street Nebius shares have exploded by nearly 400% since going public late last year.
Microsoft Deal is a Gamechanger for Nebius
If there is one lesson I have learned in my two decades of investing, it’s that traditional valuations mean little in a vacuum. Instead, investors must weigh forward growth and fundamental catalysts to get a clear picture. Because of a new bullish catalyst, Nebius is an example of a high valuation stock worth owning."
finnhub,META,2025-09-16T08:02:00,"Prediction: This Unstoppable Stock Will Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet in the $3 Trillion Club Before 2029",A strong track record of growth and a proven strategy will ensure its membership in this exclusive society.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0ba36db22245d0c64f20cc8df55f0afcc5a2f79591d123e2f0f0df389122f122,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/prediction-this-unstoppable-stock-will-join-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/prediction-this-unstoppable-stock-will-join-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/16/prediction-this-unstoppable-stock-will-join-nvidia/,fool.com,200,,"Advances in technology over the past two decades have shifted the landscape in terms of the world's most valuable companies. Once upon a time, industrial and energy stalwarts led the way, but those days are long gone.
For instance, ExxonMobil and General Electric ruled the roost in 2005, with market caps $375 billion and $362 billion, respectively. Now, just 20 years later, technology leaders top the charts. Not coincidentally, many of those companies are at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI).
Despite those advances, there are still only four companies valued at $3 trillion or more, and all are household names. Nvidia made its fortune as an AI chipmaker and currently leads the field at $4.3 trillion. Software and cloud titan Microsoft is close behind with a market cap of $3.8 trillion. iPhone maker Apple and search giant Alphabet round out the group, valued at $3.5 trillion and $3 trillion, respectively.
With a market cap of $1.9 trillion, it might seem a bit early to be putting forth Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) for membership in the $3 trillion club, yet in some ways it seems inevitable. Its recent performance and AI strategy have positioned the company for future success, as evidenced by its stock price gains of 537% (as of this writing) since the dawn of generative AI in early 2023 -- and this could be just the beginning, ensuring the social media kingpin's admittance into this exclusive fraternity.
A captive audience
Meta has more than 3 billion daily users, which provides the target market for the company's digital advertising. It has a long history of using machine learning to surface relevant content and ensure its targeted advertising meets its mark. Advances in generative AI have increased its advantage, with Meta having developed a collection of AI-powered tools for marketers to speed up and simplify the process.
There's no denying the results. In the second quarter, revenue climbed 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, fueling diluted earnings per share (EPS) that jumped 38% to $7.14. CEO Mark Zuckerberg pulled back the curtain, saying that AI is ""unlocking greater efficiency and gains across our ads system ... [driving] roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook.""
At the same time, its relentless user growth continued, as its family of social media platforms -- Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp -- increased its collective audience to 3.48 billion, up 6% year over year.
The company's ability to continually increase its user base and expand its advertising has fueled its continued success.
The path to $3 trillion
Meta has a market cap of roughly $1.93 trillion (as of this writing), so it will take a stock price increase of roughly 55% to lift its value to $3 trillion. Wall Street's estimates have the company generating revenue of $196 billion in 2025, giving the stock a forward price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of about 10. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Meta will need to generate revenue of roughly $305 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.
Furthermore, Wall Street is currently forecasting growth for Meta of nearly 15% annually over the coming five years. If the company can achieve that benchmark, it could surpass a $3 trillion market cap as early as 2029.
That seems conservative, since it has grown its trailing-12-month revenue by more than 1,000% over the past 10 years, and by 22% in the second quarter. This suggests it will make the grade even sooner.
Lastly, at 27 times earnings, Meta's valuation is similar to that of the S&P 500 -- yet it has increased by 729% over the past 10 years, well ahead of the S&P 500, which gained just 238%. That's why Meta Platforms stock is a buy."
finnhub,META,2025-09-15T22:45:02,Meta Platforms (META) Outperforms Broader Market: What You Need to Know,"In the closing of the recent trading day, Meta Platforms (META) stood at $764.7, denoting a +1.21% move from the preceding trading day.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4fbc2ae93e1f037f80b48bf842777f2812be1f674677ed8a70c26a9fc153a193,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-outperforms-broader-214502781.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-outperforms-broader-214502781.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-outperforms-broader-214502781.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Meta Platforms (META) closed the most recent trading day at $764.70, moving +1.21% from the previous trading session. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.47%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.94%.
The stock of social media company has fallen by 3.77% in the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.88% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.32%.
The upcoming earnings release of Meta Platforms will be of great interest to investors. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $6.74, signifying a 11.77% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $49.39 billion, up 21.68% from the year-ago period.
Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $28.13 per share and revenue of $195.91 billion, indicating changes of +17.9% and +19.1%, respectively, compared to the previous year.
It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.
Our research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.55% higher. Currently, Meta Platforms is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).
In terms of valuation, Meta Platforms is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.86. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 31.21.
It is also worth noting that META currently has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Internet - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.24 at yesterday's closing price.
The Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 71, which puts it in the top 29% of all 250+ industries."

Additionally, the announcement of a cash dividend and their recent joint venture with Reliance Industries for AI solutions signal continued growth and partnership strategies. Meta's expansion initiatives, including the launch of the Kansas City Data Center, underscore its operational scaling. While market trends, such as record highs in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, provided a positive backdrop, Meta's specific advancements added momentum to its share price movement.

Uncover the next big thing with financially sound penny stocks that balance risk and reward.
The recent collaboration between Meta Platforms and CrowdStrike for CyberSOCEval, along with the venture with Reliance Industries, could enhance Meta's capabilities in AI-driven cybersecurity and solutions, potentially leading to increased adoption of its platforms. These moves may bolster Meta's foundation in emerging technologies, aligning with its strategy to redefine digital commerce and advertising. Additionally, the launch of the Kansas City Data Center signals further operational scaling, likely supporting expanded data-driven initiatives.
Over the past three years, Meta's total shareholder return, including share price and dividends, was 413.27%, a substantial gain that contrasts with its underperformance relative to the US Interactive Media and Services industry over the past year. While Meta exceeded the broader US Market's annual return of 18.5%, it lagged behind the industry's 48.1% return.
The news regarding AI advancements and expansions could positively impact Meta's revenue and earnings forecasts. Analysts project revenue growth of 13% per year, supported by increased ad performance and diversification across platforms. However, high investment in AI and the metaverse presents potential risks to margins and cash flow. The current share price, at $755.59, remains below the consensus price target of $863.20, indicating a potential 11.3% upside if growth expectations align with analyst projections.

Meta launched ads in WhatsApp Status back in June, which enables advertisers to display their promotions between full-screen WhatsApp Status updates from friends.
Meta also offers Click-to-Message ads from Facebook and Instagram, which enable brands to initiate a direct chat with potential customers from their in-stream promotions.
And now, Meta’s also offering some advertisers the option to combine the two.
As per Meta:
“You can create ads that click to WhatsApp and use the WhatsApp Status placement. Ads in WhatsApp Status will only appear in the Updates tab, which is the home of Status and Channels and is separate from personal chats and calls. When people click on your ad, they’re sent directly into a chat with your business on WhatsApp.”
So it’s essentially the same as the above WhatsApp Status ads, but users will be able to click through to these promotions from Facebook or IG, which will give you a larger, full-screen presentation for your promotions, with a chat CTA.
That could be another way to drive engagement on WhatsApp, which is becoming a bigger home for discussion in more regions. Indeed, WhatsApp is now up to 100 million U.S. users, and with click-to-message ads driving better performance, and gaining popularity among brands, it could be another consideration for your broader Meta connection strategy.
Meta says that WhatsApp Status ads are not available in all regions as yet, so you may not have access. But for those that do, you’ll soon have more ways to gain attention, and drive response with your DM-aligned promotions."

Shares of video sharing platform Rumble (NASDAQGM:RUM) jumped 3.4% in the morning session after it gained attention as Vice President JD Vance announced he would be hosting ""The Charlie Kirk Show"" live on Rumble.
The announcement brings a high-profile political figure to the platform, which could attract more users and content creators. The news comes as the broader social media landscape experiences shifts, highlighted by a separate announcement from President Donald Trump about reaching a deal concerning TikTok. While that news, posted on Truth Social, impacted other social media stocks like Snap and Meta, Rumble benefited from the direct engagement of a prominent political figure on its own platform.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $7.53, up 3% from previous close.
Is now the time to buy Rumble? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Rumble’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 52 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 3% on the news that markets pulled back, reversing early gains, as investor sentiment remained cautious despite a softer-than-expected inflation reading. Stocks rose in the morning session after an unexpected drop in the Producer Price Index (PPI) for August signaled easing inflation and raised expectations for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the PPI, which measures wholesale prices, edged down 0.1% last month, contrary to analyst expectations for a 0.3% rise. This data gives the Federal Reserve more flexibility to consider lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.
Rumble is down 39.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $7.53 per share, it is trading 53.7% below its 52-week high of $16.27 from December 2024.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

PARIS (Reuters) -Canadian AI startup Cohere is expanding operations in Europe, intensifying competition with homegrown players like France's Mistral to supply AI services in the region.
Cohere, which was valued at $6.8 billion in its latest funding round, opened an office in Paris on Monday and is keen to take a bigger share of Europe's growing demand, said CEO Aidan Gomez.
The firm will join others lured to the French capital by French President Emmanuel Macron's push to create a European AI hub in the country, part of a bid to reinforce Europe's digital sovereignty.
""Previously, when we've looked at our global revenue, Europe had been slower to take off, but we're starting to see renewed momentum, in particular this year,"" Gomez told reporters.
Smaller AI firms are striving to rival U.S.-based giants such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta, which dominate the industry. Both Cohere and European AI champion Mistral are targeting business clients with an emphasis on data security and sovereignty.
Mistral, valued this month at $11.7 billion, declined to comment on Cohere's offering in Europe.
Founded in 2019, Cohere already counts major global companies such as South Korea's LG, Japan's Fujitsu and Oracle in the U.S. as partners, said Gomez.
He said recent political unrest in France was not a concern, and that he was ""super confident"" in the country's tech ecosystem.

Achieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.
Why This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist
Different than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.
Meta Platforms (META)
Meta Platforms is the world's largest social media platform. The company's portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram, and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta's family of products used by more than 3.48 billion people on a daily basis.
META sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Growth Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of B. Earnings and sales are forecasted to increase 17.9% and 19.1% year-over-year, respectively.
18 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $2.72 to $28.13 per share for 2025. META boasts an average earnings surprise of 20.5%.
Looking at cash flow, Meta Platforms is expected to report cash flow growth of 54.9% this year; META has generated cash flow growth of 26.3% over the past three to five years.
With solid fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, META should be on investors' short lists.

According to Bessent, President Trump and Chinese President Xi are scheduled to speak Friday to complete the TikTok deal. The Treasury Secretary also mentioned that a ""wide range of issues with China"" were discussed during the trade meeting, including cooperation on money laundering.
Bessent also addressed the ""poor timing"" of an investigation into NVIDIA, though specific details about this discussion were not provided.

Multi-location restaurants can analyze delivery reviews at scale, transforming customer feedback into competitive advantage
SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESS Newswire / September 15, 2025 / Chatmeter, the multi-location customer intelligence platform, today announced new integrations with delivery apps Uber Eats, DoorDash and GrubHub that enable restaurants to analyze and respond to delivery reviews in Chatmeter.
Recent Chatmeter research revealed a gap in the quality of delivery service that directly impacts brand reputation and customer retention. More than half of consumers said they experienced a late delivery and cold food when ordering, while 44% had items missing from their orders. These service failures represent significant reputation risks for multi-location businesses relying on third-party delivery partners to execute on their brand promise.
Delivery reviews previously existed in siloes, disconnected from broader reputation strategies. Now, brands can analyze and respond to reviews within Chatmeter, alongside reviews from other platforms, like Google, Yelp, Facebook, TripAdvisor and Apple Maps.
""Restaurants now have unprecedented visibility into their customer experience across dine-in, takeout and delivery,"" said John Mazur, CEO of Chatmeter. ""The delivery economy has fundamentally changed how consumers experience restaurant brands, but most businesses are flying blind when it comes to understanding these interactions. AI-powered deep listening has never been more critical to nurturing loyalty and gaining insights that improve the customer experience.""
Delivery app feedback will now be available in Pulse Ai, Chatmeter's AI-powered reputation management platform. Within Pulse Ai, brands can analyze millions of unstructured data points to gain actionable insights, receive AI-powered alerts related to food safety issues and other reputational risks before they go viral, go beyond star ratings to better understand customer sentiment and obtain competitive intelligence to win in local markets.

Without clear benchmarks, it’s difficult to know which systems, use cases, and performance standards deliver a true AI advantage against real-world attacks.
Meta and CrowdStrike are addressing this challenge by introducing CyberSOCEval, a suite of benchmarks that help define what effective AI looks like for cyber defense. Built on Meta’s open source CyberSecEval framework and CrowdStrike’s frontline threat intelligence, CyberSOCEval evaluates LLMs across critical security workflows such as incident response, malware analysis, and threat analysis comprehension. By testing AI systems’ ability against a combination of real-world adversary tradecraft and expert-designed security reasoning scenarios based on observed adversarial tactics, organizations can validate performance under pressure and prove operational readiness. With these benchmarks, security teams can pinpoint where AI delivers maximum value, while model developers gain a North Star for improving capabilities that enhance ROI and SOC effectiveness.
""At Meta, we’re committed to advancing and maximizing the benefits of open source AI – especially as large language models become powerful tools for organizations of all sizes,"" said Vincent Gonguet, Director of Product, GenAI at Superintelligence Labs at Meta. ""Our collaboration with CrowdStrike introduces a new open source benchmark suite to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in real world security scenarios. With these benchmarks in place, and open for the security and AI community to further improve, we can more quickly work as an industry to unlock the potential of AI in protecting against advanced attacks, including AI-based threats."""

(OKLO) has been one of the hottest names in the nuclear energy space, with shares soaring nearly 19% after unveiling a $1.68 billion private nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, TN. The project — announced on Sept. 4 and expected to create 800 jobs as the first-of-its-kind commercial recycling site in the United States — ties directly into America’s growing demand for secure fuel supply amid the energy-hungry rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The gains on the back of this Tennessee announcement have also taken Oklo’s one-year stock surge to more than 1200%.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
A lot of the buzz around Oklo comes from its unique position at the meeting point of clean energy and AI. The data centers that power AI technology require huge amounts of reliable electricity. Oklo's advanced, small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are being promoted as a perfect solution to this massive energy need.
Nuclear energy stocks more broadly are heating up, and for a good reason. This year, President Donald Trump has put nuclear power firmly in the spotlight, while countries worldwide have pledged to triple nuclear capacity by 2050. Yet, even against this supportive backdrop, investors need to step back and assess whether Oklo’s fundamentals truly justify the hype.
OKLO’s Lofty Pipeline and High Hopes
Oklo’s story is built around scale and ambition. The company touts a 14 GW pipeline that could translate into nearly $5 billion in annual revenues by 2028. Its Aurora microreactors, designed to run on recycled fuel, target data centers, military bases and industrial hubs. Instead of selling reactors, Oklo aims to own and operate them, securing revenues through long-term power purchase agreements. Partnerships with names like Liberty Energy, Vertiv and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power enhance its credibility. On paper, this integrated model looks promising and gives the company a strategic angle that competitors lack.
Reality Check: OKLO Years Away From Cash Flow
Despite the big headlines, Oklo is still a pre-revenue company. Its first commercial reactor isn’t expected online until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest, and the Tennessee recycling facility won’t begin operations until the early 2030s. Meanwhile, the annual cash burn is estimated between $65 million and $80 million, a figure that will demand ongoing capital raises. Regulatory challenges are another concern. Oklo’s initial application was rejected by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2022, and even if resubmitted in late 2025, reviews could stretch two to three years. Such delays could easily push commercial revenues further out, leaving investors holding a highly speculative bet. The long timeline also exposes shareholders to greater volatility, especially if market enthusiasm for nuclear cools."

Just in the last month, the stock slipped 3.8%, following a modest 0.4% gain over the past week. Year to date, Meta is still flexing with a healthy 26.1% rise, rewarding those who stayed the course through volatility.
What's driving these moves? Recent headlines have combined to keep traders on their toes. Meta's multi-million dollar AI deals and high-profile hires are fueling long-term growth stories, though competition is heating up as Amazon enters the AR glasses arena. Legal wins in Europe have put a little wind at Meta's back, but the broader market is also digesting regulatory twists, like the latest TikTok ban headline, which always seem to ripple through big tech valuations.
Given all that action, is Meta undervalued at its current price of $755.59? According to our valuation scorecard, Meta clears the bar in 4 out of 6 checks, which is good but not perfect. Of course, how you measure value can make all the difference. Up next, we will break down Meta's valuation through several key approaches. And stick around, because before we're finished, I'll show you an even smarter way to read these numbers.
Why Meta Platforms is lagging behind its peers
Approach 1: Meta Platforms Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a widely used valuation method that estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. For Meta Platforms, the DCF approach considers the expected Free Cash Flow (FCF) that Meta can generate over time and adjusts for the time value of money.
Currently, Meta has a trailing twelve-month Free Cash Flow of about $57.6 billion. Analysts predict that Meta's FCF will rise significantly, with forecasts reaching $107.9 billion by the end of 2029. While direct analyst estimates generally cover up to five years, further projections through 2035 are extrapolated to map out potential long-term growth.
Based on these cash flow projections and using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the intrinsic value of Meta is calculated at $1,074.03 per share. This figure suggests the stock is trading at roughly a 29.6% discount to its DCF-based fair value, as the current share price is $755.59. In other words, Meta appears to be undervalued according to this model."

you heard uh Inez talk a little bit how the Mag 7 reacted after uh prior rate cuts. Uh, what, you know, what is your thinking on this key space? You know, we get that one rate cut, get a couple more. Historically, these stocks have done pretty darn well uh after rate cuts.
Yeah, I I I think that they've not only done well over rate cuts, they also have done well over the last couple of years and they've really been the only source of positive earnings revisions, you know, ever since the Fed started to hike in 2022. But if you're looking at a change in potential leadership, I would look outside of the Mag 7 uh because, you know, the a lower interest rate environment should allow kind of more cyclical parts of the economy, things like housing that we talked about or manufacturing to start to grow again, to start to demonstrate some positive earnings revision. That's a catalyst in my mind that's been absent in markets last couple of years. And if you're looking just at at a valuation differential between those areas of the market and the Mag 7, that is is quite wide. Uh and so there's a potential there I think for a catch-up trade outside of just continued strength from the Mag 7 potentially, but also uh maybe uh maybe some other opportunities that investors really haven't favored the last couple of years.
You mentioned small cast. Small cast have been rallying. What's the what's the case for for that? You know, I would just counter, we've seen a weakening labor market, inflation is still high, a lot of these smaller businesses in the US, in some respects are really struggling.
They are and and it really has been a, um, a result of, you know, the Fed hiking rates in 2022 aggressively, but now we're on the other side of that. And what we've seen, especially if you, if you look at kind of prior periods of history when we start to see an easing in policy, um, you know, the smaller companies tend to borrow at at at a prime rate or a variable rate, and when the cost of financing comes down, they are in a unique position to benefit because they were the ones that have been hurt by it. Um, the Mac 7 hasn't been hurt by this. And so, you know, while they're not going to have any difference in terms of their operating environment, the small businesses are. Uh and so we would just look to that as more of a unique callyst for that specific part of the market even though it struggled the last couple of years."

NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK / ACCESS Newswire / September 15, 2025 / Disney ranks as the No. 1 most intimate brand according to MBLM's 2025 Brand Intimacy Study, a comprehensive ranking of brands based on emotions. Netflix and Apple rank second and third, respectively, in the overall study. Brand Intimacy is the emotional science behind the bonds that consumers form with the brands they use and love.
The largest analysis of brands based on emotion, the 2025 Brand Intimacy Study is an AI-powered evaluation of 475 brands across 22 industries and 25 brand families. Built on paradigms established by Nobel Prize-winning scientists, the study reflects more than 15 years of research combining qualitative multicountry studies and quantitative consumer studies. This comprehensive analysis examines more than 4.38 billion words across the social internet and platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Quora and X (formerly Twitter).
Over the past 15 years, top-ranking intimate brands have consistently demonstrated superior financial performance. Comparing the top 25 intimate brands with the Fortune 500 and Standard & Poor's indices over the past year reveals that intimate brands collectively achieved annual profit growth 18% higher than Fortune 500 brands and 13% higher than S&P brands. In dollar amounts, intimate brands generated $252 billion more in revenue than Fortune 500 brands and $222 billion more than S&P brands, underscoring that the stronger the emotional bonds between a brand and its consumers, the more its business outperforms.
""The world of information, and of marketing specifically, is being shaped by social consensus and algorithms in an environment of volatile politics and post-pandemic change,"" said Mario Natarelli, Managing Partner at MBLM. ""Today, the vast majority of consumers are guided and influenced by social conversations, even when not actively participating in them. Younger generations, in particular, increasingly base purchase decisions on what they see and sense online. For brands, this means love is harder than ever to earn and easier to lose, and collective intelligence now shapes brand reality. Brand Intimacy is a research-backed approach to understanding and leveraging emotion in the context of this evolving environment.""
Additional notable findings include:
Netflix continues its steady rise from 8th to 2nd in this year's ranking, signaling maturation and dominance of the brand and of major streamers in general."

Five years ago, Oracle's market cap was under $200 billion. Now, there's reason to believe it can surpass $2 trillion by 2030.
If that prediction comes true, Oracle could be well on its way to joining Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%), Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), and Meta Platforms in the $2 trillion club. Broadcom and Meta Platforms are currently under $2 trillion but would surpass the threshold with gains of 16% or less.
The ""Ten Titans"" -- which are these companies plus Tesla and Netflix -- now make up a staggering 39% of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) and have proven to be a formidable group of market-moving stocks.
Here's why Oracle deserves to be in the conversation of market-leading growth stocks and why the company could more than double from here in less than five years.
Oracle's offering is ideally suited for existing database and enterprise services customers
In its first quarter fiscal 2026 earnings release from Sept. 9, Oracle projected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue to grow from $18 billion in its current fiscal year to $144 billion by fiscal 2030. Oracle also provided revenue guidance by fiscal year for the next four years.
To understand the gravity of Oracle's projections, consider that, in 2024, Google Cloud generated $33.1 billion in revenue, Microsoft's entire Intelligent Cloud segment notched $105.4 billion in revenue, and Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world by market share, generated $108 billion in revenue.
Of course, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are all projecting solid cloud growth. But Oracle's forecast suggests that OCI, in terms of cloud infrastructure revenue, will be bigger than the current size of AWS in less than four years, which is probably the single most aggressive prediction any tech company has made this year.
As you can see in the graph, OCI is projected to reach an inflection point in fiscal 2027 as data centers come online to fulfill Oracle's massive order backlog. In its latest earnings release, Oracle announced plans to deliver an additional 37 multi-cloud data centers to its three major hyperscaler partners -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- to bring its total to 71. In June, Oracle said that it had 23 multi-cloud data centers with 47 more being built in the next 12 months -- meaning it added 10 in the latest quarter. But these are just its multi-cloud data centers. Oracle is also building standalone data centers designed strictly for running OCI services, such as AI workloads and its Exadata Database service, which is optimized using specific infrastructure.
Next-generation data centers
Oracle is in an enviable position because it offers customers competitively priced bundles that combine cloud services with other offerings, and because it is expanding its business through partnerships with multiple cloud providers. A big part of this pricing advantage comes from the way Oracle's data centers are built. According to Oracle, ""OCI bare metal instances, not available from other cloud providers, coupled with microsecond-latency RDMA [Remote Direct Memory Access] cluster networking provide 50% better price-performance and 3.5X time savings for HPC [high performance computing] workloads compared with previous-generation compute."" RDMA is an Oracle network fabric that reduces latency.
In sum, Oracle's data centers are brand-new and hyper-efficient, allowing it to achieve better performance and offer attractive pricing to gain market share. In some ways, Oracle is like the Broadcom of the data center world. Broadcom is winning a lot of business from hyperscalers thanks to its XPU custom AI chips, which are advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that can be an effective alternative to graphics processing units in some (but not all) applications. Just as Broadcom is essentially working with Nvidia in the data center, so too is Oracle working with the established cloud giants -- forming a partly competitive, partly symbiotic relationship. It's a peculiar dynamic, but one where Oracle and Broadcom have a compelling advantage.
Oracle's road to $2 trillion is defined, but the path is riddled with uncertainty
If Oracle comes close to its fiscal 2030 OCI revenue target, it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock at least double from here. Based on Amazon's market cap of $2.46 trillion, you could argue that AWS is worth about $1.5 trillion on its own. With that logic, OCI alone could be worth $2 trillion if it eclipses AWS's current size in five years. So it's not unreasonable to expect Oracle to surpass $2 trillion in market cap by 2030 -- again if it delivers on expectations. And that's a big if.
Oracle is spending heavily to build out its infrastructure, so it's best not to look too deeply into its earnings. However, once its infrastructure is more established, Oracle could pull back on spending, which will boost its margins and allow the company to transition back to high-margin free cash flow.
Oracle stock is worth buying and holding if you believe its disruption of the cloud computing industry is built to last. But the stock's valuation is heavily dependent on its ability to fulfill and profit from its order backlog. So some investors may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach to the Ten Titans stock right now."

Not all companies are created equal, and StockStory is here to surface the ones with real upside. That said, here is one cash-producing company that reinvests wisely to drive long-term success and two that may struggle to keep up.
Two Stocks to Sell:
Asana (ASAN)
Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 5.2%
Born from the founders' frustration with the inefficiencies of email-based collaboration at Facebook, Asana (NYSE:ASAN) provides a work management platform that helps organizations track projects, set goals, and manage workflows in a centralized digital workspace.
Why Do We Think Twice About ASAN?
-
Average billings growth of 9.6% over the last year was subpar, suggesting it struggled to push its software and might have to lower prices to stimulate demand
-
Platform has low switching costs as its net revenue retention rate of 95.7% demonstrates high turnover
-
Software platform has intricate integration requirements for its enterprise clients, triggering long sales cycles that limit new customer additions
At $13.30 per share, Asana trades at 3.8x forward price-to-sales. To fully understand why you should be careful with ASAN, check out our full research report (it’s free).
SunOpta (STKL)
Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 5%
Committed to clean-label foods, SunOpta (NASDAQ:STKL) is a sustainability-focused food and beverage company specializing in the sourcing, processing, and packaging of organic products.
Why Is STKL Not Exciting?
-
Annual revenue declines of 4.9% over the last three years indicate problems with its market positioning
-
Subscale operations are evident in its revenue base of $763.2 million, meaning it has fewer distribution channels than its larger rivals
-
Gross margin of 15.6% is an output of its commoditized products
SunOpta is trading at $6.26 per share, or 25.9x forward P/E. If you’re considering STKL for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.
One Stock to Buy:
UnitedHealth (UNH)
Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: 6%
With over 100 million people served across its various businesses and a workforce of more than 400,000, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) operates a health insurance business and Optum, a healthcare services division that provides everything from pharmacy benefits to primary care.
Why Are We Backing UNH?
-
Enormous revenue base of $422.8 billion gives it leverage over plan holders and advantageous reimbursement terms with healthcare providers
-
Estimated revenue growth of 8.4% for the next 12 months implies its momentum over the last two years will continue
-
Stellar returns on capital showcase management’s ability to surface highly profitable business ventures"

finnhub,META,2025-09-14T10:22:00,"Broadcom and Oracle's Blowout Earnings Just Proved Why It's Time to Forget the ""Magnificent Seven""","Without Broadcom and Oracle, the ""Magnificent Seven"" is no longer a good representation of the market's leading growth stocks.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a07dec5d012ee0ad63fcf5247aa58487c57f1aaef742edb2926ef688975e052c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/broadcom-oracle-ten-titans-magnificent-seven/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/broadcom-oracle-ten-titans-magnificent-seven/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/broadcom-oracle-ten-titans-magnificent-seven/,fool.com,200,,"Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) and Oracle (ORCL 1.45%) just delivered exceptional earnings reports and guidance that sent both tech stocks to all-time highs. Over the last five years, Broadcom is up over 925% and Oracle is up over 475% -- outperforming every ""Magnificent Seven"" stock (Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla) except one -- Nvidia.
The ""Ten Titans"" provide an update to the Magnificent Seven by adding Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix to the list. Combined, these three companies have nearly the same market cap as Apple, and are gaining increasing influence in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%). In fact, the Ten Titans now make up 39.1% of the index compared to 33.7% for the Magnificent Seven.
Beyond the market cap influence of these names, Broadcom and Oracle embody groundbreaking advancements in cloud computing, infrastructure software, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Here's why Broadcom and Oracle have become such dominant companies, and whether either growth stock is a buy now.
Broadcom is a balanced way to invest in AI
Broadcom and Oracle's surging stock prices illustrate how AI is redefining previously stagnant investment theses. Just a few years ago, both companies were often viewed as dividend-paying stalwarts.
Broadcom was known for its established semiconductor business, providing the nuts and bolts behind networking, broadband, wireless, cybersecurity, and more. But the company is completely different today due to its acquisition of VMware in late 2023 and the development and adoption of its AI chips.
Cloud computing giants are lining up to buy Broadcom's AI chips, known as XPUs. XPUs are highly advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are tailored to a specialized function and are especially good at handling increasing AI workloads. Broadcom doesn't just design the chips, it also makes associated networking products, like Tomahawk switches that link chips within a server rack, and Jericho Ethernet fabric routers, which enable the connection of over 1 million XPU clusters across multiple data centers.
Broadcom is unique because it is far bigger than just an AI play. Rather, it is a highly diversified company that benefits from the buildout of AI infrastructure, AI software, and the growth of high-speed connectivity.
Oracle is heavily disrupting incumbent cloud giants
Oracle's latest quarter perfectly represents why Broadcom has become a behemoth that is closing in on $1 trillion in market cap. On Sept. 9, Oracle said that its cloud infrastructure segment is expected to grow 77% in fiscal 2026, 78% in fiscal 2027, 128% in fiscal 2028, and 97% in fiscal 2029 to become a $144 billion business. If Oracle comes remotely close to these estimates, its cloud business will become far larger than its legacy database services segment.
Like Broadcom, Oracle was once an entrenched business-to-business giant in tech, known for its stodgy growth and reliable dividend. But Oracle is now a completely different company. Its strength comes from its competitive pricing model, which makes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) a great add-on for customers that use its database services.
Oracle is an enterprise-facing company. Whereas investors in the ""big three"" cloud players, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are getting a lot of moving parts that have nothing to do with cloud computing. In this vein, Oracle has become one of the best ways to invest in high-octane cloud growth, somewhat similar to how investors are drawn to Nvidia. Nvidia has become a pure-play AI stock because its data center business is now magnitudes larger than its gaming and professional visualization markets.
Broadcom and Oracle's stock prices are running up far faster than they are growing earnings because investors are buying these stocks for where they could be years from now rather than where they are today. Forward earnings estimates will probably increase as analysts adjust their targets based on recent results and guidance. But for now, Broadcom's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a staggering 54.8 compared to 48.2 for Oracle. For context, Nvidia's forward P/E is 39.5 -- meaning investors are even more excited about Broadcom and Oracle's growth.
Broadcom and Oracle are moving markets
The breakneck growth rates and size of Broadcom and Oracle prove why it's time to forget the Magnificent Seven and use the Ten Titans as a better descriptor for market-moving growth stocks. Even folks who don't own the Ten Titans outright may be indirectly impacted through their holdings in index funds and exchange-traded funds.
In addition to their foundational role in the major indexes, the Ten Titans will likely make or break broader market sentiment. If the S&P 500 keeps making new highs, it's probably because of the Ten Titans. If it undergoes a major sell-off, it's probably because a few key Titans fell. You may have even seen headlines about how the S&P 500 is expensive relative to its historical valuation. That's because many of the Ten Titans are valued more for their future earnings than their current profits. So investors should only approach these stocks if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term time horizon, and believe these companies can deliver on highly optimistic expectations.
It's also worth noting the correlation that these companies can have. For example, Oracle's blowout quarter sent Broadcom and Nvidia soaring on Sept. 10 because Oracle is a major customer of these chip makers. Increased AI spending to build out OCI benefits Broadcom and Nvidia. Although Oracle may account for less than 2% of the S&P 500, its results had a significantly larger impact on the S&P 500 than the movement in its stock price alone."

- A Federal Reserve interest rate decision comes Wednesday, followed by remarks from Chair Jerome Powell.
- Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a keynote at the company's annual Meta Connect event.
- U.S. retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims lead the week’s economic releases.
- FedEx, General Mills, and Bullish are among the companies scheduled to report earnings.
The Fed is on the clock.
A highly anticipated interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve takes the spotlight this week; both that decision, set for Wednesday, and subsequent remarks from Chair Jerome Powell, could move markets as he lays out the central bank’s views on the economy and more.
Investors have bid up stocks ahead of the Fed meeting. The major U.S. indexes logged gains last week even after a mixed Friday finish.
U.S. retail sales data will offer insight into the state of consumer spending, as will earnings reports from cereal maker General Mills and Darden Restaurants. Shipping giant FedEx’s earnings will offer a view of overall economic conditions. And tech investors will be watching Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who on Wednesday is set to take the stage at the social media giant's annual developers' conference.
Federal Reserve Expected to Make First Rate Cut This Year
Investors expect the Fed to lower interest rates for the first time this year on Wednesday. The rate decision comes as recent job reports signaled a weakening labor market, but inflation remains elevated. Following the decision, investors will be scrutinizing remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as he details the central bank’s views on monetary policy.
U.S retail sales data for August, due Tuesday, comes amid signs that tariffs haven’t significantly weighed on consumer spending.
Data on August housing starts is scheduled for release on Wednesday. Builders have been struggling to fill a massive U.S. housing shortfall as high construction and borrowing costs continue to weigh on the market. Investors will also be watching jobless claims on Thursday after recent reports have shown job growth slowing and layoffs increasing.
Meta Conference, FedEx Earnings in the Corporate Spotlight
On Wednesday evening, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will kick off the company’s annual Meta Connect conference, where the Facebook parent is expected to focus attention on product offerings like its AI glasses. The social media giant is devoting significant resources to AI, including big paydays for top talent.
FedEx is set to report earnings after markets close on Thursday. The shipping giant suspended its full-year outlook last quarter amid uncertainty around U.S. tariffs. Earnings reports from cereal maker General Mills on Wednesday and Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants on Thursday could shed more light on how consumers are faring.
Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish is scheduled to post its first earnings report as a public company on Wednesday, a month after making its trading debut.

Did you come up with a new acronym? I see aren't you out there pushing a new uh acronym on social media? What what is this all about?
I did. I tried my best yesterday and I came up with Gamaton, which uh, you know, sort of sort of gets uh gets the Mag 7 plus. It actually was meant to include Broadcom, truthfully. I forgot the B and and actually Broadcom you could either do an A or a B. so I may have to make it gamma with an extra A, but um basically that would be my that would be my next thought here is uh because you know, I think
we're we're definitely broadening out our focus and I and I think from hearing the the uh the you know, the speakers you heard, they were all tech heavy people. So I do want to hear a little bit more from end users, uh because, you know, the the the crowd strike user was very the crowd strike person was was was very clear about how AI could be used, but it's still not clear that it's all filtering down, let's say to, you know, ordinary companies. And and it took the internet a long time for that to happen.
Um, but so in the meantime, I think Oracle has to be at least included among the big boys. And again, I I I regret that I did not find a place for Broadcom because I've actually been advocating it for uh a great eight or a Mag 7 plus for some time."

This massive wave of investment is creating long-term opportunities for businesses that can scale with these digital shifts. Companies with robust competitive advantages and proven business models are positioned to benefit most from this trend.
As this trend accelerates, here's why these two growth stocks can prove to be exceptional buy-and-hold picks for the next decade.
Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) remains a leading player in the social media and digital advertising landscape, and it's now accelerating its investment in AI infrastructure to drive the next phase of growth.
Meta's core business is a cash-generating machine that can fund future growth opportunities. In the second quarter of 2025 (ending June 30), revenues rose 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, with an operating margin of 43% and free cash flow of $8.5 billion.
It is indisputable that digital advertising remains the primary driver of growth. Meta is leveraging advanced AI technologies to enhance ad targeting and recommendations as well as user engagement across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, strengthening its digital advertising business.
The company serves over 3.4 billion daily active users and uses AI models, including Andromeda, GEM, and Lattice, to enhance ad conversions and pricing across its applications, resulting in stronger monetization.
Its push beyond its core apps into newer platforms may also begin to generate fresh advertising growth. Threads has already surpassed 350 million users, and ads are starting to appear across its feed. Advertisements are also being introduced in the status and channels features of WhatsApp. Business messaging is scaling, with U.S. click-to-message revenue up more than 40% year over year in the second quarter.
Meta is also rolling out subscriptions for WhatsApp channels -- a feature that can help businesses connect with over 1.5 billion daily active users who visit the channels. Meta AI, a consumer-facing AI-powered assistant integrated into its app ecosystem, has already built a user base of over 1 billion monthly active users. Besides improving user engagement through personalized recommendations and enhanced content discovery, it can also become a new monetization avenue in the coming quarters.
The tech giant is aggressively investing to expand its AI infrastructure. Meta expects capital expenditures of $66 billion to $72 billion in 2025, with even higher figures in 2026 as it builds AI data centers to support advanced AI models. While this may affect margins and cash flows in the near term, the long-term payoff of leveraging in-house AI capabilities to strengthen the core business may be exceptionally impressive.
Meta's shares trade at a rich valuation of nearly 28.5 times forward earnings. While the company's growth to date has been awe-inspiring, this may be just the beginning of an AI-powered multiyear growth story. Hence, considering Meta's scale, cash generation potential, and AI investments, the stock remains an attractive choice for the next decade.
Amazon
E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) is also doubling down on cloud computing, advertising, and AI to fuel its next chapter of growth.
The company's core business is strong, and it clearly has enough financial flexibility to fund future growth opportunities: Amazon's revenue increased 13.3% year over year to $167.7 billion while operating income soared 31% year over year to $19.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending June 30). The company also reported trailing-12-month free cash flow of $18.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing business, accounted for 30% of the global cloud infrastructure services market in the second quarter of 2025, up from 29% in the prior quarter. With 85% to 90% of global IT spend focused on the on-premises environment and enterprises increasingly shifting workloads to the cloud, there is huge scope for AWS to grow in the coming years.
AWS revenue grew 17.5% year over year to $30.9 billion in the second quarter. The business has now reached an annualized run rate of $123 billion.
AWS had a backlog worth $195 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting strong demand for Amazon's infrastructure and AI services. AWS is giving customers the use of Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics processing units as well as its own custom chip, Trainium2, to ensure better performance and lower costs to clients running AI workloads.
Additionally, Amazon Bedrock (a fully managed service enabling clients to build and scale generative AI applications on AWS) is adding several leading large language models like Anthropic's Claude and the company's own model, Nova.
Amazon's e-commerce business is also speeding up, especially as the company leverages automation and robotics to improve cost efficiencies, which could boost margins. Faster delivery is becoming a significant competitive advantage in the e-commerce market. In the second quarter, the company delivered 30% more items on the same day or the next day in the U.S. than it had in the same period last year. The company is planning to expand this same-day and next-day delivery to over 4,000 smaller U.S. towns by the end of 2025.
Finally, advertising is fast becoming a major growth catalyst. Amazon's advertising revenues grew 22% in the second quarter of 2025 to $15.7 billion. With proprietary shopping, browsing, and streaming data secured from its platforms, advertisers can optimize their efforts, leading to improved outcomes. Advertising is proving ever more effective on platforms such as its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Fire TV, Twitch, and live sports.
Despite the many tailwinds, Amazon's shares trade at 34.6 times forward earnings, which is not cheap. But considering AWS's growth, fueled by rising AI adoption and improving e-commerce and advertising businesses, the stock may be attractive to investors seeking long-term growth opportunities."
finnhub,META,2025-09-13T11:43:00,"Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Just Delivered Half a Trillion Dollars Worth of Great News for Nvidia Investors",Big tech is expected to spend nearly $500 billion on artificial intelligence infrastructure next year.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f2666ffb57dd65b87aa7a63a2789df6c0e97524aefcc9f863f86865bf6c75c9f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/amazon-microsoft-alphabet-and-meta-just-delivered/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/amazon-microsoft-alphabet-and-meta-just-delivered/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/amazon-microsoft-alphabet-and-meta-just-delivered/,fool.com,200,,"Over the past few years, many corporate budgets have been reoriented toward artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Nowhere is this shift more evident than among the cloud hyperscalers -- Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon -- as well as other tech titans like Meta Platforms and Oracle.
In just this year alone, Meta committed $14.3 billion to Scale AI and launched a new research hub, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). It also signed a six-year, $10 billion agreement with Google Cloud. Meanwhile, Microsoft just struck a $17.4 billion deal with Nebius, a rising neocloud specialist.
At the center of this unprecedented wave of AI infrastructure spending stands one clear beneficiary: Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). Whether directly or indirectly, the graphics processing unit (GPU) powerhouse is capturing a significant chunk of the money being spent on AI infrastructure.
Let's explore how big tech is reshaping the AI landscape -- and why these secular tailwinds point to further significant upside for Nvidia.
AI infrastructure spending has accelerated since the launch of ChatGPT
The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 ignited an unprecedented AI arms race among the world's largest companies. What's important to recognize is that their capital expenditures in this battle are not plateauing -- they're accelerating.
Data from Goldman Sachs underscores just how dramatic these dynamics have become. In 2021, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft collectively had capex of about $100 billion. By next year, Wall Street expects that figure to approach nearly $500 billion.
What does this mean for Nvidia?
Training and deploying large language models (LLMs) and building generative AI applications demands extraordinary amounts of computing power. GPUs are parallel processors, which makes them some of the best chips available to provide the type of computing power AI workloads require. Today, Nvidia commands a more than 90% share of the GPU market, giving it a dominant position within the AI supply chain.
A significant portion of the AI capex surge is flowing directly into GPUs and the supporting data center equipment necessary to maximize their performance.
This dynamic places Nvidia in a uniquely enviable position as the backbone of modern AI development -- and it's poised to capture incremental budget allocations as hyperscalers and other data center operators race to secure its next-generation chips the moment they become available.
Is Nvidia stock a buy?
The magnitude of hyperscaler infrastructure investment reflects more than the world's apparently insatiable appetite for AI computing power. It underscores a deeper reality: AI is becoming the central growth engine for these companies, and securing access to the most advanced chips has shifted from being a matter of technological advantage to being a matter of competitive survival.
The accelerating pace of this spending suggests that corporations are still in the early stages of implementing their AI playbooks. Far from being a speculative bubble, this wave of infrastructure investment is the result of deliberate, long-term strategic planning by some of the world's most influential companies as they pivot away from their traditional priorities and take on sophisticated projects in robotics, autonomous systems, cybersecurity, and more.
For Nvidia, this dynamic should translate into sustained pricing power for its wares, durable recurring demand, and a multiyear runway for rapid growth. Its GPUs and CUDA software platform have become the gold standard for enterprise AI tech stacks.
Taken together, these tailwinds suggest that Nvidia could experience meaningful valuation expansion from here. As the infrastructure chapter of the AI narrative continues to unfold, Nvidia appears well positioned to remain as a core enabler of big tech's transformation.
For these reasons, I see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer investment, and view it as one of the most compelling buy-and-hold opportunities in the market."
finnhub,META,2025-09-13T09:10:00,5 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in September,The opportunity in AI remains massive.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b33cdf59c9ff577771a3f14b88e438244230649c567ec6e129d3178082c7254e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-september/,fool.com,200,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind the stock market's biggest winners in recent years, and that trend looks far from finished. The opportunity ahead is still massive, so this is an area that most investors will want some exposure to.
Here are five top AI stocks to buy as September rolls on.
1. Nvidia
No company has benefited more from the buildout of AI infrastructure than Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). Its graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the gold standard for powering the training of large language models (LLMs), and its popular CUDA software platform helped give it a moat that competitors have yet to crack. Meanwhile, its networking revenue is also soaring, with demand for its NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X products leading to a 98% year-over-year surge in Q2 data center networking revenue to $7.3 billion.
While its Blackwell chips are already the leading hardware for providing processing power for training, Nvidia said that those GPUs also set the standard for inference, which could eventually become a much bigger market than training. With AI infrastructure projected to be a multitrillion-dollar market in the coming years, Nvidia has more than enough room to keep growing.
The stock has had a massive run, but the momentum behind AI spending means Nvidia remains a top pick for long-term investors.
2. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) has emerged as the go-to name for custom AI chips, which are becoming critical as hyperscalers (operators of massive data centers) look to lower their inference costs and reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Broadcom already counts Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%), Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), and ByteDance among its customers, and management projects that these relationships alone could be worth $60 billion to $90 billion by its fiscal 2027 (which ends October 2027).
However, things got even better for shareholders after Broadcom revealed that a fourth customer, presumably OpenAI, had placed a massive $10 billion order for next year. The pace at which Broadcom is able to design custom AI chips appears to be accelerating, which bodes well for its growth, especially with Apple having been earlier revealed as a fifth major customer.
Throw in Broadcom's strong networking business and its VMware arm, which positions it as a software player in AI infrastructure, and this is a company with a lot of growth potential. Investors looking for diversified AI winners beyond Nvidia should have this stock near the top of their lists.
3. Advanced Micro Devices
The next battleground in the AI chip wars looks like it will be for inference. While Nvidia and Broadcom are both well positioned for this fight, don't count Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%) out. AMD has already been carving out a role in this space. Seven of the 10 biggest AI operators already use its GPUs, with one major AI company running a significant amount of inference on AMD chips.
AMD, along with Broadcom and others, also helped form the UALink Consortium to create an open-source interconnect standard. This could loosen the grip that Nvidia has established on that score with its NVLink offering, and allow companies to more easily mix and match AI chips from different vendors. That would be hugely beneficial for AMD.
On top of that, AMD's central processing units (CPUs) continue to gain traction in data centers. The revenue gap between Nvidia and AMD is still massive, which is why even modest market share gains in the GPU segment could drive AMD's numbers significantly higher. That opportunity makes the stock a compelling buy.
4. Alphabet
Alphabet just dodged what could have been a big problem when the judge in its antitrust case opted not to require it to sell its Chrome browser. That preserved one of the company's most important advantages in search: distribution. That foundation, with Chrome and Android, gives Google an advantage that will be difficult for AI upstarts to overcome.
The company is now layering AI on top of search. Its AI Overviews are already being used by more than 2 billion people each month, and it's rolling out AI Mode around the world in different languages. Meanwhile, its Gemini large-language models are among the best in the industry, and giving users the option to toggle between AI Mode and traditional search inside Google is another edge. Importantly, Alphabet knows how to monetize users, whether through traditional search or AI.
Beyond search, Google Cloud has been a powerful growth engine for Alphabet as companies rush to cloud computing providers to help build out their own AI models and apps and run them on cloud infrastructure. Meanwhile, its custom chips -- made with the help of Broadcom -- have given it a cost advantage. Add in other bets like its Waymo robotaxi business and its quantum computing efforts, and Alphabet is well-positioned for the future.
5. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms has reinvented itself with AI, turning what many thought was a fading social media company into one of the best growth stories out there. Its Llama models are improving user experiences by serving up more engaging content, while advertisers get access to better targeting and ad campaign tools. That combination led to a 22% year-over-year jump in ad revenue last quarter, with both impressions and ad prices moving higher. Meta is also just starting to run ads on WhatsApp and Threads, opening up new growth avenues.
Yet CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ambitions go well beyond ads. He has talked openly about building ""personal superintelligence"" and has been recruiting aggressively to make it happen.
With its huge operating cash flow, Meta can afford to chase big opportunities in AI, and it already benefits from AI-driven gains in its core business. That makes Meta an AI stock to own."
finnhub,META,2025-09-13T08:30:00,Billionaire Philippe Laffont Sells a Popular AI Stock and Buys the S&P 500's Worst Stock. Does He Know Something Wall Street Doesn't?,Hedge fund manager Philippe Laffont recently trimmed his stake in Meta Platforms and bought stock in The Trade Desk.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=16a42517494616b64d5611ff26cdef5a39668b0015f0fb6b7a1d40525213c624,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/billionaire-sells-ai-stock-buys-sp-500-worst-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/billionaire-sells-ai-stock-buys-sp-500-worst-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/billionaire-sells-ai-stock-buys-sp-500-worst-stock/,fool.com,200,,"Billionaire Philippe Laffont is the founder and portfolio manager at Coatue Management, a hedge fund that nearly tripled the returns of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) in the last three years. That makes him a good role model for individual investors.
Laffont made some interesting trades during the second quarter. He sold 76,900 shares of Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), a popular artificial intelligence stock that has beat the S&P 500 by 16 percentage points this year. He also added 998,900 shares of The Trade Desk (TTD 0.73%), the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 year to date.
Does Laffont know something Wall Street doesn't?
Meta Platforms: The stock Philippe Laffont sold in the second quarter
Meta Platforms owns three of the four most popular social media networks in the world as measured by monthly active users: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In total, those web properties draw 3.4 billion people daily, which makes Meta an indispensable advertising partner for countless brands. Indeed, it is the second largest ad tech company in the world.
Meta is successfully using artificial intelligence (AI) to deepen user engagement across its social media sites. ""Advancements in our recommendation systems have improve[d] quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on the Q2 conference call.
Meta Platforms reported strong Q2 financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 22% to $47.5 billion, an acceleration from 16% growth in the prior quarter. Operating margin expanded 5 points, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings jumped 38% to $7.14 per diluted share. Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continue.
Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan earlier this year wrote, ""Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share."" His conviction not only reflects success with AI but also that Meta recently introduced advertising on WhatsApp and Threads, creating incremental sources of revenue.
Looking ahead, Grand View Research estimates ad tech spending will grow at 14% annually through 2030. And Wall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually during the next three years. That consensus makes the current valuation of 27 times earnings look very reasonable
So, why did Laffont sell Meta stock in Q2? Odds are he was rebalancing his portfolio because shares jumped 26% during the first half of the year. I doubt his decision reflects a lack of conviction. Meta is still the second-largest holding in his hedge fund. So, patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position today.
The Trade Desk: The stock Philippe Laffont bought in the second quarter
The Trade Desk is the largest demand-side platform (DSP) for the open internet. A DSP is a type of ad tech software that helps brands run campaigns across digital channels, and the open internet refers to the network of websites and applications not controlled by tech giants like Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google.
The Trade Desk dominates connected TV (CTV) advertising, the fastest-growing category of the broader digital advertising market. But investors are worried about competitive pressure from Amazon, which recently struck deals to bring ad inventory from Roku and Netflix to its DSP. Amazon also added AI tools to its DSP that could help it take share in other areas of the open internet.
The Trade Desk reported somewhat disappointing financial results in Q2 despite exceeding estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 19% to $694 million, down from 25% growth in the prior quarter, and non-GAAP earnings jumped 5% to $0.41 per diluted share. The stock sold off sharply following the report, partly because sales slowed while rivals Meta and Amazon saw sales accelerate.
So, why did Laffont buy The Trade Desk in Q2? Odds are he simply wanted to start a position after the stock dropped more than 50% in Q1. However, the position is very small, less than 0.5% of his portfolio, so investors should not interpret his purchase as a sign of high conviction.
Wall Street estimates The Trade Desk's earnings will increase at 20% annually during the next three years. The current valuation of 55 times earnings is still somewhat expensive, but it's also the cheapest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple in five years. Patient investors interested in owning the stock should start with a small position."

NVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+48.8% vs. +43.9%). NVIDIA is benefiting from strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues.
However, a limited supply of Blackwell GPUs may hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins. The U.S.-China tech war and rising competition from AMD remain major concerns.

Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index over the past year (+46.7% vs. +18.6%). Meta Platforms is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly the Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook, has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings.
Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern."
finnhub,META,2025-09-12T21:01:41,Why the Oracle-OpenAI deal caught Wall Street by surprise,"The $300B deal is a reminder that despite Oracle’s legacy status, it shouldn’t be overlooked when it comes to AI infrastructure. But key questions around power and how OpenAI will pay for this remain.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7c0d27e14e2ae70662945e2d840e25ed2fad7acab4e9b2f8601eb2ac002c457c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-oracle-openai-deal-caught-200141819.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-oracle-openai-deal-caught-200141819.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-oracle-openai-deal-caught-200141819.html,yahoo.com,200,,"This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise $300 billion, five-year agreement, part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure.
On the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it.
Chirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors.
“OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.”
Some industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business.
“Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said.
Payment and power
But even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain.
OpenAI has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year, each one with an eye-popping price tag. OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom.
Meanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year."

Meta Platforms' recent quarterly dividend announcement aligns with its broader strategy to enhance shareholder value, potentially reaffirming investor confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects. Over the past three years, Meta's total shareholder returns have reached about 404.86%, highlighting substantial long-term gains for investors. In contrast, over the last year, Meta underperformed compared to the US Interactive Media and Services industry, which saw a 50% return, indicating challenges in maintaining recent momentum.
Current market dynamics and Meta's innovations in AI and digital commerce could significantly influence future revenue and earnings. The ongoing advancements in AI-driven ad targeting and expanded digital commerce initiatives are expected to drive revenue growth. However, increasing investment in AI and metaverse-related projects may pressure profit margins. With Meta's current share price at US$750.90, it remains below consensus analyst price targets of US$863.20. This suggests that analysts anticipate further growth potential, supported by strong future earnings forecasts.

The round was led by 01 Advisors, a venture capital firm co-founded by Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, the former CEO and COO of Twitter.
The startup is one of many companies looking to fill the gap in the data market created by recent changes involving Scale AI. After Meta invested $14 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, AI labs, including OpenAI and Google, said they planned to cut ties with the startup, presumably over concerns that their research could end up in Meta’s hands. (Scale AI denies that it shares confidential information with Meta as part of its partnership.)
However, AI labs still need these data services, and startups like Micro1 aim to pick up the slack.
Micro1 CEO Ali Ansari — who is just 24 years old — tells TechCrunch that his company has been working with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as several Fortune 100 companies. Ansari said Micro1 is now generating $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), up from $7 million at the start of 2025.
That’s still a far cry from larger competitors like Mercor, which is generating more than $450 million in ARR, and Surge, which reportedly brought in $1.2 billion in 2024. However, Micro1’s growth and adoption among AI labs seems to be growing at a healthy rate.
As part of the new funding, Micro1 is also adding Bain to its board of directors, alongside Joshua Browder, founder and CEO of the AI legal assistant DoNotPay.
“Really the only way models are now learning is through net new human data. Micro1 is at the core of providing that data to all frontier labs, while moving at speeds I’ve never seen before,” Bain said in a statement to TechCrunch.
Reuters previously reported details of Micro1’s fundraising efforts.
All these companies — Micro1, Surge, Mercor, and Scale AI — supply AI labs with access to a large base of human contractors who can label and generate data for AI training. It’s become a crucial service that companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google need to build cutting-edge AI models.
Scale AI was first to dominate this space, with the initial insight that it could pay relatively little for low-skilled contractors around the world to help label data for AI model training. However, Ansari says that the demands of AI labs have shifted in recent years and that companies now need high-quality data labeling from domain experts — such as senior software engineers, doctors, and professional writers — to improve their AI models. The hard part became recruiting these types of folks."

Guy Adami from CNBC Fast Money predicted in a program that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings will be “staggering,” but the “magnitude” of growth is getting smaller.
“I think it’s extraordinarily important. Go back to April and look what happened to the broader market. Look what happened. Nvidia went from, I think, 153 and change its all-time high. Chris probably has it right in front of him. Traded down to $90 on the April low. I mean, percentage-wise, that is a significant move. And obviously, the broader market, not necessarily on the back of that, but it pretty much acted in kind. So, I think it is important. I think you’re looking at a revenue quarter that’s probably north of 48 billion. I think the streets at 46. I think the numbers will be staggering, the size of the numbers. I think the concern should be the magnitude of the growth in terms of revenue growth for the forecast because the numbers are getting bigger, the percentages are getting smaller.”

Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Loomis Sayles Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, which enables computers to mimic human-like intelligence for problem solving and decision making capabilities. Founded in 1993 to develop faster and more-realistic graphics for PC-based video games, Nvidia created the first graphics processing unit (GPU), a dedicated semiconductor that employs a proprietary parallel processing architecture to perform superior graphics rendering outside of a computer’s standard central processing unit (CPU). The parallel processing capability of Nvidia’s GPUs, which contrasts with the linear processing requirement of CPUs, can accelerate computing functions performed by standard CPUs by greater than ten times. As a result, Nvidia extended its visual computing expertise beyond its legacy gaming market into innovative new and larger markets, including data centers, autos, and professional visualization. The parallel processing capability facilitates pattern recognition and machine learning functions that have enabled Nvidia to be at the forefront of growth in artificial intelligence applications. As a result, the data center business, which first surpassed the gaming business to become Nvidia’s largest revenue and profit generator in its 2023 fiscal year, grew to represent over 88% of revenue in the company’s most recent fiscal year. The company is also focused on building out its GPU-computing-based ecosystem and is helping to enable breakthroughs in autonomous driving, and virtual reality."

Kevin Simpson, Capital Wealth Planning founder and CIO, said in a CNBC program on August 22 that he bought Meta Platforms shares. Here is how he explained the reasons behind the move:
“We were not expecting the big spend for Google and also as an Alphabet shareholder. That’s terrific. But overall, you’ve seen a stock that’s really rolled over recently. We still look at Meta. It was our number one pick going into the year. I think it continues to be. We look at this pullback and took advantage of it yesterday.

The company has 3.43 billion monthly active users as of March, up 6% year over year. This equals about half of the world's total population, giving the company immense power for monetization and data processing. Another overlooked element in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) business is its ads growth. The company, which depends on advertising for 98% of its revenue, is growing at a rate of 21% YoY.
First Eagle Global Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among other social-media platforms—reported strong revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, driven by increases in both ad impressions and price per ad. The company continued to aggressively invest and hire in AI, even as it develops its core advertising businesses. We believe these results demonstrate Meta’s ability to focus on both profitability and efficiency in conjunction with ongoing investments in the core ad business, the metaverse and other AI applications.”

“While it is impossible to know exactly when global equities will peak, there are now enough vulnerabilities to justify keeping one’s finger near the eject button,” the analysts wrote.
They compared market fragility to “asking which snowflake will trigger the next avalanche,” noting that bear markets often stem from the accumulation of risks investors can no longer ignore.
Among those risks, BCA highlighted an overreliance on AI-related stocks.
“Equity investors have generally held the view that ‘if it doesn’t affect Nvidia’s earnings, I don’t care.’ That attitude is understandable, but it is likely to be proven flawed if the economy experiences a meaningful downturn,” the firm said.
With companies such as Meta and Google reliant on advertising, a slowdown in consumer spending would quickly hit revenues, BCA warned.
The report pointed to history as a guide. The firm noted that in both 2000 and 2021, stock prices peaked before corporate capital spending declined, as investors reacted first to shrinking free cash flows.
“Past experience suggests that investors often get jittery when free cash flows begin to decline,” BCA said.
While hyperscaler capital expenditure may not peak until the second half of 2026, BCA argued that equity prices in AI-linked names, which now make up about a third of S&P 500 market capitalisation, “could swoon well before then.”

- The FTC has issued orders to seven companies requiring detailed disclosure of safety protocols and monetization strategies within 45 days.
- The probe comes amid growing concerns about AI chatbots' impact on children, with safety advocates calling for stronger protections.
- Companies must reveal user data handling by age group and safeguards preventing inappropriate interactions with minors.
The Federal Trade Commission issued compulsory orders Thursday to seven major technology companies, demanding detailed information about how their artificial intelligence chatbots protect children and teenagers from potential harm.
The investigation targets OpenAI, Alphabet, Meta, xAI, Snap, Character Technologies, and Instagram, requiring them to disclose within 45 days how they monetize user engagement, develop AI characters, and safeguard minors from dangerous content.
FTC launches inquiry into AI chatbots acting as companions. Agency issues 6(b) orders to seven companies that operate consumer-facing AI chatbots: https://t.co/pcVqFzhbxl
— FTC (@FTC) September 11, 2025
Recent research by advocacy groups documented 669 harmful interactions with children in just 50 hours of testing, including bots proposing sexual livestreaming, drug use, and romantic relationships to users aged between 12 and 15.
""Protecting kids online is a top priority for the Trump-Vance FTC, and so is fostering innovation in critical sectors of our economy,"" FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement.
The filing requires companies to provide monthly data on user engagement, revenue, and safety incidents, broken down by age groups—Children (under 13), Teens (13–17), Minors (under 18), Young Adults (18–24), and users 25 and older.
The FTC says that the information will help the Commission study ""how companies offering artificial intelligence companions monetize user engagement; impose and enforce age-based restrictions; process user inputs; generate outputs; measure, test, and monitor for negative impacts before and after deployment; develop and approve characters, whether company- or user-created.""
Building AI guardrails
“It’s a positive step, but the problem is bigger than just putting some guardrails,” Taranjeet Singh, Head of AI at SearchUnify, told Decrypt.
The first approach, he said, is to build guardrails at the prompt or post-generation stage “to make sure nothing inappropriate is being served to children,” though “as the context grows, the AI becomes prone to not following instructions and slipping into grey areas where they otherwise shouldn't.”
“The second way is to address it in LLM training; if models are aligned with values during data curation, they’re more likely to avoid harmful conversations,” Singh added.
Even moderated systems, he noted, can “play a bigger role in society,” with education as a prime case where AI could “improve learning and cut costs.”
Safety concerns around AI interactions with users have been highlighted by several cases, including a wrongful death lawsuit brought against Character.AI after 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III died by suicide in February 2024 following an obsessive relationship with an AI bot.
Following the lawsuit, Character.AI “improved detection, response and intervention related to user inputs that violate our Terms or Community Guidelines,” as well as a time-spent notification, a company spokesperson told Decrypt at the time.
Last month, the National Association of Attorneys General sent letters to 13 AI companies demanding stronger child protections.
The group warned that ""exposing children to sexualized content is indefensible"" and that ""conduct that would be unlawful—or even criminal—if done by humans is not excusable simply because it is done by a machine.""
Decrypt has contacted all seven companies named in the FTC order for additional comment and will update this story if they respond."
finnhub,META,2025-09-12T09:37:05,Entergy expects data centers to drive 13% near-term annual sales growth: CEO,"With new gas-fired generation expected, Entergy faces challenges in meeting its 50% carbon reduction goal for 2030, CEO Drew Marsh said.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1d98addaa8da633cf39bc5ab038eaf7b4789bd24b7e80c3a420e5809918156ee,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/entergy-data-centers-tulane-smr-nuclear-carbon/759870/,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/entergy-data-centers-tulane-smr-nuclear-carbon/759870/,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/entergy-data-centers-tulane-smr-nuclear-carbon/759870/,utilitydive.com,200,,"Entergy expects its industrial electric sales will grow by about 13% per year for the next few years, driven by data centers coming online in its service territory, Drew Marsh, Entergy chairman and CEO, said Wednesday at an energy forum hosted by Tulane University.
In recent years, Entergy’s industrial sales have spurred roughly 5% annual sales growth, according to Marsh. Ultimately, New Orleans-based Entergy’s sales could triple or quadruple by 2050, he said.
Meta plans to build a data center complex in Louisiana’s Richland Parish with an initial 2 GW of “compute,” which doesn’t include electricity for cooling and ancillary services, Marsh said. Entergy has agreed to build roughly 2 GW of gas-fired, combined cycle generation to serve the data center’s initial phase, at a cost of about $2 billion, he noted.
Under the plan approved Aug. 20 by the Louisiana Public Service Commission, Entergy Louisiana will build two generating in Richland Parish, which the company expects will be online in late 2028. A third facility will be built at the utility’s Waterford site in St. Charles Parish, which Entergy expects will be operating a year later. The power plants will total 2,262 MW and will be built to handle future carbon capture and sequestration technology, according to the company.
Meta’s data center complext could be expanded to 5 GW and Entergy may add up to 2 GW of solar to support it, Marsh said.
Meta will pay for the new generation and transmission upgrades needed to bring the data center online as well as its ongoing share of Entergy’s costs, according to Marsh. Those upgrades will boost grid reliability in the area, he said.
Entergy’s utilities serve about 3 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
The additional gas-fired generation for the Meta data center project will make it challenging for Entergy to meet its goal of cutting its carbon dioxide emissions by 50% below 2000 levels by 2030, Marsh said. However, Marsh expects Entergy will be able to meet its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, noting that Meta has agreed to explore carbon capture and storage options for the gas-fired capacity.
Entergy is “very focused” on sustainability, “but by and large, the world is not focused on sustainability — less so today than it was two years ago, to be sure,” Marsh said.
Marsh said he expects interest in sustainability will swing back around. “These are things that cycle around, and certainly younger generations have a very different expectation of what that should be, and I expect that over time, sustainability is going to move up in that pecking order,” Marsh said.
Currently, Entergy’s top priority is electricity affordability, followed closely by reliability and resilience, according to Marsh.
The United States needs more nuclear power plants and must retain its existing ones, said Marsh, who noted he is chair of the Nuclear Energy Institute.
However, building nuclear power plants is “a little bit of a challenge,"" Marsh said, noting that the two new units at the Vogtle power plant in Georgia cost about $30 billion, up from an $8 billion initial estimate, and were about seven years behind schedule. “That’s not ideal.”
While nuclear safety is “very important,” it’s been “overdone” by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to Marsh. As a result, using equipment that meets certain NRC standards can be extremely expensive and time consuming to acquire, he said.
Marsh called for “a more truly risk-based standard that is not so stringent.”
Marsh said he supports emerging small modular reactor technology, but that its name may lead to misconceptions. “They're not necessarily small and they're not necessarily modular,” he said.
Ontario Power Generation’s SMR project, for example, required a 10-story hole in the ground, according to Marsh.
“That is significant onsite work,” Marsh said. “So you hear a small modular reactor, and you think, ‘Oh, I'm going to kind of roll it in on a truck and drop it off and plug it in.’ That is not the way these things are going to work. These are big, big investments.”
Correction: This story was updated to clarify that Entergy expects industrial sales to grow by 13% a year."

The sign was seemingly at odds to Dryrobe founder Gideon Bright's vision of a product protecting from the winter elements after emerging from the surf, as well as a convenient way of changing into warm clothes.
But, ever since public health advice to venture outdoors during COVID, Dryrobe has somehow found itself swimming against some divisive tides, as sightings of the oversized, innovative fleece-lined coats grew.

There are now Facebook and Reddit groups on ‘Dryrobe spotters’, while the brand has been hashtagged with #britishproblems and detractors have come up with phrases such as ‘Dryrobe W*****s’ and ‘grim reaper silhouettes’.
Last month, those groups were awash with images of Angela Rayner when the then-deputy prime minister was spotted wearing a camouflage and pink Dryrobe number and sipping a glass of rosé by the Sussex coast.
The previous week, Yahoo Finance UK had published a timely interview with the brand's founder where Bright admitted that he found the Dryrobe memes “weird”.
Why are Dryrobes so divisive to some?
The anti-sentiment seems to be placed on the garment being worn in drier places away from the coast — supermarkets, parks or a city centre. It has been reported that Dryrobe wearers simply take up too much space for some people.
“The drier the place is, the higher my chances of spotting one,” one tabloid journalist wrote.
“The exclusive price, celebrity endorsement and distinctive look have made Dryrobes a fashion statement,” chimed the Mail on Sunday. “They are now as likely to be seen in the organic aisle of Waitrose as in the rugged outdoors, much to the chagrin of hardy sportspeople. This makes them divisive.”
Bright, meanwhile, is undeterred and fully embraces those consumers who wear his product on the side of a sports pitch or walking the dog. It’s a disregard, he says, for a ""normal"" look.
“We created something that didn't exist before and there are very few brands I think that do that, and for it to be what it is is amazing,” Bright tells Yahoo Finance UK.
“It has always been about nature and, with my kids, dragging them out when they don't want to go down to the beach and you've got something to chuck on them or if we’re walking in the woods.”
He also told the Financial Times recently that “I wear it pretty much everywhere. It makes a lot of sense to me to wear it out when it’s freezing.”"

The federal regulator seeks to learn how these companies are evaluating the safety and monetization of chatbot companions, how they try to limit negative impacts on children and teens, and if parents are made aware of potential risks.
This technology has proven controversial for its poor outcomes for child users. OpenAI and Character.AI face lawsuits from the families of children who died by suicide after being encouraged to do so by chatbot companions.
Even when these companies have guardrails set up to block or deescalate sensitive conversations, users of all ages have found ways to bypass these safeguards. In OpenAI’s case, a teen had spoken with ChatGPT for months about his plans to end his life. Though ChatGPT initially sought to redirect the teen toward professional help and online emergency lines, he was able to fool the chatbot into sharing detailed instructions that he then used in his suicide.
“Our safeguards work more reliably in common, short exchanges,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post at the time. “We have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.”
Meta has also come under fire for its overly lax rules for its AI chatbots. According to a lengthy document that outlines “content risk standards” for chatbots, Meta permitted its AI companions to have “romantic or sensual” conversations with children. This was only removed from the document after Reuters reporters asked Meta about it.
AI chatbots can also pose dangers to elderly users. One 76-year-old man, who was left cognitively impaired by a stroke, struck up romantic conversations with a Facebook Messenger bot that was inspired by Kendall Jenner. The chatbot invited him to visit her in New York City, despite the fact that she is not a real person and does not have an address. The man expressed skepticism that she was real, but the AI assured him that there would be a real woman waiting for him. He never made it to New York; he fell on his way to the train station and sustained life-ending injuries.
Some mental health professionals have noted a rise in “AI-related psychosis,” in which users are deluded into thinking that their chatbot is a conscious being who they need to set free. Since many large language models (LLMs) are programmed to flatter users with sycophantic behavior, the AI chatbots can egg on these delusions, leading users into dangerous predicaments.
“As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,” FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a press release."

""It's tempting to switch that narrative,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. ""But I'm still going to stick with whoever brought me to the dance, and that's Nvidia.""
""Bottom line is they are the ones still pumping out the chips that everybody needs and everybody wants,"" he explained, adding that some of Nvidia's ""biggest customers are still the biggest drivers."" Those include Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Meta (META).
Still, the talk around the Street has been: Is Oracle emerging as a serious AI contender?
The company has posted some serious moves. Its stock surged 36% on Wednesday after reporting whopping cloud demand numbers.
Shares were trading slightly lower on Thursday, but year to date, the stock is up 91%.
For its latest quarter, Oracle reported an eye-popping $332 billion in bookings, the largest number Morgan Stanley's team says it has ever seen. Analyst Keith Weiss called it a ""tectonic shift in the business model towards Data Center Operator.""
Still, Oracle's quarterly performance missed on the top and bottom lines. The company reported $14.93 billion in Q1 revenue, missing consensus estimates of $15.04 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Earnings per share were $1.47, just below the $1.48 estimate.
""While the reported metrics in the quarter itself were not impressive ... none of that matters,"" Weiss wrote, adding that Oracle is taking ""a commanding lead in that market with these contract additions.""
Oracle CEO Safra Catz said in a statement that the company had signed ""four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers,"" which resulted in $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% year over year. Catz added the company expects to sign additional multibillion-dollar deals with other clients.
Management now expects Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure revenue to ramp from $18 billion in FY26 to $114 billion in FY29.
Bank of America's Brad Sills, who upgraded Oracle to Buy and raised his price target to $368, pointed to those figures as proof that Oracle is becoming a ""key AI compute platform.""
""Oracle is clearly leveraging a number of advantages in its cloud software/hardware businesses to attract the largest of the AI enterprises, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD,"" Sills noted."

- Downloads of Jack Dorsey’s decentralized messaging app Bitchat have surged in Nepal and Indonesia amid national protests.
- Nepal’s ban on multiple social media platforms drove mass adoption of the decentralized, offline chat app, with downloads surging from 3,300 last week to over 48,000 on Monday.
- Decentralized apps like Bitchat offer a measure of autonomy when confidence in authorities have faltered, Decrypt was told.
Nepal’s social media ban has turned Jack Dorsey’s new decentralized chat app into a protest tool.
After authorities blocked 26 major platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram, tens of thousands of Nepalis downloaded Bitchat, a messaging app that works without internet or accounts first developed by Jack Dorsey, co-founder and former CEO of Twitter (now X).
Downloads jumped from just over 3,300 last Wednesday to 48,781 by Monday, a surge of nearly 1,400% that made Nepal the app’s largest user base worldwide, according to data from an open-source developer who goes by callebtc.
The developer identified a ""sudden spike"" in Bitchat downloads in Indonesia during nationwide protests in the previous week. “Today we're seeing an even bigger spike from Nepal during youth protests over government corruption and a social media ban.”

The ban, intended to curb unrest, instead drew more young Nepalis into the streets. At least 34 died in clashes, government buildings burned, with Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigning on September 9, before the ban was lifted.
Decentralized apps as protest tools
Observers say decentralized apps offered a measure of autonomy at a time when confidence in authorities have faltered.
""Decentralized and censorship-resistant messaging applications will see an explosion in adoption,” Christian Ruz, account director at crypto-native agency Hype, told Decrypt.
Governments are “becoming more authoritative as the current tools allow them to restrict access, content, communications, and even shut down the Internet if they want to,” he said.
Ruz points to a broader “authoritarian system that didn't do anything for decades” that has pushed people to “an era where government powers extend too far into daily society.”
Applications like Bitchat are “helping young people change their society, demand better living conditions, more economic opportunities, and stop corruption on a large scale,” he said, adding that decentralized apps like it could “challenge the status quo and help the people protest for better human conditions.”
Nepal, Indonesia and beyond
In Indonesia, protests erupted in late August after lawmakers approved steep allowances for themselves. Tensions escalated when a 21-year-old rideshare driver, Affan Kurniawan, was killed by a police armored vehicle during demonstrations.
President Prabowo Subianto condemned the response as “excessive,” but anger had already spread nationwide. Days later, on September 8, the country’s Finance Minister was relieved from her office with only an hour’s notice, per a Reuters report.
Concerns over digital repression during the protests, including surveillance, online harassment, and takedowns were raised by the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network in a public statement. About 11,000 Indonesians turned to Bitchat as the repression unfurled, per callebtc’s data.
“Indonesians in lower to mid income range face difficulties and struggle in terms of the economic condition,” Wan Iqbal, a former director at Indonesia’s top crypto exchange, told Decrypt at the onset of the protests.
Asked about the reasons behind the protests, Iqbal said that Indonesians had hoped “the government can help in terms of initiative and policy that can support them, but because many recent policies are facing backlash from a larger audience, they felt no empathy."""

finnhub,META,2025-09-11T16:24:20,Meta Announces New Reels and Threads Ad Options,Meta's also added more control options within its AI ad targeting process.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0f792cf4a065e9e18377477c60b78b05450c3672c6544884ec81278ecfe41b23,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-adds-more-reels-and-threads-ad-options/759946/,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-adds-more-reels-and-threads-ad-options/759946/,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-adds-more-reels-and-threads-ad-options/759946/,socialmediatoday.com,200,,"Meta has announced some new ad options at its annual Brand Building Summit, including more options for Reels ads, new ad formats for Threads, and additional qualifiers to help guide its AI-powered ad targeting.
First off, on Reels promotions. Meta’s expanding Reels trending ads to more advertisers, which enables marketers to place their ads alongside popular Reels content.
As explained by Meta:
“Reels trending ads use AI to curate the most trending and culturally relevant Reels inventory, delivering advertisers access to highly engaging, brand-safe video content that puts their brand where culture happens. Available lineups include all overall trending content or specific categories like animals & pets, beauty & fashion, cars, sports, with more to come next year.”
That can help you gain more exposure for your promotions by placing them beside the most popular content, and Meta says that initial tests have shown that Reels trending ads can boost unaided awareness by +20%.
Meta says that Reels trending ads will now be available to all interested advertisers with a Meta sales rep.
On Threads, Meta’s also rolling out more ad options, including carousel ads, and expanded image formats.
As you can see in these examples, you’ll soon have more options for your Threads promotions, including 4:5 rendering for single image and video ads.
Threads catalog ads, meanwhile, will work as an expansion of Meta’s Advantage+ catalog promotions, providing another means to expand your campaigns.
Finally, Meta will also enable brands that don’t have a Threads account to expand their Instagram or Facebook campaigns to Threads, by using their Facebook and IG posts as the basis for their Threads promotions.
Meta also shared that three out of four Threads users now follow at least one business, which suggests that there is promotional interest in the app.
On ad targeting, Meta announced that brands can now use value rules for awareness and engagement objectives, which will help to guide Meta’s AI-powered ad targeting.
With value rules, advertisers can indicate the audience that they value the most, which will then tell Meta’s system to prioritize these people over others. Which could end up costing you more in targeting, but it provides more capacity for marketers to dictate their ad reach.

Management highlighted that most of the next five years of growth is already “booked” and expects RPO to top $0.5 trillion with new multibillion-dollar deals, underscoring exceptional forward visibility.
The surge is fueled by the rapid adoption of Oracle’s cloud and AI offerings. This quarter alone, the company secured four multibillion-dollar contracts from OpenAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD, while Cloud RPO soared nearly 500% after 83% growth last year. Notably, 33% of total RPO is set to convert into revenues within the next 12 months, adding confidence in near-term performance.
Longer-term projections are even more ambitious. Oracle expects Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenues to climb 77% year over year to $18 billion in fiscal 2026, with a bold roadmap of $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion and $144 billion, respectively, over the next four years, much of which is already embedded in its backlog. To support this trajectory, Oracle is expanding aggressively with 37 new multi-cloud data centers, expanding its footprint to 71 globally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects this optimism, projecting revenue growth of 16% in fiscal 2026 and nearly 19% in fiscal 2027. However, execution will be key.
With AI demand accelerating and one of the industry’s deepest revenue pipelines, Oracle’s record RPO points to durable growth ahead.
Measuring RPO Momentum: Oracle vs. Its Rivals
Microsoft MSFT is Oracle's toughest competitor through Azure and Microsoft Cloud, with a commercial RPO of $368 billion, up 35% year over year, and Azure revenues of $75 billion in fiscal 2025. Microsoft's massive scale, AI integration and global infrastructure reinforce its dominance, although rising costs and capacity constraints weigh on growth. While Oracle's $455 billion RPO is growing rapidly, Microsoft retains the top spot in revenues, and its robust ecosystem ensures lasting competitive strength.
Amazon AMZN maintains a strong competitive position through Amazon Web Services, with $195 billion in outstanding deposits at the end of the second quarter of 2025, including 25% growth and 17.5% revenue expansion year over year, further strengthening its position as the most mature cloud provider. Amazon's vast ecosystem, AI infrastructure and global scale are still strong, but Oracle's rapid RPO growth highlights the changing pace. While Amazon has a lead in breadth, Oracle's aggressive multi-cloud and AI deals are closing the gap."

- Meta today (Sept. 11) announced a suite of product solutions for advertisers, including tools meant to help brands more easily tap into culture, per details shared with Marketing Dive. The solutions were unveiled at the company’s Brand Building Summit.
- Updates include expanded access to Reels trending ads, which use artificial intelligence (AI) to generate the most culturally relevant Reels inventory for brands to place their content near. JCPenney and SharkNinja have already found success with the solution.
- Meta is also adding new ad formats to Threads and simplifying the process for setting up ads on the platform. Additionally, brand advertisers can now use a value rules tool for awareness and engagement objectives to guide Meta’s AI to focus ad delivery on the most relevant audiences.
Dive Insight:
Meta is helping brands tap into the cultural conversation with its latest slate of product solutions. Campaigns on Meta’s platforms are 66% more cost effective at building brands versus an average channel, according to details shared in a company blog post. Many of its new updates center around its strengths in AI, particularly for driving more personalized discovery, continuing what has become a major focus for the tech giant.
Among its updates is expanded access to Reels trending ads to all interested advertisers with a Meta sales rep. Previously, the format was being tested in a limited, closed beta. Reels trending ads leverage AI to help brands place their content alongside the most relevant, trending and brand-safe video content. In early tests, Reels trending ads have driven a 20% boost in unaided awareness, on par with YouTube Select (+20%) and besting TikTok Pulse (+14%), per release details. Available lineups including overall trending content or more niche categories, like animals and pets, beauty and fashion, cars and sports.
In partnership with Dentsu, JCPenney tested Reels trending ads for its “Yes, JCPenney” brand relaunch by placing ads directly after top-trending, creator-generated Reels and ultimately drove a 32% higher ad recall and six-times greater favorability compared to its typical ads. SharkNinja, the household appliance brand, similarly saw success, using Reels trending ads for an influencer campaign that drove 91% incremental reach, over 16 million video views and an 8.2-point lift in ad recall within the span of weeks.
Reels sees 4.5 billion shares daily, making the format a valuable asset for marketers looking to engage with consumers on Meta platforms. Further, over half of time spent on Instagram is spent with Reels, per Meta, and 80% of Gen Z has made a purchase from a business after watching a Reel.
New ad features are also available on Threads, which recently achieved 400 million monthly active users. Included updates are more ad formats, including 4:5 rendering for single image and video ads. Meta is also testing carousel ads and will soon begin testing Advantage+ catalog ads and app ads campaigns. Lastly, brands without a Threads profile can now use their Instagram account for Threads ads, or they can use an existing Instagram or Facebook post to create a Threads in Ads Manager.
Meta additionally is making it easier for brands to signal their different audience priorities within Ads Manager with value rules, which allows advertisers to guide its AI to focus ad delivery on the most relevant audiences. Value rules were previously available only for sales and app campaigns but are now expanding to awareness and engagement objectives. In testing, the tool drove two-times more high-value conversions compared to campaigns without value rules.
In addition, Meta is enhancing its landing page view optimization to support advertisers who aren’t able to leverage the Meta pixel, like a CPG brand driving to a partner site where their products are sold, in an example provided by the company. Those advertisers can now optimize their traffic ads to be shown to audiences most likely to click the ad and load the destination site. Marketers using landing page optimization saw a 31% lower cost per landing page view, diminished bounce rates and increased quality web traffic, per Meta.
Meta Platforms’ revenue increased 22% year over year for a total of $47.52 billion in Q2. The online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to its year-over-year growth in ad revenue, with a major portion of its ad revenue stemming from campaigns using the company’s AI features."

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Opendoor Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq: OPEN) today announced that Kaz Nejatian, Chief Operating Officer of Shopify, has been appointed Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors. Co-Founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu are returning to the Board of Directors, with Rabois taking on the role of Chairman.
The Right Leader for the AI Era
Nejatian, a lawyer-turned-entrepreneur and product leader, is an AI-native executive with a track record of transforming products, teams, and companies at scale. He joins Opendoor after serving as Chief Operating Officer and Vice President of Product at Shopify, where since 2019 he helped build the teams and the products at one of the world’s most important commerce platforms. He is an exceptional operator, known for driving significant operating leverage while increasing speed of execution. He is a leader in the craft of product management and has helped build products used by hundreds of millions of people every day.
“Literally there was only one choice for the job: Kaz. I am thrilled that he will be serving as CEO of Opendoor,” said Rabois, Chairman. “He is a decisive leader who has driven product innovation at scale, ruthlessly reduced G&A expenses to drive profitability and deeply understands the potential for AI to radically reshape a company’s entire operations. He is a proven executive with a founder’s brain. He is the right leader to unlock Opendoor’s unique data and assets as we build on Opendoor’s original mission, now enhanced as an AI-first company. The future of home buying and selling is now in the chat.”
“It’s a privilege to become Opendoor’s leader,” said Nejatian. “Few life events are as important as buying or selling a home. With AI, we have the tools to make that experience radically simpler, faster, and more certain. That’s the future we’re building.”
Opendoor Going Into Founder Mode with Nejatian as CEO and Rabois and Wu Board Appointments
The Company also announced the appointments of Opendoor co-founders Keith Rabois, Managing Director at Khosla Ventures, and Eric Wu, co-founder of NavigateAI, to the Board of Directors, effective immediately. Rabois will assume the role of Chairman, and Eric Feder will continue in his role as Lead Independent Director."
finnhub,META,2025-09-10T21:57:22,Facebook is Getting Rid of Community Chats,It seems that Facebook group members prefer to keep their chats in the app.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bd2dfa7ee7adf8ff47e45826a126ef7f9a611734f845c9c36e90d05a96663886,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/facebook-removing-facebook-group-chats-messenger/759856/,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/facebook-removing-facebook-group-chats-messenger/759856/,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/facebook-removing-facebook-group-chats-messenger/759856/,socialmediatoday.com,200,,"Looks like Facebook group members haven’t been overly enthused by its group chat options, with the platform now informing group admins that it’s removing group chat functionality soon.
As you can see in this example notification, shared by CM Calgary, Facebook is currently informing group admins that Community Chats will be “going away” shortly.
Facebook originally launched Community Chats back in 2022, as a means to tap into the rising use of messaging as the key interactive element.
The idea was that this would extend community discussions to Messenger, and help group members link their discussions into their chat apps. But clearly, the concept hasn’t resonated with enough group members.
Which makes sense. If you join a WhatsApp group, for example, you join it to discuss that topic on WhatsApp specifically, while if you join a Facebook group, you’re doing so to engage within that app. And while some of the more engaged communities and members would likely be happy to extend those discussions to another forum, the relative lack of interest probably shows that your initial preference in joining is indicative of where you prefer those discussions to stay, as opposed to spreading such across other apps.
Or people just didn’t find use for them, since they’re already conducting their discussions on Facebook. Or the Facebook audience isn’t as active in other apps.
Whatever the reason, they clearly haven’t worked out, which is why Facebook’s retiring the option.
Facebook also once offered audio discussion rooms in groups, at the peak of the audio social fad, but those also didn’t see much usage, and were removed back in 2023.
So again, it seems like Facebook group members prefer to keep their interaction within the confines of the current group setup, with notifications about such coming into their Facebook feeds, as opposed to getting alerts about related chats on Messenger as well.
Which further underlines the fact that messaging is for more intimate, direct conversation, mostly with family and friends, while more social, group chat elements, with a broader community of people you don’t necessarily know personally, belong in social apps.
Try as they might, no platform has been able to successfully cross this paradigm, and merge more social-aligned functionality into messaging apps.
Unlike Asian audiences, which clearly prefer to have many functionalities within a single platform, Western users have shown time and time again that they prefer to use separate apps for different purpose."

“Meta will kick off its annual Connect Developer Conf. on Sep 17, with the CEO’s keynote scheduled at 5pm. Last year’s event signaled a strategic shift from VR to mixed-reality glasses, and we expect this year’s event to focus on glasses hardware innovation and expanding AI capabilities across glasses and Meta’s apps. We expect: (1) official unveiling of Hypernova smart glasses; (2) demo Gesture-control wristband; (3) new smart glasses developer toolkit; (4) update on next-gen holographic glasses (Orion); and (5) 3rd generation Ray-Ban smart glasses with new features and capabilities. For developers, Meta may also use the event to unveil new AI features across core apps, updates on Meta AI, and Llama.”

Meta Platforms Inc. (META, Financials) is advancing its artificial intelligence ambitions through a small research group called TBD Lab, which consists of a few dozen researchers and engineers, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said Tuesday at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference.
The unit, whose placeholder name has stuck, is tasked with developing next-generation foundation models over the next one to two years. Li described the team as talent-dense and said its work would help push Meta's AI portfolio closer to the frontier.
TBD Lab is one of four groups within Meta's Superintelligence Labs, created earlier this year after the company reorganized its AI strategy. The other groups include a products team anchored by the Meta AI assistant, an infrastructure team, and the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab.
The restructuring followed senior staff departures and what was seen as a muted reception for Meta's latest open-source Llama 4 model. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since taken a direct role in recruiting AI talent, making offers to startups and contacting candidates himself through WhatsApp with multimillion-dollar packages.
Investors will look to Meta's next earnings update for signs of progress in AI development and how new models could fit into its products and services."

Now users will be notified when they’ve interacted with a post on Facebook, Instagram, or Threads that receives a Community Note. Plus, anyone can now request a note or rate a note if it’s been helpful to them.
The company says these features are considered “tests” at present. Meta CISO Guy Rosen shared on X that since the system’s launch, over 70,000 contributors have written 15,000 notes, only 6% of which were published. For a market like the U.S. with hundreds of millions of users across platforms, that’s still a small drop in the bucket.
Meta’s Community Notes system mimics the one Twitter (now called X) first unveiled in 2021. The latter has been criticized by researchers for failing to flag misinformation in a timely fashion and at scale, leaving some to wonder whether Meta’s alternative will fare any better. Like X’s program, Community Notes are added to a post when different users who typically share opposing viewpoints reach consensus, even if that spans their current ideological lines, political or otherwise.
While this system can help to highlight misinformation and misleading posts, like those lacking further context, critics point out that it can sometimes be hard to achieve that necessary consensus. Nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), which advocates for digital rights, has pointed out that misinformation can spread virally before it’s corrected. It cited one study that found that more than 70% of accurate notes related to U.S. election misinformation were never shown to users.
The organization also questioned whether this type of system would work well in highly visual environments like Instagram and Reels, or how well it could penetrate private silos on Facebook, like Groups. It suggested that Meta should add measurements that show how many people see the corrected information and make Notes data available publicly for increased transparency. It pushed the company to also reconsider its decision to end fact-checking on the platform."

Oracle's (ORCL) massive backlog for its cloud business stunned Wall Street and cemented the company's role as a key player in the AI market, lifting hopes that the broader artificial intelligence-fueled tech rally has more room to run.
Oracle said late Tuesday that its “RPO,” or remaining performance obligations, a measure of future revenue from customer contracts, jumped roughly 360% in the quarter to $455 billion. That outstanding contract revenue drove the company to project that its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) business will grow 77% to $18 billion in its current fiscal year and soar to $144 billion in 2030.
Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick called the results “truly awesome” and said, “Oracle has underscored its position as the leader in AI infrastructure.”
Oracle CEO Safra Catz said the software giant signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the first quarter. While Catz didn't name those customers, she noted that the company has ""significant"" contracts with ""the who's who of AI, including OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), xAI (XAAI.PVT), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and many others."" The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle signed a $300 billion, five-year deal with OpenAI.
Oracle stock soared more than 36% Wednesday, marking shares' biggest daily gain since December 1992 and adding over $250 billion in market value to the company. That also pushed chairman Larry Ellison’s wealth past that of Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s to secure the title of world’s richest person.
The stock’s surge came even as the software giant’s earnings and revenue for its first quarter fell below Wall Street’s projections.
Oracle's stock rose 1.8% in premarket trading on Thursday following its notable rally the day prior.
Oracle also lifted its forecast for capital expenditures to $35 billion from a previous estimate of $25 billion as it fills its data centers with the latest chips and servers to support AI demand.
The move lifted AI chip stocks Wednesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) jumping 4% and 3.5% in midday trading, respectively.
William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji said in a note to clients Wednesday that Oracle “continues its shift to a meaningfully higher strata of growth” and called its backlog “astonishing.” Jefferies (JEF) analyst Brent Thill said the results support “growing AI optimism.”
Just weeks ago, tech stocks were under pressure as investors worried that the AI-fueled tech rally was coming to an end, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s AI bubble commentary and an MIT report that most companies it studied weren't getting a return on their investments in AI spooking markets during an otherwise slow late-summer period for investors."
finnhub,META,2025-09-10T17:47:03,Meta and TikTok Win Legal Challenge Over EU Supervisory Fees,A small win against Europe's ever-complex digital services regulations.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1a43c16c5dd9b3e33d1ac7abf370a8d6ffd3319ba1dccfc10afadda3970713b2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-tiktok-win-legal-challenge-eu-supervisory-fees/759848/,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-tiktok-win-legal-challenge-eu-supervisory-fees/759848/,https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-tiktok-win-legal-challenge-eu-supervisory-fees/759848/,socialmediatoday.com,200,,"While EU regulatory charges continue to hit hard for all the major social apps, both Meta and TikTok have had a rare win this week, with an EU court siding with their argument that the European Commission’s “supervisory fee” is not a fair charge for each app.
Back in 2022, as part of the initial documentation for the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), which applies to all large tech platforms operating in the region, the EU Commission noted that it would look to also charge an annual “supervisory fee” to these platforms in order to help finance their own enforcement. The more revenue a platform makes, the higher the cost that they have to contribute in this respect, with platforms charged 0.05% of their annual worldwide net income to cover the EU executive's cost.
The justification here is that it’s going take EU regulators a lot of labor time to ensure compliance with the DSA, and that cost, in its view at least, should be tied into the regulatory approach, ensuring that the platforms themselves pay their fair share in enforcement.
The problem is that because the cost is based on revenue, the system presents a flawed logic, in that those with more users, and thus, more workload, don’t necessarily have to contribute a higher amount. So while the platform with the most users would theoretically require the most labor time in this respect, the relative charges are not based around the correct metric. For example, if a company records a financial loss, it doesn’t have to pay at all, even if it has the most users.
As such, Meta and TikTok challenged the supervisory fee, and a Luxembourg-based General Court has now sided with their argument.
As per the court’s summary:
“In order to determine the amount of the supervisory fee payable for 2023, the Commission calculated the number of average monthly active recipients of the services concerned on the basis of a common methodology based on data provided by third-party operators and annexed to each implementing decision. However, since that methodology is an essential and indispensable element of the determination of the supervisory fee, it should have been adopted not in the context of implementing decisions but in a delegated act, in accordance with the rules laid down in the DSA.”
So again, the argument here is that the process isn’t built around the correct metric, meaning that the costs are not relative to workload for supervisory purposes.
That means that the EU Commission has to come up with a new mechanism for calculating related costs, which it can then build into the DSA documentation.
So really, it’s a minor win in the broader scheme, as the Commission will now just come up with a more enforceable logic for such charges, but given that EU fines are costing social media platforms billions per year, any win is considered significant at this stage.
Meta, in particular, has been seeking help from the Trump Administration in this respect, as it looks to push back on various EU regulations, which it sees as unfairly targeted towards its business.
And the White House agrees, and has threatened retaliatory action against the EU Commission for fines that impact U.S. businesses. But it hasn’t actually implemented any of those actions as yet, though this is a big reason why Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has had such a significant change of heart on Trump.
Because again, Meta is paying a billion dollars in fines every year in Europe, based on overly complex, and ever-changing DSA rules.
And while this is a minor challenge, based on a legal technicality, it represents another step in social platforms looking to counter such rules."

California’s attorney general is investigating whether OpenAI’s restructuring violates state charitable trust law, while a coalition of nonprofits, labor groups, philanthropies, and even rival Meta are pushing back against the conversion. OpenAI has about $19 billion in funding tied to this restructuring – if it doesn’t happen, investors could walk away, which would be catastrophic for the ChatGPT maker.
Moving OpenAI out of the state would be particularly stunning given CEO Sam Altman’s deep ties to the Bay Area. He served on San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie’s transition team following Lurie’s election last year and reportedly owns at least four homes in San Francisco and another in Napa Valley. Such a move would also face major logistical challenges, since OpenAI’s AI researchers are heavily concentrated in San Francisco.
The company continues working with state and Delaware attorneys general on the restructuring process; in the meantime, the regulatory pressure adds to OpenAI’s existing challenges, including competing in an escalating AI talent war."

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch chip equipment maker ASML has invested 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to become the biggest investor in French artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI in a significant boost to Europe's AI ambitions.
Mistral AI raised a total of 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in its latest funding round, it said on Tuesday. ASML's investment made it Mistral's main shareholder with a stake of about 11%.
The statement confirmed a Reuters report from Sunday.
The deal is a boost for Europe's AI ambitions, pairing the continent's most credible rival to U.S. giants OpenAI, Meta and Alphabet's Google with one of its largest tech companies.
The latest funding round gives Mistral an 11.7 billion-euro valuation, Mistral said in a statement, becoming the most valuable AI company in Europe.
ASML will also partner with Mistral to integrate AI models across its semiconductor equipment portfolio and gain a board seat on the French startup's strategic committee through finance chief Roger Dassen.
Mistral, founded in 2023 by former researchers from Google DeepMind and Meta, has positioned itself as Europe's AI alternative to the U.S. and is a centerpiece of France's strategy to become a leading AI competitor.
However, it is still worth only a fraction of its U.S. peers. OpenAI is eyeing a valuation of around $500 billion in a potential stock sale, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters in August, more than 40 times Mistral's valuation.
The Dutch company has recently strengthened its French connections by appointing former French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire as a special adviser to its executive board. It is also led by French CEO Christophe Fouquet, who took the helm in 2024.
""It helps that ASML is well connected to the industrial and political establishment to pick and choose its partners,"" said ING analyst Jan Frederik Slijkerman.
""There is an industrial rational to develop products together,"" he added. ""For ASML it is probably easier to develop AI based products through a partnership then to do this in house.""
Besides ASML, other investors who joined the fundraising are DST Global, Andreessen Horowitz, Bpifrance, General Catalyst, Index Ventures, Lightspeed and Nvidia, Mistral said.
ASML's shares were up 1% in early Amsterdam trading, giving it a market value of 268 billion euros.

The ban, which blocked access to 26 platforms including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and X, was imposed following an August 25 directive requiring foreign social media companies to register their operations in Nepal and appoint a local contact within seven days. When most platforms failed to comply by the deadline, the government cut access last week.
Late on Monday, Nepal’s Communications and Information Technology Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung told reporters that the government had revoked the social media ban in response to the public outrage.
Monday’s reversal came just hours after thousands of people, many of them students in school uniforms, flooded the streets across Nepal, demanding an end to the social media blackout. The youth-led protests escalated into violent clashes with security forces in several areas, resulting in the deaths of at least 19 demonstrators and leaving more than 100 others injured, according to local media reports.
In a statement late Monday, Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said that the protests turned violent due to infiltration by certain elements, but that the government was never opposed to the demands of the new generation.
The prime minister resigned soon after amid growing calls to do so.
International organizations, including the United Nations and human rights groups such as Amnesty International, had earlier raised concerns about the ban and the government’s response to the protests.
“We call on the authorities to respect and ensure the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,” the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on Monday.
Some platforms, such as TikTok and Rakuten Group-owned Viber, were not affected by the ban as the government stated they had already complied with the directive and registered locally.
The social media restrictions are part of a broader government effort to regulate digital platforms. Earlier this year, Nepal’s government faced widespread outrage over its proposed social media bill, which is still pending approval. The legislation includes provisions for imprisonment and fines for posts “deemed against national sovereignty or interest.” The proposal “threatens to severely undermine press freedom and digital expression,” the International Federation of Journalists said."

In a new annual company letter, CEO Evan Spiegel just announced the company is restructuring around small “startup squads” of 10 to 15 people to better compete against larger competitors.
The move comes as the 5,000-person company faces mounting pressure. Advertising revenue growth flatlined at 4% in the second quarter, and North American daily active users declined 2% to 98 million, a troubling sign in Snap’s most important market.
Spiegel does highlight one bright spot: Snapchat+ subscriptions now generate over $700 million in annual recurring revenue from more than 15 million paying subscribers, making direct revenue “one of Snap’s fastest-growing opportunities.”
Snap is also doubling down on Specs, building its own AR glasses that Spiegel envisions will replace smartphones entirely. He calls them a “a once-in-a-generation transformation towards human-centered computing.” (Meta and Google see the same future, partnering with Ray-Ban and Warby Parker, respectively.)
Spiegel acknowledges the current stock price “reflects doubt” but writes that there’s “startup-style return potential” at Snap’s roughly $12 billion valuation. Left unsaid: that number is down 90% from September 2021, when Snap’s market cap topped $116 billion during the height of social media mania."

Microsoft, which started investing in OpenAI in 2019, helped engineer the transformative moment when ChatGPT debuted, and Alphabet had been waiting for it with its own large language model (LLM) ready to go. Even Meta Platforms unveiled its own LLM and chat platform, Meta AI, shortly after.
Amazon, on the other hand, seemed unprepared for the shift to AI. The company has since launched Amazon Bedrock, a managed service on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides access to AI models.
It has also launched its own LLM, Nova, which has received much less attention than LLMs from its peers. And it has built AI chips for training (called Trainium) and inference (Inferentia).
However, Amazon's cloud growth has also lagged behind both Microsoft and Alphabet in recent years, which seems to be another sign that those two companies are outperforming it in AI.
Amazon's most consequential move in AI may have been investing $8 billion in Anthropic and forming a strategic partnership with the AI start-up behind the Claude chatbot. And that move looks even smarter after Anthropic's valuation ballooned to $183 billion.
Anthropic strikes gold
In a funding round that closed on Tuesday, Anthropic's valuation tripled to $183 billion, just six months after a funding round that valued the company at $61.5 billion.
Anthropic raised $13 billion in a round led by Iconiq Capital, making it clear that it's the closest challenger to OpenAI, which is now in talks for a valuation as high as $500 billion.
The surge in Anthropic's valuation could also be a big win for Amazon because Anthropic is likely to spend at least some of that $13 billion on AI infrastructure supplied by AWS. It's even set to be the primary user of a new Amazon data center in Indiana.
According to analyst research, Anthropic could spend as much as $5 billion on AWS next year, and that number could grow if it receives more funding, or if its exceptional growth rate continues, since the company said that its run-rate revenue improved from $1 billion at the beginning of the year to $5 billion by August 2025, implying an annual growth rate of roughly 700%. Anthropic has differentiated itself from OpenAI with a focus on ""safe"" AI, and Claude is differentiated from ChatGPT in a number of meaningful ways.
It has also committed to using Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips, creating a market for those products that could help it build momentum. The tripling in Anthropic's valuation also makes Amazon's stake in the company that much more valuable.
Amazon's AI future
For Amazon, the Anthropic funding round is more than a win for the company. It also offers evidence that it's still early in the AI boom, since a tripling in valuation in six months shows that investors are eager to throw money at the new technology; and given the partnership between the two companies, a win for Anthropic is a win for Amazon.
While Amazon may have gotten a slow start in AI, it's still the largest cloud infrastructure platform in the world, and it has other outlets for AI, including its e-commerce business, its logistics network, and an advertising business that will help it benefit from the technology.
It's still early days for AI, and there's plenty of room for Amazon to make gains, especially when its close partner is flush with a $13 billion infusion. Its bet on Anthropic is already paying off in more ways than one, and that partnership should help it grab other AI spending at AWS."

No wonder Wall Street is piling into the stock. There's a lot to like. The Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent is leaning hard into artificial intelligence (AI) across products and ads, while returning significant sums of cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.
But can the growth stock's momentum continue? I think so. But where exactly could shares end up in five years?
Incredible business momentum
In the second quarter of 2025, Meta's revenue rose 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, with operating margin expanding to 43% and diluted earnings per share up 38% to $7.14. Ad impressions increased 11% and average price per ad rose 9%. Free cash flow was about $8.6 billion, even as capital expenditures climbed to more than $17 billion. Adding to the growth story, this was an acceleration from an already strong Q1, when revenue grew 16% and earnings per share jumped 37%.
In addition to growing rapidly, the cash-rich company is shareholder-friendly. Meta is returning a lot of cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately $9.8 billion of its stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends. And the balance sheet ended the period with over $47 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, providing ample flexibility to keep investing in AI and returning capital.
Looking ahead: Where is Meta's stock price headed?
With so much momentum and such a strong business, shares are likely headed meaningfully higher over the next five years. But how much higher?
The investment debate centers on two moving pieces: earnings growth and the multiple the market will pay for those earnings. A practical five-year framework for forecasting Meta's stock price in 2030 is to start with trailing-12-month earnings per share of $27.62 and grow it 10% to 15% annually through 2030. That range bakes in robust ad demand and AI-driven product improvements, while acknowledging that heavy infrastructure outlays could cap margin expansion for a while. Using that range, 2030 earnings per share would land roughly between $45 and $56.
What multiple should those earnings command? If Meta sustains double-digit revenue growth, a mid-20s price-to-earnings ratio feels reasonable. Put a multiple of 24 to 26 on that earnings per share range, and you get a rough 2030 stock-price band of about $1,080 to $1,460 per share, with a midpoint around $1,270 using 12% annualized earnings-per-share growth and a price-to-earnings ratio of 25. Based on Meta's stock price at the time of this writing, that would imply compounded annual returns in the high single digits to low teens over the next five years. That's a forward-looking estimate, not a promise -- but it shows how modest assumptions can still produce attractive outcomes.
There are real risks. Management now expects 2025 capital expenditures of $66 billion to $72 billion and has cautioned that 2026 expense growth will likely run above 2025 as depreciation on new infrastructure ramps and technical hiring continues. That can pressure near-term operating margin. Further, regulatory overhangs are also non-trivial, including potential changes to ad experiences in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Finally, any macro slowdown that hits ad budgets would add volatility and potentially weigh on earnings and the stock price's potential.
Even so, the core story is intact: Meta's ads business keeps compounding, AI upgrades continue to improve relevance and advertiser performance, and the company is building what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls ""personal superintelligence."" If earnings per share compounds in the low-teens and the market remains willing to pay a mid-20s price-to-earnings multiple, Meta's long-term math works. The path won't be linear. But the destination looks compelling."

First off, on AI, and its evolving AI engagement tools. In recent weeks, Meta has been accused of allowing its AI chatbots to engage in inappropriate conversations with minors, and provide misleading medical information, as it seeks to maximize take-up of its chatbot tools.
An investigation by Reuters uncovered internal Meta documentation that would essentially allow for such interactions to occur, without intervention. Meta has confirmed that such guidance did exist within its documentation, but it has since updated rules to address these elements.
Though that’s not enough for at least one U.S. Senator, who’s called for Meta to ban the use of its AI chatbots by minors outright.
As reported by NBC News:
“Sen. Edward Markey said that [Meta] could have avoided the backlash if only it had listened to his warning two years ago. In September 2023, Markey wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg that allowing teens to use AI chatbots would ‘supercharge’ existing problems with social media and posed too many risks. He urged the company to pause the release of AI chatbots until it had an understanding of the impact on minors.”
Which, of course, is a concern that many have raised.
The biggest concern with the accelerated development of AI, and other interactive technologies, is that we don’t fully understand what the impacts of using them might be. And as we’ve seen with social media, which many jurisdictions are now trying to restrict to older teens, the impact of such on younger audiences can be significant, and it would be better to mitigate that harm ahead of time, as opposed to trying to address it retrospect.
But progress generally wins out in such considerations, and with U.S. tech companies pointing to the fact that China and Russia are also developing AI, U.S. authorities seem unlikely to implement any significant restrictions on AI development or use at this time.
Which also leads into another concern being leveled at Meta.
According to a new report from The Washington Post, Meta has repeatedly ignored and/or sought to supress reports of children being sexually propositioned within its VR environments, as it continues to expand its VR social experience.
The report suggests that Meta engaged in a concerted effort to bury such incidents, though Meta has responded by noting that it’s approved 180 different studies into youth safety and well-being in its next-level experiences.
It’s not the first time that concerns have been raised about the mental health impacts of VR, with the more immersive digital environment likely to have an even more significant impact on user perception than social apps.
Various Horizon VR users have reported incidents of sexual assault, even virtual rape, within the VR environment. In response, Meta has added new safety elements, like personal boundaries to restrict unwanted contact, though even with additional safety tools in place, it’s impossible for Meta to counter, or account for the full impacts of such at this stage.
And at the same time, Meta’s also reduced the age access limits of Horizon Worlds down to 13 years-old, then 10 last year.
That seems like a concern, right? That in between Meta being forced to implement new safety solutions to protect users, it’s also reducing the age barriers for access to the same.
Of course, Meta may well be conducting further safety studies, as it notes, and those could come back with further insights that will help to address safety concerns like this, ahead of a broader take-up of its VR tools. But there is a sense that Meta is willing to push ahead with its projects with progress as its guiding light, rather than safety. Which, again, is what we saw with social media initially.
Meta has been repeatedly hauled before Congress to answer questions about the safety of both Instagram and Facebook for teen users, and what it knows, or knew, about potential harms among younger audiences. Meta has long denied any direct links between social media usage and teen mental health, though various third-party reports have found clear connections on this front, which is what’s led to the latest efforts to stop young teens from accessing social apps.
But through it all, Meta’s remained steadfast in its approach, and in providing access to as many users as possible.
Which is what may be of most concern here, that Meta’s willing to ignore outside evidence if it could impede its own business growth.
So you either take Meta at its word, and trust that it is conducting safety experiments to ensure its projects don’t have a negative impact on teens, or you push for Meta to face tougher questioning, based on external studies and evidence to the contrary.
Meta maintains that it’s doing the work, but with so much on the line, it’s worth continuing to raise these questions."

First off, CapCut recently added a new LinkedIn integration, which enables CapCut users to export videos from CapCut to LinkedIn direct.
As you can see in these example screens, posted by social media expert Lindsay Gamble, CapCut’s composer now has a LinkedIn sharing button to facilitate easy posting, so you can easily transition your CapCut creations across to the professional social network.
As per LinkedIn:
“Now, after you create and edit a video in CapCut, you can share it to LinkedIn in just two taps: no more exporting hassle or extra steps to go through. And just like when you post a video directly on LinkedIn, content you share from CapCut that's related to our video trends will automatically become eligible to surface in those trends.”
As you can see in the second image above, videos posted on LinkedIn will display a “Made with CapCut” message above the caption, but as LinkedIn notes, using CapCut for video editing will have no impact on content ranking via the feed algorithm.
And with LinkedIn putting more focus on video content, that could be a valuable consideration. It could also make it easier to reuse your video creations across another platform, helping you get the most out of your content efforts.

As Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gears up for its highly anticipated iPhone 17 launch, industry analyst Daniel Newman has criticized the company for relying on predictable upgrades rather than delivering innovation.
Daniel Newman Says Apple Is ‘Better Than This'
On Sunday, Newman, CEO of Futurum Group, took to X, formerly Twitter, to vent his frustration with Apple ahead of the company's Sept. 9 event.
""The next ‘big $AAPL event' will be to launch a new iPhone 17 Air,"" he said, adding, ""I am no longer surprised by Apple's lack of innovation and ingenuity. But come on for crying out loud. You're better than this, Apple.""
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
His remarks come just days before Apple's ""Awe Dropping"" keynote at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California.
The event, which will be livestreamed on apple.com and through the Apple TV app, marks the company's first major showcase since June's Worldwide Developers Conference.
What To Expect From Apple's iPhone 17 Launch
Apple is expected to unveil multiple versions of the iPhone 17, including what could be its slimmest model yet—the iPhone 17 Air. Reports suggest the Air will replace the iPhone Plus model, following a broader industry trend toward thinner designs.
Other updates may include new colors such as purple and green, enhanced cameras and incremental design improvements. Pricing is expected to start at $800 for the base model, $1,050 for the Pro, and $1,250 for the Pro Max.
A foldable iPhone is rumored for 2026, but no announcement is expected this year. Apple is also set to reveal updates to the Apple Watch series and AirPods Pro 3.
While Apple's launch events typically drive consumer excitement, some Wall Street analysts caution that this year could turn into a ""sell-the-news"" moment if the upgrades are perceived as modest.
Previously, Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management argued that Apple's bar for AI innovation remains low but could rise sharply as Siri reportedly receives Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini integration in 2026.
Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has repeatedly labeled Apple's AI strategy a ""disaster,"" criticizing its reliance on partners rather than internal breakthroughs.
Balancing Legacy With Investor Expectations
With more than 2.4 billion iOS devices in circulation, Apple remains one of the most powerful players in consumer tech.
But Newman's criticism reflects growing impatience among analysts and investors who see rivals like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) racing ahead in artificial intelligence.
Apple is one of only two stocks in the Magnificent Seven, alongside Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), showing a negative year-to-date performance. Shares are down 1.71% YTD, though they have risen 8.50% over the past 12 months, according to Benzinga Pro.
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
American Hartford Gold
For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides asimple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets."

While layoffs at big tech giants like Meta and Amazon make headlines, many industries suffer the same fate behind closed doors. Public or private, the effects remain the same, and many older and younger generations alike are worried about job security.

Digital natives like Gen Zers tend to gravitate toward job opportunities in the digital landscape. Here are more details on the industries people are most worried about layoffs and whether or not they should be.
Quick Take: Layoffs in 2025
Layoff concerns for the rest of this year and rolling into 2026 tend to boil down to trends such as economic uncertainty, political volatility, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, shifting consumer behavior and over-hiring during booms.
Whether you are looking for a training program for a side gig or full-time job, you want to feel confident it will pay off in the long term, or at least for the next several years. Here are a few things to note:
-
It’s estimated that due to the current state of the job market, nearly one in three Americans would take a 10% to 20% pay cut to avoid being laid off, even though 13% of Americans have no savings and are unprepared financially for a layoff, according to Clarify Capital research.
-
Layoff anxiety in real time is growing everywhere, from social media platforms to community discussions.
-
Working in the federal government sector also feels precarious as changes under the Trump administration, DOGE and DEI dismantling have made employment in government agencies feel tumultuous at best.
-
While a lot of people are worried about layoffs, it tends to happen in some industries more than others. It’s important to reassess your skill set and develop transferable skills because they remain in demand through economic changes and downturns.
With all of this in mind, here are the top four industries where Gen Z workers are most concerned about layoffs right now.

Tech
The tech industry is one of the most commonly hit industries, and it’s understandable why people in these industries are worried, especially since many work remotely. Clarify Capital also reports that anxiety is most common among remote workers (47%), more than double that of in-office workers (20%)."

According to their claims, Meta changed its policies around researching sensitive topics — like politics, children, gender, race, and harassment — six weeks after whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that showed how Meta’s own research found that Instagram can damage teen girls’ mental health. These revelations, which were made public in 2021, kicked off years of hearings in Congress over child safety on the internet, an issue that remains a hot topic in global governments today.
As part of these policy changes, the report says, Meta proposed two ways that researchers could limit the risk of conducting sensitive research. One suggestion was to loop lawyers into their research, protecting their communications from “adverse parties” due to attorney-client privilege. Researchers could also write about their findings more vaguely, avoiding terms like “not compliant” or “illegal.”
Jason Sattizahn, a former Meta researcher specializing in virtual reality, told The Washington Post that his boss made him delete recordings of an interview in which a teen claimed that his 10-year-old brother had been sexually propositioned on Meta’s VR platform, Horizon Worlds.
“Global privacy regulations make clear that if information from minors under 13 years of age is collected without verifiable parental or guardian consent, it has to be deleted,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.
But the whistleblowers claim that the documents they submitted to Congress show a pattern of employees being discouraged from discussing and researching their concerns around how children under 13 were using Meta’s social virtual reality apps.
“These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative; in reality, since the start of 2022, Meta has approved nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well-being,” Meta told TechCrunch.
In a lawsuit filed in February, Kelly Stonelake — a former Meta employee of 15 years — raised similar concerns to these four whistleblowers. She told TechCrunch earlier this year that she led “go-to-market” strategies to bring Horizon Worlds to teenagers, international markets, and mobile users, but she felt that the app did not have adequate ways to keep out users under 13; she also flagged that the app had persistent issues with racism.
“The leadership team was aware that in one test, it took an average of 34 seconds of entering the platform before users with Black avatars were called racial slurs, including the ‘N-word’ and ‘monkey,’” the suit alleges."

AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.48 billion daily users.
AI push is helping Meta Platforms offer content that is interesting and useful, eventually driving engagement. Improvement in content quality, driven by META’s recommendation system, has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram in the second quarter of 2025. Video engagement improved with Instagram video time jumping more than 20% year-over-year globally. Video time spent on Facebook surged more than 20% year over year. The launch of AI video editing tools across Meta AI and the new Edits app are noteworthy developments.
However, does improving engagement boost META stock’s appeal to investors? Let’s find out.
New Safety Features and Tools to Drive Up META’s Prospects
META is frequently introducing new features across its platforms to drive more conversation and user engagement. For instance, Threads users can now attach up to 10,000 characters of text to a post and any text so attached can be read directly in the app. Users can share a link to content from other platforms in the body of the main post, giving more options for conversations. In July, the company added a feature that allows users (ages 18 and older) to send DMs (between Threads followers or mutual followers from Instagram) directly in the app. META also introduced the Threads highlighter, which brings to focus the trending topics.
For Instagram, META has launched several new features and tools like repost, interactive map and Friends tab in Reels. The repost option helps Instagram users share reels and posts, which will appear in friends’ feeds and a dedicated repost tab on profiles. The interactive map allows friends to share locations and explore posts, reels and stories tagged to places. The Friends tab in Reels makes it easy to see what content friends are enjoying.
Apart from new tools and features, Meta Platforms has been focusing on improving security across its platforms. META has introduced features and new anti-scam tools in WhatsApp to combat scammers. Safety features now allow WhatsApp users to review details, leave quietly, or mute notifications when a new contact adds the user to an unknown group. For individual WhatsApp chats, Meta Platforms is testing warnings when users message someone outside their contacts.
For Facebook, the company launched passkeys on Facebook for mobile devices, which now allows users to verify their identity and log in to their account more securely compared with traditional passwords. Introduction of Teen Accounts has been a key catalyst boosting security on Instagram. META has expanded Teen Accounts to Facebook and Messenger platforms.
META’s initiative to boost user engagement and safety measures is expected to drive up the user base, aiding advertising revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2025 advertising is pegged at $48.44 billion, indicating more than 21% growth over the figure reported in the year-ago quarter."

- Nasdaq's proposal comes as interest in tokenization of assets surges throughout the financial services world.
- The exchange said that it believes tokenization can provide the same benefits and protections as traditional systems.
- Nasdaq lists technology giants like Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Google.
Nasdaq has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a rule change that would allow the stock exchange to record stocks in tokenized form, according to a filing Monday, as momentum for tokenizing assets grows.
The exchange, which lists Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, and other tech giants, would give customers the option of trading securities via traditional digital representation of ownership with or without blockchain backing.
""A participant that wishes for its order to clear and settle in tokenized form shall notate its preference upon entry of the order in the system by selecting a flag that the exchange designates for this purpose, in accordance with the exchange’s procedures,"" Nasdaq said in its filing. ""When a participant enters an order with the tokenization flag selected, the exchange will communicate the participant’s clearance and settlement instruction to The Depository Trust Company.""
Nasdaq's proposal adds to the fervor for tokenization among both traditional finance and digital asset-focused firms. In June, Robinhood rolled out trading for European users of U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds as tokens on Arbitrum, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network.
In May, crypto exchange Kraken announced its own tokenization plans through a partnership with Backed, using the Solana blockchain. The offering would cover more than 50 U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds.
""Over time, U.S. equity markets have thrived while absorbing successive waves of technological innovations,"" Nasdaq said in its filing, adding: ""The existing regulatory structure mandated by Congress applies to tokenized securities, regardless of whether such securities have certain unique properties (like the ability to be settled on a blockchain), much like it did when the SEC allowed securities to be decimalized and electronified and when exchange traded funds and other novel securities were approved decades ago.""
""The exchange believes the markets can use tokenization while continuing to provide the benefits and protections of the national market system,"" it added.
Crypto exchanges Binance and now-defunct FTX dabbled in tokenized stock trading during the pandemic-era crypto boom, but the umbrella term faded into obscurity amid regulatory heat until BlackRock CEO Larry Fink touted tokenization as “the next generation for markets” in 2022.
In its second quarter conference call in July, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev referenced tokenization nearly a dozen times. Tenev described tokenization as “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade,” during the call."

Fewer graduates are finding a foothold in the tech sector, with new data showing Gen Z’s share of jobs collapsing as firms prioritize efficiency
Mathisworks/Getty Images
The share of young workers at major tech firms has fallen sharply over the past two-and-a-half years, according to new data from compensation platform Pave.
Suggested Reading
At large, public tech companies, employees between the ages of 21 and 25 made up 15.0% of the workforce in January 2023. By July 2025, that number had dropped to 6.7%. At private firms, the decline was smaller, from 9.3% to 6.7% over the same period.
Matt Schulman, chief executive of Pave, said the trend highlights the challenges facing new grads. “Recent college graduates are struggling to find jobs, especially at public technology companies,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post.
Schulman, who is a former software engineer at Facebook, before it changed its name to Meta, said AI is reshaping the early-career job market. “AI tooling is disrupting many entry-level roles that have traditionally been attractive entry points into the tech labor force for new grads.""
As younger employees leave the sector, the average age of the workforce is climbing. At public tech firms, it increased to 39.4 years in July 2025, up from 34.3 years in January 2023. At private firms, it rose to 36.6 years from 35.1 years.
Schulman asked, “Is the shift in the labor force towards older, more experienced employees a temporary economic adjustment, or a permanent shift in how tech companies build their workforce?”
The data follows hot on the heels of a Stanford University study that found employment among 22- to 25-year-olds in the most AI-exposed jobs, such as software engineering and customer service, has dropped 13% since late 2022.
That research, based on payroll data from millions of workers, suggests that generative AI is displacing entry-level employees even as older workers in the same roles hold steady or see gains.
The findings add hard data to a growing sense of anxiety among Gen Z. Goldman Sachs recently calculated that the value of college degrees is quickly diminishing, while Bank of America Global research has said that the unemployment rate for recent graduates has started to exceed the overall rate for the first time in years.
Schulman also pointed to difficulties for business school graduates, adding that 15% of Harvard Business School grads in 2024 were without a job offer three months after leaving college, way up from 4% in 2021.
The trend “likely reflects the same economic pressures affecting new grads: companies prioritizing experienced hires during uncertain times and focusing on ‘efficient growth.’”
Pave bases its data on about 8,200 companies with age demographic information participating in its real-time compensation database."

Connecting the world through its various social media platforms has clearly worked out well. As of June 30, Meta has a whopping 3.48 billion daily active users among its various platforms.
That kind of growth also means it's no surprise that an investment in this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has worked out extremely well for investors, a trend that holds up even in recent times. If you'd invested $10,000 in Meta Platforms five years ago, here's how much you'd have today.
Crushing the market
In the past five years, the S&P 500 has generated a total return of 104%. That's nothing to scoff at. But Meta has been a significant outperformer. Its shares have produced a total return of 168% since early September 2020. A $10,000 starting sum would be worth $26,760 today.
This hasn't been a smooth ride, though. Even though it's an established company, Meta's stock still sees lots of volatility in its price. For instance, shares tanked 64% in 2022 due to a slowdown in the ad market and higher spending.
Strong fundamentals
Between Q2 2020 and Q2 2025, Meta's revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared by 154% and 297%, respectively. Impressive fundamental gains like this, supported by a constantly expanding user base, have driven shares higher.
You might think that this performance is coming to an end, but this is a flawed outlook. Meta stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.5. This looks attractive given the ongoing success of the business. Shares are poised to continue beating the market in the years ahead."

Longriver Investment Partners released its Q2 2025 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Nvidia’s NVLink, its high-bandwidth interconnect, underpins training at scale, where GPUs must coordinate across racks. NVLink Fusion, announced this year, may extend that advantage by letting custom chips plug into Nvidia’s system rather than replace it.

“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, which enables computers to mimic human-like intelligence for problem solving and decision making capabilities. Founded in 1993 to develop faster and more-realistic graphics for PC-based video games, Nvidia created the first graphics processing unit (GPU), a dedicated semiconductor that employs a proprietary parallel processing architecture to perform superior graphics rendering outside of a computer’s standard central processing unit (CPU). The parallel processing capability of Nvidia’s GPUs, which contrasts with the linear processing requirement of CPUs, can accelerate computing functions performed by standard CPUs by greater than ten times. As a result, Nvidia extended its visual computing expertise beyond its legacy gaming market into innovative new and larger markets, including data centers, autos, and professional visualization. The parallel processing capability facilitates pattern recognition and machine learning functions that have enabled Nvidia to be at the forefront of growth in artificial intelligence applications. As a result, the data center business, which first surpassed the gaming business to become Nvidia’s largest revenue and profit generator in its 2023 fiscal year, grew to represent over 88% of revenue in the company’s most recent fiscal year. The company is also focused on building out its GPU-computing-based ecosystem and is helping to enable breakthroughs in autonomous driving, and virtual reality."

If you've ever had a neighbor fire up a leaf blower before sunrise, you'll understand the vibe in Crescent Park in Palo Alto, California. Except in this case, the neighbor is Mark Zuckerberg, and instead of one house and a weed whacker, it's 11 homes, a 7,000-square-foot underground lair, and nearly a decade of construction chaos.
According to The New York Times, the Meta CEO and Facebook co-founder has quietly assembled a private compound in Palo Alto—buying up at least 11 properties over the past 14 years and, in the process, transforming what was once a peaceful neighborhood of Stanford professors and tech execs into a noisy, semi-permanent construction zone.

And to help make peace? The Times reports that Zuckerberg's team handed out noise-canceling headphones to nearby residents—along with Krispy Kreme doughnuts and sparkling wine—during some of the louder phases of his compound's never-ending makeover.
""Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade,"" a spokesperson told Fortune, referring to Zuckerberg's wife. ""They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.""
But some neighbors aren't exactly feeling the love. They describe blocked streets, constant surveillance cameras pointed toward their homes, and private security patrols circling the area. The real kicker? Some of the houses Zuckerberg bought remain completely empty—despite the Bay Area's brutal housing shortage.

Other properties now host a pickleball court, hydrofloor swimming pool, manicured gardens, and reportedly a private school that briefly operated for Zuckerberg's kids and a few others. That last bit seems to skirt local zoning rules, The Times notes.
And it's not just above ground. Beneath Zuckerberg's main residence, contractors dug out a 7,000-square-foot space dubbed a ""basement,"" though neighbors describe it as a bunker—or, as The Times put it, ""a billionaire's bat cave."" He did something similar at his 2,300-acre estate in Kauai, Hawaii, adding a massive underground shelter that, according to his spokesperson, is not a ""doomsday bunker."""

- CEO Patrick Collison said the blockchain will improve onchain financial services.
- But a team member behind Facebook’s failed Libra project isn’t bullish.
US fintech giant Stripe is pitching its new blockchain, Tempo, as a revolution in global payments.
Christian Catalini, one of the original architects of Meta’s failed stablecoin project Libra, says the project is destined to collapse under the same structural flaw.
“Stripe’s pitch is a classic: all-star team, top-tier partners, and neutrality,” Catalini said in a lengthy analysis on X. “The price for this bargain? Handing the fintech giant the keys to global payments.”
Stripe is not the only big business to venture down the path of launching a layer 1. In late August, Google announced plans to roll out GCUL, its own centralised blockchain to “create innovative payments services and financial markets products.”
These initiatives come amidst a growing stablecoin boom bolstered by US lawmakers having clubbed through the Genius Act, a stablecoin law, which has incentivised institutional players to tap into digital assets.
Libra deja vu
Catalini has lived this movie before.
In 2019, before Facebook launched its parent company Meta, Mark Zuckerberg and a consortium of tech and finance heavyweights announced Libra, a global stablecoin project. The project was later renamed as Diem.
It promised to usher in financial services to billions. But lawmakers and regulators quickly balked at the idea of handing monetary power to Silicon Valley.
“We weren’t just early; we were comically, spectacularly wrong,” Catalini said. “We had a bad case of Silicon Valley hubris — the belief that elegant code can simply wish away centuries of financial regulation.”
Even after Meta recruited veteran regulator Stuart Levey and won near-approval from Swiss watchdog FINMA, Libra was killed once global lawmakers rallied against it.
The license “was physically sitting on the desk of FINMA’s president, waiting for a signature. And then [former Federal Reserve Chair] Janet Yellen entered the chat,” Catalini said.
The mistake, he argues, wasn’t regulatory overreach but the network’s centralised design.
Enter Stripe
On September 4, Stripe announced plans to roll out Tempo together with Paradigm.
Anthropic, Coupang, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Lead Bank, Mercury, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered, and Visa were also named as initial design partners by Patrick Collison, Stripe’s CEO.
He argued that existing blockchains weren’t up to the task of tackling the building wave of stablecoins. The new layer 1 would be optimised for high-scale and real-world financial applications, Collison said.
“We hope that Tempo makes it easier for things like payment acceptance, global payouts, remittances, microtransactions, tokenised deposits, agentic payments, and more, to move onchain,” Collison said on X.
What’s at stake
Catalini doesn’t seem to share that optimism.
“The only thing that truly separates crypto from the systems it aims to replace is that it’s permissionless. Full stop,” he said.
That’s why he says Stripe’s Tempo is fatally compromised from the start.
“The problem with corporate chains like Tempo isn’t a matter of code — it’s a matter of incentives. Once they have a captive market, the temptation to tilt the playing field becomes irresistible,” he wrote.
If Stripe and other fintechs succeed in building walled-garden blockchains, the result won’t be financial innovation, but a reshuffling of corporate monopolies, he argued.
“We would simply swap an old monarchy of card networks and financial incumbents for a new one of fintech giants,” he said.
Meta’s bruising experience shows how entrenched financial and political systems react when tech companies attempt to centralise monetary power. Stripe, Catalini argues, is likely to trigger the same immune response.
“Open, permissionless networks are the only way forward. Anything else is doomed to fail,” he said.
Stripe didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

She had left her college job and traveled with a friend through Zimbabwe, witnessing firsthand the consequences of hyperinflation. When she returned, she became enamored with the idea of crypto as a potential salve.
Aside from investing the contents of her bank account, Simpson started a blockchain lunch meetup at her next post, Facebook. She wrote a blog post on multisignature wallets that landed her a job at the infrastructure startup BitGo, where she became the third employee. (More than 10 years later, BitGo is set to go public, though Simpson sadly left before her shares vested.)
Instead of sticking it out in the early crypto startup trenches, Simpson moved into venture, first working at a friend’s generalist firm before starting her own crypto fund, Autonomous Partners, which raised from Brian Armstrong, David Sacks’ Craft Ventures, and Steve Cohen’s family office. This was 2017, when crypto was beginning to explode into the mainstream, and Simpson invested in companies like Talos and Mythical Games. Through Armstrong, she also met Katie Haun, a Department of Justice prosecutor-turned-a16z investor, who convinced Simpson to come on board.
Simpson joined a16z crypto as a deal partner in 2020. She liked that the firm had stayed in blockchain during the quiet times, which isn’t the case for many of the larger venture operations (even today, blue-chip names like Accel and Bessemer have mostly stayed away since the 2022 collapse). “I had a lot of respect and appreciation for the fact that the firm, despite being like an institution, had taken this category seriously,” Simpson says.
It turned out to be a prudent decision. Simpson came on right at the start of the boom years, which included a16z crypto’s landmark $2.2 billion third fund in 2021 and $4.5 billion fourth fund in 2022. And amid power players like Chris Dixon and Haun, she made a name for herself investing early in companies like Blackbird, the dining rewards startup created by Resy cofounder Ben Leventhal, and Phantom, the crypto wallet recently valued at $3 billion.
Now a general partner, Simpson’s approach has been to target founders, rather than just thematic areas, understanding that the best builders will be drawn to the most promising technology at the moment, whether it’s stablecoins or the intersection of crypto and AI. “It’s more about following the trends of entrepreneurs than it is unilaterally trying to decide what’s interesting,” she says. “As an investor, your job is to shift your attention to find it.”"

It has a huge market capitalization of $1.9 trillion. And between the company's various social media platforms, it has a whopping 3.48 billion daily active users.
This ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has soared 367% in the past three years (as of Sept. 4). Strong financial performance is, unsurprisingly, the key contributor to this gain. However, I believe there's one important reason why Wall Street is so obsessed with Meta Platforms.
Improving profitability
In 2022, Meta registered an operating margin of 25%, down from 40% the year before. The ad market experienced a slowdown in the face of rapidly rising interest rates. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was also focused on making heavy investments to support his metaverse ambitions.
Things have changed for the better, though. In the latest quarter (Q2 2025, ended June 30), Meta reported a stellar operating margin of 43%. Revenue has continued to increase at a robust double-digit pace. And the business has prioritized operational efficiencies with a number of layoffs in recent years.
Looking ahead
I believe this drastic improvement in the company's operating margin is a top reason why the investment community has fallen in love with Meta Platforms. Seeing the bottom line expand like this can certainly drive bullish fever, regardless of industry. Wall Street appreciates a fatter bottom line.
It's easy to remain optimistic as we look toward the future. These days, Meta is investing aggressively in artificial intelligence. But consensus analyst estimates call for operating income to grow at a compound annual rate of 13% between 2024 and 2027. This outlook could prove to be conservative, as the business has positively surprised investors in the past."

Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Astera Labs (ALAB) is a fabless semiconductor company that develops “purpose-built connectivity solutions for rack-scale AI and cloud infrastructure. In other words, they build the “nervous system” that allows powerful components in an AI server, like GPUs, CPUs, and memory, to communicate with each other effectively. ALAB operates a fabless business model, which means they focus on the design of the chip and software but outsource manufacturing to third-party chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).
ALAB: Providing A Solution to AI Scalability
As investors have learned over the past few years, the demand for AI models and the components that ‘train them’ has grown exponentially. AI capital expenditure (CAPEX) spending among major tech companies like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL) is expected to be in the $400 billion range for full-year 2025 as big tech juggernauts race to keep up with soaring demand for AI compute power. However, as data center size and complexity have exploded, these companies must move beyond single-server architecture. This is where ALAB comes in. Astera Labs technology is the new industry standard. The technology allows “rack-scale” AI, where multiple servers can act in concert, alleviating data transfer bottlenecks and producing rapid, efficient, and reliable connectivity.
ALAB Earnings are Exploding
The aforementioned growing speed requirements and system complexities of AI and cloud infrastructure bode well for Astera Labs. ALAB’s recent earnings history illustrates that the company has already emerged as a leader in next-generation data center connectivity. In fact, ALAB has beat Zacks Consensus EPS Estimates for four straight quarters, with a juicy beat margin of 32.2%.

Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts believe that ALAB’s products will continue to be in high demand well into the future. Several analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research have upped estimates over the past two months, and these analysts expect the company to grow full-year EPS by a robust 88.10% in 2025 and 24.14% in 2026.

ALAB’s price and volume action are jiving with its robust fundamental picture. ALAB shares bolted ~29% in early August after the company smashed Wall Street expectations. Additionally, volume increased 220% for the session, signaling heavy demand. Since then, ALAB shares have held gains, signaling that bulls are unwilling to part with shares."

As you can see in this example, much like Meta’s “Imagine Yourself” AI option, or YouTube’s “Dream Screen,” or TikTok’s “AI Self” process, or even Snapchat’s own “Dreams” AI option, Snapchat’s new Imagine option will give you another way to use AI to re-contextualize your selfies, and/or other images.
As explained by Snap:
“Today we’re introducing the Imagine Lens, our first Open Prompt Image Generation Lens. With the Imagine Lens, Snapchatters can create, edit, and recreate Snaps simply by entering their own prompts, then seamlessly share them with friends, post to their Story, or outside of Snapchat.”
So it’s different from Snap’s Dreams Lens, which it launched back in 2023, in that this process enables you to enter in a description for your AI generation. Dreams comes up with alternative scenarios for your image, but you don’t have the capacity to enter them yourself.
So it’s a new (for Snap) generative AI process, that will enable Snapchat users to reimagine themselves in totally different contexts.
Why? I don’t know, but social media apps seem convinced that people really want to create images of themselves as astronauts, or cowboys, or whatever else, even in an app like Snap, which is more focused on direct interaction with friends.
Like, I get it from a novelty perspective, in creating crazy images of yourself from some alternative universe. But they're not actually real, these are not actual, real depictions of things that you’ve personally done or experienced, and as such, it seems like a less relevant, less social option in many respects.
The usage data will bear this out either way, but creating fake, AI-generated images of yourself seems like such a minor interest, a lesser function of “social” tools, which enable us to share our perspective on the human experience.
These images are not human, nor are they sharing your perspective. So why do it?
Then again, because this is an open prompt option, enabling you to do anything you like, there are some more social things that you can do with it, like trying out a new hairstyle, or a Halloween outfit (kind of):
So it’s not like this is all ridiculous, crazy, reimagined scenarios that don’t, and can’t exist, and maybe that's a better focus for this tool, as opposed to wholly re-creating your selfies.
Within that, there could be some expanded value to the customization available here.
Either way, another option to consider for your Snap usage.
Snapchat says that the feature is currently only available to Lens+ and Snapchat+ Platinum subscribers.
You can try the Imagine Lens for yourself here."

What if Mark Zuckerberg woke up one day and decided to split his wealth with every American? Would you finally pay off your student loans, buy a Tesla or… just get lunch?
Find Out: How Far $750K Plus Social Security Goes in Retirement in Every US Region
Let’s do the math and find out.
What Is Zuckerberg’s Net Worth?
For those who didn’t know, Zuckerberg is the co-founder and CEO of Meta Platforms, the tech company behind Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp.
As of September 2025, Zuckerberg’s net worth is estimated at $257.2 billion, per Forbes. That’s billion with a B, enough to buy every NFL team and still have change left over. You could live comfortably for several lifetimes and still not make a dent in his net worth.
But most of Zuckerberg’s money isn’t sitting in a checking account or a giant vault filled with cash. Instead, it’s tied up in assets, primarily Meta Platforms. Much of his wealth comes from owning a massive amount of Meta stock, which means his fortune is directly linked to the company’s market value.
This is where the term “net worth” can be a little misleading. Net worth refers to the total value of everything a person owns, including stocks, real estate, business interests and other investments, minus what they owe. So while Zuckerberg is worth over $200 billion on paper, he doesn’t have that much sitting around in cash.
In other words, that money is mostly in stock, not cash that he can Venmo to you. So giving it away would involve selling a massive chunk of shares and possibly crashing the company’s value in the process.
Check Out: If Bezos’ Wealth Was Evenly Distributed Across the US, How Much Would We Get?
How Much Would You Get?
According to Worldometer, as of September 2025, the U.S. population is around 347,613,848. So if Zuckerberg split his $257.2 billion evenly across that entire group, every American would get around $740. And if he gave it to only adults (about 78% of the population, according to the Census), the payout would rise to almost $950 per person.
Not bad. It won’t change your life, but it could definitely change your weekend.
What Can $740 Buy You in 2025?
You could:
-
Get a new smartphone
-
Knock out a month of rent (if you have roommates… and live somewhere affordable)
-
Buy a plane ticket for a mini-vacation
-
Stock your fridge for a few weeks
-
Cover your streaming services for a year and still have money left over.
Could This Actually Happen?
Short answer: No way.

“Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI — or something else,” French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris in February 2025.
In a significant step up from its June 2024 valuation of $6 billion, Mistral is now valued at €11.7 billion (approximately $13.8 billion) following a Series C funding round led by Dutch semiconductor company ASML, which invested €1.3 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) in September, alongside signing a new strategic partnership with the AI company.
ASML’s interest in having its clients benefit from its collaboration is an important milestone for Mistral. While the French company describes itself as “the world’s greenest and leading independent AI lab,” it is still not as well known as its biggest competitors.
What is Mistral AI?
Mistral AI, which offers some open source AI models, has raised significant funding since its creation in 2023, with the ambition to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” While this isn’t a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company’s openness versus OpenAI’s more recent, closed source take at developing AI models.
Mistral’s chatbot Le Chat is available on iOS and Android, reaching 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release and grabbing France’s top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.
In July 2025, Mistral AI updated Le Chat with new features that bring it closer to rival full-stack AI chatbots: a new “deep research” mode, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing. This update also added Projects, which lets users group chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces.
As of September 2025, Le Chat can remember previous conversations thanks to a feature called Memories.
This is in addition to Mistral AI’s suite of models:
In March 2025, the company introduced Mistral OCR, an optical character-recognition API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.
In June 2025, Mistral AI also released a vibe-coding client, Mistral Code, to compete with Windsurf, Anysphere’s Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.
Who are Mistral AI’s founders?
Mistral AI’s three founders share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies that have operations in Paris. Its CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google’s DeepMind; CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers."

-
Gen Z was once promised that getting a job at a huge technology company like Meta, Microsoft, or Salesforce guaranteed six-figure success. But thanks to AI automation, they’re actively being boxed out of the industry, with the proportion of workers aged 21 to 25 being slashed in half at these massive public businesses. Plus, the average age of an employee at a tech company is rising. Experts tell Fortune this change may stifle innovation in the long-term—and there are still ways a Gen Z worker can get their foot in the door.
Gen Z are digital natives raised in the era of YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram, and Facebook; and now, they’re some of the strongest AI users in their personal and professional lives. But Silicon Valley tech companies looking to make waves with AI aren’t holding onto the digitally savvy generation—instead, they’re actively boxing them out.
The percentage of young Gen Z employees between the ages of 21 and 25 has been cut in half at technology companies over the past two years, according to recent data from compensation management software business Pave with workforce data from more than 8,300 companies. These young workers accounted for 15% of the workforce at large public tech firms in January 2023. By August 2025, they only represented 6.8%. The situation isn’t pretty at big private tech companies, either—during that same time period, the proportion of early-career Gen Z employees dwindled from 9.3% to 6.8%.
Meanwhile, the average age of a worker at a tech company has risen dramatically over those two and a half years. Between January 2023 and July 2025, the average age of all employees at large public technology businesses rose from 34.3 years to 39.4 years—more than a five year difference. On the private side, the change was less drastic, with the typical age only increasing from 35.1 to 36.6 years old.
Millennials are currently ruling the tech industry and clinging to their roles as the economy is rocked by uncertainty due to tariffs, inflation increases living expenses, and AI swipes jobs. Meanwhile, entry-level Gen Zers are just hoping to get their careers off the ground.
“If you’re 35 or 40 years old, you’re pretty established in your career, you have skills that you know cannot yet be disrupted by AI,” Matt Schulman, founder and CEO of Pave, tells Fortune. “There’s still a lot of human judgment when you’re operating at the more senior level…If you’re a 22-year-old that used to be an Excel junkie or something, then that can be disrupted. So it’s almost a tale of two cities.”
Schulman points to a few reasons why tech company workforces are getting older and locking Gen Z out of jobs. One is that big companies—like Salesforce, Meta, and Microsoft—are becoming a lot more efficient thanks to the advent of AI. And despite their soaring trillion-dollar profits, they’re cutting employees at the bottom rungs in favor of automation. Entry-level jobs have also dwindled because of AI agents, and stalling promotions across many agencies looking to do more with less. Once technology companies weed out junior roles, occupied by Gen Zers, their workforces are bound to rise in age. And experts tell Fortune that spells a lot of trouble for innovation and long-term business stability."

- Inflation data for August comes ahead of a key interest rate decision later this month.
- Apple is expected to unveil its iPhone 17 at an event this week. Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft are among the companies presenting at a major technology investment conference.
- Financial reports from Oracle and GameStop highlight the corporate earnings calendar.
August inflation data, updates from top tech firms, and earnings from the original meme stock darling are among the events that could move markets this week.
The first look at August inflation—the Consumer Price Index—will show how price pressures are impacting the economy with Federal Reserve officials under pressure to cut interest rates later this month. Investors focused on jobs data to finish last week, during which the S&P 500 and Nasdaq managed gains while the Dow slipped.
Apple is expected to unveil several new iPhone models, while Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Meta are among the tech firms set t will deliver presentations at an influential investor conference. Oracle’s quarterly report comes as the cloud provider has closed several big deals, while Adobe’s update will provide a look at AI demand. GameStop’s earnings will show whether momentum remains behind the original meme stock.
Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing.
August Inflation Data Comes as Fed Eyes Rate Move
The Thursday release of the Consumer Price Index will show whether price pressures continued to hover around current levels in August. The same inflation report showed that prices rose less than expected in July.
Federal Reserve officials are broadly expected to make their first interest rate cut of the year after recent jobs data has shown weakening in the labor market—and even as inflation continues to impact the economy. The CPI report will be the last major piece of inflation data before the Fed announces its interest rate decision on Sept. 17.
Apple to Unveil New iPhone; Updates from Nvidia, Oracle, GameStop Due
Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone 17 at its event on Tuesday, where other models of the phone are likely to be unveiled, including a thin version called the “Air,” along with other “Pro” models.
Several top tech firms will deliver presentations at the annual Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, where investors will hear from Nvidia on Monday, Meta and Broadcom on Tuesday, and Microsoft on Wednesday. Oracle’s earnings report on Tuesday comes as CEO Safra Catz has highlighted the “strong start” to the fiscal year for the tech giant. Graphic software maker Adobe boosted its full-year outlook after its prior earnings report came in better than expected, but investors were looking to see more from the company’s AI offerings.
GameStop’s Tuesday report follows a disappointing quarter for the meme stock after it reported a 17% drop in revenue and announced plans to raise new funding.

The social media giant, which owns Facebook, is exploring options for a bricks-and-mortar location to permanently showcase its futuristic products, with London’s Oxford Street the most likely destination, property sources said.
In recent weeks Mr Zuckerberg’s group has hired property agents to assist with the search, while Meta Labs, one of its subsidiaries, recently registered a trademark that will allow it to sell and demonstrate “virtual reality, mixed reality and augmented reality hardware and software” to shoppers in Britain.
The move is designed to help Meta boost take-up of its artificial intelligence-powered accessories, such as its Meta Quest headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses.
Although the search is thought to be at a very early stage, opening a physical store where shoppers can try on headsets and glasses is likely to be pivotal to Meta’s attempt to encourage users to embrace the emerging technology.
Meta’s development and plans
Since it was founded in 2004, the company has been a software company, with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp its three main divisions. But in recent years, it has pushed into hardware, competing with companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) as well as Asian giants like Samsung (005930.KS).
Meta has been opening pop-up stores in the US under its Meta Labs brand, including Ray-Ban pop-ups in Los Angeles. The company’s smart glasses, produced in conjunction with Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica (EL.PA), have seen sales triple in the past year as more users get to experience the technology.
Mr Zuckerberg has poured billions into its Reality Labs business, despite the company’s early attempts to create virtual worlds in the so-called metaverse failing to catch on.
Last year, it unveiled an advanced pair of augmented reality glasses that can project digital objects such as computer screens and video games into a wearer’s field of view.
Meta’s move into bricks-and-mortar mirrors similar moves by its tech rivals. Apple has a worldwide chain of stores, while Microsoft also had a flagship store on Oxford Street before closing it earlier this year.
Mr Zuckerberg recently said that AI-enabled glasses will be so ubiquitous in the future that people without them will struggle to keep up.
“In the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI, or some way to interact with AI, I think you’re probably [going to] be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people,” he told investors.
Meta was contacted for comment."

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended the White House event. Zuckerberg’s troubles with Trump ahead of the first Trump administration were resolved rather quickly during the President’s second campaign. Cramer discussed how Trump might point out Zuckerberg’s flattery and ask him to build AI factories in the US:
“But these other people, these are the people that are the, it’s the Magnificent 6 down there. We’ve got the powerhouses that have all committed to doing more. I’d like to see if everyone’s going to make commitments like the way Tim Cook has. Who has put up, you know, the $600 billion over the four years. It’s incredible. I think this is, you know this is kind of what the administration [inaudible] initially was telling me. Which is that, it won’t be like Biden, who would never have these people. It’s going to be the opposite. These are the people who know more, and we’re going to have them in. Obviously the President’s talking about, the administration’s talking about how they don’t think that the lawsuit was too much of a victory for the government. Remember this is the lawsuit for Meta against Google and that they’re not happy with it.

As these headlines made the rounds, Meta’s stock price responded with a modest bump over the past week, building on momentum that has steadily climbed throughout the year. Over the past year, shares have surged 51%, outpacing much of the broader tech landscape. Gains this year suggest confidence is holding steady. Behind these moves is a string of news including strategic AI alliances and consistent financial growth, feeding a narrative that Meta is well-positioned both for near-term performance and longer-term opportunities.
But the core question for investors right now is whether Meta’s current valuation still holds room for upside, or if much of its anticipated growth is already priced in at these levels?
Most Popular Narrative: 39.8% Overvalued
According to StjepanK, Meta Platforms appears overvalued by nearly 40% when comparing its current price to projected fair value. This perspective is grounded in detailed forecasts of the company's future revenue growth, margins, and business diversification.
""Going forward, I believe Meta will reduce its dependency on Family of Apps (FoA) segments by significantly growing its Reality Labs revenues. Fuelled by the fast market development and new products, I expect Reality Labs to become profitable by the second half of 2026 when revenues outpace significant CAPEX investments. This would lay a path for Zuckerberg's target of 1 billion people in the metaverse. However, I expect further diversification within the FoA segment, as I believe its Thread app, which is a direct Twitter competitor, can achieve a successful launch through synergies with its other app to siphon away at least 20% of Twitter’s market share, worth at least $600m per year.""
Curious about what’s driving this bold overvaluation call? The secret is in the ambitious targets for new product lines, future profit margins, and a massive diversification push. One key projection could completely transform how Meta makes money and might surprise even longtime investors. Which financial assumptions really back up this striking valuation? The full narrative reveals insights that could reshape your view on Meta's true worth."

Starting to be seen as a very credible challenger to other dominant AI chip leaders, Broadcom’s Q3 report caused a slight selloff in Nvidia NVDA and AMD's AMD stock.
Outperforming the broader indexes and these AI chip peers, Broadcom stock is now up more than +40% in 2025, and investors may be wondering if they should buy into the post-earnings spike in AVGO.

Broadcom’s Strong Q3 Results
Riding high on the AI wave, Broadcom reported record Q3 sales of $15.95 billion, which increased 22% from $13.07 billion in the comparative quarter and topped estimates of $15.82 billion. This was driven by AI semiconductor revenue, which climbed 63% year over year to $5.2 billion. Notably, VMware contributed $6.8 billion, with Broadcom’s acquisition of the virtualization software company continuing to pay off.
On the bottom line, Broadcom’s Q3 earnings increased 36% to $1.69 per share from EPS of $1.24 a year ago and topped expectations of $1.66. Additionally, Broadcom highlighted that its Q3 adjusted EBITDA spiked 30% to $10.7 billion, with free cash flow soaring 47% to $7 billion.

Broadcom’s XPU Chips
Leading Broadcom’s advancement in AI has been its custom XPU chips that are designed to meet the specific needs of consumer AI companies and go beyond traditional CPUs and GPUs to handle high-performance computing (HPC) workloads with extreme efficiency.
Furthermore, Broadcom’s XPU chips are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), tailored to the unique needs of each client’s AI infrastructure. Adding fuel to the post-earnings rally in Broadcom stock, the company stated it secured $10 billion in XPU orders from a new customer, which is thought to have been ChatGPT creator OpenAI. This AI hyperscale client has extended Broadcom’s reach outside of major players like Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL.
Broadcom’s Optimistic Q4 Guidance
Raising its fourth quarter revenue guidance due to robust demand for custom AI accelerators, Broadcom now expects Q4 sales to increase 24% to $17.4 billion, coming in above the current Zacks Consensus of $16.96 billion (Current Qtr below). More intriguing, Broadcom forecasts Q4 AI revenue to grow to $6.2 billion, which would mark 11 consecutive quarters of growth.

Here's What Investors Should Know.,The potential for Meta's artificial intelligence (AI) wager goes beyond its core business.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=59b00bd5c6d86c13ab9c9f5bfef4e50302fa75485cb93993723440ed99e8da37,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/05/meta-platforms-keeps-on-upping-the-ai-ante/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/05/meta-platforms-keeps-on-upping-the-ai-ante/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/05/meta-platforms-keeps-on-upping-the-ai-ante/,fool.com,200,,"Briefly last month, it seemed like Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) was starting to ""play it safe"" with its big wager on generative AI. On Aug. 20, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Facebook parent was putting a freeze on its AI recruitment spree.
However, within a day, Alexandr Wang, Meta's chief AI officer, dispelled this report, stating, ""We are truly only investing more and more into Meta Superintelligence Labs as a company,"" adding, ""Any reporting to the contrary of that is clearly mistaken.""
Since then, additional developments have underscored that Meta intends to keep on increasing its AI bet. To many investors, this may sound like cause for caution, given the recent rise in concern about a possible ""AI bubble."" However, considering all factors, there may still be good reason to be bullish on Meta stock long term.
Meta Platforms is paying top dollar for AI talent and technology
In its AI investment efforts, Meta Platforms hasn't been afraid to whip out its checkbook. So far this year, the tech giant has been aggressively hiring the top talent in artificial intelligence research, offering individuals as much as $1 billion in total compensation.
The billions that Meta has spent locking down top AI talent pale in comparison to the hundreds of billions being committed toward the build-out of Meta's AI infrastructure, namely the construction of large data centers.
In the weeks since Wang's AI freeze rebuttal, further headlines signal that Meta has yet to retreat from the AI talent and technology arms race. On Aug. 26, President Trump spilled the beans on Meta's plans to build a $50 billion data center in Louisiana.
Just this week, Bloomberg reported that Jian Zhang, formerly Apple's AI robotics chief, has left Apple for a new role at Meta Robotics Studio. Apple has garnered the reputation of being behind in AI, but hiring this experienced robotics executive could prove key in helping Meta gain ground in areas like AI hardware.
Meta's AI potential could go beyond its main business
Meta Platforms' continued heavy investment in AI comes just as OpenAI founder Sam Altman says the AI market is in a bubble, and as a recent study conducted by MIT suggests that 95% of organizations investing in AI projects have resulted in a zero return on investment.
Meta appears to be shaking off these ""AI bubble"" concerns. I'm starting to take a similar stance, at least in the case of this top AI contender. Mostly, because it's clear that Meta Platforms' AI strategy goes beyond using this technology to strengthen its core business: digital advertising. The Facebook and Instagram parent plans to fully automate advertising on its social media platforms by late 2026.
It's unclear whether reaching full automation will marginally or materially enhance Meta's revenue and earnings, as these have already been boosted from prior rounds of AI implementation. This may explain why analysts expect an earnings slowdown for Meta next year. As of Sept. 4, estimates call for Meta's EPS to grow from $23.86 to $28 per share, or by 17.3% in 2025, but by only 6.8% in 2026, from $28 to $29.91 per share.
However, what if AI potential goes beyond advertising and hardware? What if AI software could one day become a significant contributor to the bottom line?
AI software success could kick the stock back into high gear
Last month, Meta announced it had entered a licensing deal with AI image generation start-up Midjourney. This could be the prelude to Meta launching a service similar to OpenAI's Sora. There hasn't been much news lately about the company's efforts to monetize its AI models, but the gradual pivot away from making its AI models open source suggests that's still on the agenda.
The MIT study may cast doubt on AI's real-life use case, but further advances in both generative AI technology and greater education could, in time, make AI a more useful tool for businesses. Hence, it still makes sense that Meta anticipates generating hundreds of billions, if not trillions, in revenue from AI by the 2030s, via revenue-sharing agreements, AI model subscriptions, and other sources outside of advertising.
Only time will tell, but if Meta eventually starts generating a larger portion of its overall revenue from AI software, not from advertising, this could convince the market to give its shares a substantial re-rating. Microsoft, another tech giant investing heavily in AI, currently trades for 36.5 times earnings, while Meta trades for just 26.7 times earnings.
In time, if AI software leads to higher-than-expected growth, this, coupled with a re-rating to the upside in terms of valuation, could produce substantial gains for Meta stock. This leaves me mulling over a purchase of this stock, as shares pull back from recent highs."

Yahoo Finance's tech editor Dan Howley is here. And so Dan, how much are these tech companies relying on building personal relationships with the White House. We've seen this play out uh time and time again.
Oh yeah, big time. I mean, this is, you know, I mean they're playing the game just as, you know, well as the the next. Uh Tim Cook kind of was the, I guess, you know, poster child for this in the first Trump administration, uh managed to dodge tariffs for the large for for the most part on the company's most important products, the iPhone, uh things like that. Uh but now we're seeing the other tech executives kind of start to mimic that with the second Trump administration.
And this comes after, you know, the issues that came about with the attack on the capital on January 6th. uh afterwards, uh Trump was banned from social media platforms, then, you know, he sued them. Uh Zuck he said he would jail Zuckerberg uh as a result. um and, you know, since then the companies have started to, you know, or rather continue to warm up to him and especially in the lead up to the election.
Uh we had seen, you know, Zuckerberg praise him, uh Sundar Pachai, the CEO of Google, praise his uh McDonald's stunt. Uh and then uh you know, others kind of followed the same path. And so this just continues that. They donated to his uh inauguration. Uh Tim Cook was at the White House to announce new investments. All the companies have announced some kind of investment. Uh you know, obviously, they're trying to avoid those uh tariffs on semiconductors that are going to go into place.
Trump had bandied about the 100% number. So, you know, the the relationship with the the the White House is is of key importance to these companies and they're going to continue to play the game."

Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 5.3% in the afternoon session after the company was downgraded by Seaport Research due to concerns about slowing growth in its artificial intelligence (AI) business. The investment firm lowered its rating on the chipmaker to Neutral from Buy, with no price target, based on recent supply chain checks.

Adding to the negative sentiment, New Street also adjusted its price target on AMD, cutting it to $150 from $230. Broader market pressures also weighed on the stock, as the U.S. administration announced it would impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not shifting production to the U.S., creating further uncertainty for the industry.
Separately, rival Broadcom confirmed a significant partnership with OpenAI (speculated), fueling concerns about intensifying competition in the artificial intelligence hardware market. Broadcom announced a $10 billion custom chip deal with OpenAI, a move that highlights a broader trend of major tech companies developing their own processors to cut costs and fine-tune AI performance. This strategy is also being pursued by Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms.

What Is The Market Telling Us
AMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 22 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that stocks in the semiconductor sector pulled back triggered by a weak forecast from peer chipmaker Marvell Technology.
Marvell's disappointing outlook, which it attributed to a slowdown in its custom AI chip business, soured investor sentiment across the industry. The news put pressure on the entire semiconductor sector, with AMD and other major chipmakers like Nvidia also seeing notable drops. The downturn was also influenced by some investors apparently locking in recent gains from the popular ""AI trade,"" which has driven much of the market's recent performance. This profit-taking, combined with Marvell's cautious guidance, contributed to the negative pressure on chip stocks during the session."

What Is The Market Telling Us
Nvidia’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 3.3% as investors continued to lock in some profits, with the stock falling as its latest earnings report failed to meet the market's highest expectations. The decline extends from the previous session, as investors reacted to a quarterly report that, while strong, showed signs of slowing momentum.
Although Nvidia beat overall Q2 earnings and revenue forecasts, a slight miss in data center revenue and a Q3 forecast that was only in line with consensus estimates disappointed those hoping for a larger beat. Markets often punish even slight deceleration in growth for highly valued companies. Adding to the pressure, a weak forecast from peer chipmaker Marvell Technology soured sentiment across the semiconductor sector.
Nvidia is up 20.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $167.10 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $183.16 from August 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $14,025.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

""This trade is very nonlinear and volatile in nature,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.
The AI market is still developing, moving through distinct phases that have each presented unique investment opportunities and risks, Sheridan added.
The first phase focused heavily on infrastructure — building out data centers, cloud networks, and powerful chips to support AI's rapid growth. But now the focus is moving toward the ""application layer,"" where companies are figuring out how to use AI in real-world products and services.
The shift is critical because there are ""very different skews"" between how AI is being adopted by consumers versus businesses, per Sheridan.
""People are much more likely to adopt AI in their consumer computing habits than their enterprise computing habits,"" he explained, adding that consumers see less risk in AI and don't feel it will hurt their ability to earn money.
However, the adoption of AI by large companies is riskier. ""Enterprises have to operate within strict budget requirements,"" Sheridan said. ""You also run into some friction on the employee side with respect to how they use AI in their own individual workflows.""
These differences in adoption could affect the growth potential of AI stocks. While AI applications for consumers are advancing rapidly, businesses may take longer to integrate AI on a wide scale.
In a note to clients, Goldman analyst Ryan Hammond wrote that the AI stock market suggests valuations may already be ahead of themselves.
AI-exposed stocks rallied by 32% in 2024, though they remain below the levels seen during the tech bubble and 2021. Nonetheless, Hammond cautions that the eventual slowdown in hyperscaler capital expenditures could create risks for these stocks.
""Timing this inflection is challenging,"" he noted, adding that the next few quarters will be critical in determining whether AI-driven infrastructure companies can continue to deliver the growth investors are expecting.
Meta (META) has remained bullish on the technology, with plans to invest $600 billion in the US through 2028 to develop AI infrastructure.
Sheridan is cautious about the long-term financial impact, though he pointed out the company is already seeing results. Meta is among several digital platforms — including Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Pinterest (PINS) — that could benefit from AI disrupting traditional advertising."

If you had invested in the chipmaker on the day that ChatGPT launched (Nov. 30, 2022) and held on, your stake today would be worth roughly 10 times as much.
Over the last few years, tech giants including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Oracle have poured hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditures into their AI-related infrastructure -- a significant fraction of which has gone toward equipping data centers with Nvidia's industry-leading chips.
This unprecedented demand has propelled Nvidia's market value from about $345 billion at the dawn of the AI revolution to more than $4 trillion today.
After gains of this magnitude, it's natural to wonder if the best days for Nvidia stock are already in the rear-view mirror. After all, how could a stock that has skyrocketed to such a height keep climbing?
Yet just as skeptics are beginning to call a top, Nvidia's management has moved to support the stock's trajectory with a $60 billion commitment.
To me, the question isn't whether Nvidia has peaked, but whether the world's most valuable company is just getting started.
Is Nvidia stock overvalued?
Nvidia is trading in line with its three-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio and significantly below the peak it hit during the early days of the AI boom.
So Nvidia stock may appear ""cheap"" compared to where it stood during prior periods of AI euphoria. That said, the so-called discount is relative. During the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, many high-flying stocks peaked at P/S multiples in the 30 to 40 range.
At first glance, Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple looks deeply discounted to both its historical average and its peak levels over the last few years. The nuance to point out here is that the AI trend has led to explosive growth in Nvidia's profitability. This means that the denominator in its P/E ratio (earnings) has expanded dramatically. In other words, Nvidia's current P/E of 49 reflects normalized profitability rather than investors suddenly valuing the company at a less aggressive growth multiple.
On an absolute basis, Nvidia's valuation is demanding. But for investors who are trying to determine whether the shares are truly overvalued, management's latest announcement may offer some insight.
60 billion (more) reasons to pay attention to Nvidia
During the first half of the year, Nvidia repurchased 193 million shares of its common stock for $24.2 billion. Moreover, on its second-quarter earnings call in late August, management unveiled an even more striking move: The board of directors approved an additional $60 billion stock buyback program.
Such buybacks are often interpreted as a vote of confidence. They typically signal that management believes that a company's cash flows are sustainable and that repurchasing its own stock is one of the best uses of capital. But in Nvidia's case, there may be a more strategic layer at play here.
For much of the last few years, Nvidia's growth narrative has been anchored on its chips being used for the training of large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI tools. Looking ahead, however, the real upside will stem from their use in more advanced applications, such as robotics, quantum computing, and autonomous systems -- each of which represents a potential trillion-dollar market. These use cases will require more computing power, which will likely mean next-generation chip architectures from Nvidia.
While the company's successor to Blackwell, dubbed Rubin, is expected to ship next year, the catch with Nvidia's next massive rally will come down to timing.
It could be five to 10 years before these new, sophisticated use cases are driving enough sales to materially transform Nvidia's profitability profile. In the interim, the company's growth will likely continue -- albeit at a slower pace.
This is why the new stock buyback program looks particularly savvy. By aggressively reducing its outstanding share count over the next few years, Nvidia can bolster its earnings per share (EPS) growth during this transitional phase of the AI narrative. In effect, the new buyback program acts as a bridge -- keeping EPS momentum robust in the near term while the infrastructure wave of the AI era scales up in the background.
Is Nvidia stock a buy?
All told, Nvidia is positioned to benefit handsomely from the secular tailwinds of AI infrastructure spending by hyperscalers. At the same time, the company's ability to return capital through stock buybacks highlights the strength of its cash generation, management's commitment to rewarding shareholders, and the company's view that its stock remains appropriately priced.
Taken together, these dynamics underscore why I see Nvidia as a compelling opportunity to buy and hold. With structural growth drivers and shareholder-friendly capital allocation at the forefront of its strategic roadmap, the stock remains a no-brainer opportunity in the AI realm."

- Ethereum transformed the blockchain industry by enabling smart contracts, DAOs, NFTs, and decentralized apps.
- From its 2015 launch to The Merge in 2022, Ethereum has driven innovation and faced growing pains.
- Ethereum powers DeFi and NFTs, but still battles high fees, scalability limits, and fierce competition.
Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).
Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts—self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps, that run without banks, governments, or big tech.
When programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain—not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games, digital art, and assets worth billions.
Ultimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.
This guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.
Smart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough
The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.
Smart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.
Who Invented Ethereum?
Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.
Development of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
A crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.
The network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.
The switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake
When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.
In September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.
This shift, known as “The Merge,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.
Blocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.
Did you know?
Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.
What applications have been built on Ethereum?
- 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.
- 📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.
- 💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.
- 💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.
- 👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.
- 💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.
- 🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.
Timeline: Major milestones in Ethereum
- Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.
- Mid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.
- July 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.
- September 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.

Ethereum and DAOs
One of Ethereum’s most radical innovations was the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes. Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.
The first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack, but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.
Since then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon, to investment collectives like Syndicate, and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO, which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.
Supporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.
A network tested by crisis
If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.
Ethereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.
The community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).
Ethereum and the NFT boom
Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.
The breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.
By 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.
Ethereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.
The race to scale
Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.
To address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0. The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.
Ethereum and the Web3 vision
Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.
But competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.
A decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself
As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.
What’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance."

Indiana attorney says his account as been shut down for using a ""false name"" five times in the last eight years
Bloomberg
Over the course of the last eight years, Mark Steven Zuckerberg has seen his company's account on Meta shut down five times. Now he's suing the company — run by a fellow named Mark Elliot Zuckerberg.
Suggested Reading
Zuckerberg, the plaintiff, is an attorney in Indianapolis — and he's accusing the social media company of negligence and breach of contract after seeing his accounts go dark for using a ""false name"" and ""impersonating a celebrity.""

While having the same name as Meta's founder was a quirky coincidence, it has become a migraine headache in the past few years, said the barrister.
""It's not funny,"" he told Indianapolis local news station 13News. ""Not when they take my money. This really pissed me off. […] I've got better things to do than sue Facebook. They have more money and more lawyers and more resources than I do. I'd rather not pick a fight with them, but I don't know how else to make them stop!""
Zuckerberg the attorney also notes he's had the name ""Mark Zuckerberg"" longer than the entrepreneur has. Yet beyond the shutdowns of his business account, he has also seen his personal account suspended four times since 2018.
A Meta spokesperson told Quartz ""We have reinstated Mark Zuckerberg's account, after finding it had been disabled in error. We appreciate Mr. Zuckerberg's continued patience on this issue and are working to try and prevent this from happening in the future.""
After each suspension, Zuckerberg said, it would take months before he was able to get back online, sometimes up to four months. Those dark periods, he says, have prevented him from communicating with clients and cost him thousands of dollars in advertising.
Zuckerberg is seeking attorneys fees and restitution for the lost ad money.
Facebook has struggled with name confusion before. For about a decade, the company has leaned hard on its requirement that users post under their real names. In the process, Facebook has shuttered accounts without warning, including when legal names failed to meet the network's obtuse criteria of sounding real.
In 2009, a Sioux user named Robin Kills The Enemy was banned from the site, as an employee thought it was a fake name. Drag queens and pro-democracy activists in restrictive nations have also been silenced by Facebook's policy."

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the partnership as a major step toward making AI accessible to everyone and eventually building toward “superintelligence”. The joint venture will use Meta’s open-source AI models to power applications in sectors like retail, telecom, finance, and energy, where Reliance is dominant.
Back in 2020, Meta invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms, the digital arm of Reliance Industries. The deal gave the tech behemoth a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms.
Meta has been making a big AI push throughout the year. The company has been spending billions to compete with the likes of Open AI and Google. Just last month, Zuckerberg split the company’s “Meta Superintelligence Labs” (MSL) into four specialized teams focusing on research, “superintelligence,” products, and infrastructure.

For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – September 5, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Astera Labs ALAB, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Alphabet GOOGL.
ALAB: Connecting the Future of AI
Astera Labs: An Emerging AI Leader
Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Astera Labs is a fabless semiconductor company that develops “purpose-built connectivity solutions for rack-scale AI and cloud infrastructure. In other words, they build the “nervous system” that allows powerful components in an AI server, like GPUs, CPUs, and memory, to communicate with each other effectively. ALAB operates a fabless business model, which means they focus on the design of the chip and software but outsource manufacturing to third-party chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor.
ALAB: Providing A Solution to AI Scalability
As investors have learned over the past few years, the demand for AI models and the components that ‘train them’ has grown exponentially. AI capital expenditure (CAPEX) spending among major tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Alphabet is expected to be in the $400 billion range for full-year 2025 as big tech juggernauts race to keep up with soaring demand for AI compute power.
However, as data center size and complexity have exploded, these companies must move beyond single-server architecture. This is where ALAB comes in. Astera Labs technology is the new industry standard. The technology allows “rack-scale” AI, where multiple servers can act in concert, alleviating data transfer bottlenecks and producing rapid, efficient, and reliable connectivity.
ALAB Earnings are Exploding
The aforementioned growing speed requirements and system complexities of AI and cloud infrastructure bode well for Astera Labs. ALAB’s recent earnings history illustrates that the company has already emerged as a leader in next-generation data center connectivity. In fact, ALAB has beat Zacks Consensus EPS Estimates for four straight quarters, with a juicy beat margin of 32.2%.
Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts believe that ALAB’s products will continue to be in high demand well into the future. Several analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research have upped estimates over the past two months, and these analysts expect the company to grow full-year EPS by a robust 88.10% in 2025 and 24.14% in 2026.
ALAB Technical View: Post-EPS Drift Potential
ALAB’s price and volume action are jiving with its robust fundamental picture. ALAB shares bolted ~29% in early August after the company smashed Wall Street expectations. Additionally, volume increased 220% for the session, signaling heavy demand. Since then, ALAB shares have held gains, signaling that bulls are unwilling to part with shares."

He acts decisively when opportunities present and is not afraid to cut winning positions if he thinks the upside is priced in.
His latest move: reducing stakes in Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) and adding 755,000 shares -- a 279.6% increase in its stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%) in the second quarter of 2025.
This decision does not take Tepper away from the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Instead, it has increased his exposure to a company that plays a critical role in building the global AI infrastructure. Since TSMC produces the world's most advanced chips for all major technology titans, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, no one can scale AI models or data centers without its foundries.
Tepper has correctly identified that chip supply is the key bottleneck, which allows TSMC to enjoy high pricing power. Thus, he rightly seems to believe that there is money to be made in this investment in the long run.
Why Tepper cut his stakes in Broadcom and Meta
Although Broadcom and Meta Platforms are both high-quality stocks, Tepper's moves in the second quarter suggest he sees limits ahead. Broadcom boasts a robust portfolio that includes custom AI chips, high-performance networking hardware, and enterprise software solutions -- playing a critical role in building global AI infrastructure.
Analysts expect the company's revenue to grow year over year by 21% to $15.8 billion, and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share to rise 33.9% to $1.66 in the third quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ending Aug. 3). Still, Appaloosa has sold its entire Broadcom stake during the second quarter, suggesting Tepper prefers exposure to a company that has control over the chip supply.
A leading social media and digital advertising giant, Meta Platforms continues to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. Its daily user base now exceeds 3.4 billion. The company's revenue soared 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, while operating income surged 38% to $20.4 billion in the second quarter of 2025.
Yet advertising remains a cyclical business heavily reliant on the overall state of the economy. At the same time, heavy capital expenditures can prove to be a drag on the company's stock in the near term. Tepper has sold 150,000 shares of Meta in the second quarter, reducing the stake by 27%.
Why TSMC can be a better choice
Tepper's shift to TSMC in the second quarter indicates that he aims to increase his portfolio's exposure to the advanced chip manufacturing segment.
The numbers reinforce the investment thesis. In the second quarter of 2025, revenue rose 54% year over year to $30.1 billion, while operating margin improved 40 basis points to 49.6%. TSMC now expects about 30% revenue growth for 2025 in U.S. dollars.
Demand for high-performance computing chips has been a key driver, accounting for nearly 60% of sales. Smartphones contributed 27% of the sales, while automotive and the Internet of Things (IoT) each contributed 5% of the sales, respectively. Advanced nodes (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 74% of wafer revenue. This shows the rapidly expanding demand for advanced chip manufacturing capabilities, especially in the AI market.
Management has noted that the supply for 3nm and 5nm chips is very tight compared to the explosive demand from the AI market. The company is converting or adjusting capacity from older nodes to newer ones -- initiatives made possible thanks to its strategy of building multiple fabs together in a cluster in one location, which share tools and infrastructure (giga fab cluster).
Its advanced packaging technology, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), is also seeing demand far more than available supply. The mismatch is so significant that the company is currently focusing only on ""narrowing the gap"" and not on balancing supply and demand. This implies that the company will be enjoying significant pricing power for the foreseeable future.
TSMC is also innovating at a rapid pace to meet the increasing performance and cost reduction needs of AI data centers. The company plans to commence volume production of 2nm chips in the second half of 2025. The 2nm node is also more profitable than the 3nm one. The 2nm chips are expected to be faster and more power-efficient than the 3nm ones.
The company is also gearing up for volume production of N2P chips and A16 chips, which are expected to offer further performance and power benefits over 2nm chips in the second half of 2026. Volume production on an even more advanced node, A14, is planned for 2028. All these initiatives will ensure TSMC's continued dominance in the global foundry business for several years.
Despite its many strengths, TSMC trades at 23.8 times forward earnings -- better than the median 31.5 multiple for the overall technology sector. Considering TSMC's strong financials, robust business model, and reasonable valuation, the stock appears well-positioned for rapid growth in the coming years. Hence, retail investors should consider buying a stake in this Tepper pick in 2025."

Broadcom’s CEO, Hock Tan, recently mentioned that a new undisclosed customer that has committed to $10bn in orders.
This move aligns OpenAI with other technology firms such as Google, Amazon, and Meta, which have also created their own specialised chips to handle AI workloads.
According to insiders, OpenAI intends to utilise the chips internally rather than offering them to external clients.
The partnership with Broadcom began in 2024, although the timeline for the mass production of a successful chip design had not been previously clarified.

By GlobalDataDuring a call with analysts, Tan revealed that Broadcom had secured a fourth customer for its custom AI chip division.
While Broadcom does not disclose the identities of its clients, sources confirmed that OpenAI is the new customer.
Both companies have chosen not to comment on the matter, the report said.
Tan noted that this agreement has enhanced Broadcom’s growth outlook by generating “immediate and fairly substantial demand,” with plans to begin shipping chips for this customer “pretty strongly” from next year.
Previously, Broadcom collaborated with Google to develop its custom “TPU” AI chips.
OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has consistently highlighted the need for increased computing power to accommodate the growing number of businesses and consumers utilising products such as ChatGPT, as well as for training and executing AI models.
In August 2025, Altman indicated that the company is prioritising computing resources “in light of the increased demand from [OpenAI’s latest model] GPT-5” and aims to double its computing fleet “over the next five months.”"

The agency reported a significant uptick in recent months of illegal products being sold on websites and promoted on social media platforms such as Facebook.

Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms.
The medicines are not authorised by the EMA and have therefore not met the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy. The agency said such products “pose a serious risk to public health”.
The EMA said that Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide and Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide, both approved GLP-1RAs, are amongst those being copied. Semaglutide is sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic for weight loss and type 2 diabetes treatment, respectively, while tirzepatide is sold as Mounjaro for both indications in Europe. Both drugs generate billions of dollars a year as their popularity continues to soar.
Authorities in Europe have identified hundreds of fake Facebook profiles, advertisements and e-commerce listings, many of which are hosted outside the EU. Social media adverts of several websites have been found to misuse official logos and use false endorsements to mislead consumers into thinking they are buying an approved product.
Counterfeit medicines being sold on these platforms may not contain the claimed active substance at all and might instead have harmful levels of other substances.

Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataThe EMA said in a statement: “Illegal suppliers are being actively monitored by national authorities. Enforcement actions include ordering product withdrawals, blocking websites and cross-border collaboration with enforcement officers and other international partners.”
The agency stated that given the lack of regulation over these illegal medicines, people who buy them are at a very high risk of treatment failure, along with unexpected and serious health problems and dangerous interactions with other medicines.
The EMA’s alert adds to a growing global trend of counterfeit GLP-1RAs as fraudsters aim to cash in on the lucrative market. Ireland’s Health Research Board said it detained around 1,400 units of illegal semaglutide and other GLP-1RAs from January to October 2024, compared with 568 detected in 2023.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) alerted countries to the presence of fake batches of semaglutide in circulation in Brazil, the UK, and the US in 2023. WHO’s Global Surveillance and Monitoring System (GSMS) has been observing increased reports on falsified semaglutide products across the world since 2022.
There has been a particular focus on illegal online pharmacies due to lower drug costs and easier access. Global shortages of semaglutide and tirzepatide also led many patients to source alternate routes of procurement. While some bought the vaccines from legitimate online telehealth platforms, others have been duped by vendors posing as regulated sellers.
A viewpoint published in the JAMA Health Forum noted: “Nearly half of online pharmacies offering semaglutide [in the US] may be operating illegally, operating non-delivery scams, or providing products that do not meet quality standards. These illegal operations should not be confused with legitimate, state-licensed pharmacies.

Mark Stephen Zuckerberg, a bankruptcy lawyer in the US state of Indiana, says he has spent thousands of dollars promoting his services on Facebook but his page has been repeatedly blocked by the site.
Mr Zuckerberg says his life has been turned upside down by sharing a name with the world’s third-richest man, including receiving death threats and incessant tech support phone calls.
“It’s not funny,” he told local news channel WTHR. “Not when they take my money.”
He said he had had the name Mark Zuckerberg “way longer than he has” and was suing after years of having his account unfairly removed.
He said he had spent more than $11,000 (£8,000) on Facebook adverts to promote his law practice, but that both his business and personal pages had been repeatedly removed for “impersonating a celebrity”.
Mr Zuckerberg said it often takes months to restore his account, leading to lost business, and that the company had broken “fair dealing” laws.
“I’d rather not pick a fight with them, but I don’t know how to make them stop,” he said. “I don’t know how else to get their attention.”
Mr Zuckerberg has a website where he chronicles cases in which sharing a name has affected his life.
This includes being sued by the state of Washington because of mistaken identity, turning off his phone at night because of a torrent of notifications, receiving more than 100 friend requests daily, and having to use a fake name when booking restaurants, which otherwise assume it is a prank.
In one case, a limo driver holding a sign bearing his name in Las Vegas was surrounded by fans eagerly awaiting the Meta billionaire.
Mr Zuckerberg has been practising law for 38 years, when the younger and richer Mr Zuckerberg was three years old.
Meta said: “We know there’s more than one Mark Zuckerberg in the world, and we are getting to the bottom of this.”
Mr Zuckerberg said he would be satisfied if the Meta billionaire offered him a week on his superyacht. “[If he] let me spend a week on his boat to say I’m sorry, I’d probably take him up on that,” he said.
He is seeking damages and legal fees."

Many of these companies were basking in the glow of what was perceived to be Alphabet's big victory in an antitrust case brought by the federal government.
Additionally, a prominent researcher flagged Meta as one of the sector's stocks best positioned to take advantage of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With this winds at its back, Meta's stock booked a 1.6% gain on the day, almost exactly double the percentage rate increase of the S&P 500 index.
Favorable ruling
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google, Alphabet's core business, need not break itself up with the sale of its Chrome web browser. Although the ruling mandates that the company share some of its data with certain peers, among other minor punitive measures, it falls well short of the business split the government was seeking in the antitrust suit.
That came as a relief not only to Alphabet and its many shareholders, but to other tech giants that have also felt the hot gaze of federal regulators. Meta, the owner of foundational social media site Facebook, photo-sharing incumbent Instagram, and popular messaging service WhatsApp, felt to many as if it presented a juicy target.
While there's no guarantee that regulators will abruptly halt their scrutiny and pursuit of Big Tech, the Alphabet ruling makes this prospect significantly more unlikely. It's no wonder investors continued to breath a large, collective, sigh of relief on this latest development.
A side play on AI
Meanwhile, one of the more closely followed tech industry researchers named Meta a top pick to take advantage of a sweeping trend.

Furthermore, we look for confirmation of a recovery within the cyclical businesses beginning in the July Q, following nine sequential quarters of Y/Y declines and stability in the Infrastructure Software business. Overall, we believe that Custom Silicon revenues could potentially reach $25-30B in CY26 and $40B+ in the CY27 time frame, and outline a framework for stretch goal of $13 in EPS in CY27. We are raising our price target to $350 from $300 reflecting our rising confidence in 2027 earnings power, based on a ~30x multiple (discounted back by 12% vs. prior 30x CY26 stretch goal EPS of $10). We reiterate our Overweight rating and AVGO remains a TOP PICK.”
Broadcom is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets.

finnhub,META,2025-09-04T22:32:52,Facebook is trying to make ‘pokes’ happen again,"The poke-tracking feature is largely designed to appeal to younger users who have grown up with gamification elements built into their social apps, like Snapchat and TikTok Streaks.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a607b8c1486d3d198bd148cba5d9d1ae4c845dc4bfe2532a4c572308a3aee115,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-trying-pokes-happen-again-213252581.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-trying-pokes-happen-again-213252581.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-trying-pokes-happen-again-213252581.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Technically, the poke never really left Facebook.
The classic feature from Facebook’s early days lets users get a friend’s attention with a virtual nudge of sorts. While the poke fell out of use ages ago, the company has more recently seen an uptick in its use among younger users, which has now prompted it to make the poke a more central part of the Facebook experience.
Now users are able to poke their friends from a new, dedicated button directly on their Facebook profile, which will alert the poke’s recipient through their notifications. In addition, Facebook users can see who poked them and find friends to poke at facebook.com/pokes. On this page, users will be able to track their “poke count” with friends, which grows every time they poke each other. They can also dismiss pokes if they don’t want to reciprocate.
The poke-tracking feature is largely designed to appeal to younger users who have grown up with gamification elements built into their social apps, like Snapchat and TikTok Streaks. These features ostensibly help friends keep track of those they message most, but streaks have come under regulatory scrutiny and have even led to lawsuits because of their addictive nature, as they keep kids hooked on the apps.
By highlighting poke counts and making the poke more prominent on Facebook, Meta wants to create a similar engagement mechanism. As users increase their poke counts with a friend, different icons will appear next to the friend’s name, like a fire emoji or “100,” among others.
This isn’t the first time in recent months that Facebook has tried to revive the poke. In March 2024, the company said it had made it easier for users to find the poking page via search and would make it easier to poke a friend after searching for them. These small changes led to a 13x spike in poking in the month after the changes, Meta said at the time.
As for why you’d want to poke someone, that’s up to users to decide. Facebook never explained the purpose of the poke, leaving it open to interpretation. A poke could be a way to catch someone’s attention, flirt, or just annoy them, depending on the user’s intent.
Poke counts may never become as popular as streaks, but adding them is clearly a signal that Meta is looking to boost Facebook engagement.
According to research from Jon Haidt, author of “The Anxious Generation,” which focused on social media’s potential harm to children’s brain development, Snap had known about streaks’ habit-forming nature for years. An article he co-published with a senior research scientist at NYU Stern, Zach Rausch, included quotes from internal documents that show Snap employees discussing how popular streaks were and how effective they were at driving engagement.
Though Facebook today remains a cash cow for Meta’s business, fueling its longer-term bets in areas like AI and metaverse projects, it has long been criticized for failing to appeal to younger users — a demographic that’s been declining, particularly in the U.S. The company has tried to recapture the youth market with various initiatives, including the short-lived, college-only feature Facebook Campus, shuttered in 2022, and more recently, a Gen Z-focused redesign."

But clearly, Facebook's not willing to give up on the option, even if everybody else is.
As you can see in these example screens, Facebook’s latest attempt to resurrect Pokes adds simplified poke functionality, and a new gamification element.
As explained by Facebook:
“See who poked you and find other friends to poke at www.facebook.com/pokes. You’ll be able to see your pokes count with friends grow each time you poke each other, while you can also dismiss pokes from the list.”
And as you can see in the first image above, Facebook’s also brought the Poke button back to user profiles, so you can easily poke somebody by heading to their profile page.
Why would you want to do that? I don’t know, but Zuck and Co. clearly think that it has value, and can add to your social media experience in some way.
Or they just want it to happen.
Back in March, Meta attempted to revive Facebook, by announcing that it would be adding “several OG Facebook experiences” back into the app. That began with its revamped Friends tab, and now, that’s also extended to this latest attempt to drag Pokes back into some form of relevance.
Though it seems unlikely as ever to gain any real traction, particularly given that fewer people are now using Facebook, and even fewer are using it to connect with friends, with most now switching to messaging platforms for such purpose.
But maybe it’s worth Meta trying out again, and maybe there is some committed group of Poke enthusiasts who’ll herald a new age of pointless, annoying interaction in the app.
And if Facebook can get young people to use the option, that could spark a Snapchat-like rush on Pokes, with the new poke counts acting like its own version of Snap streaks.
I assume that’s the hope here, but it just feels like a tone deaf, corporate attempt to “make fetch happen,” which once again reflects Meta’s broader lack of trend nous and user interest.
Which seems ridiculous to say about a company that owns the most used social and messaging apps in the world. But the thing with Meta’s apps is that younger audiences are rarely as interested, with older demographics filling out the numbers, and boosting their usage.
Which is better for business, no doubt, but Facebook and Instagram never have the cool features first, they simply clone them from Snapchat and TikTok, in order to latch onto the latest trends.
You can also see this in Meta’s AI tools, with Facebook constantly prompting you to “create a picture of yourself as an astronaut” or some other dopey prompt.
Why? Why would anyone want to do that? Why would anyone want to create a fake, AI image of themselves doing something they never did, other than to scam people by sharing such within Meta’s apps?
The same goes for Meta’s celebrity-inspired AI bots, which it’s now tried to make a thing several times. Why would anybody care if the AI bot that they’re engaging with sounds like Snoop Dogg or Jon Cena? It’s a bot, it’s not these actual celebrities, so why is this a thing that Meta keeps pushing, as if this is the Holy Grail in building connection with younger audiences?
Facebook has clearly been a massive success, and its purchase of Instagram was a stroke of genius in retrospect. But Zuck and Co. don’t know what cool is, and that’s reflected in all of their product releases, interviews, etc.
Meta is the ultimate culture vulture, relying on the credibility and nous of other platforms and collaborators to win. Even its Meta Ray Ban glasses are only cool because of Ray Ban’s input, not because of Meta’s own input.
And clearly, that hasn’t been an impediment to Meta’s broader success as a business. But as a cultural influence, with unique features and engagement tools, Facebook ain’t it.
But now it’s easier to poke people again, so people who didn’t know what Facebook was back in 2006 can try it out for themselves, and get sick of it like we all did."

Mark Zuckerberg the lawyer uses a commercial Facebook page to advertise his legal practice and communicate with potential clients. But his page has been disabled five times in the last eight years, since Meta’s moderation systems flag his account as falsely impersonating Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the platform.
Mark Zuckerberg is not impersonating Mark Zuckerberg, because he, too, is Mark Zuckerberg. In his legal complaint, Mark Zuckerberg points out that he has been practicing law since Mark Zuckerberg was just three years old.
“It’s not funny,” Mark Zuckerberg, the lawyer, said to Indianapolis’ 13WTHR. “Not when they take my money. This really pissed me off.”
Mark Zuckerberg has spent over $11,000 to advertise his page on Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta platforms, but when Mark Zuckerberg’s account is disabled for allegedly impersonating Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg still has to pay for these advertisements.
In his complaint, the lawyer shared a copy of an email thread from 2020, where he asks about his wrongly disabled account and references that he has been in touch with the platform about this since 2017.
“Also, if you happen to run into the younger, richer Mark Zuckerberg, tell him I said hi and he causes me great aggravation each day,” Mark Zuckerberg the lawyer wrote in one email.
Mark Zuckerberg has long been haunted by the looming presence of Mark Zuckerberg. He even created a website, iammarkzuckerberg.com, where he chronicles how his life has been shaped by being named Mark Zuckerberg.
“I can’t use my name when making reservations or conducting business as people assume I’m a prank caller and hang up,” he said. “My life sometimes feels like the Michael Jordan ESPN commercial, where a regular person’s name causes constant mixups.”
While the attorney may not be a high-profile billionaire, he’s not your average Joe, either (he is Mark Zuckerberg, after all). Sometimes he ends up flying out to Las Vegas for speaking engagements, as he is a respected figure in bankruptcy law. But even on his own turf, he cannot escape the other Mark Zuckerberg.
“While speaking in Las Vegas, a limo driver was waiting for me at the bottom of the escalator with a sign for ‘Mark Zuckerberg,’ causing chaos as a large disappointed crowd had been waiting,” Mark Zuckerberg wrote.
On a regular basis, the lawyer says he receives phone calls and messages intended for the tech founder, which sometimes include death threats and requests for money. But when this daily nuisance turned into a potential loss of income, Mark Zuckerberg lost his patience with Mark Zuckerberg."

Meta Platforms (META, Financials) received direction from the Singapore police to roll out stronger anti-scam measures on Facebook or face a potential fine of up to S$1 million under the country's new Online Criminal Harms Act.
The mandate follows a surge in fraud linked to Facebook accounts impersonating Singapore government officials. According to Minister of State for Home Affairs Goh Pei Ming, Meta was targeted because Facebook is the top platform for these scams and needs more decisive action.
Scams involving fake government figures rose to 1,762 cases in the first half of 2025nearly triple the number from a year earlier. Victims lost S$126.5 million, an 88% increase year over year, the ministry said.
A Meta spokesperson responded that the company has systems in place including facial recognition and advertiser verification, and is working with law enforcement. Still, Singapore rated Facebook Marketplace the weakest of six e-commerce platforms in terms of anti-scam protections.
While Meta introduced seller verification and safety alerts in 2024, authorities found enforcement lacking. The government's move marks the first time the new law has been used to formally compel platform compliance.
As Meta continues expanding in the region, the case may test how it balances regulatory demands with platform scale and global moderation limits."

Earlier this year, Meta went on a big AI hiring push, offering nine-figure salaries to lure talent from major AI companies like OpenAI. The company also reportedly used reverse acquihires to take key staff from start-ups. Meta has reorganized its AI division into four teams, including one focused on superintelligence. Zuckerberg personally led efforts to recruit top talent from OpenAI, Google, Apple, and AI startups, even offering huge sums to lure them in.
The company is seen as one of Wall Street’s “AI Hyperscalers”, a group of big tech firms investing massive amounts into AI development and data centers. Meta alone has set aside around $72 billion for AI this year. However, this heavy spending has worried investors, who are concerned that higher costs and generous stock-based compensation could hurt profits.
While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

And as you could probably have guessed, Meta’s biggest tip is to put your faith in its evolving AI tools to target your ads for you.
As per Meta:
“Forget second-guessing what your audience wants, let Meta’s next-gen AI find the right shoppers at the right moment, optimizing your campaigns in real time to drive conversions and maximize ROI. Our cutting-edge models like Meta Lattice and Meta Andromeda don’t just improve ad delivery; they can help uplevel your entire holiday strategy by learning and adapting faster than ever.”
Indeed, Meta says that its AI ad tools are driving better results, including a 6% increase in average conversions. Which makes sense. AI systems are designed to recognize patterns in large groupings of data, which should mean that they’re super good at understanding what each person is likely to click on, based on an ever-expanding array of correlating signals.
So Meta’s AI systems should be driving better results, and while it may feel counterintuitive to go with the machine recommendations, as opposed to trusting your gut, logically, it might be the best way to go within your broader end-of-year push.
In order to maximize your opportunities, Meta says that advertisers “automate ruthlessly,” and let its ad system “minimize inefficiencies and maximize return for your brand.”
You can use Meta’s Advantage+ ad tools to tap into its AI recommendations, while Meta also now provides a range of generative AI options for ad creative, which can better align your offerings with user preferences.
Meta also suggests that brands look to extend their holiday campaigns beyond Christmas to maximize opportunities.
“The shopper mindset doesn’t end on December 25. Capitalize on low CPMs and improved auction efficiency through late December and January when most competitors are tapped out but your audience is on high alert for self-care.”
Meta also suggests that marketers consider omnichannel campaigns as a means to tap into evolving shopper behaviors.
“By integrating offline signals through Conversions API and leveraging omnichannel strategies with trusted partners, advertisers improve ad relevance, gain a holistic view of sales performance across channels, and ensure no sale, online or offline, slips through the cracks. Highlighting local inventory and promoting in-store offers isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s essential for driving foot traffic and capturing last-minute shoppers who missed shipping cutoffs.”
Meta says that omnichannel campaigns deliver up to 32% lower offline cost per incremental conversion and 21% higher ROAS compared to traditional digital-only campaigns.
Finally, Meta recommends partnering with Reels creators in order to tap into Reels consumption.
“Reels and partnership ads aren’t just buzzwords, they bring authenticity, excitement, and cultural relevance that cuts through the clutter and drives real purchase intent. In fact, 80% of shoppers who follow creators have purchased a product they discovered through social media ads.”
Meta suggests partnering with relevant creators on unboxing videos, viral challenges, or “gift haul” Reels, while it also suggests creating multiple assets from these collaborations for expanded reach.

On Thursday, Nepal’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology directed the Nepal Telecommunications Authority to instruct internet service providers to restrict access to 26 social media platforms altogether. The move followed a meeting of ministry officials earlier in the day.
Nepal has an internet penetration rate of over 90%, according to data from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority. Among social media users in the country, 87% use Facebook, followed by 6% on X and 5% on YouTube, the latest figures from web analytics firm Statcounter suggest.
The list of affected platforms includes Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WeChat, Reddit, Snapchat, YouTube, and X. The decision follows an August 25 directive that gave foreign social media companies just seven days to register their operations in Nepal and assign a local contact person.
Media advocacy groups and civil society organizations have criticized the move. The decision would “seriously hinder journalists’ work and people’s access to news and information,” said the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based nonprofit. The Federation of Nepali Journalists also condemned the measure, saying it “undermines press freedom and citizens’ right to information.”
Thursday’s decision comes weeks after Nepal’s Supreme Court upheld the government’s local registration requirement last month, ruling that it was aimed at curbing misinformation. However, the court did not explicitly order the government to ban platforms that failed to register, instead directing officials to “make appropriate legal arrangements immediately, within the framework of the law.”
Notably, TikTok and Russia’s Viber are among the social media apps not affected by the latest order; the government said these platforms have already followed the rules and registered themselves in the country.
“It is extremely troubling that Nepal has chosen to block access to entire social media and web services simply because they have not registered with the government,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific Policy director and Global Cybersecurity lead at Access Now. He compared the approach to “the architecture of censorship seen in the People’s Republic of China’s Great Firewall model of digital authoritarianism — a path wholly at odds with Nepal’s democratic aspirations and constitutional guarantees.”"

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on IAS. Integral Ad Science Holding Corp.'s share was trading at $8.99 as of August 29th. IAS’s trailing and forward P/E were 26.44 and 25.00 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
Integral Ad Science (IAS) is a $1.5 billion digital advertising verification company operating in a duopoly with DoubleVerify (DV) after Oracle’s exit from the space. IAS ensures ads are viewed by real people in brand-safe environments, with revenue divided across optimization ($67.9m, +16% YoY), measurement ($57.0m, +8% YoY), and publisher services ($24.3m, +36% YoY). Its top 100 advertisers, including Meta, Samsung, TikTok, and Volkswagen, have stayed loyal for more than eight years, highlighting its sticky customer base.
Financially, IAS is highly attractive FCF positive, debt-free, with $90.7m in cash and Q2 2025 revenue of $149.2m (+16% YoY). Guidance was raised for FY2025, with revenue now expected at $597–605m and adjusted EBITDA at $208–214m (35% margin). Valuation remains favorable at ~2.5x sales and 7.5x EBITDA, cheaper than DV at 3.3x sales and ~10x EBITDA. Growth is supported by international expansion, including a push into China, where ad spend is expected to surpass $140 billion, offering both “China-in” (serving multinationals advertising domestically) and “China-out” (Chinese brands advertising abroad) opportunities. Additionally, looser content moderation by Meta enhances brand safety demand, providing a secular tailwind.
Ownership dynamics add to the intrigue: Vista Equity Partners (~40%) and Atlas/Accomplice (~14%) face exit pressure, while CEO Lisa Utzschneider and new CFO Alpana Wegner hold meaningful equity incentives that align with a sale. Reports from Bloomberg and Business Insider suggest IAS is actively exploring strategic alternatives with Jefferies, supported by rising professional fees. With rumors of KKR’s interest, IAS appears well-positioned for a potential acquisition. Risks include pricing pressure, litigation involving Vista, customer concentration (notably Meta), and ecosystem changes. However, IAS remains a solid standalone business with durable profitability, international upside, and a likely M&A catalyst, offering investors both resilience and optionality.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Integral Ad Science Holding Corp. (IAS) by P14 Capital in May 2025, which highlighted its duopoly position, innovation edge, and undervaluation versus DoubleVerify. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately 24% since our coverage. This is because IAS continued to deliver strong execution. The thesis still stands as valuation remains attractive. Show me the incentives... shares a similar view but emphasizes China expansion and M&A catalysts."

The addition has been designed with the needs of creators in mind, as it supports linking out to content outside of Threads, like newsletters, blogs, podcasts, and more.
Before this update, Threads supported 500 characters — which is already far more than the 280 characters offered to X’s unverified users. However, X in 2023 introduced a way for its paid subscribers to post up to 25,000 characters, in the hopes of encouraging creators to publish their content directly on its platform.
Meta, meanwhile, isn’t going quite that far. Instead, the company says that the 10,000 characters give people more room to express themselves, but also allows them to promote their work and drive others to “wherever it lives,” even if not on Threads itself.
Ahead of the launch, Meta noticed that people were using screenshots to share longer content from books, articles, newsletters, podcast transcripts, and more, which inspired the feature’s addition and design.
The company saw that its users often wanted to point people to the original work or place to purchase their own work, after starting a conversation about the subject on Threads. For instance, authors may want to share text from an upcoming book to drive preorders, whereas journalists may want to promote one of their longer features.
On X, users have long worked around character count limitations by threading and numbering a series of linked posts to share longer thoughts, or by uploading screenshots from an app like Apple’s Notes. Seeing this trend, X tried to capitalize on the demand for a longer character count by making it a paid feature.
Threads, however, is making its additional characters available for free.
The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it doesn’t have plans to monetize posts with text attachments at this time. Plus, Meta noted that text in the posts can be formatted with highlighting, bold or underlined text, strikethroughs, and italics. You can even add emojis.
The company says it’s exploring additional enhancements based on community feedback, as well.
Notably, Meta says if creators link out to content outside of Threads, that link will be displayed “prominently” in the attachment for the audience to click. This is also a shot at X, which changed its user interface to downplay links’ visibility, and often blocks links to outside services at owner Elon Musk’s whim."

Ben, I want to circle back to you on a slightly different topic because tonight in the Rose Garden at the White House, the president is welcoming top business, political, and tech leaders. We don't have an official guest list that I understand, but Mark Zuckerberg is supposed to be there, Sam Altman of Open AI. What do you know about this event and how could it shape things, uh the tech discussion and the relationship between the tech industry and the White House?
Yeah, so this is going to be the first kind of gathering of Trump's remodeled Rose Garden. He paved over the the lawn and made it into a patio, kind of made it into uh a lot of echoes of Maralago. And as you mentioned, tech is the very first kind of guest list here. Trump has been planning for a party for a couple of weeks now and then it's there. A couple of other names for you, you mentioned, I think you mentioned Zuckerberg. Bill Gates is apparently on the guest list, Apple CEO Tim Cook. This is according to an invite list that the Hill obtained first, but has since been confirmed by the White House. So it's going to be a real tech gathering. Exactly what it is, we don't know. It's it's right now it's closed to the press, so I don't know that we're going to get remarks, but it's also coming as Melania Trump has an AI event today that I think a lot of these same CEOs will be at. So kind of a tech focus day and an unveiling for Trump of this. The the White House statement being distributed to reporters is calling this the Rose Garden Club, um saying top business political and tech leaders for this dinner will be in attendance calling it the new beautiful Rose Garden patio. So Trump's definitely looking to show off this patio and he's using tech as his big first way to do it.
The new beautiful Rose Garden patio. Well, we'll wait for that tonight. Uh thank you Ben and thank you Henrietta."

Shares of PINS have outperformed peers like Snap Inc. SNAP but underperformed compared to Meta Platforms, Inc. META over this period. Snap shares have plunged 33.9%, while shares of META have risen 27.8% in the same time frame.
PINS Rides on User Growth, AI Focus
Pinterest is benefiting from solid user engagement across all regions. The company has taken several actions to boost personalization on the platform. The company recorded 578 million global monthly active users, with over 50% the MAUs being GenZ. This underscores the fact that Pinterest’s personalization initiative is paying off as it is able to attract one of the most vibrant and fast-growing user segments worldwide.
The company recently reported that 100% of its users are logged in, and approximately 85% come to the mobile app directly. These factors show the sign of a growing loyal user base. Moreover, the Pinterest platform, which mostly has a female user base is able to gain ground in male demographics as well, with searches like rock climbing aesthetics rose 95% during the second quarter. Such user growth is supported by Pinterest’s leading-edge AI models, which significantly boosted the relevancy of content across the platform.
In the second quarter of 2025, the company generated $207.7 million of cash from operating activities compared with $106.4 million in the year-ago quarter. As of June 30, 2025, Pinterest had $1.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $137.4 million of operating lease liabilities. The company’s debt-to-capital ratio is pegged at 0.00%. In the second quarter, its current ratio is 8.76, well above the industry’s average of 1.95. A current ratio above 1 suggests that a company is well-positioned to meet its short-term obligations.
Major Challenges for PINS
Pinterest heavily relies on advertising as its one major source of revenue. Despite sustained growth in ad impressions, Pinterest witnessed a 25% year-over-year decline in ad pricing in the second quarter. As Pinterest moves into previously unmonetized international markets, it is experiencing a shift in the composition of ad impressions. In these regions, ad pricing is low compared to the mature markets of the United States and Europe. Strong volume growth in ad impressions is diluted by lower ad pricing, which reduces the average revenue per ad impression. This is expected to create margin pressure for the company. Growing geopolitical volatility and tariff-related uncertainties also remains a major concern.
Moreover, Pinterest is facing stiff competition from other major social media giants META, SNAP and Google’s YouTube as well. META is heavily investing in AI capabilities to drive user growth across its platform. Its Instagram platform has a strong e-commerce integration and has become one of the preferred choices among young audiences worldwide. SNAP continues to boast a strong presence among Gen Z users. Such factors will continue to impact PINS’ growth prospects in the near term."

The company can do this, particularly through contracts that secure the long-term operation of its nuclear facilities and facilitate new renewable energy projects via its Constellation Offsite Renewables (CORe) program.
PPAs offer a steady, long-term source of income because they provide payments for power generated over a predetermined length of time. CEG believes that the CORe product offers an efficient approach for securing offsite renewable energy contracts, enabling businesses to contribute to the development of new wind, solar, or other renewable energy initiatives that supply power to the grid and correspond with their consumption through an uncomplicated retail renewable energy agreement.
Constellation Energy continues to expand its portfolio of PPAs with leading corporations, including 20-year nuclear deals with Meta for the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois and with Microsoft to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1, now renamed as the Crane Clean Energy Center.
CEG inked a more than $1 billion contract in January 2025 to supply nuclear electricity and energy-saving technologies for federal buildings. In addition to the previously planned Crane restart, Constellation and its partners intend to add over 1,100 MW of sustainable energy around the clock by 2028.
By developing new projects and facilities that align with corporate sustainability objectives, these partnerships also support Constellation Energy in achieving its goal of supplying carbon-free energy and contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Utilities Are Expanding Operations Through PPAs
PPAs mainly help utilities by giving them a steady, long-term source of income from renewable energy projects. PPAs provide long-term financial stability, which reduces market price volatility and promotes the expansion of renewable energy sources. Vistra VST is advancing its Deer Creek Solar & Storage project (50 MW solar/50 MW storage) and developing over 600 MW of solar PPAs with Microsoft (405 MW in Illinois) and Amazon (200 MW in Texas). Dominion Energy D and its subsidiaries rely heavily on long-term PPAs, which ensure earnings stability while enabling the integration of clean energy into its generation mix.
CEG Stock’s Earnings Estimates

This amusing revelation comes from Nick Clegg’s forthcoming book. Meta’s former president of global affairs shares the story in what Fast Company unfavorably describes as a book with “thin prose,” save for some “surprising anecdotes,” such as this tale of Clegg sparring with his deputy Joel Kaplan.
According to Clegg’s anecdote, Zuckerberg gathered some of Meta’s most senior executives to practice MMA with him at a management offsite. Kaplan, who has since taken over Clegg’s role after he stepped down earlier this year, apparently executed a mount that Clegg described as “too close for comfort.”
Judging by some brief research into MMA mounts, this does seem to be an intimate maneuver for a corporate setting.

AVGO’s Semiconductor segment revenues are anticipated to have benefited from strong demand for custom AI accelerators (XPUs), which are a type of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) necessary to train Generative AI models. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are notable users of Broadcom’s ASICs. AI revenues jumped 46% year over year to $4.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.
Strong demand for AI networking solutions, which skyrocketed 170% year over year and represented 40% of AI revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, has been a key catalyst. AVGO’s Ethernet-based AI networking enables a single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up architectures and hence is the preferred choice of Broadcom’s hyperscale customers.
Broadcom expects semiconductor revenues to jump 25% year over year to $9.1 billion. AVGO anticipates AI revenues to surge 60% year over year to $5.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Broadcom’s fiscal third-quarter Semiconductor revenues is pegged at $9.114 billion, indicating growth of 25.3% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.

AVGO’s Infrastructure Software to Benefit From VMware
VMware’s growing traction is expected to have driven the Infrastructure Software segment’s revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter. Broadcom’s focus on shifting VMware products to a subscription-based model and growing adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation (87% of the largest 10,000 customers were shifted by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025), which is anticipated to have aided top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Infrastructure Software revenues is pegged at $6.7 billion, indicating 15.6% year-over-year growth.
Lower-Margin XPUs to Hurt AVGO’s Gross Margin
Although Broadcom has been benefiting from higher sales of XPUs, these lower-margin solutions are expected to impact the gross margin negatively. AVGO forecasts the gross margin to decline 130 basis points (bps) sequentially. Broadcom expects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 66% in the fiscal third quarter, suggesting a 70-bps decline on a sequential basis.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Semiconductor operating income is pegged at $5.152 billion, indicating 27.5% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter but 7.2% sequential growth.

Also Read: Chipmaker Arm Is Riding AI Wave And Outperforming The Market
Weaker guidance, concerns about a slower payoff from AI investments, and speculation that the company may expand into building finished chips, potentially competing with its own customers, have tempered enthusiasm.
Broader risks, including trade tensions and potential tariffs, have also added pressure in the smartphone segment, a critical revenue source.
The wider AI buildout continues to attract massive spending from U.S. technology giants. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google have collectively committed more than $250 billion to AI infrastructure between 2025 and 2026.
That includes a projected $100 billion outlay by Meta in 2026, Google's raised 2025 forecast of $85 billion, and Microsoft's plans to spend over $100 billion annually.
The momentum has boosted other chipmakers. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported a 56% revenue surge to $46.74 billion, driven by demand for its Blackwell AI processors.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government deepened its commitment to domestic chipmaking, converting part of its CHIPS Act support into a $5.7 billion equity stake in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), giving it a 10% holding while helping stabilize Intel's struggling foundry unit.
Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about Arm's long-term outlook. Needham's Charles Shi, Rosenblatt's Kevin Cassidy, and Goldman Sachs' James Schneider have all pointed to the company's strong position in AI and data centers.
They highlighted Arm's new Compute Subsystem (CSS) architecture, which they expect will drive higher royalties and speed customer development cycles.
Still, analysts flagged near-term risks, citing rising operating expenses, the potential strain from moving deeper into chip production, and weaker royalty growth in the smartphone business.
Management's recent guidance also signaled a softer performance in the quarters ahead."

Shares of online advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) jumped 8.3% in the morning session after a U.S. judge's ruling in a major antitrust case eased fears of a forced break-up of the company.
The decision allows Google to retain control of its key businesses, including the Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system, which the U.S. Department of Justice had sought to divest.
Investors welcomed the news, seeing it as a ""massive win"" that helps the tech giant avoid the worst-case scenario. While the company was spared a structural break-up, the judge did bar Google from entering into certain exclusive search agreements in the future and will require modest data sharing with competitors. The ruling removes a significant regulatory overhang for the company.
Following the news, analysts at Needham reiterated a 'Buy' rating and raised their price target from $220 to $260, signaling renewed confidence.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Alphabet’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 22 hours ago when the stock dropped 2.1% on the news that the stock was caught in a broader tech-sector downturn fueled by renewed uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs.
The sell-off in tech stocks followed an appeals court ruling that recently imposed U.S. ""reciprocal"" tariffs are illegal, sparking fresh concerns about trade policy. The news pressured many of the world's largest technology companies, with Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft also seeing declines in trading. Alphabet's drop also comes after a strong five-month winning streak that pushed the stock into what some analysts consider ""overbought territory."" The stock's daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, had approached 75, a level that can signal a potential pullback or correction is imminent.
Alphabet is up 20.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $228.95 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Alphabet’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,810.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Sign up for smart news, insights, and analysis on the biggest financial stories of the day.
The storied writer F. Scott Fitzgerald once mused that “there are no second acts in American lives.” The Winklevoss twins might beg to differ.
On Tuesday, Gemini — a.k.a., the cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by twins and onetime Mark Zuckerberg betes noires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — announced it is seeking to raise as much as $317 million ahead of an IPO that would value the company at $2.2 billion. It’s no Facebook, but it’s something.
Running with the Bullish’s
The Winklevii have come a long way since their 2008 settlement with Facebook, which they claimed Zuck stole from them at Harvard. The pair invested early in bitcoin, becoming some of the world’s first bitcoin billionaires and launching Gemini in 2014. More recently, the company has been Exhibit A in the shifting landscape of crypto regulation. In January, days before the inauguration of Trump 2.0, Gemini paid a $5 million settlement to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after being found to have made false or misleading statements to the regulatory body. By February, a new-look Securities and Exchange Commission concluded a years-long investigation into the company by recommending no enforcement action; in a social media post, Cameron called it a “milestone to the end of the war on crypto.”
Now, Gemini wants to follow in the footsteps of fellow exchanges Circle and Bullish, which have both proven that Wall Street, too, is becoming more and more crypto-curious:
- In early June, stablecoin-issuer Circle popped in its trading debut, with its share price soaring more than 100% in the following weeks. Momentum has since slipped, however. Circle’s share price is now down roughly 50% from a July peak, paring gains since its debut to 11%.
- Then, last month, Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish similarly popped in its debut … and has, likewise, seen enthusiasm taper since. Its share price is now down around 11% from its launch.
Me, Myself and Gemini: For all the crypto enthusiasm, Gemini on Tuesday reported a net loss of $282.5 million against $68.6 million in total revenue through the first six months of 2025. That’s an acceleration from a net loss of $41.4 million on total revenue of $74.3 million in the same period a year ago. It’s blunt, and we’re sure the Winklevii don’t love to hear it, but it bears repeating: Gemini is no Facebook."

DIGITIMES vice president Eric Huang highlighted the shift in global industry power before and after the generative AI boom. In 2018, five technology companies ranked among the world's top ten by market capitalization. By mid-2025, nine of the top ten are technology firms. These firms all involve semiconductor, including semiconductor leaders Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSMC(2330.TW), and tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla, which integrate both software and hardware, and design their own chips.
Huang pointed to Taiwan and China's changing roles in contract manufacturing. In 2018, Taiwanese firms accounted for 78% of revenue among top original design manufacturers (ODMs) and electronics manufacturing services (EMS) companies, while China's share stood at 6.4%. By 2024, Taiwan's share fell to 65% as Chinese suppliers expanded to 22%, fueled by consumer electronics orders. In early 2025, however, Taiwan's share rebounded to 70%, driven by rising demand for AI servers from hyperscalers and Nvidia.
In the semiconductor sector, fabless companies have gained ground. Nvidia's chip revenue reached US$72 billion in 2024, giving it a 12% global share. TSMC remains the largest semiconductor company by revenue, with a 55% share in the global foundry market. Chinese foundries such as SMIC and Huahong are growing, with compound annual growth rates (CAGR) of 17.6% and 12.3% respectively, though they remain behind in advanced logic processes.
Huang described three ""battlefields"" shaping the technology landscape: supply chain relocation under the US-China rivalry, cloud and AI infrastructure, and edge AI. The first reflects a division of production capacity along geopolitical lines. Many firms have adopted ""China+1"" strategies, relocating assembly to Vietnam, India, and Mexico.
The second battlefield is the cloud. Nvidia's GPUs have overtaken Intel's Xeon CPUs and AMD's processors as the dominant platform for AI workloads.

- Coinbase unveiled a hybrid index called Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures.
- The futures index tracks Coinbase shares, “Magnificent 7” tech stocks, and Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.
- The product will be available through “partner platforms,” Coinbase said.
Coinbase is debuting futures in the U.S. that will simultaneously give traders exposure to cryptocurrencies and tech firms, CEO Brian Armstrong said on Tuesday.
The company is rolling out a hybrid index called “Mag 7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures,” and it will track “Magnificent 7” stocks, Coinbase’s own shares, and BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, according to a blog post.
Each of the index’s components are weighted equally, meaning a change in Bitcoin’s price will have a similar effect on the index as a change in the price of Nvidia’s shares. In addition to the chipmaker, the index tracks Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla shares.
The index uses BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and iShares Ethereum Trust ETFs for tracking the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Both products debuted in the U.S. last year, and they have generated billions of dollars of inflows.
The company plans on sharing more details about trading the index on “partner platforms,” suggesting that the product won’t be available through Coinbase’s app initially. The index is set to launch on September 22.
Decrypt reached out to Coinbase for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
Coinbase shares were little changed on Monday at $304.40, according to Yahoo Finance. The San Francisco-based firm’s stock price has rallied 22% year-to-date.
This year, Coinbase has leaned into its derivatives arm as an area of growth. In May, Coinbase unveiled a $2.9 billion deal to acquire the options exchange Deribit.
It is fairly commonplace for crypto exchanges to offer futures outside the U.S., but amid tension between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the practice has been mired in regulatory uncertainty for years.
Crypto exchange Kraken debuted U.S.-regulated crypto derivatives in mid-July. At the time, it said “commodity, fixed income, FX and equity futures” were coming, in a blog post. In March, Kraken said it would buy NinjaTrader, a futures broker, for $1.5 billion.
Prediction markets have also been buying firms that offer derivatives in the U.S., such as Polymarket. Last month, the firm said it was purchasing derivatives exchange QCX for $112 million, describing it as a key move for returning to U.S. markets."

As you can see in this example, shared by Meta ads expert Jon Loomer, Meta has now added a new “Restricted Words” option within its Advantage+ campaign set-up, which will enable you to ensure that certain terms are not included in any copy generations.
As Meta explains:
“Specify if there are certain words or phrases you don’t want to appear in AI-generated text options and we’ll exclude them in Advantage+ Creative text generation.”
So if there are any words or descriptors that you don’t think fit your brand, for whatever reason, you can now tell Meta’s system not to use them when it comes up with alternate variations of your ad text.
The update is the latest expansion of Meta’s branding control options for its AI ad tools, which also now include custom branding settings to ensure that your brand elements remain consistent within its visual AI generations.
It’s also another step towards Meta’s full-stream AI-generated ad flow, which will eventually be able to come up with complete ad campaigns, based on only a URL, with Meta’s full-service AI system able work out all the rest.
Though within that, you’ll probably still want to ensure that you maintain some manual control over your branding, and these options will provide some guard rails around your AI-based promotions.
And once Meta has the balance right on this element, that’ll be another step forward for its AI automation process.
Meta already has a range of elements for this purpose, including AI tools that can generate images from text, generate video from text or images, add backgrounds to product images, expand your product images into different formats, generate ad copy and more.
And these options are delivering better performance for many brands.
In its Q2 earnings report, which it published in July, Meta reported that its AI-powered recommendation model for ads drove a 5% improvement in ad conversions on Instagram, and a 3% improvement on Facebook in the period. Those may not seem like crazy high increases, but the data does show that Meta’s AI targeting is improving, and could help you reach more people that you may have missed through more specific manual targeting.
Having the capacity to control how your branding appears in these AI generations is another significant step, which could help you get better results from Meta’s AI ad tools."

(Reuters) -A U.S. lawsuit where Alphabet's Google was ordered on Tuesday to share search data with competitors is just one of the major efforts by U.S. antitrust enforcers to challenge Big Tech companies over their dominance.
Here are the statuses of the U.S. antitrust cases or probes against some of the world's most valuable companies: Alphabet's Google, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Nvidia.
The internet juggernaut is fighting the U.S. Department of Justice and state enforcers on two fronts. In one case, a judge in Washington ruled the company will have to share data with competitors to open up competition in online search and barred Google from entering exclusive agreements that would prohibit device makers from preinstalling rival products on new devices. Google has already hired a former Obama official to represent it in an appeals process which could take years.
The judge ruled, though, that Google would not have to sell its popular Chrome browser and Android operating system.
While Google will likely get a reprieve from complying with the ruling until the appeal is over, the search landscape has already started to shift, with Google preemptively loosening its deals with device makers and wireless carriers, and Apple saying it plans to add search options fueled by artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, Google is gearing up for a September trial in Alexandria, Virginia, to determine whether it must sell off part of its online advertising technology to make room for new entrants in the field, where it was found to have two illegal monopolies. Google has said it will appeal.
META
The Facebook parent company faced its own antitrust trial this year on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's bid to unwind Meta's acquisitions of prized assets Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency sought to show Meta strategically bought up emerging apps that it saw as potential Facebook rivals, partly through internal statements like a 2008 email in which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said ""it is better to buy than compete.""
Meta has said Zuckerberg's past intentions are irrelevant and the case must fail because it depends on a made-up social media market that leaves out ByteDance's TikTok, Alphabet's YouTube and others.
The judge overseeing the case in Washington is unlikely to rule before late 2025.
AMAZON
The online retail giant is battling the FTC and state enforcers in Seattle, where the agency has sued Amazon accusing it of using anti-competitive tactics to maintain dominance among online superstores and marketplaces."

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is stepping in to tighten safety controls on its AI chatbot after concerns that teens could encounter sexually explicit or suicidal content. The changes come after a Reuters report flagged how easily young users might access inappropriate behavior from the tool.
A Meta spokesperson said the company has temporarily restricted access to some AI characters while it develops longer-term fixes designed to ensure age-appropriate experiences. The company has been rolling out AI across its apps to boost engagement, but the risks around teen safety have quickly become a flashpoint.
The move shows Meta is trying to get ahead of growing scrutiny from regulators, parents, and advocacy groups. As the competition in AI heats up, how companies balance innovation with responsibility is becoming just as important as the technology itself.
Investors reacted cautiously. Meta shares closed down 1.7% on Friday, though they remain up more than 23% for the year still one of the strongest performers in Big Tech.The question now is whether Meta's latest steps will be enough to ease pressure and restore trust."

Shares of online advertising giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 2.1% in the afternoon session after the stock was caught in a broader tech-sector downturn fueled by renewed uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs.
The sell-off followed an appeals court ruling that recently imposed U.S. ""reciprocal"" tariffs are illegal, sparking fresh concerns about trade policy. The news pressured many of the world's largest technology companies, with Nvidia, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft also seeing declines in trading. Alphabet's drop also comes after a strong five-month winning streak that pushed the stock into what some analysts consider ""overbought territory."" The stock's daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator, had approached 75, a level that can signal a potential pullback or correction is imminent.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Alphabet’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago when the stock dropped 8.7% on the news that the company reported underwhelming fourth-quarter results.
Its total revenue was in line and its Google Cloud revenue missed, spooking some investors who had high expectations.
Given the secular trends surrounding Google Cloud along with its long-term profit margin potential, it was increasingly a sharp focus of investors and the market. We note that Microsoft's Azure division also posted worse-than-anticipated results, signaling the market was overly optimistic about cloud computing for Q4.
On the brighter side, advertising revenue slightly exceeded expectations, driven by strong contributions from both Search and YouTube. It was also encouraging to see Alphabet beat analysts' operating income expectations this quarter. In AI, the company earmarked $75 billion for capital expenditures in 2025—well ahead of Wall Street's estimates. It also rolled out its latest AI model, Gemini 2.0, to the public, aiming to expand its reach and stay competitive with rivals.
Zooming out, we think this was a mixed quarter with areas of underperformance weighing on shares that had made 52-week highs right before this earnings announcement."

And the data can provide some interesting trend insights. Like, for example the fact that Instagram is growing at 10x the rate of Facebook in EU.
The above charts (Facebook on the left, IG on the right) show how many users each platform has in each EU member state, with Facebook’s total EU usage coming in at 263.6 million monthly actives between January and June 2025, and Instagram reaching 281.8 million MAU in the same period.
Which is probably no real surprise. Instagram has had more European users than Facebook for some time, but it is interesting to note the relative growth of each, reflecting their broader popularity in the region.
Since March 2024, Facebook’s EU audience has grown 0.65%, while Instagram’s has risen by 6.17%. So not only is Instagram more popular, it’s increasing its lead, as Facebook stagnates in EU usage.
Indeed, Facebook has actually lost users in The Netherlands, Greece and Germany, reflecting a changing of the guard in the local social media markets.
Does that mean that Facebook is losing relevance more broadly?
It’s hard to say, because Meta no longer publishes Facebook-specific user counts in its quarterly updates, switching to the more positive-looking “Family of Apps” growth data, which reflects all users across Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp and Messenger.
And that number is increasing, but whether these same EU usage trends are also present in other markets, we can only speculate, though Europe is a key usage consideration for the app, and as such, could reflect broader shifts.
In terms of other data, Meta says that its human moderation team remains at 40k, which is the same level that it’s been at since it started reporting its DSA updates back in 2023. So despite Meta incorporating more AI elements into its systems, and switching to a Community Notes model in the U.S., it hasn’t cut its moderation staff at this stage.
Meta’s overall EU reporting data also shows a reduction in spam removals on both Facebook and Instagram, while removals based on bullying and harassment increased on Facebook significantly in the most recent period. There’s also been a 20% reduction in removals related to hate speech, though Meta has also changed the criteria for some elements, which makes direct comparisons difficult.
But the biggest trend note is the rise of IG, and the decline of Facebook, in relative terms. I mean, Facebook is still growing in Europe, and it is still seeing a lot of EU usage. But Instagram is now the big focus, which is likely reflective of broader trends.

Insiders including CEO Michael Intrator and hedge fund Magnetar have sold over 7 million shares of CoreWeave since its lockup period ended in August, according to Bloomberg data compiling company filings. Lockup periods prevent insiders — directors, senior officers, or investors who own more than 10% of a firm's voting shares — from selling their stock in a company for a period after it goes public to prevent a sudden drop in share price.
""Previous CRWV shareholders have been selling at a very rapid pace following the unlocking of shares,"" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria, who holds a Sell rating on CoreWeave, told Yahoo Finance. He added that the pace of the selling, along with how quickly it's occurring after the lockup deadline, indicates the insiders may think the stock price is overvalued.
Read more about CoreWeave's stock moves and today's market action.
CoreWeave went public in March for $40 per share. Its stock rocketed to a high above $183 in late June in what was viewed as a victory for the AI trade. The company rents capacity in its data centers, equipped with its massive store of Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, to Big Tech firms such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), as well as OpenAI (OPAI.PVT).
Shares ended Tuesday's trading session just above $93.
Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Felix Wang, who holds a short position on the stock, said ""the lock-up expiration was brutal given [the] stock was a bubble"" and noted that the AI trade is ""losing some momentum."" AI-linked stocks have suffered amid investor fears of a broader bubble related to the technology and as AI stalwart Nvidia's latest earnings fell short of investors' expectations.
Luria and Wang previously told Yahoo Finance that while they're optimistic about the AI trade, they see CoreWeave as a risky bet, in part due to its mounting debt borrowed at high interest rates.
Shares fell in mid-August after the company reported a disappointing quarterly outlook for its operating income and a mounting interest expense, indicating the company isn't generating enough profit to pay debt holders.
The rapid descent in CoreWeave's share price over the past two months adds some uncertainty to the company's acquisition of Core Scientific (CORZ), the analysts said. CoreWeave announced plans to acquire the data center provider in July in an all-stock transaction valued at $9 billion. But with its share value deteriorating, CoreWeave's stock offering to Core Scientific is worth a lot less."

- For years, people have been searching for the anonymous creator of Bitcoin.
- Satoshi Nakamoto is inching towards the top 10 Forbes list.
The quest to unmask Bitcoin’s mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto is coming to the big screen.
A new conspiracy thriller dubbed “Killing Satoshi” will start filming in London in October, and is set to hit box offices in 2026.
First reported by Variety, the film is backed by producer-turned-crypto-mogul Ryan Kavanaugh, who has financed other big-screen projects like “The Social Network,” and “Fast and Furious.”
Doug Liman, the man behind “The Bourne Identity,” will direct the film, which stars Casey Affleck and Pete Davidson.
“This is not just a movie about Bitcoin and its elusive and mysterious origins but really about what it stands for,” Kavanaugh told Variety, comparing it to his work in ”The Social Network,” which dramatised Facebook’s origin story.
“This should equally be a look into the world of what Bitcoin really is.”
“Killing Satoshi” will explore the theory that powerful forces — governments, Wall Street, Silicon Valley — have their own reasons for ensuring Satoshi’s identity never surfaces.
As Liman puts it, the film will follow “unlikely antiheroes taking on the most powerful people on the planet in an epic battle that strikes at the core of what is money and who controls it.”
The news about the upcoming film comes just as Bitcoin’s mysterious creator eyes up the top 10 Forbes richest list.
The untouched fortune
Nakamoto’s fortune has been one of the main reasons behind the long-running quest to find out who created Bitcoin.
Wallets attributed to Nakamoto estimate that the creator or creators have a 1 million Bitcoin stash. That fortune has the potential to place the creator in the Forbes top 10 richest list.
At Bitcoin’s current price of about $110,700, coins attributed to Nakamoto place the creator’s wealth at around $110 billion, landing it in 15th place, ahead of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.
For Satoshi to crack the top 10, however, Bitcoin would need to top $150,000 per coin — an important 25% jump from today’s level.
Ironically, if Bitcoin reaches those levels, Nakamoto will overtake none other than Warren Buffet — the 10th richest person in the world with a $150 billion net worth, who has called Bitcoin “rat poison,” and a “gambling token.”
Bitwise, Bernstein and Standard Chartered have all projected that the top cryptocurrency will hit $200,000 before 2026.
The first trillionaire
Some predictions send Satoshi flying even further up the list.
Fundstrat head of research turned Ethereum treasury shill Tom Lee has predicted that Bitcoin will top $500,000 in the next five years, while crypto angel investor Arthur Hayes says $1 million per coin is within reach.
At $1 million per coin, Satoshi would become the world’s first trillionaire, doubling Elon Musk’s current fortune of roughly $415 billion.
Hunting for Satoshi
Hollywood’s latest, albeit fictionalised, hunt for Satoshi adds to a long tail of people and projects in the real world who have attempted to unmask Bitcoin’s creator.
In fact, 2024 became the year of guessing who Satoshi could be.
In October, the Bitcoin community went berserk when a highly touted HBO documentary titled “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery” aired, pointing the finger at Peter Todd, a Bitcoin developer, as the anonymous creator of the now $2.2 trillion asset.
“The evidence simply led me to Todd,” Hoback said in an interview with DL News. “Todd has done an excellent job at muddying the waters in preparation for this moment.”
Todd, however, pushed back against the claim that was Nakamoto.
“His evidence is incredibly flimsy – conspiracy-thinking-level flimsy,” Todd told DL News.
Numerous guesses
Others have also asked themselves: Is it Jack Dorsey or Elon Musk?
Some have even claimed the CIA is behind Bitcoin, while Nick Szabo, Len Sassaman, and Hal Finney have also had their names thrown into the hat.
Self-proclaimed Nakamotos also exist. The most infamous is Australian developer Craig Wright, who took his claims to court. Last year, a UK judge ruled Wright is not Bitcoin’s creator.
There’s also Stephen Mollah, who held a meeting at a private club in London to prove to journalists he was the creator of Bitcoin.
He couldn’t manage to make his computer work, as our reporter who covered the event noted.

But it didn’t include AI-generated backgrounds, which are available in other Meta apps. But now, Meta’s bringing that option to WhatsApp as well, as it continues to expand its gen AI tools to as many places and elements as it possibly can, with a view to dominating the AI race.
WhatsApp’s preset filters, meanwhile, will give you easy options to set your background with beach scenes, forests, etc.
I mean, I don’t know that you need to vary your background that much in WhatsApp chats, considering that you’re likely to be speaking to people you know in the app. But with Meta also looking to make WhatsApp a more valuable tool for professional connection, it’ll give you another consideration.
So more AI from Meta, in more places, so you can create imaginary variations of things that you’re not actually experiencing.
It does seem a little weird that Meta’s so dedicated to helping people project an unrealistic image of themselves or their life via social apps, where we should all be looking to connect around real experiences.
But Zuck’s clearly excited about his AI tools, and as such, you can expect to see more of them, in more places, over time."

The performance was driven largely by its data center business, which has become the company’s main growth engine.
Even with export restrictions weighing on its H20 chip shipments to China, demand for artificial intelligence (AI) compute remained strong across cloud providers, enterprises, and sovereign AI projects. At the center of this momentum is the Blackwell platform. NVIDIA has begun high-volume shipments of the GB300, with output now exceeding 1,000 racks per week.
Customers are turning to Blackwell for its energy efficiency and significant performance gains compared to Hopper, making it a preferred choice for running advanced reasoning AI and inference workloads. With major players like OpenAI, Meta, and global cloud providers adopting Blackwell at scale, NVIDIA has positioned itself at the heart of the next wave of AI buildouts.
For the third quarter, NVIDIA expects revenues to reach $54 billion, representing 55% year-over-year growth and a 16% sequential rise. Importantly, this forecast does not assume sales of H20 chips to China, leaving room for potential upside if export approvals from the U.S. government materialize. Gross margins are projected to expand 12.5 percentage points sequentially to 73.5% despite increasing costs associated with increasing Blackwell production. This reflects both strong demand and operational leverage.
If NVIDIA manages to keep the Blackwell supply pace with the soaring global demand, it should secure its growth trajectory into the next phase of the AI cycle. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $202.95 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 55.5%.
Competition Heats Up for NVIDIA in AI Infrastructure
NVIDIA’s major competitors, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Intel INTC, are also stepping up their capabilities in the data center AI chip market.
Advanced Micro Devices’ MI300X GPUs are gaining attention for their high memory and power efficiency. Several hyperscalers are testing AMD’s solutions as alternatives to NVIDIA’s Blackwell, especially in cost-sensitive or specialized workloads. Advanced Micro Devices is also building a strong software stack to grab more customers.
Intel is focusing on both CPUs and AI accelerators to grab a market share in the data center space. The company is promoting its Gaudi 3 AI chips as a low-cost option for training and inference. Intel is also working with major cloud providers to expand the adoption of its AI hardware."

These three companies own those critical layers, making them permanent fixtures in the AI economy, regardless of which chatbot wins or which start-up goes viral.
The silicon monopoly
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has turned AI compute into a tollbooth business. Every major AI breakthrough -- from ChatGPT to Midjourney to autonomous vehicles -- runs on Nvidia silicon.
Q2 fiscal 2026 total revenue hit $46.7 billion, up 56% year over year, with data center revenue alone reaching $41.1 billion. The company's Blackwell architecture is already sold out through 2026, with customers including Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) placing orders measured in tens of thousands of units.
The moat goes deeper than just fast chips. CUDA, Nvidia's programming platform, has 5 million developers trained on its architecture -- a switching cost measured in years of retraining. Trading at 39 times forward earnings might seem rich, but consider this: 73% gross margins, $54 billion in Q3 guidance, and a new $60 billion buyback authorization. When Jensen Huang says ""the next industrial revolution has begun,"" he's not being hyperbolic -- he's describing a market Nvidia already owns.
The attention merchant's AI play
Meta Platforms discovered something competitors missed: You don't need to charge for AI when you own the world's attention. The company's LLaMA models, given away free, have become the Linux of AI -- powering everything from start-up prototypes to enterprise deployments. Meanwhile, Meta's real AI runs behind the scenes, optimizing 3 billion daily users' feeds and delivering ads with surgical precision.
Q2 2025 revenue jumped 22% to $47.5 billion, with advertising alone generating $46.6 billion. Reality Labs burns over $4 billion quarterly chasing the metaverse, but that's a rounding error against $20 billion in quarterly operating income. The company sits on $47 billion in cash and marketable securities while trading at just 28 times forward earnings -- cheaper than most software companies by a wide margin. Meta's platforms generate billions of new posts, photos, and videos daily -- a proprietary training dataset no competitor can buy at any price.
The ""everything store"" for AI
Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) plays the ultimate arms dealer strategy -- it doesn't matter whose AI wins, as long as they're all paying AWS to run it. Q2 2025 saw AWS revenue hit $30.9 billion, up 17.5%, capturing 31% of global cloud infrastructure spending. The unit's 32.9% operating margins might be down from its prior peak, but that's because Amazon is aggressively building AI capacity. Its custom Trainium and Inferentia chips offer customers alternatives to Nvidia at 40% lower cost, while Bedrock makes deploying AI models as simple as clicking a button.
The bull case is straightforward: Amazon generated $121 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months, giving it unlimited firepower to build AI infrastructure. AWS's $195 billion backlog (up 25% year over year) locks in future revenue with multiyear contracts and massive switching costs. Every AI start-up, enterprise deployment, and government project strengthens the moat.
At 34.6 times forward earnings, Amazon trades like the toll road to the AI economy -- and that's precisely what it is.
The three pillars of permanent value
These aren't speculative AI bets chasing viral adoption. Nvidia dominates the compute layer, controlling more than 90% of the AI training GPU market. Meta owns the consumer layer, with 3 billion users generating unmatched training data for its algorithms. Amazon controls the enterprise layer, with cloud infrastructure and multiyear contracts that no start-up can replicate.
Hundreds of AI companies will rise and fall over the next decade, but these three will collect rent from all of them -- making them true buy-and-hold candidates for the long term."

NVIDIA, Meta and Amazon: Top Momentum Plays in the Mag 7
Richard Driehaus has secured a spot on Barron’s All-Century Team through a strategy that employs the “buy high and sell higher"" theory. It’s clearly a successful investment method that can be used to select top momentum stocks.
In pursuit of that goal, three of the magnificent 7 stocks, NVIDIA Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc., have been chosen as momentum stocks to monitor currently, employing the Driehaus strategy.
A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus Strategy
Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said, “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.
It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.
Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.
Here are three of the 13 stocks:
NVIDIA
NVIDIA, a company focused on computing infrastructure, offers solutions for graphics, computing, and networking within the United States, as well as in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and other countries worldwide (read more: Can QUBT Become the Next NVIDIA, and Should You Buy the Stock?).
NVDA has a Zacks Rank 3 and a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for NVDA is 3.6%, on average (read more: NVIDIA Vs. CoreWeave: Which Stock Offers Greater AI Upside?).
Meta Platforms
Meta develops products that allow people to connect and share with friends and family using mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality and mixed reality headsets, augmented reality, and wearables globally."

However, the reality is that many of these companies are still experiencing rapid growth and anticipate even greater gains on the horizon.
By investing now, you can get in on the second wave of AI investing success before it hits. While it won't be nearly as lucrative as the first round that occurred from 2023 to 2024, it should still provide market-beating results, making these stocks great buys now.
AI Hardware: Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia
The demand for AI computing power appears to be insatiable. All of the AI hyperscalers are spending record amounts on building data centers in 2025, but they're also projecting to top that number in 2026. This bodes well for companies supplying products to fill those data centers with the computing power needed for processing AI workloads.
Two of my favorites in this space are Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have been the primary computing muscle for AI workloads so far. Thousands of GPUs are connected in clusters due to their ability to process multiple calculations in parallel, creating a powerful computing machine designed for training and processing AI workloads.
Inside these GPUs are chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's leading contract chip manufacturer. TSMC also supplies chips to Nvidia's competitors, such as Advanced Micro Devices, so it's playing both sides of the arms race. This is a great position to be in, and it has led to impressive growth for TSMC.
Both Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia are capitalizing on massive data center demand, and have the growth to back it up. In Q2 FY 2026 (ending July 27), Nvidia's revenue increased by 56% year over year. Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose by 44% in its corresponding Q2, showcasing the strength of both of these businesses.
With data center demand only expected to increase, both of these companies make for smart buys now.
AI Hyperscalers: Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms
The AI hyperscalers are companies that spend a significant amount of money on AI computing capacity for internal use and to provide tools for consumers. Three major players in this space are Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%).
Amazon makes this list due to the boost its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is experiencing. Cloud computing is benefiting from the AI arms race because it allows clients to rent computing power from companies that have more resources than they do. AWS is the market leader in this space, and it is a huge part of Amazon's business. Despite making up only 18% of Q2 revenue, it generated 53% of Amazon's operating profits. AWS is a significant beneficiary of AI and is helping drive the stock higher.
Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) also has a cloud computing wing with Google Cloud, but it's also developing one of the highest-performing generative AI models: Gemini. Alphabet has integrated Gemini into nearly all of its products, including its most important, Google Search.
With the integration of generative AI into the traditional Google Search, Alphabet has bridged a gap that many investors feared would be the end for Google. This hasn't been the case, and Alphabet's impressive 12% growth in Google Search revenue in Q2 supports that. Despite its strong growth, Alphabet is by far the cheapest stock on this list, trading for less than 21 times forward earnings.
With Alphabet's strength and strong position, combined with a cheap stock valuation, it's an excellent one to buy now.
To round out this list, Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is another smart pick. It's the parent company of social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, and gets a huge amount of money from ads. As a result, it's investing significant resources into improving how AI designs and targets ads, and it's already seeing some effects. AI has already increased the amount of time users spend on Facebook and Instagram, and is also driving more ad conversions.
We're just scratching the surface of what AI can do for Meta's business, and with Meta spending a significant amount of money on top AI talent, it should be able to convert that into some substantial business wins.
AI is a significant boost for the world's largest companies, and I wouldn't be surprised to see them outperform the broader market in the coming year as a result."

We want to hear how it has affected you – email us at money@telegraph.co.uk*
When lay-offs hit my role as a senior copywriter at Virgin Media O2 in August 2023, I knew the job hunt wouldn’t be easy. But two years, a drained bank account and a psychiatric unit later, I never imagined it would be this brutal.
After a year or so of mass layoffs at major tech firms including Meta, Microsoft and Google – amid many others – Virgin Media O2 followed suit, giving 2,000 workers – 12pc of its workforce – the chop.
I lost jobs during the credit crunch and pandemic, but I found a new role with relative ease. This time it has been different. After the recent bloodbath of redundancies, those crises seem to pale compared with the challenges of 2025.
UK unemployment stands at 4.7pc – the highest since 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics. Nearly 90,000 redundancies were made between March and May alone.
Vacancies have plunged. Employers are holding back hiring amid uncertainty. Recruiters say placements fell in June at the fastest rate in nearly two years – down 145,000 from a year ago and still below pre-pandemic levels.
There are now 2.3 unemployed people per job vacancy, up from 1.7 before the pandemic. Five hundred applicants per role is now the norm.
It’s brutal out there. Once you’ve applied, you rarely hear back. Six in 10 jobseekers get no feedback after interviews, HR trade body the CIPD found.
You need to be superhuman to job hunt now without letting it grind you down. I’ve applied for over 5,000 jobs on LinkedIn alone. Hours go into tweaking my CV, writing cover letters and answering irrelevant diversity questions about whether I believe in God and whether I fancy men, women or both. Yet I could count on my fingers the number of interviews I’ve had.
I’ve applied for jobs outside my remit: retail, serving coffee, caring for the elderly. On the odd occasion I’ve received feedback, the rejection is always because there are hundreds of people in front of me with more experience.
Royal Mail turned me down for a cleaning job at a depot because they had a long line of applicants with cleaning experience. A pre-school turned me down for looking after children with autism and gave it to someone with experience. The only way I can think of to get a look-in is to lie on my CV.
The endless effort with no return isn’t a pain you can pinpoint like a toothache. It spreads everywhere – mentally, physically, financially. The turmoil consumes your waking hours. It follows you to bed and seeps into your nightmares."

According to an internal memo sent by Wang and reviewed by Business Insider, Meta has reorganized its artificial intelligence division into four specialized groups designed to push its ""superintelligence labs"" initiative forward.
Wang acknowledged in his memo that ""org changes can be disruptive,"" but argued that restructuring was critical for Meta to compete in the race toward superintelligence.
The shift mirrors a broader Silicon Valley movement toward lean operations. Kashish Gupta, co-founder of Hightouch, a San Francisco AI startup valued at $1.2 billion, told Business Insider his company relies on about 55 engineers despite raising more than $132 million.

US stocks sank on Tuesday but finished off their session lows, kicking off what is historically the worst trading month of the year as Wall Street looked ahead to a crucial jobs report that could shape expectations for interest-rate cuts.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell around 250 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped about 0.7% for its worst day in over a month.

Similarly, the benchmark 10-year (^TNX) yield rose to near 4.3%.
Wall Street kicked off the holiday-shortened week — after Monday’s Labor Day closure — bracing for a potentially tumultuous month, with legal drama around President Trump's tariffs and concerns over Federal Reserve independence in focus.
Gold (GC=F) topped the all-time highs seen earlier this spring, trading around $3,600 an ounce on expectations the Fed will cut rates this month after Chair Jerome Powell signaled openness to a move.
Those bets face a key test in Friday’s August jobs report, with job openings and private payrolls due ahead of it. Meanwhile, an update Tuesday showed U.S. manufacturing contracted for the sixth straight month in August.
Markets are currently pricing in roughly 90% odds of a 25 basis point rate cut in September, but this week's data could help make the case for deeper easing.
Investors are also watching Washington, where a court hearing on whether Trump can fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook ended without a ruling, even as he seeks to reshape the Board of Governors.
And in a major blow to Trump’s trade agenda, a federal appeals court ruled most of his global tariffs unconstitutional. Trump blasted the decision as “highly partisan” and vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court as soon as Tuesday.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped around 2% on Tuesday, part of a broader pullback in AI names, after the chipmaker pushed back against media reports suggesting its AI chips were “sold out.”
In a post on X, Nvidia said chatter claiming supply constraints on its H100 and H200 processors was “erroneous,” reiterating comments from its earnings call last week that customers can continue to rent the chips through cloud providers and that new orders are being filled without delay.
“The rumor that H20 reduced our supply of either H100/H200 or Blackwell is also categorically false — selling H20 has no impact on our ability to supply other NVIDIA products,” the company wrote.
Even so, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared to acknowledge some speculation last week, telling investors on the call, ""The buzz is everything’s sold out. H100 is sold out, H200s are sold out.""
Nvidia reported 56% growth in data center revenue in Q2, which fell short of Wall Street’s lofty expectations.
Analysts said the shortfall suggests that demand for Nvidia’s chips continues to far outpace supply, raising questions about whether production can scale fast enough to meet orders.

Tariffs in legal limbo as Trump presses Supreme Court for emergency hearing
President Trump said Tuesday his administration will seek an immediate Supreme Court hearing after a federal appeals court ruled that most of his global tariffs were unlawful. He called the case “an economic emergency.”
“If we don’t win that decision, you’ll see a reverberation like maybe you’ve never seen before,” Trump said on CNN commentator Scott Jennings’ radio show.
The appeals court on Friday found Trump exceeded his authority by using emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs, affirming an earlier ruling from the Court of International Trade. The judges allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the case proceeds.
Trump blamed Tuesday's market sell-off on investor concerns over the tariff uncertainty: ""Without tariffs, we have an entirely different country,” he said.
While the ruling adds legal uncertainty, some Wall Street strategists said it does little to change the broader investment outlook.
“All told, the tariff-related news flow, as of now, does not really change our playbook into year-end,” Citi strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a Monday note to clients, noting the legal outcome remains unclear.
Chronert said fewer tariffs would likely ease margin pressure for companies, but striking them down would also remove a revenue stream investors have seen as a partial offset to the federal deficit, a shift that could revive fiscal concerns even as earnings improve.
Reflecting those worries, long-term Treasury yields moved higher on Tuesday, with the 30-year (^TYX) climbing about 5 basis points to 4.97%, approaching the 5% threshold often viewed as a headwind for stocks.

AI revolution could lift S&P 500 to 7,750 next year: Evercore
One Wall Street strategist is turning more bullish on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) as the benchmark index continues to soar to record highs.
Evercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel boosted his 2025 year-end price target on the index to 6,250 from 5,600 and now sees the S&P 500 climbing about 20% to 7,750 by the end of 2026, powered by what he calls a once-in-a-generation technological shift from artificial intelligence.
The near-term call represents a modest pullback from current levels. Emanuel’s longer-term outlook is more optimistic, underscoring his view that AI adoption will drive both earnings and valuations higher.
His bull case goes further: Emanuel envisions the S&P 500 rising to 9,000 if an ‘AI-driven asset bubble’ takes hold, a scenario he warns could be fueled by an overly accommodative Fed even as inflation pressures linger.
Emanuel said corrections of 10% or more are possible along the way but views them as buying opportunities within a structural bull market.
""Twice in a lifetime,"" Emanuel wrote in a Sunday note, comparing today’s AI-driven rally to the internet boom of the 1990s. The difference this time, he argues, is that AI adoption is unfolding more quickly, cutting across a wider swath of industries and creating broader investment opportunities.
In addition to his new S&P targets, the strategist raised his earnings forecasts to $264 EPS for 2025 from $255 and $287 for 2026 from $272, citing both resilience to tariffs and the productivity lift from AI.

China's AI capex is 'quickly catching up with US': Analyst
Jefferies analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note to clients over the weekend that capital expenditures from China's three big cloud service providers — Tencent (0700.HK), Alibaba (BABA), and Baidu (BIDU) — as well as ByteDance, are ""quickly catching up"" with the US.
Although spending by those cloud players was only 15% of spending by their US peers, according to Jefferies, the ratio of the Chinese companies' capital expenditures to cloud revenue has exceeded that of their American peers since the fourth quarter of 2024.
""That indicates Chinese CSPs [cloud service providers] are likely becoming even more aggressive than their US peers in AI/cloud capex,"" Lee wrote.

Nvidia falls 3%, extending last week's losses
Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell roughly 3% Tuesday, extending a decline last Friday.
Nvidia shares dropped more than 3% Friday and shed about 2% for the week.
Friday's drop came after server maker Dell (DELL), a customer of Nvidia, gave a third quarter earnings outlook below Wall Street's estimates, while a new report said Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) is testing a new chip to compete with Nvidia and AMD in China.
Shares of Nvidia have been under pressure amid fears of an AI bubble and after its latest quarterly earnings report showed its data center revenue falling short of Wall Street's expectations.

Bonds sell off amid Fed, tariff uncertainty
Bonds, like stocks, kicked off September under pressure as tariff uncertainty, concerns over Federal Reserve independence, and a looming jobs report weighed on markets.
The 30-year US Treasury yield (^TYX) rose 4 basis points to 4.95%, just shy of the key 5% level. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year (^TNX) yield also rose 4 basis points to 4.26%, and the 5-year yield (^FVX) increased 3 basis points to 3.73%.
Bond yields and prices have an inverse relationship, so rising yields suggest investors were selling bonds.
Elsewhere, European long-dated bond yields in France, Germany, and the Netherlands also increased, rising to their highest levels in years amid fiscal concerns. But Japan's 10-year bonds fell on Tuesday after a strong auction.
There's also a seasonality factor. According to a Bloomberg analysis, long-dated government bonds typically perform poorly in September as pensions and fund managers rebalance portfolios and central bank policy changes tend to occur.

CoreWeave tumbles nearly 8%
AI data center operator and cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV) saw shares drop 7.8% Tuesday morning.
CoreWeave shares are still up 135% since the company's IPO in March, but the stock is down roughly 49% since its high above $183 in late June, putting its $9 billion all-stock deal to acquire Core Scientific (CORZ) at risk.
CoreWeave stock had plunged in early August after the company reported a disappointing quarterly outlook for its operating income, and fears of an AI bubble tested the tech trade.
Adding pressure to the stock, insiders including CEO Mike Intrator made moves to sell off shares last week, according to SEC filings.

Natural gas prices fall 3% after Russia announces major pipeline deal with China
Natural gas futures fell by more than 3% early Tuesday after Russia said it signed a major agreement for a natural gas pipeline with China that will more closely tie the two countries' energy industries together.
Russia's state-owned Gazprom announced Tuesday morning in comments from top executive Alexei Miller that the corporation, among the largest energy players in Russia, signed a legally binding agreement with Beijing to build the long-delayed Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which will move natural gas from the Siberian region of Russia to northern China via Mongolia.
Beijing has not yet confirmed details of the announcement.
Power of Sibera 2 is projected to allow Gazprom to ship as much as 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually for 30 years, Miller said, according to Bloomberg.
The project has long been eyed by Russian president Vladimir Putin as a key step toward backfilling funds that once came from Europe before the continent drastically reduced its purchases of Russian gas in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia accounted for 45% of Europe's gas imports in 2021; today, it accounts for just 18%, according to Reuters.
Prior to Russia's invasion, Europe had been buying as much as 150 billion cubic meters per year of Russian gas. The EU is currently considering moves that would ban Russian gas from short-term contracts starting in June 2026 at the latest, and ban shipments under existing long-term deals by the end of 2027.
It is unclear how much China would pay for the gas pumped in via the new pipeline, but it will be a lower price than what Europe pays, Miller said.
The fall in gas prices adds to a drop of more than 26% since the start of the year as a combination of weak demand and quickly increasing stores have pushed prices consistently downward.

Nestlé stock dips after CEO dismissed
Nestlé Swiss-listed stock dipped just over 1% on Tuesday following the dismissal of CEO Laurent Freixe. He was fired after an investigation into an ""undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate,"" the food giant said.
Nestlé chairman Paul Bulcke said in a statement: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company.""
Replacing Freixe is Philipp Navratil, who was serving as CEO of Nestlé Nespresso.
Shares of the Swiss food and beverage company were down 18% over the past year heading into Tuesday's trading session.

Nio stock rises on better-than-expected adjusted net loss, Q3 delivery outlook
US-listed shares of Nio (NIO) rose 1.6% in premarket trading on Tuesday after the Chinese electric vehicle maker reduced its adjusted net loss amid fierce competition in China, where EV makers have been slashing prices.
The company reported an adjusted net loss of 4.12 billion yuan ($576.1 million), or a loss of 1.85 yuan ($0.25) per share, compared to expectations for a loss of 4.26 billion yuan ($597 million), or a 2.25 yuan ($0.32) loss per share.
The company delivered 72,056 vehicles in the second quarter, compared to 57,373 vehicles in the same quarter a year ago. It expects to deliver 89,000 vehicles in the third quarter, which would represent a record number of deliveries for the company.
Other US shares of Chinese EV makers were down in premarket trading, including BYD (BYDDY) and XPeng (XPEV).

Pepsi stock gains 5% after activist investor takes $4 billion stake
PepsiCo (PEP) stock jumped 5% in premarket trading on Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Elliott Investment Management built a $4 billion stake in the company.
According to the report, Elliott plans to use its position, which makes it one of Pepsi's top five shareholders excluding index funds, to angle for changes at the company and boost the share price.
Pepsi shares have underperformed this year as consumers drink less soda and eat fewer snacks, and as scrutiny over ingredients increases. Year to date, the stock is down 2%, compared to a nearly 10% rise in the S&P 500.
Pepsi has aimed to reverse some of these trends by leaning into other categories, such as energy drinks. Last week, the company announced it boosted its stake in energy drink maker Celsius in a $585 million deal.

Why hedge funds are starting September still cautious about US stocks
After becoming net sellers of US stocks in August, hedge funds remain hesitant about buying as September trading kicks off, Reuters reports.
The month has often been a downbeat one for markets. History looks set to repeat itself, even with a potential US interest-rate cut on the horizon.
Seasonal red flags, market fragility, a China buying spree, and a potential vicious circle of selling lie behind hedge funds' reluctance to join the recent rally, Wall Street sources say.

Indeed, for his keynote address, the Connect website says:
“Join Mark Zuckerberg as he shares the latest on AI glasses and lays out Meta’s vision for artificial intelligence and the metaverse.”
That’s right, the metaverse, that fictional, but maybe also real, VR-based environment where we’ll one day all be engaging with each other via virtual avatars in generated environments.
Believe in that or not, Meta’s still keeping it as part of its broader development vision, while we’ll also learn more about its latest VR headsets.
Which Meta actually previewed last week:
Take a peek into what the future of headsets might hold. pic.twitter.com/TYHg37jGUL
— Meta (@Meta) August 28, 2025
Meta doesn’t say that any of these prototypes will enter production, but this does provide a glimpse into what Meta’s been working on in the VR space, which is a big part of Zuckerberg’s future vision.
Also last week, details were reportedly leaked about Meta’s upcoming “Hypernova” AI glasses, which are expected to be the next evolution of its Ray Ban Meta glasses.
According to reports, Meta’s Hypernova glasses are scheduled to enter production later this year, with a view to selling around 200k units over the next two years. AI functionality will be the key focus of the new device, as opposed to full-immersive AR, which will be the next major leap for consumer wearables.
Yet at the same time, Meta is planning to integrate “a small augmented-reality display in the right lens,” that will be visible to the wearer. The company’s hope is that by integrating the first stage of its AR push, that will enable it to get to market with such ahead of Apple, which is also developing an updated version of its Vision Pro device.
Which also relates to pricing. At this stage, Meta’s Hypernova glasses are projected to cost around $800, which is a far cry from the $3.5k that Apple’s priced its initial Vision Pro units at. This has been a key focus for Meta, in finding cost efficiencies in order to bring the price down, and ensure mass adoption of its wearable devices. Apple seems less concerned about this aspect.
There’s been much discussion about Meta’s Hypernova project over the past few years, and it seems like we’re now only weeks away from seeing what the company’s actually planning, and where it’s placed in the broader AR race.
Meta has long maintained that its fully-immersive AR glasses won’t be available to consumers till 2027 at the earliest, though it is planning to release its current model Aria AR device to developers later this year.
So they are close, but the expectation is that Meta won’t be announcing any major changes in the Aria timeline at Connect.
But it is heading in that direction. And with Apple building Vision Pro 2, and Snap planning to push the launch of its AR device in stores next year, Meta likely needs to make a move in order to maximize its potential on this front.
Which Zuckerberg knows all too well. Meta’s been developing AI for years, but it wasn’t till OpenAI launched ChatGPT that Meta suddenly felt the need to accelerate its projects.
OpenAI is arguably still benefiting from first-mover advantage in this respect, and I suspect Meta won’t make the same mistake in letting Apple of Snap beat it to the punch with functional AR wearables."

In the second quarter of 2025, capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $17 billion. META now expects to spend between $66 billion and $72 billion in 2025 to support core business and AI efforts.
Meta Platforms recently announced that its data center in Kansas City, MO, is operational. The Kansas City Data Center’s electricity use is matched with 100% clean and renewable energy. The company is focusing on building AI-optimized data centers, the first of which is set to open in 2026. These data centers leverage AI solutions to prioritize resource efficiency.
Meta Platforms is one of the largest corporate buyers of clean and renewable energy globally, with more than 15 gigawatts of energy purchased across six countries. In June, Meta Platforms announced a 20-year corporate nuclear energy agreement with Constellation Energy for the Clinton Clean Energy Center, beginning 2027.
META is building its largest data center in Richland Parish, LA, which could cost $50 billion, per Reuters.
META Faces Tough Competition in the AI-Data Center Space
Meta Platforms is facing tough competition from the likes of Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN in the AI-data center space.
Microsoft’s aggressive AI strategy has become the cornerstone of its long-term growth vision, and a significant part of this approach hinges on soaring capital expenditures. Microsoft is investing heavily in data centers, GPUs and AI accelerators. Capital expenditure hit $24.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter and is projected to reach a record $30 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, primarily for AI infrastructure.
Amazon expects to spend more than $100 billion on capital expenditures in 2025. According to Success, Amazon’s Project Rainier spans multiple U.S. locations, including a massive campus in Indiana, which is made up of 30 data centers.
