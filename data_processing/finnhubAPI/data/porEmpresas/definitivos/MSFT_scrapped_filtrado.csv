finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-14T06:19:47,Class Action Alleges Microsoft Choked AI Supply to Lift ChatGPT Costs,"Microsoft is being accused of using cloud dominance to restrict AI compute, keeping ChatGPT costs artificially high for nearly three years.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cf2fb14fd362cb2e00cf308d41155a7ae4be0ea2d554e2200b4266557b4c08f4,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://decrypt.co/344168/class-action-microsoft-choked-ai-supply-lift-chatgpt-costs,https://decrypt.co/344168/class-action-microsoft-choked-ai-supply-lift-chatgpt-costs,https://decrypt.co/344168/class-action-microsoft-choked-ai-supply-lift-chatgpt-costs,decrypt.co,200,,"In brief
- Microsoft allegedly used an exclusive Azure agreement from 2019 to control compute supply to OpenAI, keeping ChatGPT prices artificially high while developing competing AI products.
- When OpenAI began buying compute from Google in June 2025, token prices reportedly dropped 80 percent within weeks, which plaintiffs say is evidence of the restraint.
- The lawsuit seeks damages for overcharges from November 2022 to February 2025, warning Microsoft still holds contractual power to throttle OpenAI's supply.
ChatGPT users have accused Microsoft of ""mercilessly"" choking OpenAI's compute supply through an exclusive cloud agreement, artificially inflating AI subscription prices while simultaneously rushing its own competing products to market.
The lawsuit, filed Monday in San Francisco federal court, alleges Microsoft ""secretly turned an investment into a stranglehold,"" using its Azure cloud dominance to restrict the computational resources needed to run ChatGPT, keeping prices at levels reaching ""100 to 200 times"" competitors' rates during a February 2025 AI price war.
Eleven ChatGPT Plus subscribers brought the case, alleging they overpaid for subscriptions and received degraded service from November 2022 through February 2025 due to Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct.
The lawsuit calls the case ""a sequel to U.S. v. Microsoft,"" invoking the company's 1990s antitrust battles and characterizing it as a ""recidivist violator"" that has ""ported the same exclusionary playbook into AI.""
Microsoft’s 2019 deal gave exclusive rights to supply Azure compute to OpenAI’s commercial models, effectively giving the company contractual control over a “horizontal competitor’s supply chain” while it built its own generative AI products, according to the filing.
The plaintiffs define a new antitrust market, the Consumer Generative AI Market, encompassing subscription products like ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Gemini Advanced, and DeepSeek Chat.
Microsoft reportedly holds a 49% stake in OpenAI’s for-profit arm and takes 20% of its paid-product revenue, the lawsuit alleges, effectively “profiting twice—first from compute sales, and again from the very AI product it constrains.”
When OpenAI began purchasing compute from Google Cloud in June 2025, ending Microsoft's exclusivity, ChatGPT token prices dropped 80 percent within weeks, according to the complaint.
A ‘powerful experiment’
The complaint calls it a “powerful natural experiment” showing Microsoft’s “anticompetitive restraint,” noting that before the shift, ChatGPT users faced “poor quality, unreleased innovations, and slow response times.”
""On proof, the strongest evidence would be the exclusive agreement itself,"" Navodaya Singh Rajpurohit, legal partner at Coinque Consulting, told Decrypt. ""If that document shows Microsoft held or used control over OpenAI compute, that is primary proof. If it is not available, internal emails and capacity records can still carry the case.""
“Restraint of trade turns on control,” Rajpurohit said, adding the claim is strong if Microsoft actually exercised or clearly held that control, but weaker if it did not.
The complaint also alleges Microsoft “still retains the contractual ability to restrict OpenAI’s compute purchases,” a power that lingers “as a sword of Damocles over OpenAI, wielded by one of its principal competitors.”
Plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a permanent injunction barring Microsoft from exclusive compute deals with OpenAI, along with disclosure of internal communications on compute supply, pricing, and integration.
""The court can do more than fine the company,"" Rajpurohit explained. ""It can order changes to the OpenAI arrangement, remove exclusive terms, and set guardrails that prevent future choke points.”
The class-action arrives amid shifts in the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship. Japan’s SoftBank is reportedly negotiating to invest up to $25 billion in OpenAI, surpassing Microsoft's $13 billion stake. Meanwhile, Microsoft has agreed under the Stargate project to end its exclusive cloud provider status.
Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s requests for comment."

Don't take my word for it: The world's five most valuable companies -- each with market caps of more than $2 trillion -- are leading innovators in the field of AI.
AI chipmaker Nvidia recently became the world's largest publicly traded company, valued at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the industry standard for AI workloads. Enterprise and cloud provider Microsoft provides a growing suite of AI tools, whikch has driven its value to $3.9 trillion. With more than 1 billion iPhones in the wild, Apple has a captive audience for its Apple Intelligence (AI) ambitions, pushing its market cap to $3.8 trillion. Cloud and AI leaders Alphabet and Amazon round out the top five, boasting values of $2.9 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.
With a market cap of roughly $1.5 trillion (as of this writing), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%), often referred to as TSMC, is on the fast track to join this elite fraternity. The adoption of AI continues at a hectic pace, fueling blistering demand for its most advanced chips. As the world's largest and most renowned semiconductor foundry, TSMC is on the fast track to meet the requirements for membership in this exclusive club -- and it might happen sooner than investors realize.
Want chips with that?
TMSC has worked behind the scenes for years, fabricating the most advanced processors, but recently found itself in the spotlight. Management bills the company as the ""world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry,"" making it a critical provider in the supply chain for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI.
And make no mistake, no foundry is as well-regarded as TSMC. Its customer list reads like the Who's-Who of tech glitterati, and includes Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others.
With the surge in demand for AI-centric processors, TSMC is no longer dependent merely on smartphone chips. In fact, the lion's share of the company's revenue now comes from the advanced processors needed for HPC and AI, recently responsible for 60% of sales.
TSMC's growth continues to accelerate. In the second quarter, revenue of $30 billion grew 44% in U.S. dollars, while earnings per ADR soared 67% to $2.47. Management expects this trend to continue. TSMC is calling for third-quarter revenue of $32.4 billion in USD at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 38%, and the company has been known to underpromise and overdeliver.
The path to $1 trillion
TSMC is in an enviable position as the world scrambles to adopt this groundbreaking technology. The company is well positioned to benefit from advances in generative AI, counting the biggest names in technology as its customers. Furthermore, TSMC's rapid revenue growth is the clearest sign yet that it is poised to profit from this opportunity. As such, TSMC should soon be joining the company of multi-trillionaires.
According to Wall Street, TSMC is on track to generate revenue of $123.3 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 12.8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSMC would have to generate revenue of roughly $156 billion annually to justify a $2 trillion market cap.
It's telling that Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 16% and 18% in 2026 and 2027, respectively. If the company achieves those relatively low hurdles, it will likely achieve a $2 trillion market cap sometime in 2027. That said, given the company's accelerating growth in recent years, it will likely make the grade even sooner.
Estimates regarding the market potential of AI continue to rachet higher. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the coming decade. That could be conservative, as new use cases for AI are continually being developed.
Finally, at roughly 30 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors a practical way to invest in a once-in-a-generation opportunity."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-14T01:01:00,2 Soaring Stocks to Hold for the Next 20 Years,All is well for these two market leaders.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7217c1624d905c98611979667fb44feac9643cb51385c152bdbc3da05c25a15e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/2-soaring-stocks-to-hold-for-the-next-20-years/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/2-soaring-stocks-to-hold-for-the-next-20-years/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/2-soaring-stocks-to-hold-for-the-next-20-years/,fool.com,200,,"It hasn't been an easy year for equity markets. In times like these, though, it's important to remember that the buy-and-hold approach to stock investing remains one of the best and most accessible ways to grow wealth over time. So, rather than being rattled by current market volatility or economic uncertainty, it's more helpful to focus on finding companies that can perform well over the next few decades. While most corporations can't pull that off, here are two that have what it takes: Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) and Shopify (SHOP 2.22%). These two companies have crushed the market this year, and there is plenty of upside left for patient investors.
1. Microsoft
Microsoft was among the 10 biggest stocks by market cap in 2005. It remains the only member of the top 10 ranking of 2005 to maintain a spot on the list 20 years later. That's a testament to Microsoft's longevity. Even though past successes don't guarantee future outcomes, the tech leader still possesses the qualities of a corporation capable of thriving for the next two decades. Microsoft remains by far the dominant force in the market for computer operating systems (OS). Its Microsoft 365 productivity tools are part of the day-to-day lives and operations of millions of individuals and businesses.
That's no longer Microsoft's main growth driver, but the company's deep, long-standing enterprise relationships are helping its all-important cloud computing business perform well. The company's Azure platform hosts Microsoft 365 services. For businesses that already use the latter, there are many advantages to also using the former as opposed to some other cloud service. That, combined with the tech giant's relationship with OpenAI -- perhaps the leader in AI -- is helping Microsoft gain market share against its longtime rival in the cloud, Amazon. The latter still has the edge, but Microsoft has been growing its sales faster.
The great news is that there is still plenty of room to grow, as we are still arguably in the early stages of both the cloud and AI revolutions. As Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said, some 85% of IT spending still happens on premises. Further, Microsoft benefits from a strong economic moat thanks to high switching costs and a strong brand name. So, Microsoft can ride this tailwind over the next 20 years and deliver excellent returns to its shareholders once again. The company has crushed the market this year, and there is plenty more where that came from.
2. Shopify
Shopify was founded in 2006, so it didn't exist 20 years ago. Since it came on the scene, though, it has catapulted itself as one of the leading e-commerce companies in the world. In the U.S., Shopify holds a more than 12% market share by gross merchandise volume. How did Shopify accomplish this feat? The company helped revolutionize the way merchants set up online storefronts. Shopify provides all the tools its clients need on its website. It is easy to set up and use; there is no need to be an expert in coding, and the platform is highly customizable -- all things that were lacking before Shopify came around.
Shopify also offers marketing tools, payment processing, and more. The company has evolved with the internet, enabling sales across social media channels. It recently announced a deal with OpenAI that will allow its merchants to sell products directly through ChatGPT.
Shopify has been rewarded for its efforts as the e-commerce space has grown significantly over the past 19 years. Yet, even this industry is still on a long-term growth path. While it's impossible to know what the size of the sector will be in 20 years, its penetration remains pretty low -- 16.3% as of the second quarter -- even in the U.S. Further, Shopify operates in over 175 countries, but still makes most of its money in the U.S.
International expansions should be another powerful tailwind for the e-commerce specialist. Over the next 20 years, Shopify could perform very well as it remains a leader in the field and continues to innovate. Investors should consider hopping along for the ride."

SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP), the nonprofit international organization bringing at-scale innovations and hyperscale best practices to all, announces an expansion to its Open Systems for AI, an umbrella initiative with the new Open Data Center for AI Strategic Initiative (SI), to increase efforts on key data center infrastructure challenges: power, cooling, mechanical, and management telemetry. The addition of this new strategic initiative is in response to a large increase in data center physical infrastructure projects and workstreams launched in the past year, learnings from the OCP Open Systems for AI SI workshop series, and the new open-letter call for collaboration. With strong support from the OCP Board and stakeholders, the Foundation invites other organizations to sign this letter, which was initiated by Google, Meta, and Microsoft.. This underscores the OCP Foundation's mission to support the entire open data center ecosystem, covering IT as well as physical data center infrastructure and facilities.
The mandate of the Open Data Center for AI SI is to develop standardizations for data center infrastructure allowing advanced high-density AI infrastructure to be deployed as flexibly as traditional compute where facilities are built with a common understanding of management telemetry, advanced power and cooling technologies to enable simpler deployment of a wide variety of AI solutions. The issue faced by data center partners including hyperscalers, neoclouds, co-location providers, enterprise users, and technology providers is that siloed efforts produce competing design requirements that slows innovations and extends deployment timelines. The goal is to identify and specify requirements for AI data centers such that the physical infrastructure common ground enables fungibility for a diverse AI IT infrastructure, especially while aspects of the AI IT elements are rapidly evolving. This will enable colocation data center providers to support a wider range of tenants with fewer customizations.
""The OCP Community's vision of the open data center ecosystem continues to enable solving the challenges of building at-scale AI clusters and the infrastructure that houses them. We are continuing to utilize OCP's open, collaborative, and unique value proposition and its large community and ecosystem to develop open specifications and standards that address the bottlenecks that threaten to constrain the future of AI growth. We firmly believe OCP's role in fostering development of open, standardized, sustainable, and scalable infrastructure to be increasingly vital to the industry and its supply chain enabling it to deliver on AI's transformative potential cost effectively and with faster TTM, while managing its environmental impact,"" said George Tchaparian, CEO at the Open Compute Project Foundation."

The DGX Spark, which Nvidia said offers data center-class performance, packs the company's GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, as well as its ConnectX-7 networking capabilities and software stack.
The idea is to provide smaller businesses and developers with access to an AI computing system without requiring them to spend thousands on renting AI data center services or buying their own AI servers.
The Spark is part of a new class of computer Nvidia is rolling out with third-party partners, including ASUS (2357.TW) and Dell (DELL), which will allow customers to develop and use AI models on their own local devices.
Nvidia said the Spark can be outfitted with up to 128GB of memory, which should help when running massive AI models.
“In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon [Musk] at a small startup called OpenAI — and from it came ChatGPT, kickstarting the AI revolution,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
“DGX-1 launched the era of AI supercomputers and unlocked the scaling laws that drive modern AI. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.”
Like the DGX-1, Huang also hand-delivered one of the first Spark systems to Musk.
The company also has a larger, more powerful DGX Station, which runs on Nvidia's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra desktop superchip.
But don't expect to grab a Spark or Station and start running your video games or other apps. The system runs on Nvidia's own Linux-based DGX OS and its AI software stack and is specifically designed for building and running AI models.
Nvidia also said users can connect two Spark systems to allow for even larger AI models with up to 405 billion parameters.
The Spark and Station are designed to complement Nvidia's existing AI offerings, enabling users to prototype AI models before deploying them more widely.
Nvidia holds the pole position in the AI chip race thanks to both its powerful processors and CUDA software service.
In addition to its desktop systems, the company continues to ink massive deals with AI companies, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) that will see the ChatGPT developer purchase 10 gigawatts of GPUs.
Last month, Nvidia signed a deal that will see CoreWeave (CRWV) purchase $6.3 billion worth of GPUs from the chip giant.
The company is also providing GPUs to Elon Musk's xAI (XAAI.PVT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and a slew of other tech behemoths — not to mention OpenAI and Oracle's (ORCL) joint Stargate Project venture."

Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) and SoftBank are said to be in talks to put up to $2 billion into Wayve, a UK firm that is working on making AI for self-driving cars. The Financial Times was the first to report on the sale. If it goes through, Wayve would be worth almost $8 billion.
Wayve is one of a small number of new businesses that is doing something different with self-driving cars. Instead of using pre-set rules or maps, its AI models learn by watching how people drive and changing to fit the conditions of the actual world. The company's mission is to make cars smarter and safer by always learning.
These talks are happening at a time when more and more people are putting money into transportation that uses AI. Nvidia said earlier this year that it would contribute $500 million into Wayve as part of a $2.7 billion plan to make the UK's AI ecosystem better. Wayve could get the money it needs to test and sell its technology if Microsoft and SoftBank join aboard.
The move would make Microsoft more involved in AI infrastructure and apps.

That's why focusing on a business' long-term prospects is often the best way to find which companies are most deserving of your hard-earned capital.
It's also an excellent plan for dividend stocks because companies that pay you to own their stock often do their best work over the span of years, when investors can reinvest the dividends to maximize their returns.
Where to start? It might be helpful to consider what the world could look like in the years to come. For example, it appears that artificial intelligence (AI) is only just getting started. Also, an increasingly technology-driven world will likely consume more electricity. Lastly, people will eat -- some things don't ever change.
Here are three dividend stocks that play to these themes. Consider buying and holding them for the next decade.
1. Microsoft
Artificial intelligence is still new. Some AI stocks will fail. However, it's unlikely that Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) will be one of them.
The company was a diversified tech leader before the AI boom, with a sprawling empire spanning personal and enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more. Microsoft made its name on PC software decades ago, but continues to evolve.
In addition to staying relevant, the company's prolonged success has enabled it to build its dividend track record. Despite investing billions of dollars in its data centers and other growth efforts, management has increased the dividend for 23 consecutive years. And Microsoft has a fortress-like balance sheet.
It currently has a market capitalization of $3.9 trillion. That's too large to expect life-changing growth, but Wall Street does expect nearly 15% annualized earnings increases over the long term as AI helps drive growth throughout the company. Microsoft's dividend and growth blend make it a stock that investors can confidently buy and hold indefinitely.
2. NextEra Energy
The AI boom is cranking up electricity demand. Unless that changes, companies like NextEra Energy (NEE 1.28%) will enjoy plentiful opportunities over the coming decade. The Florida-based energy giant operates America's largest electric utility and is a leader in wind and solar power generation projects.
Renewable energy has spread by leaps and bounds over time, and it seems unlikely to stop anytime soon, now that data centers are becoming an increasing strain on the broader electric grid. To that point, NextEra is investing $75 billion in energy infrastructure over the next few years, which should help keep growth headed in the right direction.
Investors get a strong starting dividend yield of 2.7% at the stock's current share price. Management has raised its payout for 30 consecutive years, with an average annual increase of 11% over the past decade, easily outpacing inflation. NextEra should continue to be a top-notch dividend stock, poised to extend its dividend growth streak for the next decade and beyond.
3. Domino's Pizza
Sometimes, the simple business models are the most effective. Domino's Pizza (DPZ -1.65%) is a great example. The popular restaurant chain has thrived in a highly competitive pizza industry because it offers a product that strikes the perfect balance between tasty and affordable, making it a popular choice for feeding families or large groups.
Domino's uses a franchise model. Franchisees pay fees and royalties to open restaurants, then handle most of the costs associated with opening and maintaining the business. The parent company generates more-stable revenue at higher profit margins as a result. Domino's has paid and raised its dividend for the past 12 years.
Pizza is a staple across multiple cultures, and it remains an affordable way to feed the masses, so there's a good chance that people will continue ordering Domino's Pizza well into the future. The company aims to continue expanding its global store count, paving the way for growth and making the stock a no-brainer for any long-term dividend investor."

(""Nscale""). In parallel, Aker and Nscale have completed the closing of the 50/50% joint venture in Narvik, Northern Norway. The new company, "" Aker Nscale "", will deliver secure, scalable, and energy-efficient infrastructure tailored for sovereign AI workloads across Europe.
OSLO, Norway, Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The joint venture has already gained strong commercial traction, anchored by the previously announced five-year, multi-billion dollar off-take agreement with Microsoft, alongside the Stargate Norway project with OpenAI. These partnerships affirm the scale and strategic importance of the business, highlighting the accelerating demand for clean, sovereign AI compute capacity.
The closing of Aker Nscale follows the fulfilment of all necessary conditions, and the completion of Nscale's Series B financing round, in which Aker became a 9.3% owner on a fully diluted basis. Aker's 50% stake in Aker Nscale is convertible into additional Nscale shares at a future IPO, positioning Aker to benefit from long-term value creation and public market upside.
Øyvind Eriksen, President and CEO at Aker ASA, commented:
""This reflects the full scope of Aker's strategic commitment – through our direct ownership in Nscale and our partnership in Narvik. Together, it gives us a strong position in a fast-moving market, with a structure designed to capture long-term upside. But this is also something bigger: we are finally realizing Narvik's potential, placing Norway at the heart of a new industrial era, and doing it in partnership with the most capable technology companies in the world.""
Aker Nscale will be headquartered at Fornebu, Norway, with operational teams in Narvik. Kristian Røkke has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of the new company. He commented:
""I want to thank the people of Narvik and Northern Norway for their unwavering support and collaboration. Their commitment has been instrumental in turning a bold vision into a real, operational foundation for sovereign AI infrastructure. I've had the opportunity to work closely with local partners and municipalities, and to witness first-hand the capabilities and dedication that define this region. Aker Nscale is built on a clear and growing need: scalable, secure, and energy-efficient compute capacity for European AI. I'm proud to lead this effort and work alongside our teams, customers, and partners to realize its full potential."""
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-13T16:32:00,Taiwan Semi (TSM) is Going to $400,Top semi foundry is the backbone of the AI economy and makes NVIDIA magic possible,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7cda01ce291c04ffe400dee8881c3f7d2ee6177e0f0175cbf7427afb966c3247,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semi-tsm-going-400-163200307.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semi-tsm-going-400-163200307.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-semi-tsm-going-400-163200307.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) reports September quarter results Thursday morning and as the stock bounces back sharply from Friday's trade war jitters, investors look forward to the continuous good news from the planet's top AI foundry.
For instance, Susquehanna raised their price target to $400 from $300 last week after TSM reported a 31.4% increase in September sales (vs. Sep'24). And the Jan-Sep run-rate compares at +36.4% yoy.
Taiwan Semiconductor, aka TSMC, is the premier chip fabrication company for the world's most advanced digital technologies, from Apple smartphones to NVIDIA GPUs.
In less than five years, TSMC's trailing 12-month revenue has more than doubled to hit nearly $105 billion as of the June quarter. Clearly, this is on the back of NVIDIA's (NVDA) explosive growth which saw sales grow by ten times in the same period to $165 billion as of the July quarter, on its way to cross $205 billion this fiscal year (ends January).
Of course, demand for NVIDIA GPU systems didn't turn into a hockey stick until its ""ChatGPT moment"" in the spring of 2023.
I mark that moment in late May at Computex in Taipei City, Taiwan when Jensen Huang unveiled the DGX Grace Hopper 200 system and said that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms (META) were already in line.
To me, this meant that the other 996 corporations in the Fortune 1,000 would want (or need) to build their own LLMs too. I then published this article and video to explain what was coming...
Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion
And that $2 trillion market cap came quickly. That's when the ""AI bubble"" talk started. You can imagine how astonished the bubble breathers are now that NVDA is approaching a $5 trillion market cap.
""Honey, I Shrunk the Chips!""
While Apple's business has been significant for TSMC (as much as 25% of revenues), the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in the low single digits.
What still makes Apple very important though is how they help drive innovation at TSMC by always demanding the latest and greatest architectures for their ecosystem of devices.
TSMC supplies chips for flagship smartphones and 5G infrastructure, where efficiency and miniaturization are crucial. The company’s 5nm and 3nm transistor nodes are widely adopted in high-end mobile devices and 5G equipment, supporting the global rollout of next-generation connectivity.
Transistor nodes refer to the specific manufacturing processes used to produce integrated circuits, where the ""nm"" (nanometer = 1 billionth of a meter) like 7nm or 5nm, historically represented a physical dimension of the transistor, specifically the gate length. For reference, the coronavirus is about 50nm.
Now it's more of a marketing term that signifies a new generation of chip technology with improved performance, power efficiency, and transistor density.
But generally, a smaller node number means...
Smaller transistors: More transistors can be packed into the same area on a chip.
Faster switching: Electrons have a shorter distance to travel, leading to higher clock speeds.
Lower power consumption: Less voltage is needed to operate the smaller transistors.
Why the AI Economy is Not a Bubble
Which brings us back to NVIDIA as they now pack 208 billion transistors into the Grace Blackwell ""superchip"" with further density on the horizon in the Rubin and Feynman series of GPUs expected in 2026 and 2027, following Jensen's nearly annual cadence of development.
I mentioned the early demand for NVIDIA systems in 2023 and have recently seen similar projections from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Marvell (MRVL) at their Custom AI Investor Event that total datacenter capex by the big ""hyperscalers"" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) plus Meta, Tesla (TSLA), OpenAI, Apple, and xAI, will grow from nearly $600 billion this year to over $1 trillion in 2028.
This demand is not slowing down because all these companies realize that the transition to an ""AI economy"" is built on the infrastructure of NVIDIA GPU systems. I am on record late last year saying that this megatrend would lead to over $500 billion in revenues for NVIDIA by 2030. That's only ~35% CAGR from when the TTM topline crossed $100 billion.
And Citi just updated their industry outlook in their ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Energy"" report. The bank forecasts global AI infra capex at $5.5 trillion cumulative through 2029 (56% CAGR), hitting $2.16T in 2029 alone. So that's a double from 2028's $1 trillion.
And that's the infrastructure to power not just generative and agentic AI systems (i.e., LLMs), but a whole new world of ""physical AI"" for autonomous machines, including self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and many other types of 3D automation requiring ""embodied"" or edge intelligence and vision/spatial perception.
And of course my favorite use cases for these technologies are science and medicine, where researchers can plumb the depths of our existence and come back with wondrous and life-changing knowledge.
The training alone for these worlds requires enormous datasets and compute, using simulation and synthetic models. In this way, Jensen is forging a new universe of possibilities that keep TSMC ""fabs"" humming.
TSMC is the Backbone of the AI Economy
TSMC holds about 67% of the global foundry market and nearly 90% of advanced chip production, making it the preferred manufacturer for high-performance, custom AI accelerators and GPUs.
While NVIDIA designs the magical GPUs and systems that power the innovations of the AI Economy, it all starts with Taiwan Semi's advanced silicon fabrication. This is the epitome of high-tech manufacturing using lithographic etching to create circuits smaller than the eye can see.
And what's better for crafting new chips than brand new ""fabs"" as TSMC just broke ground on their 3rd facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In late June, Softbank's Masayoshi Son announced new plans to invest in a $1 trillion industrial complex in Arizona that will build robots and AI technologies.
Son is seeking to create a version of China's vast manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, which concentrates high-tech companies for proximity of resources, logistics, R&D, collaboration, and talent. TSMC was named as a key partner in Son's plans.
Currently for TSMC, the 5nm and 3nm nodes are the backbone for state-of-the-art AI accelerators, powering chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple that are used in generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.
In Q1 2025, 58% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from 3nm and 5nm nodes, with 73% from 7nm and below, underscoring the centrality of these advanced processes in TSMC's business and the broader tech ecosystem.
But TSMC wouldn't be itself if it wasn't planning to go deeper. The company plans to begin production of its 2nm node by late 2025, promising significant gains in power efficiency and performance. Looking further ahead, mass production of the 1.4nm (14 angstroms) process is slated for 2028, offering 10–15% higher speeds or 25–30% lower energy use compared to 2nm."

Nvidia (NVDA) in late September said it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) as part of a partnership for the ChatGPT maker to use Nvidia’s chips to train and run its next generation of models.
This is just one of a flurry of deals among a tight web of Big Tech players that have been made public in the last few months. There's also Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). And on Monday, the ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.
Wall Street analysts say the agreements highlight a growing trend: AI infrastructure providers, led by Nvidia, are investing in their customers, who then turn around and buy more of the infrastructure providers’ products. In other cases, customers of infrastructure like OpenAI are investing in their suppliers.
Analysts interviewed by Yahoo Finance said there are two major concerns with the circular dynamic seen in the recent spree of AI investments. For one, the nature of the transactions could make it seem like there’s greater demand for AI than there really is. It also drives a closer link among the valuations of Big Tech companies — especially given that their respective stocks have soared on news of such deals — and intertwine their fates so that a hit to any one company would be bad news for the entire ecosystem, the experts said.
“The latest developments are very troubling,” said tech analyst and Bokeh Capital Partners chief investment officer Kim Forrest. “Vendors [of AI infrastructure] have gotten a lot of money, so they're just shoving money back into their customers that may be poorly spent.”
Cornell professor Karan Girotra said instances of vendors and customers financially supporting one another reduce the “resilience” of the overall system: “If something goes wrong, then the effect flows through the system rather than [being] isolated.”
Legendary short seller Jim Chanos, famous for predicting the fall of Enron during the dot-com bust, also weighed in, writing in a post on X last week, “[Don’t] you think it’s a bit odd that when the narrative is ‘demand for compute is infinite’, the sellers keep subsidizing the buyers?”"

REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Ontinue, a leading provider of AI-powered managed extended detection and response (MXDR) services and winner of the 2023 Microsoft Security Services Innovator of the Year award, today announced the availability of the Gartner® 2025 Market Guide for Managed Detection and Response (MDR), a report that we believe captures how buyer expectations and service models continue to evolve in the rapidly advancing MDR market.
MDR Market Growth and Direction
According to Gartner, MDR is an established services market, providing detection and response to enterprise customers (see Gartner's DataHub: Forecast - Information Security — Q3 2025). End-user spending growth is forecast to outpace other managed security services at 9.6% globally, and emerging regions are expected to have far faster uptake, with Asia/Pacific at 19% CAGR.
In our opinion, the Market Guide also highlights that as AI-driven automation enables faster containment, MDR providers must maintain trust and transparency while offering pathways to self-service, a dynamic Ontinue continues to advance through its MXDR platform and human-in-the-loop delivery model which accelerates, rather than replaces, human expertise. By automating routine investigation tasks, surfacing relevant context in real time, and connecting signals across cloud, SaaS, and identity environments, Ontinue enables its analysts to focus on what matters most: understanding intent, validating impact, and guiding customers toward faster, more informed decisions. The result is an MDR service that not only detects and responds faster, but delivers deeper insight and measurable outcomes for every customer interaction.
""Turnkey, human-delivered, threat detection, investigation, and response (TDIR) capabilities are a core requirement for buyers of MDR services, who demand remotely delivered services deployed quickly and predictably,""
— Gartner, Market Guide for Managed Detection and Response, 2025.
""This report reinforces what we've believed, and built Ontinue around, from day one,"" said Geoff Haydon, CEO of Ontinue. ""Cybersecurity is no longer just about protection; it's a strategic business advantage. As organizations evolve, they're looking for partners who don't just detect threats, but help them operate more confidently, make faster decisions, and achieve stronger business outcomes. We believe Gartner findings validate Ontinue's approach - one that fuses 24/7 human expertise with Agentic AI and automation to continuously reduce exposure, build trust, and drive resilience."""

Gen X may be about to make history, but not in the way they hoped. Caught between rising job losses, disappearing social safety nets and growing automation, many in this generation are facing a terrifying possibility: being pushed out of the workforce with no apparent way back in.
A Generation On The Edge
Sociologists Annette Nierobisz and Dana Sawchuk interviewed dozens of baby boomers who lost white-collar jobs during the 2008 recession. Many were, in their words, ""too young to retire but too old to start all over."" The same now applies to Gen X, who may be even worse off, as they argue in a recent The Hill op-ed. In it, they warn that Gen Xers face heightened financial risk due to diminished job security, draining retirement accounts, and limited social support compared to earlier generations.

The authors found that some older workers managed ""soft landings,"" thanks to pensions, generous severance packages, or support from family. But those benefits are rare today. Gen X entered the workforce as stable, long-term jobs were being replaced with temp work, contract gigs and 401(k)s instead of pensions.
Nierobisz and Sawchuk argue that retraining alone won't be enough. Older workers already face age discrimination. And when jobs vanish faster than new ones are created, reskilling becomes a losing game.
""It's impossible to prepare for a bout of unemployment extended indefinitely by age discrimination in the hiring process,"" they wrote.
Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.
Will UBI Become A Necessity?
The authors argue that Gen X may be the tipping point for considering universal basic income as a structural solution to long-term job loss. Based on their interviews and broader research, they say the financial realities facing Gen X make it far more vulnerable to lasting harm after a layoff.
That leaves UBI as a serious option, not as a futuristic experiment, but as a necessary support for people who fall through the cracks. The idea is gaining traction in some U.S. cities, and international experiments have shown improvements in well-being and employment stability.
The key argument is that if AI is going to replace work, then income has to be separated from employment. For Gen Xers aging out of the job market without a pension, safety net or viable second act, UBI could be the only thing standing between stability and financial collapse."

The announcement comes just a week after OpenAI announced a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that will see the chipmaker provide OpenAI with up to 6 gigawatts of AI processors.
Broadcom stock jumped nearly 10% on the news.
OpenAI is the world's most valuable startup, surpassing Elon Musk's SpaceX at some $500 billion.
Under the terms of the Broadcom deal, OpenAI said it will design the accelerators and systems, and then develop and deploy them with Broadcom.
""Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential and deliver real benefits for people and businesses,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
""Developing our own accelerators adds to the broader ecosystem of partners all building the capacity required to push the frontier of AI to provide benefits to all humanity,"" he added.
The announcement is another sign that companies are increasingly seeking to develop their own custom silicon to reduce their reliance on both Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD's chips. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) already have their own custom AI chips, as does Microsoft (MSFT).
But that doesn't mean they'll abandon Nvidia or AMD anytime soon.
OpenAI recently signed a $100 billion deal with Nvidia that will see the ChatGPT developer deploy up to 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems.
OpenAI has been on a dealmaking spree, agreeing to terms with the likes of CoreWeave (CRWV) and launching its Project Stargate initiative with Oracle (ORCL).
But the deals have raised questions about how long OpenAI can continue to spend billions while failing to turn a profit.
The moves have also increased concerns about a continued circular AI trade and the potential for an AI bubble.
During a discussion at Italian Tech Week earlier this month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that we’re likely witnessing an AI bubble, but he added that some of those investments will eventually pay off.
""When people get very excited, as they are today, about artificial intelligence, for example ... every experiment gets funded, every company gets funded,"" Bezos said.

Each of these companies posted strong results last quarter, and there are good reasons to believe that strength can continue into the final stretch of the year. These stocks look attractive, not just heading into earnings, but for the long haul as well.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and last quarter's results showed just how strong demand for its chips has been. Its data center revenue surged 56% year over year, despite the company lacking access to the Chinese market, as companies and governments around the world continue to rapidly build out their AI infrastructure.
That trend does not look like it's slowing, with cloud computing companies continuing to spend big on data center infrastructure and Oracle announcing massive AI data center spending plans. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to dominate the AI infrastructure market, where its graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to power AI workloads and have an over 90% market share. Its CUDA software platform continues to give it a wide moat in the space, as most early AI code was written on it, and developers favor it.
With data center spending remaining strong and AI demand still outpacing supply, Nvidia's growth trajectory looks intact. The company has already proven that it can deliver consistent upside surprises, and it's positioned better than any of its peers to capture profits from the next leg of the AI infrastructure buildout.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has transformed itself into one of the biggest AI beneficiaries in tech, and that evolution showed up clearly in its last earnings report. The company posted 22% revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by an increase in ad impressions and higher prices. The number of daily active users across its family of apps also climbed by 6% year over year to 3.48 billion, proving that it can still draw in new users despite the maturity of its platforms.
AI has been the key driver behind Meta's resurgence. It has been using AI to improve how its algorithms recommend content, which is keeping users more engaged. That, in turn, increases the amount of ad inventory it can sell. At the same time, its AI tools for advertisers are helping companies create and target their marketing campaigns more effectively, which boosts Meta's ad pricing power.
Meanwhile, it is just starting to introduce ads to its biggest untapped assets, WhatsApp and Threads, both of which have huge growth potential. All these things should help keep the company's earnings momentum going.
Meta also isn't sitting still when it comes to innovation. It recently debuted its new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, sales of which could give its Q4 revenue a boost. These augmented reality glasses could also be a precursor to its eventual vision for things like ""superpersonal intelligence"" and the metaverse, which are longer-term bets.
3. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) capped off its fiscal 2025 with one of its best quarters in years, showing just how well it's executing across both cloud computing and AI. In its fiscal Q4, which ended June 30, revenue from its Azure cloud platform jumped by 39%, marking its eighth straight quarter of growth above 30%. Meanwhile, its Intelligent Cloud division as a whole grew by 26% to nearly $30 billion. That strength is being driven by companies accelerating their AI spending, with Azure being one of the biggest beneficiaries.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's early investments in OpenAI continue to give it an edge. Its Copilot AI tools, now integrated across Office products, are increasingly being adopted by enterprises to increase worker productivity. These products are still in their early innings, which means there's plenty of runway for growth left. Revenues from Microsoft 365 rose more than 20% last quarter, and even the company's personal computing segment saw renewed growth, led by Xbox and search advertising.
Microsoft is spending aggressively to expand its data center capacity to meet the flood of AI demand, which should keep growth strong in the quarters ahead. With Azure continuing to increase its sales in a rapidly growing cloud market, and with Copilot adding a valuable new layer of recurring revenue, Microsoft looks like one of the most reliable performers heading into this earnings season and a top long-term holding for investors."

Shares of Broadcom rose more than 12% in premarket trading.
The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts' worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam.
The agreement is the latest in a string of massive AI chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry's surging appetite for computing power as it races to build systems that meet or surpass human intelligence.
OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity.
""Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal.
CUSTOM CHIP BOOM
The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on Nvidia's costly processors that are limited in supply.
The approach is not a sure bet. Similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have run into delays or failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports, and analysts believe custom chips do not pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the short term.
The rise of custom chips has, however, turned Broadcom - long known for its networking hardware - into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022.
The company unveiled a blockbuster $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer that some analysts and market watchers speculated was OpenAI.
Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements."

(Reuters) -Salesforce said on Monday it would invest $15 billion in San Francisco over the next five years to accelerate AI adoption, as the cloud software provider looks to sharpen its competitive edge against tech giants.
Founded in San Francisco in 1999 and still headquartered there, Salesforce has been integrating AI into its products, including workplace messaging platform Slack, as it jostles with companies such as ServiceNow, Oracle and Microsoft to win businesses eager to adopt the booming technology.
Salesforce said the latest investment would support a new AI incubator hub on its San Francisco campus and help companies adopt AI agents, which can perform tasks on behalf of the users.
""This $15 billion investment reflects our deep commitment to our hometown — advancing AI innovation, creating jobs and helping companies and our communities thrive,"" CEO Marc Benioff said.
The announcement comes ahead of the company's Dreamforce conference, scheduled to take place between October 14 and October 16 in San Francisco. The annual conference is expected to draw nearly 50,000 attendees and generate $130 million in local revenue, Salesforce said.
The company, which has more than 76,000 employees globally, last week announced plans to spend $1 billion in Mexico over the next five years. It began operating in Mexico in 2006.
""If the company wants to remain a leader in an important emerging technology area, it must have a pipeline of talent to innovate and drive the field forward. We already see shortages of AI talent, so this makes sense,"" Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said.
Salesforce shares were up 2.8%. They have fallen around 28% so far this year.
Earlier in the day, the company also launched its ""Agentforce 360"" AI platform globally.
Salesforce had in September forecast third-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates, and announced a $20 billion increase to its existing share buyback program.

The chief executives of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple and OpenAI treated the US President to a show of fealty worthy of a royal entourage.
The highlight of the trip, on the 18th September, saw Trump and UK Prime Minister Starmer announce the UK US Tech Prosperity Deal, an historic accord for deeper cooperation between the two countries’ technology innovation efforts and a much-needed boost for a UK Labour government failing to deliver on its promise of economic growth.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
The deal aims to give the UK’s tech ecosystem access to US datasets, infrastructure and compute power, as well as collaborative R&D and shared research funding opportunities on quantum, nuclear and AI. It also signals greater collaboration on regulation, national security and the skills needed to advance the UK’s technology sector, according to the official memorandum of understanding.
The deal was accompanied by a raft of US Big Tech investment announcements in the UK’s AI infrastructure. These included a $30bn investment by Microsoft which includes includes building the country’s largest supercomputer in partnership with British company Nscale, a $5bn investment by Google including the opening of a data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, a $1.5bn investment by US datacentre company CoreWeave in Scotland and the establishment of Stargate UK in a collaboration between Nscale, OpenAI and US chipmaker Nvidia.
While policy makers and tech titans alike touted the deal’s mutual benefits there was some scepticism that the US may have more to gain the UK’s cheap land and labour – some even likening the agreement to a Western multinational exploiting developing world resources (with the view that the UK has been much relegated by its economic misfortunes to low value investment location).
Most of the investment focuses on data centre buildouts, with the majority of jobs created during the construction and build out phase as data centre management is not job intensive. The huge infrastructure investment also raises the question of UK energy and water supply being diverted away from local populations in order to facilitate such levels of compute power.
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataBut above all, these private investments by private companies with global market dominance raise questions around data sovereignty, geopolitical tensions and UK tech increasing becoming a satellite arm of the US rather than a sovereign tech power in its own right.
Across the channel European Union law makers have made a concerted effort to distance their own business ecosystems from the auspices of US Big Tech companies. France and Norway are developing their own sovereign clouds and are involving local partners in the endeavour.
Indeed, some of the Tech Prosperity Deal’s raft of US digital infrastructure investment did include a local partner Nscale, a company seemly sprung from nowhere in 2024. Little is known about this relatively recent newcomer. Nscale chief commercial officer, Karl Havard, has publicly stated that the company is the the UK’s only full-stack, sovereign AI infrastructure provider, telling Capacity in July 2025 that: “This reflects our belief that control over local AI infrastructure and compute is essential to national resilience, economic growth, and global competitiveness.”
Digital sovereignty becomes a business priority
Sovereignty has become an increasingly important issue within the digital economy evinced by the then Conservative UK government’s decision to classify data centres as critical national infrastructure in September 2024. However, economic imperatives mean that the UK government welcomes foreign direct investment in UK digital infrastructure. But are UK businesses concerned whether their data is being stored, processed and managed over US run infrastructure?
Claudio Corbetta, CEO of team.blue says it “absolutely makes a difference” for SMEs. The company’s own research found that nearly three-quarters (73%) of SMEs across the UK and Ireland are concerned about their data being stored in the US. This is also happening in Europe, with 72% of SMEs worried about their data being stored in the US. This anxiety is tied to frameworks like the US Cloud Act and continuing debates over the adequacy of the EU–US and UK–US data transfer arrangements, explains Corbetta. The US Cloud Act gives US law enforcement the power to demand electronic data stored overseas by US companies.
“The sovereignty question for SMEs goes beyond infrastructure capacity. It is about whether they trust that the data falls under either EU and/or UK jurisdiction, or not. What we’re hearing from customers across Europe is that this distinction has direct implications on their ability to adhere to regulations, as well as maintaining and building on consumer trust,” says Corbetta.
Corbetta says that SMEs increasingly see confidence in data sovereignty as a business differentiator, as it’s shaping procurement decisions and customer relationships. “If we take a step back and look at the wider European context, while Big Tech plays a huge role in AI and cloud infrastructure, we’re seeing a shift that provides opportunities for European tech companies. Europe-based providers can compete on capability while offering the certainty that data remains protected under local laws. For many SMEs, that combination of sovereignty and trust is now just as important as performance or price,” says Corbetta.
“From what we’re hearing, company directors and customers are increasingly raising questions about data location, and that pressure is shaping real business decisions.
“For tech leaders, the takeaway is that digital sovereignty is not just a compliance topic, it’s a strategic one. Providers that can combine transparency, guidance, and local hosting solutions are increasingly seen as true partners. Sovereignty isn’t an add-on, but the foundation for sustainable digital growth,” he adds.
UK opportunity for sovereign AI infrastructure
Many British business leaders like Mahdi Yahya, founder and CEO at UK AI specialist data centre provider Ori, sees a clear opportunity arising from the fact that digital sovereignty is increasingly becoming a boardroom priority for UK businesses.
The infrastructure funding announcements in the UK [US UK Prosperity Deal] mark an exciting time for the space, says Yahya, though it’s still a niche market to some extent. And the market potential for a largely UK owned and run AI infrastructure does exist. While the incumbent Big Tech cloud providers dominate, the price point, the fact that Ori’s infrastructure is built ground up specifically for AI and the data sovereignty proposition of using a UK company is what has allowed the company and other players in the space to build successful UK businesses on the back of this demand for specialist AI infrastructure.
Yahya doesn’t see the demand opportunity decreasing any time soon. “The big buying factor for a lot of enterprises, especially in Europe and Middle East, is around the sovereignty of infrastructure,” he says.
“AI will have access to and will be interacting with all the data that you have. And so, whether you’re a government entity, or an enterprise in a regulated sector, or operating in compliance heavy sector, it becomes extremely important to know where the infrastructure is and what control there is over the infrastructure.
“And many governments in Europe, specifically, and enterprises in Europe now have mandates that they need to be working with cloud providers that are local or sovereign for this precise reasons,” adds Yahya.
How would a smaller UK industry compete with big US cloud players on AI infrastructure? “It’s impossible for them to overcome the sovereignty issue, because obviously they’re US controlled,” he says.
“Some customers we talk to are adamant that they don’t want to be working with a provider that is subject to the US cloud act, for example, and the US cloud players are still subject to that. So that removes that portion of the market for them,” he explains.
And then the other big differentiator, or opportunity, is around performance specialisation of a company like Ori that was built from the ground up with AI in mind. “Like any industry, you have incumbents, and then a new technology that comes to light, and along with that come new players with a more differentiated offering, with a more performant offering, a more cost-effective offering, and that’s where we are at the moment,” he says.
Build British Big Tech
British veteran entrepreneur and CEO of AI research engine Corpora.ai, Mel Morris, sees the UK’s massive investment focus on AI infrastructure as “a wakeup call in terms of what we spend our money on”.
In Morris’s view, UK investment patterns are simply following prevailing trends and lack innovative foresight. “The money is following the fashion. The fashion says, get Jensen Huang over here, let’s put $5bn to get some GPUs in place and build a big data centre. Meanwhile, we’re seeing small entrepreneurial startups, with game changing technology that potentially could double the gross domestic product of this country, struggling to get heard and to get financed.”
Morris’s call to action is to reframe the UK’s focus on AI infrastructure to encompass a wider, more innovation first approach.
“Forget the amount of GPUs. In three years they’ll be worth nothing, because you’ll need them to be ten times faster and a tenth of the price. Let’s focus on what are small amounts of money, relatively speaking, that we could spend to build sovereignty, to build the technologies that allow us to compete, because at the moment, we’re [the UK] a net importer of AI tech, and I think that’s a dangerous place to be.”"

TAIPEI, Taiwan, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TrendForce’s latest investigations reveal that the rapid expansion of AI server demand is propelling global cloud service providers (CSPs), such as Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu, to boost investments in NVIDIA’s rack-scale GPU solutions, data center expansion, and in-house AI ASIC design. Total CapEx from the eight major CSPs is expected to surpass US$420 billion in 2025, roughly equivalent to their combined spending in 2023 and 2024, marking a 61% YoY increase.
TrendForce predicts that as rack-scale solutions like GB/VR systems grow in 2026, the total CapEx of the eight CSPs will hit a new peak, surpassing US$520 billion with a 24% year-over-year rise. Additionally, investment priorities are moving from revenue-generating assets to short-lived infrastructure such as servers and GPUs, indicating a strategic emphasis on boosting long-term competitiveness and market share rather than immediate profits.
In 2025, NVIDIA’s GB200/GB300 rack systems are poised to become the main deployment targets for CSPs, driven by higher-than-anticipated demand growth. Besides North America’s leading four CSPs and Oracle, emerging customers such as Tesla/xAI, CoreWeave, and Nebius are increasing their purchases for AI cloud leasing and generative AI workloads. By 2026, CSPs are likely to shift from GB300 racks to the new NVIDIA Rubin VR200 rack platform in the latter half of the year.
Custom AI chip production continues to scale up
North America’s leading four CSPs are increasing their investments in AI ASICs to improve autonomy and manage costs for large-scale AI and LLM tasks. Google is partnering with Broadcom on the TPU v7p (Ironwood), an optimized platform for training, set to expand in 2026 and succeed the TPU v6e (Trilium). TrendForce predicts Google’s TPU shipments will stay the highest among CSPs, with over 40% annual growth in 2026.
AWS is prioritizing its Trainium v2 chips, with a liquid-cooled rack version expected by late 2025. The Trainium v3, developed jointly with Alchip and Marvell, is planned for mass production in early 2026. AWS’s ASIC shipments are anticipated to more than double in 2025, marking the fastest growth among major CSPs, with a further approximate 20% increase in 2026.
Meta is enhancing its partnership with Broadcom, with MTIA v2 set for mass production in Q4 2025 to boost inference efficiency and lower latency. In 2025, shipments will mainly back Meta’s internal AI platforms and recommendation systems, while MTIA v3, which includes HBM integration, will launch in 2026, doubling total shipment volume."

The event comes just as concerns are building that Oracle is sacrificing profitability for growth from renting computing power to AI companies like OpenAI. Last week, the Information reported Oracle’s cloud margins are lower than many on Wall Street are modeling, sending Oracle shares down as much as 7.1% on Tuesday. Even though the stock quickly recovered the losses, there are lingering questions about the economics of the business, which Oracle has forecast will see revenue jump 700% in the coming three fiscal years.
“There are absolutely investors who are concerned about margins, or concerned its targets are very aggressive,” said Mark Martiak, senior partner and financial adviser at Prudential Advisors, whose parent company has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management. “This is an opportunity for Oracle to ease concerns, since a lot of skeptics see the valuation as stretched, especially if a mega-deal like the one it has with OpenAI doesn’t deliver sustained revenue.”
Tuesday will feature a keynote address from recently named co-CEO Mike Sicilia, as well as one from founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison, whose stake in Oracle briefly made him the world’s richest person last month. On Thursday, an investor day is expected to bring updated financial targets.
Hopes are high among many on Wall Street. The conference will be “a major catalyst where the company will clarify many of these debates,” Mizuho Securities analyst Siti Panigrahi wrote in a note last week, referring to questions over margins. Bernstein’s Mark Moerdler expects “additional details which should help put some of these issues to bed.”
Heavy demand for cloud computing has boosted Oracle’s overall sales, but the big investments required to support it have weighed on profitability. Oracle’s revenue growth is projected to jump to 17% in its current fiscal year, from 8% the year before, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. However, gross margin, which excludes operating expenses, is expected to fall more than 2 percentage points to 68.4%. As recently as fiscal 2021, Oracle’s gross margin was above 80%."

The catastrophic meltdown at Fukushima left many questioning whether this powerful energy source was truly worth the risk.
Fast forward to today. As global power demands surge and the push for cleaner energy intensifies, with tech giants like Microsoft and Meta Platforms leading the charge, nuclear energy is making a resurgence.
Enter the Global X Uranium ETF (URA 2.02%), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for investors seeking to capitalize on this renewed interest in nuclear power. Here's why adding the Uranium ETF to your portfolio could be a smart move.
1. Energy demand will rise significantly in the coming years
Energy demand in the U.S. and across the globe is rising. Driving this increased demand are power-hungry data centers that support artificial intelligence (AI) and technology like ChatGPT. Goldman Sachs forecasts that global data center power demand will surge 165% by 2030, primarily driven by the growth of AI.
Data centers are projected to use more energy, while the electrification of vehicles, heating, and industrial processes adds steady new baseload demand. Unlike past cycles, this surge is not cyclical but structural, tied to digital infrastructure, decarbonization mandates, and the reshoring of energy-intensive manufacturing.
Traditional efficiency gains from appliances and lighting are no longer sufficient to offset growth, and grid operators warn of capacity shortfalls in multiple regions.
2. Nuclear provides clean-burning, reliable fuel
As utilities scramble to expand their generation, nuclear power and natural gas are emerging as essential backstops, as renewables alone face challenges related to intermittency and transmission.
Nuclear power offers a unique solution, as it provides massive, steady baseload electricity without producing carbon emissions. Unlike fossil fuels, which release CO2 and pollutants, nuclear reactors generate power through fission, making them one of the cleanest large-scale energy sources available.
This positions nuclear as essential for achieving carbon-neutral goals, since it can complement intermittent renewables like wind and solar while displacing coal and natural gas. With governments and utilities under pressure to reduce emissions while meeting surging demand, nuclear energy offers a reliable and scalable path to cleaner energy and long-term climate commitments.
3. Countries are seeking energy security at home
For the U.S., nuclear energy enhances energy security by providing a stable, domestic power source that reduces dependence on foreign oil, gas, and enriched uranium from adversarial nations, such as Russia.
As geopolitical tensions rise, countries are diversifying away from supplier countries that could use energy as a form of leverage and shifting toward trusted partners and homegrown production. This creates an opportunity for nuclear power companies and uranium miners.
4. Supplies are low
Global uranium supplies and production capacity are relatively tight. Over the last decade, as nuclear energy fell out of favor, prices declined, and there was little incentive to invest in new mines, resulting in underinvestment and closures.
This, coupled with rising demand as nations expand nuclear fleets and advanced reactors approach deployment, will put pressure on current supplies. With utilities increasingly locking in long-term contracts, supply could fall short of demand later this decade. This imbalance sets the stage for higher uranium prices and positions well-capitalized miners, developers, and fuel-cycle companies for growth.
5. The Global X Uranium ETF provides diverse exposure across nuclear
The Global X Uranium ETF (URA) provides investors with a convenient way to gain broad exposure to the uranium industry across its entire value chain.
Rather than betting on a single miner or fuel-cycle company, this ETF holds a diversified basket of global uranium-related stocks, including uranium producers, developers, exploration companies, and providers of nuclear components or technologies. Its top five largest holdings include Cameco (19.6% of net assets), Oklo (15.5%), Uranium Energy Corporation (5.9%), Centrus Energy (5.6%), and Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (5.4%).
This mix helps balance risk between established players with stable operations and smaller companies with higher growth potential. Importantly, it captures companies at different stages of the supply chain, from mining and refining to reactor construction and fuel services, allowing investors to benefit from rising uranium demand in multiple ways."

Chip leaders like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are building the hardware backbones powering generative AI, while cloud titans such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon race to expand data centers and roll out new services at unprecedented speed.
One of the more surprising winners throughout the AI boom has been a nuclear energy company called Oklo (OKLO -1.34%). As of this writing (Oct. 6), shares have surged an astonishing 1,130% over the past year. My prediction for 2026? Oklo stock could climb even higher.
The question is -- does that make it a smart buy right now?
Oklo's momentum looks strong, but there's a catch
Oklo's mission is straightforward: to design and build small modular reactors (SMRs) capable of powering data centers and remote industrial sites. This concept has captured the imaginations of investors as AI's rapid expansion collides with soaring electricity demand -- a market that Wall Street estimates could be worth as much as $10 trillion.
Yet for all the excitement surrounding Oklo, the company still lacks two critical ingredients: revenue and profits.
Heading into 2026, my prediction is that Oklo's story will revolve more around partnerships than profits. The company will likely announce new collaborations with government agencies and private enterprises -- perhaps with data center operators or hyperscalers seeking to diversify their power sources.
These announcements will make headlines and stoke media enthusiasm, but investors should remain cautious. Oklo remains years away from true commercialization, and until the company deploys and operates a working reactor at scale, such deals are more symbolic than financially meaningful. In other words, they offer optionality but not cash flow.
Dilution risk looms as Oklo's valuation defies gravity
Oklo's meteoric rise has been fueled more by narrative momentum than by underlying business fundamentals. The company went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2024, and since then, its valuation has swelled to levels that would make even the most optimistic investors raise an eyebrow. At its current market capitalization of $20 billion, Oklo is priced like a mature energy company despite not generating a single dollar of revenue.
This disconnect could soon force management to raise more capital through a secondary stock offering. Building nuclear reactors is extraordinarily capital-intensive, and regulatory approvals can take years to secure. While Oklo has garnered early support from the Department of Energy, it will almost certainly need additional funding to sustain operations through the rest of the decade.
Issuing new shares while the stock remains inflated would be a logical move -- but it comes with an obvious trade-off: dilution. This is a familiar outcome for early-stage companies and one that bullish investors should be prepared to accept.
Oklo looks more like a meme stock than a long-term investment
Online forums have latched onto Oklo as the next frontier of nuclear innovation -- a bet that, in theory, could revolutionize the energy landscape. In practice, however, Oklo has yet to deliver a prototype that produces compelling unit economics.
Against this backdrop, the company is behaving less like a traditional investment and more like a meme stock. Much like the dot-com era -- when valuations were driven by engagement metrics such as clicks and page views -- Oklo's market value appears tethered to speculative optimism rather than measurable results.
For investors, that distinction is critical. Owning Oklo today isn't an investment in a proven enterprise; it's a wager on a narrative. This kind of profile rarely offers the durable financial foundation that institutional investors seek. Instead, Oklo has become a day-trader's playground -- propelled by retail hype rather than fundamentals.
Savvy investors should resist the fear of missing out (FOMO) and remember that hype cycles eventually correct. When the dust settles, Oklo could indeed become a key player in the future of nuclear energy -- but only after its technology and financials mature. Until then, the company remains one of the market's flashiest yet most fragile stories. If shares continue rising throughout 2026, I'd view it as an opportunity to sell on momentum."

What began as a niche designer of graphics chips for gamers has evolved into the central nervous system of the artificial intelligence (AI) economy.
Today, hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, and Meta Platforms rely on Nvidia's hardware and software stack to train and deploy their AI models. Unprecedented demand has fueled staggering financial growth, propelling Nvidia's market value nearly 16x during the AI revolution. At a market cap of roughly $4.5 trillion, Nvidia now wears the crown of the world's most valuable company.
This raises the question: Is there any upside left, or have investors who don't already own shares missed the boat?
The answer according to Wall Street analyst Phil Panaro at The Boston Consulting Group may surprise you. Panaro projects that Nvidia could reach a $20 trillion valuation within the next five years -- representing a gain of more than 340% from current levels. While this target may sound ambitious, his thesis is built on three converging forces shaping the next decade of AI.
Let's unpack the key drivers behind Panaro's bold prediction and explore why Nvidia's long-term story remains one of the most compelling in the entire market.
The AI boom has only just begun
The first pillar of Panaro's thesis is that the current AI boom is still in the early innings of a decades-long transformation. He estimates that global AI adoption remains below 1% today, meaning that most industries have only begun to explore the potential of intelligent automation. As AI becomes embedded across healthcare, financial services, logistics, retail, and manufacturing, the demand for accelerated computing should expand exponentially.
Nvidia is uniquely positioned to capture these tailwinds. On the hardware front, its chips remain the gold standard for training and inferencing large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI systems. Equally important, Nvidia's CUDA software platform forms the base layer of its ecosystem, enabling developers to build AI applications at scale.
This deep integration has created enormous switching costs, meaning that once a company's AI infrastructure is built on Nvidia's backbone, migrating to another platform becomes complex and financially prohibitive.
This combination of superior product performance and ecosystem lock-in gives Nvidia exceptional pricing power. In effect, the company is no longer just a chip designer. It has assumed the role of a toll collector in the AI era, charging admission to every breakthrough that relies on its compute stack.
Web3 and the next frontier of compute demand
The second pillar of Panaro's argument centers on the rise of Web3 and decentralized applications. Blockchain validation, metaverse rendering, and on-chain governance are all emerging systems that require computationally intensive processing power -- precisely the kind of workload Nvidia's GPUs are designed to handle.
Nvidia's opportunity in this realm is twofold.
First, the company's hardware will likely remain a core foundation for next-generation decentralized networks -- providing the horsepower to process blockchain transactions and train autonomous systems at global scale.
Second, Nvidia's software capabilities -- particularly in simulation and digital twin technologies -- could prove to be essential tools for building virtual worlds, industrial replicas, and real-time digital economies that mirror the physical world.
As Web3 evolves, Nvidia remains positioned to supply both the silicon and the advanced software required to power the next frontier of the internet.
Governments will be the next wave of AI customers
The third pillar of Panaro's forecast highlights an often-overlooked source of demand: the public sector. While private businesses have raced to procure GPUs and expand their data center footprints, government agencies around the world are only beginning to invest in digital transformation.
Federal and state governments could use AI to optimize logistics, detect fraud, forecast infrastructure needs, and manage power grids with greater efficiency. Meanwhile, defense agencies could leverage AI for training simulations, satellite imagery analysis, and developing advanced cybersecurity protocols.
The underlying investment theme here is quite powerful: Government contracts tend to be long-term and capital-intensive. Initiatives like Project Stargate underscore this trend -- large-scale, multiyear buildouts designed to make AI infrastructure a national security asset.
Ambition vs. reality
Whether Nvidia will reach a $20 trillion valuation by 2030 remains open to debate. In my view, Panaro's target should be interpreted less as a precise forecast and more as a statement of potential.
Nvidia has built one of the most durable and profitable business models of the modern era, one that bridges hardware, software, and connected ecosystems.
And regardless of whether Nvidia reaches the $20 trillion milestone, I agree that its story appears to be in its early chapters. For this reason, I see Nvidia as a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon."

Blow-out quarterly earnings estimates from American software and cloud services specialist Oracle, a $100bn (£75bn) investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI by silicon chip designer Nvidia and, in reverse, the purchase of a 10pc stake by OpenAI in another semiconductor maker, AMD, are all keeping the artificial intelligence (AI) pot boiling, so far as stock markets are concerned.
The magnificent seven of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla now have an aggregate stock market capitalisation of $21tn – or 36pc of the S&P 500 index’s total value. Their spending on AI and their share prices are firing US economic growth, which continues to shrug off tariff turmoil, corporate earnings – and thus, the US stock market.
In theory, where the US goes, the rest are sure to follow. America is the world’s largest economy and home to its biggest stock market, biggest bond market and its reserve currency the dollar, all of which count for rather a lot. Many headline stock indices are cruising to new highs, including our very own FTSE 100.
Yet someone is worried. The minutes of the latest meeting of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC), released last Wednesday, offer warnings of increased risks of a sharp pullback in global share prices. The question now, as one email sent to this column immediately reflected, is whether this is a timely alert or a repeat of Alan Greenspan’s “irrational exuberance” speech of 1996. The then-Federal Reserve chair cautioned about the dangers of a galloping stock market, only for share prices to continue rising, not peaking until 39 months later.
Uncanny echoes
The FPC’s frets about the sky-high valuations of anything AI carry uncomfortable echoes of the technology, media and telecoms (TMT) – or dotcom – bubble that inflated over the 1990s, popped in 2000 and bottomed in 2002. It then took America’s technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index, the poster child for the bubble, until April 2015 to return to its March 2000 high, teaching investors a painful lesson of the perils of choosing narrative over valuation.
Greenspan had, in the eyes of some, tried to calm animal spirits before the bubble even got going – and with good reason. Just eight months after the Fed chair spoke, trouble blew in from an unexpected quarter when Thailand devalued the baht. Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia quickly followed with the rupiah, won and ringgit, and the Asian debt crisis began to roil markets."

At these higher valuations, picking new AI stocks is a bit trickier. But there are still opportunities in high-quality, defensive AI stocks, as well as laggard turnarounds that still have AI upside.
The following two storied names embody both defensive and aggressive bets on the AI revolution today.
Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) is a leader in enterprise software, cloud computing, and PC operating systems, along with other cash-generative businesses like LinkedIn and Xbox.
Microsoft's diversified portfolio of profitable growth businesses gives it the cash flow to compete strongly in artificial intelligence. And while the generative AI boom is potentially disruptive to even the large tech giants, it's more likely the forward-thinking Microsoft and visionary CEO Satya Nadella will find ways to benefit from the AI transition.
After all, Microsoft was an early investor in OpenAI, the leading AI model-builder, which in some ways is attempting to compete with Microsoft's enterprise software business. But even if that happens to an extent, Microsoft's stake in OpenAI would appreciate in value, somewhat offsetting the threat.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has made a few bullish ""leaks"" of late. According to a recent Bloomberg piece citing anonymous internal sources, Microsoft management apparently believes its data center capacity will be constrained for longer than previously anticipated.
Not having enough data center capacity to meet demand seems like a ""good"" problem to have, and suggests the growth outlook for Microsoft's Azure cloud unit should be strong for years.
Meanwhile, another Microsoft executive recently hinted at something bigger perhaps bubbling under the surface -- Microsoft's in-house AI chip efforts. Microsoft is seen as somewhat of a laggard in designing its own in-house AI accelerators, something its rivals have been at for a longer time. In recent years, cloud giants have been designing their own silicon in order to wean themselves off higher-priced Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices graphics processing units (GPUs).
However, Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott recently said Microsoft's goal is to use ""mainly"" its own chips going forward, adding that Microsoft is using ""lots of Microsoft"" silicon today. If Microsoft gets its in-house chip efforts on par with or better than rivals, look for its cloud and AI gross margins to increase even more.
Intel
While most AI-related chip stocks are at or near their all-time highs, Intel (INTC 4.24%) has been a notable laggard. The stock has recently doubled off its April lows, but Intel's stock still remains about 50% below all-time highs, and trades at a fraction of the market cap of other AI winners.
But this summer, a turnaround began brewing, as Intel attracted the investment of the U.S. government, Softbank, and Nvidia, which all put billions of dollars behind the U.S. chipmaker.
Perhaps more importantly, Intel just hosted journalists at its new high-tech semiconductor manufacturing plant, Fab 51, in Arizona last week. There, it introduced the first two products to be produced at the new fab: Panther Lake, a new PC CPU, and Clearwater Forest, the power-efficient data center CPU, which should start shipping in early 2026.
The event was important, as it was the formal unveiling of Intel's all-important 18A node, the manufacturing node where Intel hopes to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in process technology. The node features two new important innovations: gate-all-around (GAA) transistors and backside power. At the tour, Intel said 18A's current manufacturing defect density was at its lowest point in its development, and that the node would be ready for high-volume manufacturing before the year is out.
That's extremely notable, as many in the press have downplayed 18A, with various outlets peddling rumors of low yields and questions over performance. But if Intel can achieve high-volume manufacturing this quarter at good yields, it will match TSMC's schedule for its 2nm-class chips, which should also begin high-volume manufacturing soon. And while TSMC chips will have GAA transistors, they won't have backside power. So it's possible for some applications, Intel may actually be ahead of TSMC in 2026.
And Intel will certainly be ahead of TSMC in terms of U.S.-based chip manufacturing. Despite TSMC having pledged billions and billions to build U.S.-based fabs, it isn't anticipated to bring even its 3nm chip technology to the U.S. until 2027, let alone 2nm, which is supposed to arrive the following year. That means if there is geopolitical strife between China and Taiwan at any point over the next few years, Intel's importance would only grow -- perhaps exponentially.
With the backing of the U.S. government and now potentially having a leading process once again, Intel is a turnaround story to bet on, even after its recent surge."

Ramsey And Delony Slam The “Terrible Bargain”
In a recent episode of “The Ramsey Show,” co-host John Delony read a letter from Andrea in Ohio, who explained her partner of 25 years had built a business with over 300 employees, and now has a multimillion-dollar net worth. She had been asking him to get married since their first child was born. After years of turning her down, he told her he would finally agree if she signed a prenup.

“You gave up everything, and he gave up nothing,” personal finance expert Dave Ramsey told her. “You raised his kids and helped him build a business and he owns it. You made a terrible bargain 25 years ago.”
Andrea said she gave up her own career to raise their children and that her partner has always taken care of the family financially. But now, she feels unsure and exposed. “I love him but wonder if I should just let go of the idea of marriage,” she wrote.
Ramsey was frank: “I think this guy’s a jerk. He’s slimy,” he said.
Delony added that the situation likely goes deeper than finances, suspecting emotional or psychological abuse. “You’re not crazy,” he told Andrea. “I wouldn’t want to be in the same room with that guy personally. He’s a terrible human being.”
Ramsey said she should talk to a lawyer immediately. “You certainly got child support coming out of your ears,” he said. But he doubted she would take any action.

“Your options are to stay in the poop or demand that we get married with no prenup, or I’m leaving and taking the kids,” Ramsey added. “Which is actually about the only healthy thing to do in this situation.”
Ramsey also shared some data with the listeners. “If you’re 35 and you’re married, your net worth is somewhere around 10x what it is if you’re shacked up,” he said, adding that married men also live longer and survive illnesses like cancer at higher rates.
Both hosts urged listeners not to repeat Andrea’s mistake. “Adults devise a plan. Children do what feels good,” Ramsey said. “Children move in together at 24.”
They closed by telling Andrea she’s worth more than how she’s being treated. “I think you just let him go,” Ramsey said. “And take half his money.”"

Instead, learn how to bring artificial intelligence (AI) to regular businesses that have no clue what they’re doing.
The billionaire investor and former “Shark Tank” star explained his reasoning during a recent livestream interview. Cuban thinks the real opportunity isn’t at big tech companies, but at the millions of small and medium-sized businesses that desperately need AI help but don’t know where to start.

Cuban wants college students to become “AI integrators.” These are people who can walk into any company and figure out exactly how artificial intelligence can improve their operations.
“Every single company needs professionals with AI implementation skills,” Cuban said during the TBPN interview. The problem is that most companies have no idea how to actually use AI in their day-to-day work.
Cuban pointed out that there are 33 million companies in America, but only a tiny fraction have dedicated AI budgets or keep AI experts on staff. Yet all of these businesses will need to adapt to survive in an AI-driven economy.

Why This Reminds Cuban of His Own Success Story
The comparison Cuban made to his early career is telling. When he was 24 years old, he walked into companies that had never seen a personal computer and explained how the technology could transform their business.
“I was walking into companies who had never seen a PC before in their lives and explaining to them the value,” Cuban said. He would meet with business owners and create customized plans showing exactly how computers could solve their specific problems.
That experience taught Cuban something important: There’s massive money to be made by bringing new technology to businesses that don’t understand it yet. He thinks AI represents the same kind of opportunity that personal computers did in the 1980s.
What Students Should Actually Learn
Cuban got specific about what skills matter most. He wants students spending their senior year “learning the difference between Sora and Veo” (two popular AI video-generation tools) and figuring out how to customize AI models for different business needs.
The key is understanding how AI works in practice, not just in theory. Students who master these integration skills will be able to walk into any business and immediately spot clear opportunities where AI could make a meaningful difference."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-12T12:16:00,"1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla in the $1 Trillion Club","The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to strong growth for Oracle's business, and more could be on the way.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5aadf94b82e439ed478948fb7d97d96decdde4f675c285107a8f6f14c70f72c2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-apple-m/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-apple-m/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-apple-m/,fool.com,200,,"There are several stocks that are now worth at least $1 trillion. This includes Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, which are together known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" There are others now part of the trillion-dollar club, but these are among the more notable names.
The list may get even bigger in the years ahead, as many businesses are growing and benefiting from feverish spending on artificial intelligence (AI). There's one unstoppable company that's doing well due to that trend, and which looks set to join the club in the near future: Oracle (ORCL 1.45%). Here's why it may not be too late to invest in this promising tech stock.
Oracle has become a key player in the AI boom
For years, Oracle has been known as a big name in databases and providing companies with the critical backend services and infrastructure they need to manage all their data. It still serves that purpose today, plus it also offers key products and services, which help its customers manage AI workloads.
Its new Oracle AI World, for instance, will allow its customers to use large language models to analyze existing databases. The big advantage with Oracle is that unlike many big tech companies, it's agnostic to the whole chatbot market; it isn't developing one of its own, and it's there to simply provide customers with the AI-powered products and services they need. It also has AI agents that can help to automate tasks and add efficiency.
And its efforts have been paying off. Last month, the company reported its latest quarterly results (for the period ending Aug. 31) and demand remains robust, with CEO Safra Catz noting that it ""signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1."" It expects even more large contracts to be signed in the future. And its contract backlog has skyrocketed by 359% year over year, totaling $455 billion.
Oracle's quarterly revenue totaled $14.9 billion and rose 12% year over year. Its cloud segment led the way, as sales in that business unit came in at $7.2 billion and were up by 28%.
The company also generates terrific profit margins, as its net income during the period was $2.9 billion, which is comparable to what it generated in the prior-year period. The bottom line would have been larger, however, if not for an increase in restructuring expenses, as the company has been reducing its workforce in an effort to improve efficiency.
Why a $1 trillion valuation may be just an inevitability at this point
Oracle's market cap as of the end of Monday was around $820 billion. For it to hit a $1 trillion valuation, it would need to rise by another 22% from that. In just the past year, its shares have soared more than 70%. And with tech companies continuing to invest heavily into AI, Oracle looks poised to benefit from those growth opportunities.
It may not happen soon, and it could take a couple of years, as the stock has already risen so fast. It's currently trading around its all-time highs, and its price-to-earnings multiple of 66 doesn't look cheap at all. As a result, growth investors may be thinking twice about the stock, and that could lead to limited gains, at least in the short term.
But with so much growth still out there, it may truly be an inevitability before Oracle reaches $1 trillion. According to analysts from the MarketsandMarkets, the global cloud AI market is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 32.4% until 2029. It's a staggering level of growth, with Oracle right in the middle of it all.
Oracle's still a good buy today
Although you may be tempted to pass on Oracle's stock because its valuation is a bit rich, over the long term, there's still much more runway for it to become more valuable. The important role it plays in tech makes it a solid investment, particularly due to its close relationship with other tech giants.
Oracle's solid fundamentals and AI-powered growth makes it a great investment to add to your portfolio today, especially if you're looking for an AI stock that still has a lot of upside left."

So far, he and his ex-wife Melinda Gates have given away more than $100 billion. Gates recently committed to boost his donations by $200 billion over the next 20 years.
Nearly all of Gates' charitable contributions have gone to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has distributed billions of dollars to help address global problems, including children's health and climate change. However, the Gates Foundation Trust also has roughly $67 billion invested in stocks. The growth and dividend income from these investments will help fund charitable work in the future.
Around 67% of the Gates Foundation Trust's portfolio is invested in three stocks -- and Wall Street absolutely loves one of them.
Gates Foundation Trust's top three stocks
You probably won't be surprised that the Gates Foundation Trust's biggest holding is Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%). The giant software company makes up around 27% of the trust's portfolio, with a stake valued at $13 billion, as of June 30, 2025.
Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft in 1975. When Bill and Melinda Gates started their foundation in 2000, they funded it mainly through donating shares of Microsoft and have given additional shares to the foundation throughout the years.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.06%) (BRK.B 0.05%) ranks as the Gates Foundation Trust's second-largest holding. At the end of the second quarter of 2025, the charitable trust's stake in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett was worth around $11.7 billion and comprised 24.5% of its portfolio. It's probably no coincidence that Gates has been an admirer of Buffett and a friend of the legendary investor for decades
Waste Management (WM -1.99%) is the third-largest position in the Gates Foundation Trust's portfolio. The trust's holding in the waste management and environmental services company was valued at roughly $7.4 billion at the end of Q2. This stake made up 15.4% of the portfolio.
Wall Street's favorite
Wall Street likes all of the Gates Foundation Trust's top three holdings. Analysts are least bullish about Berkshire Hathaway, though. Of the four analysts surveyed by S&P Global in October who cover the stock, only two rated it as a buy. The other two analysts recommended holding Berkshire. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflected an upside potential of only 4%.
There's more enthusiasm on Wall Street for Waste Management. Fifteen of the 25 analysts surveyed by S&P Global rated the stock as a buy or strong buy. Nine analysts recommended holding Waste Management, with one outlier advising to sell the stock. The consensus price target for Waste Management is around 17% above the current share price.
However, Wall Street's favorite of the Gates Foundation Trust's top three stocks is clearly Microsoft. Of the 58 analysts surveyed by S&P Global this month, 13 rated the stock as a strong buy. Another 44 analysts rated Microsoft as a buy, while only one analyst was less positive with a hold recommendation. The average 12-month price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of roughly 19%.
Why do analysts absolutely love Microsoft? Primarily because of the company's huge artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind. Microsoft's cloud platform is booming as customers flock to the cloud to deploy AI systems. The tech giant has integrated generative AI functionality throughout its product lineup.
Are analysts right about Microsoft?
Although I don't always agree with Wall Street's views on stocks, I think analysts are right to be bullish about Microsoft. I don't know if the stock will jump 19% over the next 12 months, but it could easily do so.
The rising adoption of agentic AI could provide an especially strong catalyst for Microsoft. The company has AI agents built into its Copilot Studio software for automating business tasks. It also recently introduced an AI agent framework for developers to create AI agents on the Azure cloud.
Significant growth is already baked into Microsoft's share price, as the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a lofty 33.3. However, I think Microsoft's growth prospects warrant a premium valuation. This stock should continue to be a big winner for investors -- and the Gates Foundation Trust -- over the long run."

Since then, it's been joined by other companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Of course, the list also includes the current market-cap leader, Nvidia.
It's becoming increasingly normal for a new company to join the $1 trillion club. But it remains an impressive feat nevertheless. At this pace, these tech titans could be joined by brick-and-mortar giant Walmart (WMT 1.71%) in 2026.
Over the past 15 years, Walmart stock has risen by 470%. The company has also been a steady dividend payer over this time. For investors who bought, held, and reinvested the dividends along the way, returns were even better with a 680% gain.
Stocks that post strong long-term gains, as Walmart stock has, often decide to undergo stock splits, bringing the price per share down due to a higher number of shares overall. Walmart has done this many times in its history, including a 3-for-1 stock split in 2024.
As of this writing, Walmart has a market cap of $820 billion. Therefore, to reach $1 trillion in 2026, it would need to appreciate by about 22% in less than 15 months. Is this really possible? It's not a sure thing, but it may be easier than some investors think.
How Walmart can reach $1 trillion
At a high level, stocks tend to go up when profit potential goes up. Perhaps profit potential goes up because a business is about to reach a new scale thanks to new locations or an acquisition. Or perhaps profit potential goes up because management is about to unlock some operating leverage. But either way, for Walmart stock to go up another 22%, one would expect improvement to its operating income over the next year or so.
Walmart is known for selling millions of products. But retail sales aren't driving growth for the company's operating income. In the earnings call to discuss financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2026, CFO John Rainey said: ""Contributions to operating income are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of interrelated drivers, including improved e-commerce, economics, and business mix, most notably from higher margin areas like advertising and membership fees.""
Rainey attributes much of Walmart's operating income growth to e-commerce, an area of the business that's absolutely booming. In Q2, e-commerce revenue was up a strong 25% year over year globally, far outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of about 5%. If e-commerce continues to boom in 2026, it could drive operating income, and the stock price, higher.
Walmart's e-commerce growth provides it with another opportunity: Digital advertising. The company has troves of consumer shopping data and strong relationships with top consumer brands. With more customers transacting digitally, it gives the retailer an opportunity to generate high-margin digital advertising revenue.
Additionally, Walmart recently completed its acquisition of connected-TV company Vizio. This is another channel with which the company can leverage its data and scale to advertise to consumers, which again drives operating income growth.
For what it's worth, Walmart's Q2 advertising revenue was up 46%. Granted, some of the growth was inorganic from the recent addition of Vizio. But the company is growing this revenue stream nonetheless.
In other words, Walmart's fastest-growing revenue streams also happen to be the ones that are driving growth in operating profit. Assuming these trends continue, which I do, Walmart's profits should continue to climb in 2026, providing a boost for the stock price.
To be clear, Walmart might not grow enough over the next 15 months to warrant a $1 trillion valuation before the end of 2026. But directionally, the business appears to be headed for the trillion-dollar club. It doesn't seem to be a matter of if, but rather of when."

And I could see why some investors would gravitate toward Berkshire Hathaway, which is like an ETF bundled within a single stock.
But I have my sights set on a stock that has quietly delivered a 58,000% return since it began trading in 1991. The business isn't flashy, but it's indispensable. It's a cash cow in good times and bad. And the company's share-buyback program can only be described as relentless.
I'm talking about AutoZone (AZO -0.62%).
You know the jingle
AutoZone is an auto parts retailer that likely needs no introduction, because that ubiquitous jingle -- ""Get in the zone, AutoZone!"" -- is probably living rent-free in your head. But if you've never peeked under the hood of AutoZone's business, you might be surprised by how strong the engine is.
Founded in 1979, AutoZone has grown from a single store in Forrest City, Arkansas, to more than 6,600 stores in the United States. AutoZone also is expanding internationally, with 883 stores in Mexico and nearly 150 in Brazil.
For the company's fiscal year 2025, which ended Aug. 30, AutoZone reported net sales of $18.9 billion, a 4.5% increase over the previous year on a 52-week basis. U.S. same-store sales -- also known as comparable-store sales -- were up 3.2%, while international same-store sales were up 9.3%, adjusting for the negative effects of currency exchange rates.
Tariff-driven cost inflation, a stronger U.S. dollar, and AutoZone's aggressive expansion efforts have put pressure on earnings. Net income dipped 6.2% to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2025, and diluted earnings per share fell 3.1% to $144.87.
In fact, AutoZone's fiscal 2025 Q4 results marked the fifth consecutive quarter that the company has fallen short of analysts' earnings estimates. Yet the stock is up 24% this year, as of Oct. 9, which tells me that investors are focusing on the big picture. Here's why you might consider doing the same.
A huge total addressable market
One way to assess a company's growth prospects is to look at its total addressable market. AutoZone is one of the leading retailers in the automotive aftermarket. Industry associations expect the total value of the U.S. automotive aftermarket to reach $576 billion in 2025, and globally, it's valued at $2.3 trillion. . With the number of vehicles on the road and the average age of vehicles at an all-time high, demand for replacement parts should continue to be strong.
AutoZone has been investing heavily in its sales and distribution footprint to capture more market share. In fiscal 2025, AutoZone's capital expenditures rose 27% to nearly $1.4 billion. The company opened 304 new stores -- the most since 1996 -- and two new distribution centers. Management expects fiscal 2026 capex spending to be in the same ballpark, with most of it focused on ""accelerated store growth.""
Some of those new stores are larger stores that function like mini distribution centers. ""Megahubs,"" for example, are supersized AutoZone stores carrying more than 100,000 SKUs (individual products). Megahubs have been outperforming traditional stores, and they're helping smaller stores in their area fulfill orders faster. AutoZone's ultimate goal is to have 300 megahubs.
In fiscal 2025, AutoZone generated nearly $3.2 billion in operating cash flow, so it's in a strong position to keep investing in the business. Given the sheer size of the automotive aftermarket, the payoff could be massive. But there's another reason I'm such a huge fan of this stock.
AutoZone knows how to treat shareholders
Since fiscal 1998, AutoZone has scooped up $38.5 billion worth of its own shares. Over the past 10 years, AutoZone reduced its outstanding share count by 45% -- and it's still buying more shares.
Share buybacks are a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders, and they signal management's confidence in the business. By reducing the supply of shares available in the market, share buybacks can enhance earnings per share and increase demand for the remaining shares -- both of which can drive the stock price higher.
You can see the inverse relationship in this chart:
Inelastic demand
There's something else that makes AutoZone a strong candidate for this ""what-if"" hypothetical.
The automotive aftermarket benefits from a concept known as inelastic demand -- meaning consumers will make essential repairs to their vehicles regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. In fact, auto parts retailers often shine in tough times, because consumers tend to pull back on buying new vehicles. As a leader in this space, AutoZone might be the ultimate recession-resistant stock, well-positioned for growth in boom times and busts."

PG&E Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder in PG&E, you need to believe California’s utility sector will be rewarded for supporting the power demands of emerging industries such as AI data centers, while successfully managing ongoing wildfire risk and earning regulatory approval for critical infrastructure investments. The recent news linking PG&E to Microsoft’s San Jose data center underscores a potential long-term growth catalyst. However, it has no material impact on the most important short-term catalyst: progress towards regulatory stability and wildfire liability reforms. The biggest risk remains legislative and regulatory uncertainty around wildfire responsibility.
Among recent announcements, PG&E’s lowered full-year earnings guidance in July is most relevant for understanding current sentiment. Even as data center developments point to future load growth, earnings guidance revisions focus investor attention on regulatory, operational, and cost risks over the coming quarters.
By contrast, investors should also be aware that ongoing debates about how California allocates wildfire costs could...

PG&E's outlook anticipates $27.6 billion in revenue and $4.0 billion in earnings by 2028. This scenario assumes a 4.1% annual revenue growth and a $1.6 billion increase in earnings from the current $2.4 billion.
Uncover how PG&E's forecasts yield a $20.39 fair value, a 29% upside to its current price.
Exploring Other Perspectives
Five individual fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from US$6.79 to US$20.39 per share. While many see strong future demand from AI and tech growth, the risk that regulatory changes could impact cost recovery remains central to the company’s outlook, reminding you that community opinions can vary widely."

Its stock has gained just 34% over the past five years, significantly trailing the S&P 500 index's 90% returns.
But despite its mediocre returns, there's still a lot to like about what Amazon's doing right now and where the company is headed. Here are a few reasons why the company could still be a good long-term investment and whether Amazon stock could set you up for life.
1. It's making big investments in AI
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leading public cloud computing company with 30% market share, compared to Microsoft's 20% and Google's 13%. Microsoft has made some gains on Amazon over the past few years, but Amazon is making some very large investments in artificial intelligence to stay on top.
Recently, the company spent $34 billion in the second quarter on capital expenditures, mostly for expanding its cloud business, and analysts estimate it could spend up to $100 billion this year. The key to staying ahead in the AI race right now is investing a lot of money to build the most advanced data center infrastructure, and this spending could help Amazon outpace the competition.
And it will likely be money well spent, considering that AWS has an operating margin of 33% and generated $10.2 billion operating income in Q2. Not only that, but global AI cloud computing revenue is estimated to reach $2 trillion by 2030, giving Amazon a lot of potential to expand further into this space.
2. It's still the e-commerce king
Amazon has more e-commerce competition than ever, yet the company has maintained its dominant position. Amazon enjoys U.S. e-commerce market share of 40%, while rival Walmart takes just 13% and Target barely registers with 2%.
A big part of the company's success comes from its Prime membership subscription, which gives members access to fast and free deliveries, video and music streaming, photo storage, and more. The latest estimates put global Prime membership at 240 million.
Prime members are important to the company because they spend an average of $1,170 annually on Amazon -- more than twice what nonmembers spend, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.
3. Its advertising business continues to impress
Advertising is perhaps one of the most overlooked aspects of Amazon's business, but it's becoming increasingly important, with Amazon's ad sales increasing by 23% in Q2 to $15.7 billion.
To put this in perspective, Amazon is the third-largest advertising company in the U.S. behind Alphabet and Meta Platforms. The company will have an estimated 17% of the digital market next year, up from less than 11% in 2021. Considering that digital ad sales in the U.S. will reach $429 billion by 2029, Amazon's ability to successfully tap into this market could become increasingly important over the next few years.
Will buying Amazon set you up for life?
Amazon's stock has been a huge success for long-term investors, with gains of 2,800% over the past 15 years. But expecting similar results over the next decade or so probably isn't realistic.
Still, that doesn't mean you should avoid adding Amazon to your portfolio. With Amazon still the leading cloud computing player, its investments in AI just beginning, and the company already carving out a niche in advertising, Amazon still has a lot of potential to boost your portfolio in the coming years, even if it doesn't set you up for life."

On October 9, Morgan Stanley reiterated the stock as “Overweight,” calling it their “Top Pick in large-cap software,” and stating that its “valuation is still at a discount to peers.”
“Microsoft remains best positioned to capture incremental share of GenAI spend and IT budgets as workloads move to the cloud.”
The firm’s quarterly survey of chief information officers (CIO) further reveals how the company is in an ideal position to cash in on artificial-intelligence spending.
There were hundreds of U.S. and European CIOs polled between Aug. 5 and Sept. 9, of which 37% believe that Microsoft will claim the largest or second-largest share of additional generative AI spending in the next three years.
“Bottom line, Microsoft again remains the clearest beneficiary of GenAI spend.”

The firm also revealed from the survey that the company is likely to benefit from the migration of computing work to the cloud from on-premise servers.
Of the 100 respondents, forty-nine believe that Microsoft will gain from the largest additional share of IT budgets due to the transition to the cloud in the next three years. Twelve said Amazon while six answered Salesforce, amongst some other smaller players.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides AI-powered cloud, productivity, and business solutions, focusing on efficiency, security, and AI advancements.

Her daughter, who just graduated college, was preparing to travel for the final round of interviews after passing three earlier stages.
Asking For Reimbursement Sends The Wrong Message
The mother, Chelsea, estimated that the total cost, including airfare, Uber rides, hotel stays, meals, and three days of missed wages, would significantly impact her daughter’s budget. She wondered if it would be inappropriate to ask the company for at least partial reimbursement.

“Yes, it would be wildly, wildly silly,” Coleman said. “Not even inappropriate. Just silly. You’re guaranteeing she doesn’t get the job.”
“The fact that you’re asking us this concerns me,” Coleman added. “This is entitlement 101. You are not entitled to your expenses for applying to a job.”

The technology sector -- led by such companies as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Oracle -- is up even more at 160%. But the semiconductor industry within the tech sector has done even better.
The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX 3.08%) is up a staggering 191% over the last five years. There's a lot more to the fund's success than its exposure to well-known names like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.
These two Motley Fool contributors discuss why the exchange-traded fund (ETF) may still be a good buy even after its massive run-up, as well as reasons to be cautious when approaching red-hot chip stocks at all-time highs.
A role player in the age of AI
Daniel Foelber: The iShares Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to semiconductor designers, manufacturers, and equipment suppliers that are underrepresented by technology sector ETFs and many growth ETFs.

4.7% |

|
Texas Instruments |
4.5% |
1.1% |
As you can see in the table, the iShares Semiconductor ETF holds meaningful positions in companies that are underrepresented in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF. And while Nvidia and Broadcom make up just shy of 20% of the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF, the other eight semiconductor stocks in the table, including AMD, are absent from the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF.
A common issue with growth ETFs is that they tend to concentrate heavily on a handful of industry-leading names. The iShares Semiconductor ETF doesn't have that issue. It's an ideal choice for investors looking for exposure to the entire semiconductor value chain. Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a lot of attention, but it's just one use case of semiconductors.
For example, Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors are used in many Android devices that run Alphabet's software. AI is Micron's fastest-growing segment, but PC and mobile devices are still the primary use cases for its memory chips. Texas Instruments makes analog and embedded semiconductors that are used in consumer electronics, automotive, healthcare applications, and more.
Fabrication plants operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing include equipment made by companies like Lam Research, Applied Materials, ASML Holding, and KLA. Combined, these five companies make up 22.6% of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. But Taiwan Semi and ASML are absent from the iShares U.S. Technology ETF because they aren't U.S. companies. And Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA combined only make up less than 4% of the iShares U.S. Technology ETF.
In sum, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a great buy for investors looking for an ETF with exposure to the integrated semiconductor value chain rather than just a few popular names.
Even chip lovers should think twice in this economy
Anders Bylund: Buying the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a bold bet on a very specific high-growth industry. I'm usually all for that type of targeted investment. Things are different in the fall of 2025, though.
I still think of the AI boom as a positive market force. It's not a bubble, and the chip stocks that have soared due to great AI-related sales in the last three years have earned their lofty valuations. At the same time, even legendary bull runs usually have a couple of sharp price corrections along the way. That's particularly true when the bulls are racing in the middle of a shaky global economy.
On that note, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is too narrowly focused for my taste in this economy. I mean, even the classic S&P 500 funds look too concentrated since 27.8% of their total value comes from the top five holdings (including semiconductor king Nvidia in the top spot, of course). The iShares Semiconductor ETF takes this focus one step further. It holds just 30 stocks, and the top five names add up to 33.6% of the portfolio's assets under management (AUM).
Again, I'm usually fine with sector-specific ETFs. This just doesn't look like a good time to load up on this richly valued ETF. The ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 37 with a meager 0.7% dividend yield and a lofty beta value of 1.6. In other words, it's both expensive and volatile. I'd much rather put my investable cash to work in a tried-and-true market-wide tracker like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now.
I will surely consider hyper-targeted ETFs like the iShares Semiconductor ETF again someday. The same AI boom will probably still be in full force when I do. I just need the economy to calm down before I can commit to a swaggering AI-chip fund again. For now, I'm more interested in risk management."

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is the largest producer of carbon-free energy in the US, with over 32,400 MW of generating capacity consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric assets.
Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is the largest producer of nuclear energy in the US by a wide margin, over three times more than its closest competitor. The company’s business model generates strong, stable cash flows through regulated rate structures and long-term power purchase agreements and it boasts hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google among its key customers. It was reported this summer that the utility has also struck a deal with Meta to keep one of its reactors in Illinois operating for 20 years.
Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) made headlines earlier this year when it announced the acquisition of Calpine, turning the company into the largest independent power provider in the country. The blockbuster deal, which is expected to close in Q4 2025, is expected to boost CEG’s EPS by more than 20% next year.

Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.
It’s common knowledge that Warren Buffett and Bill Gates are two of the most successful men in the world. Back in 1998, Buffett gave a lecture alongside Gates at the University of Washington, where they shared how crucial forming good habits early on was to their current success.
Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, consistently outperforms the S&P 500 in returns. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway’s compounded annual gain over the last 60 years was 19.9%, almost doubling the S&P 500’s 10.4% annual return in that same period, according to the company’s 2024 annual report. (1)
Gates co-founded Microsoft in 1975 with his friends, believing that chip technology would allow everyone to someday own a computer at home, and now we can’t imagine our lives without a computer in our pocket at all times.
It’s no surprise that their advice to students decades ago still resonates with investors today.
Warren Buffett’s advice — build good habits from those you admire
Buffett was clear in his advice: IQ doesn’t matter as much as you think it does when it comes to success.
“Everybody in this room has more than enough IQ to do my job,” Buffett said. “The big thing is rationality. I always look at IQ and talent as sort of representing the horsepower of the motor.”
In other words, you can be the smartest, most talented person in the room, but if your habits are poor, you won’t get far:
“In terms of the output — the efficiency with which the motor works — that depends on rationality because a lot of people start out with 400-horsepower motors and get 100-horsepower of output. It’s way better to have a 200-horsepower motor and get it all into output.”
Buffett reiterated that anyone in the room can achieve what he has in his career, but that some won’t “because you’ll get in your own way — it won’t be because the world doesn’t allow you to — it’ll be because you don’t allow yourself.”
He suggested the students take a look around the room and find the peer they respect the most, and write down the qualities they truly admire about that person.
He then suggested following that up by doing the opposite — find the person they “can stand the least in the whole group” and write down the qualities about that person that rub them the wrong way.
Once you know what those good qualities are, you can build up strong habits that bring those qualities forward in you, and put to rest the bad qualities within yourself that remind you of the person you don’t want to emulate. This is how you convert all your horsepower into output."

Cisco Systems Investment Narrative Recap
To be a Cisco shareholder, you need confidence in the company's ability to capture durable growth from surging AI infrastructure investment, while navigating industry shifts toward cloud and software-based networking. The launch of the Silicon One P200 and 8223 routing system underscores Cisco’s relevance with key AI hyperscale clients, an important catalyst, but it does little to immediately offset the business’s biggest risk: reliance on a few top customers, making revenues vulnerable to any slowdown in cloud or AI spending.
Among recent announcements, Cisco’s enhancements to the Webex Customer Experience portfolio, particularly the introduction of AI-powered tools for contact centers, reinforce its push into AI-centric enterprise solutions. This focus on embedding AI into core offerings not only aligns with demand for enhanced networking hardware but also supports recurring revenue growth, which is crucial given shifting spending patterns among large customers.
By contrast, investors should be aware that Cisco’s dependence on major AI infrastructure deals can introduce sudden volatility if large spending plans change...

Uncover how Cisco Systems' forecasts yield a $75.81 fair value, a 12% upside to its current price.
Exploring Other Perspectives
The Simply Wall St Community's 12 fair value estimates range from US$58.24 to US$75.81 per share. While opinion varies, the business’s exposure to order cycles from hyperscale customers remains a key focus for what could influence future results."

Lord Case sought advice from the appointments watchdog on becoming an adviser to the American firm, according to Acoba (Advisory Committee for Business Appointments).
Former prime minister Rishi Sunak has also recently sought advice on his appointment as a senior adviser to San Francisco-based Anthropic, which developed the Claude AI models, and Copilot AI developer Microsoft.
Lord Case, who was once the UK’s most senior civil servant, should not draw on “any privileged information available to him from his time in crown service”, the watchdog has said.
He should also not “make use, directly or indirectly, of his contacts in Government and/or crown service to influence policy, secure business or funding, or otherwise unfairly advantage Invisible Technologies”.
It is understood the role as a paid, part-time adviser will not involve contact with Government.
The former cabinet secretary, who sits as a crossbench peer in the Lords after his departure from the civil service in December last year, told Acoba he did not meet Invisible Technologies during his time in Whitehall.
Invisible Technologies is a US company which develops, trains and helps third-parties use AI (artificial intelligence).
Mr Sunak’s roles are also paid.
The Conservative MP for Richmond and Northallerton has told Acoba he will donate the payments to his and his wife Akshata Murty’s numeracy skills charity The Richmond Project.
Acoba has vetted several appointments over recent weeks before its final closure on Monday.
Its functions are being transferred to the Civil Service Commission.
Former Scottish first minister Humza Yousaf approached the committee to look into his appointment as a global strategic adviser for the Muslim Impact Forum.
The organisation is a “trusted space” where Muslim leaders and institutions “converge to shape agendas, forge partnerships, and deliver solutions that respond to today’s challenges with clarity and integrity”, according to its website.
Former Conservative rail and HS2 minister Huw Merriman has become the non-executive chairman at High Speed Rail Group.
“I have long championed rail as central to driving economic growth, connecting communities and supporting a more sustainable transport network,” he said in a statement.
“The UK now stands at an important crossroad for high speed rail.
“While progress on HS2 since the reset is encouraging, crucial decisions on northern connectivity are still awaited."

According to Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives, the market reaction stems from China’s announcement about tightening restrictions on rare earth materials effective December 1.
""After a relatively calm few months and improving relations between the US and China this step up in tensions has created a white knuckle moment for the markets with tech stocks under major pressure today,"" Ives noted.
The analyst characterized the situation as ""a game of high stakes poker"" between the US and China amid the ongoing AI revolution, with Beijing also increasing scrutiny of NVIDIA’s advanced chips.
Ives maintained his bullish stance on tech stocks despite the sell-off, suggesting that ""the bark will likely be worse than bite this time around as cooler heads prevail."" He views such market reactions as buying opportunities for semiconductor, software, and Big Tech companies.
The analyst highlighted several companies leading what he called the ""4th Industrial Revolution,"" including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Palantir (which he dubbed ""the Messi of AI""), Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.
Ives predicted tech stocks could rise another 7% or more by year-end, describing the current market as a ""1996 Moment...and NOT a 1999 Moment."" He also pointed to OpenAI’s recent investments in NVIDIA and AMD as evidence of ongoing capacity expansion and enterprise demand.
""Sell-offs like today we encourage investors to buy the tech winners and not head for elevators despite this war of words between Trump and Xi,"" Ives concluded.

The toy company’s revenue grew 11% in the second quarter to a record $124.2 million, and it even raised full-year guidance – all while mitigating the cost of tariffs. That’s a stark contrast to years of unprofitability before 2012.
Investors have taken notice. In the last year alone, Build-A-Bear’s stock is up 76%. In the last five years, the toy company’s share price (BBW) has risen nearly 2,000% – besting even tech companies riding the AI boom like Palantir, Nvidia and Microsoft.
But the company faces potential headwinds, including the impact of tariffs and increasingly squeezed consumers, who might pare back on non-essentials as they tighten budgets while inflation stays hot.
Build-A-Bear broadened its customer base beyond kids and capitalized on customer trends that emerged after the pandemic, focusing on experiences and tapping into what Sharon Price John, the company’s CEO, calls the “nostalgia economy.”
“’Kidulting,’ (is) adults wanting to be kids, and they’re buying things that they loved when they were kids. So we leaned into that with really interesting licenses that played on their memory,” John told CNN.
Build-A-Bear has licensing deals with nostalgic brands like Hello Kitty, Pokémon and Harry Potter. John said adults and teens are now 40% of the company’s business.
“A lot of the adults with kids also have fond memories of Build-A-Bear themselves,” said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. “So they’ve been keen to expose their kids to that. It’s a memory that they have and are fond of, and they’re keen to recreate that for a new generation.”
For parents, the fusion of entertainment and product from picking out and building a bear is valuable, as is Build-A-Bear’s price point, especially for birthday bears that cost a customer’s age.
“That’s very helpful to the retailer because we are in an era where money’s a bit tighter. People are thinking about what represents value, and Build-A-Bear has a proposition that’s really centered around value,” said Saunders.
And while many mall brands have faded, Build-A-Bear is growing. The company announced it would open 60 stores this year, 10 more than previously announced.
“Malls are still a big part of what we do, but that’s almost 30-40% of our retail environment,” said John. “Now we’re in tourist locations, cruise ships, hospitality and we also built out our e-commerce business. We had to participate in the digital economy.”
The tariff question
Like most toy companies, the company said tariffs will take a bite: an expected $11 million this year, despite front-loading component imports from China and Vietnam, which have 30% and 20% tariffs respectively.
The brand has controlled price hikes for now but expects to raise them at some point, albeit in specific spots rather than across-the-board, John said.
“I think that that has pleased investors because they’ve said, well, yes, there may be some downside on tariffs here, but it’s significantly less than maybe it is elsewhere in the toy sector,” said Saunders.
And as Americans face tighter wallets in the face of inflation, non-essentials – like Build-A-Bear’s product – could get cut from family budgets. Inflation has remained above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target for years, and a stagnating labor market has reignited fears that more families could see their incomes shrink.
Saunders also cited concerns about slowing foot traffic at shopping malls – and the chance that the current collectibles craze could go the way of Beanie Babies and Cabbage Patch kids in years past.
“Some of these (worries) may not materialize in the near-term, but the company needs to be alert to all of them,” said Saunders."

Third quarter earning season is underway with the biggest tech names slated to report later in the month. It'll of course give us the latest read on just how much companies are spending and making on artificial intelligence, which has driven markets to repeated record highs. Here with more on what to watch is Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and Global Head of Technology Research. Dan, it's great to see you, as always. Um, so we're going into earning season for this company for these companies at a time where there is this debate of valuations. There is this debate about the so-called circular economy, how much they're all sort of spending on each other. Um, what are you going to zero in on in the in these earnings reports?
Yeah, I look, Julia, I'd say, I mean, the street's still massively underestimating what this tech cycle is going to look like. I think it's an AI super cycle. And I think this 3Q earnings is going to be much more of a validation moment in terms of not just for chips but for software. And I think the broader build out. Look, it continue the bears in hibernation mode. They've missed the last two and a half years. and they'll continue to miss this bull market that I think has another two years ahead of it.
You know, it's interesting because I haven't talked to that many bears, right? The bears, the straight up bears are hard to find on this stuff. It's more the message that maybe you should start to diversify a little bit. It's not that you should sell necessarily, maybe take a little bit of profits and put it in some of the smaller companies in the space, put them outside of AI entirely because maybe we're in a little bit of a a breathing period here. What do you think of that argument, Dan?
Look, I get it. I mean, but my view is we're in the second inning of a nine- inning cycle. So, I mean, to to peel away from an AI perspective, talk about people have peeled away from AMD over the last, you know, a month ago, or Oracle six months ago, or Nvidia a year ago. See my whole point is like, the street's under estimating what this cycle is going to look like. And I think ultimately in the next one, two years, numbers are maybe 20, 30% underestimated. And I think that's why three Q earnings is just going to be more validation showing the use cases are exploded."

In a statement, SAMR said Qualcomm’s acquisition is suspected of violating the country’s anti-monopoly laws, though it didn’t provide any further details on what element of the deal broke monopoly laws or how.
In a statement, a Qualcomm spokesperson said, “We are fully cooperating with SAMR in this matter. Qualcomm is committed to supporting the development and growth of our customers and partners.” Qualcomm stock was down more than 4% in midday trade.
The announcement comes the same day President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that the Chinese government is seeking to tighten its control over rare earth minerals. Trump went on to threaten a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese goods.
Trump also said there’s no longer any reason for him to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping as the two leaders initially planned at the APEC Summit in South Korea.
Like Qualcomm, SAMR has also accused AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) of violating China’s anti-monopoly laws. In September, the regulator announced that it would conduct further investigations into the deal. Nvidia has denied any wrongdoing.
China has also called on companies to avoid using Nvidia’s products, and in 2024, a state agency called for an investigation into Intel’s chips for what China’s Cyberspace Security Association claimed were ""frequent vulnerabilities and high failure rates.""
The US and China are locked in a months-long trade fight that has seen the countries raise tariffs on shipments of their respective goods by more than 120% before lowering them again.

Technology and rare earth minerals are just two of the biggest pawns in the back-and-forth struggle between the two nations. Tech companies have had to maneuver their relationships with the countries, placating them to ensure they can continue to sell their products into both markets.
In the US, companies like Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM) have committed to building new facilities or otherwise sourcing components from American factories in an effort to win Trump’s approval and avoid potentially onerous tariffs.
Qualcomm relies on TSMC to build its chips, some of which come from the company’s manufacturing plants in Arizona."

These companies deal with everything ranging from chipmaking to cloud infrastructure to consumer-facing applications, and more. However, not all AI stocks are created equal, and I'd argue that many of these companies are only propped up by the current AI hype.
On the other hand, Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) is a company involved with AI that is diversified, profitable, and already monetizing it at scale. In my opinion, it's undoubtedly one of the best AI stocks to buy now.
One thing Microsoft has going for it regarding AI is its partnership with OpenAI. This partnership gives Microsoft first dibs on OpenAI's newest models and early integration, which is an advantage for Microsoft because it doesn't take on all the heavy lifting and costs that are required to build and run these advanced AI models in-house. This saves time, resources, and billions in a time when time is of the essence in the AI arms race.
As a bonus, Microsoft currently receives around 20% of OpenAI's revenue, though this figure is projected to be around 8% by the end of the decade. In either case, Microsoft is in a good position to profit from OpenAI's growth while continuing to strengthen its ecosystem of products and services.
Microsoft already has a stronghold on enterprise software and productivity tools. Boosting them with AI features can strengthen their value proposition."

""I think this may have been an oversight,"" she wrote, explaining that the kids were minors when the policy was taken out. Now adults, they were pressuring her to sign the money over. ""They'll still get an IRA, a house, a car — but they want this too.""

On air, Dave Ramsey and his co‑host, John Delony, unpacked the emotional letter. Ramsey didn't hesitate.
""Legally, it's your money, period. No court's even going to look at this. They'd dismiss it in 30 seconds,"" he said. ""But if you truly believe it was a mistake — like an envelope mailed to the wrong address — then, morally, you give it to them.""
Ramsey walked through two possibilities. If the parents simply forgot to update their paperwork when the kids became adults, then the aunt could hand over the funds knowing she'd done the right thing. But if the couple intentionally named her — maybe because they trusted her more than their children — that's a different story. ""They're not entitled to it just because they're kin,"" he said. ""If Mom and Dad's intent was clear, you don't owe them anything.""

That's when Delony offered what he called Option 3. ""Maybe these kids are hurting,"" he said. ""They've been through a lot. Maybe their parents knew there'd be immaturity and wanted their aunt to make wise choices with this money — to love them through it.""
Ramsey nodded, suggesting that if the parents had wanted their sister to act as a caretaker of the funds, she could ""dole it out slowly, like a trust."" College tuition? Sure. Rent for an apartment? Maybe not. ""You decide what your sister and brother‑in‑law would've done,"" he told her.
Delony circled back a few minutes later, putting the dilemma in personal terms: What if it were his own family? ""If I had a niece and nephew — one doing great, one struggling — I might say, ‘Yes for tuition, but no for your next life mistake. I'll take care of you like your parents would have.'"" Ramsey agreed: ""That's loving your family well, even if they don't like it."""

Dublin, Oct. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""2025 Connected TV Platform Expansion in the U.S.: Gaming, Fitness, Smart Home"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
This study draws from the analyst's Q1 2025 survey of 8,000 US internet households. The survey is demographically representative of US internet households, with quotas for age, income, gender, and educational attainment.
TV operating system (TV OS) platform vendors and TV OEMs are looking for new use cases and applications to drive TV sales, advertising revenue, and uptake of related services. With widespread adoption of large-screen TVs, 4K and HDR, relatively little interest in 8K and a business model transitioning away from a high volume, low margin hardware model to a high margin advertising model, CTV platform vendors and TV OEMs benefit from expanding beyond the traditional feature set. With smart TVs now reaching 68% of US internet households, this creates new possibilities for commerce, gaming, fitness, and smart home applications, among others.
This study investigates new differentiators and points of interest for US CTV buyers. It examines demand for smart home hub capabilities, health and fitness services and integrations, advanced gaming functions and features, artistic display capabilities, telehealth, content creation, interactive shopping, and more. It identifies consumer openness towards technologies such as optical content recognition, embedded cameras and microphones, AI and AI assistants, among others.

Letters from the Parliament’s office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) disclosing Sunak’s appointments revealed concerns that the ex-Conservative PM’s privileged information could “grant Microsoft an unfair advantage.”
Sunak has some history with Microsoft, which has several active contracts with British government departments. In 2023, he unveiled a £2.5 billion deal with Microsoft to invest in new data centers and training in the U.K.
Acoba also noted that “there is a reasonable concern that your appointment could be seen to offer unfair access and influence within the U.K. government…given the ongoing debate about how to best regulate AI, and at a time of intense debate and lobbying around the world on what the approach should be.”
Sunak said he would steer clear on advising on U.K. policy matters, stick to high-level perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends, and avoid lobbying. He said he would divert his salary to the Richmond Project, a charity he founded with his wife earlier this year.
The former PM also serves as a senior advisor to investment bank Goldman Sachs and speech writer for firms like Bain Capital and Makena Capital.
Sunak isn’t the first British politician to take on roles helping Silicon Valley tech giants navigate governmental affairs. Sunak’s senior political adviser, Liam Booth-Smith, is also on Anthropic’s payroll. And former Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg served as Meta’s president of global affairs until January 2025.
In the United States, the revolving door between Silicon Valley and the U.S. government is ever-active. At Meta, Clegg was replaced by Joel Kaplan, George W. Bush’s former deputy chief of staff, and Dustin Carmack, a former adviser to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, joined the firm’s policy team in 2024. Microsoft’s current president of global affairs is Lisa Monaco, former deputy attorney general under Joe Biden."

Miners’ secured grid capacity and high-density sites offer hyperscalers a faster, cheaper path to expand AI data centers as interconnection delays mount.
What to know:
- Bernstein says grid congestion is delaying U.S. data center expansion, making power access a key AI bottleneck.
- Bitcoin miners control over 14 GW of secured power, offering AI firms a faster, cheaper path to scale than greenfield builds, the report said.
- Existing high-density, cooled mining sites can be quickly converted for AI workloads; IREN is Bernstein's top pick with a $75 price target.
A tightening U.S. power grid is driving bitcoin
Soaring demand from AI and digital workloads has made grid access one of the biggest constraints on new data center growth, with interconnection timelines stretching to seven years in some regions, the broker said in a report on Friday.
Miners, who secured large renewable power contracts years ago, now control more than 14 gigawatts (GW) of capacity and offer AI providers a shortcut to scale, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.
Sites owned by IREN (IREN) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) can cut deployment time by up to 75% compared with greenfield projects, the analysts wrote.
The sector is riding broader momentum. Bloomberg reported that Microsoft expects data center shortages to persist through 2026 as cloud and AI demand outpaces its infrastructure buildout. The surge in demand for high-performance computing is fueling optimism that bitcoin miners can capitalize by expanding into AI and data center operations.
Because bitcoin facilities already run at high power densities and have advanced cooling systems, they can be retrofitted for high-performance AI workloads far faster and cheaper than new builds, Bernstein said.
The broker called miners “strategic enablers” of the AI buildout and named IREN its top pick, with an outperform rating and a $75 price target.
IREN was 5.7% higher in early trading Friday, around $67.50.

When asked why he believed the company would be a top performer, here is what the analyst said at the time:
“ I think if you look at Amazon, Meta, or Microsoft, it’s very strategic for them to have a second source. They need to keep Nvidia’s pricing in check. Nvidia, to their credit, while prices and margins have gone up, have not taken advantage of their customers. They’ve profited from them greatly, but they’ve not exploited their market position. The buyers we’re talking about—hundreds of billions of dollars going into AI infrastructure—they need to make sure there’s a competitor. We’ve already seen the AI category for AMD growing to a $5 billion market for them over the next year.”
Over the past year, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) shares have gained 36%. The stock is up 95% so far this year, thanks to the recent surge following its latest deal with OpenAI. AMD agreed to supply 6 gigawatts of compute capacity to OpenAI.
Macquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and manufactures semiconductors, including central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and other high-performance computing solutions for various markets like gaming, data centers, and AI. The company currently maintains a small market share for GPUs used for AI applications though by 2027, we believe the company will have product on par with the market leader, NVIDIA. Hyperscale customers with deep programming expertise may increasingly decide to dual-source high-end chips leading to much larger revenue and profit gains in coming years for AMD than investors currently expect.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Year to date, Salesforce shares have plunged 26.6%, underperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry’s gain of 21.6%. Moreover, Salesforce has been left behind by other major players in the enterprise software world, including Oracle Corporation ORCL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and SAP SE SAP. Shares of Oracle, Microsoft and SAP have risen 78%, 23.8% and 12%, respectively, year to date.

The sharp contrast raises a tough question: Is it time to move on from Salesforce, or is there still long-term value in holding on? While near-term issues are weighing on the stock, there’s still a strong fundamental case for staying invested.
Why Salesforce Stock Is Underperforming
A decelerating growth trend has turned investors cautious about the company’s near-term prospects. For years, Salesforce delivered double-digit revenue increases. However, that pace has now cooled to single digits. In the first half of fiscal 2026, revenues rose just 8.7% year over year, and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) grew by only 9.4%.
This slowdown reflects cautious enterprise spending amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical pressures. Analysts anticipate that this trend will persist, with high single-digit revenue growth expected for fiscal 2026 and 2027.
The impact is also visible in profit forecasts. Salesforce’s EPS is now expected to witness a CAGR of 13.5% over the next five years, which is a big drop from the 27.8% CAGR it posted over the previous five years.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
This changing growth profile shows how businesses are adjusting their IT budgets. Instead of large digital transformation projects, many are opting for smaller, lower-risk investments. For Salesforce, this means adapting its strategy to stay competitive and relevant.
Nonetheless, Salesforce still leads the global customer relationship management software market and holds the biggest market share, according to Gartner. This leadership position gives it a solid base to return to its robust growth trajectory.
Salesforce Dominates CRM Software Market
Salesforce remains the dominant player in the customer relationship management (CRM) software space. Its platform is deeply integrated across enterprise systems, making it a go-to solution for businesses."

finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-10T10:45:00,Prediction: The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) Will Surge Over the Next 10 Years. Here's 1 Reason Why.,This exchange-traded fund has averaged annual gains of more than 20% over the past 15 years.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a86739b856d4aa893aeb484026b192a30fefa302e0ecafc88bf394c0af664f06,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/prediction-vanguard-information-technology-etf-vgt/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/prediction-vanguard-information-technology-etf-vgt/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/10/prediction-vanguard-information-technology-etf-vgt/,fool.com,200,,"Which companies are you most bullish about for the coming decade? Many investors would name companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and other members of the ""Magnificent Seven."" Buying into many such stocks individually, though, can be a bit of work, and then following all those companies will be a lot more work.
So consider simplifying your life and just investing in a tech-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 0.77%). Why? Well, because with one investment, you'll immediately be invested in hundreds of technology stocks -- which together stand a good chance of outperforming the market over the long run. (An ETF is a fund that trades like a stock.)
Basically, its diversity of quality holdings is key to its performance. And I believe this ETF should do quite well over the next 10 years.
To whet your appetite, here's a breakdown of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF's long-term performance, contrasted with the performance of an S&P 500 index fund, in this case, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.40%).
| Average Annualized Return |
Vanguard S&P 500 ETF |
Vanguard Information Technology ETF |
|---|---|---|
| 5 years | 16.63% | 20.50% |
| 10 years | 14.99% | 23.24% |
| 15 years | 14.55% | 20.28% |
To be clear, a simple, low-fee S&P 500 index fund like VOO is also worth your consideration. During periods that feature big market pullbacks, which can begin at any time, the broader S&P 500 is likely to pull back less sharply than a tech-heavy fund. And the S&P 500 has delivered solid average annual gains of close to 10% over long periods.
While there are 300-plus companies in the ETF, more than half of its value is in its top 10 holdings -- and especially in Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. So do be sure that you have confidence in the outlook for those businesses before buying shares of this fund. And for best results, plan to hold it for a long time."

Acoba, the watchdog that assesses external jobs for MPs, has said Sunak will not be advising on UK policy matters.
The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments has in the past been accused of being toothless and unable to prevent MPs from taking employment that could cause a conflict of interest, or allow former parliamentarians to use contacts made in government for personal use.
Sunak was prime minister between October 2022 and July 2024.
It was thought he could be eyeing a job in Silicon Valley, California, after his general election defeat.
But in his final prime minister's questions appearance as Conservative leader, Sunak vowed to spend more time ""in the greatest place on Earth"", referring to his Richmond and Northallerton constituency.
He added: ""If anyone needs me, I will be in Yorkshire.""
Acoba has warned Sunak that he shouldn't provide advice to or on behalf of Microsoft on government work or its contracts until later next year.

Very last question I want to squeeze in. We've been talking here about all the potential AI winners.
As you look across the landscape, I ask both of you this, now and ahead, what are the kinds of companies Dan that you think, hey, they're at a structural disadvantage. These could be AI losers.
Yeah, I think the category that everybody's come to agree on here, Josh, is it's the enterprise SAS and applications companies. They're at the highest risk. And here's the reason why.
In the future, these agentic workflows that Pat mentioned, they're going to be able to just like we do with Chat GPT, you're going to ask it a question and it's going to be able to look across your entire data state.
It's going to then be able to abstract to you an interface. And it's going to be personalized to you.
Right now when you use a CRM or any sort of ERP platform or an HR platform, predetermined or highly customizable, lots of consulting, lots of spend, lots of seats, you know, and the way that whole business model works, I've been saying for a while, the software industrial complex is going to be reborn.
So the winners of the SAS era are going to have to make a really hard pivot. So the Adobes, Salesforces, service now all under pressure.
I think Service now's done a pretty good job telling its story. I think obviously Salesforce is trying with agent force, but in the end, Google is saying build your agents with us and build it all with us. And that is definitely creating new calculus for these companies that have had a multi-decade run.
Quickly, Patrick, you agree with that?
Uh I do. and I want to characterize that it's a foot race between what I call the horizontal agents from the hyperscalers uh versus the enterprise SAS agents. They have agents too that are very, um, vertical.
And the bet that the enterprise SAS companies have is they can do it quickly enough, friction, less friction at a reasonable cost and a reasonab reasonable premium. Some of these enterprise SAS companies are giving their AI away for free versus this other structure that says, I'm going to build these horizontal, um, I'm going to have these horizontal agents and I'm not going to I'm going to save money because I don't have to pay the premium for enterprise SAS.
Enterprise SAS is not going away. The question is its growth. And are are enterprises going to give the extra money to the enterprise SAS vendors for that AI magic? Or are they going to invest in these uh horizontal uh agents?
I think some of it'll go away.
Fellas, great to have you both here on set.
Thank you, Josh. Appreciate that.
That was terrific. Thank you."

Let's look at five tech leaders who have precisely those attributes.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) started out as a chipmaker supporting the video game industry: Its graphics processing units (GPUs) were designed to speed up graphics rendering in video games. However, it also created its CUDA software platform, which allows developers to program its chips for specific tasks, and cleverly gave it away free to universities and research labs -- including the places where early work on artificial intelligence (AI) was taking place.
That decision changed the company completely. In part due to the fact that developers are comfortable working with CUDA -- which is only compatible with Nvidia chips -- and in part due to the fact that it has long designed the top-performing GPUs, its parallel processors are well established as the foundation of the AI infrastructure being used to train and run the most complex models. Meanwhile, because so much of the initial AI code was created using CUDA, it's hard for developers to leave Nvidia's ecosystem.
Moreover, the company has continued to evolve and widen its moat, first through networking, and now with its investment in OpenAI.
Nvidia's strength is not just that it has the best chips, but that it has consistently identified new opportunities before others have and adapted to take advantage of them.
2. Alphabet
For many years, Alphabet's (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) Google search engine looked largely unchanged on the surface, but behind the scenes, the company has been constantly evolving the software, figuring out how to deliver better results and finding new ways to monetize them. It has also successfully navigated shifts in the space -- for example, the majority of search moving from desktop to mobile. Now, it's doing the same thing with AI, where its innovation is more noticeable thanks to AI Overviews and AI Mode.
The company gave itself a wide moat by becoming the gateway to the internet, and it has maintained it thanks in part to the huge distribution advantages it has via its Chrome browser and Android operating system. Its search revenue-sharing deal with Apple (AAPL 0.54%) only adds to this, and the reach of its ad network is unparalleled.
Alphabet also branched out into cloud computing, and built YouTube into a massive global platform. Looking ahead to markets that barely exist now, it has made big bets on robotaxis and quantum computing. This is a company with wide moats, and it continues to innovate and adapt.
3. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) probably doesn't get enough credit nowadays for either its moat or its adaptability. It went from being an online bookstore to the largest e-commerce player in the world by aggressively building out a huge fulfillment and logistics network. The unmatched diversity of its product offerings and its ability to quickly get goods to its customers have provided it with a wide moat. Today, it continues to expand on that behind the scenes through its use of AI and robotics.
It also gave birth to the cloud computing industry with its launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is now one of the most profitable cloud businesses anywhere, and its high switching costs keep its enterprise customers locked in. And it developed its own tensor processing chips, which give it a cost and performance advantage in offering AI processing power to its customers.
Amazon has shown over and over again that it's not afraid to rethink how it operates, whether that means automating warehouses or pushing into digital advertising, and that ability to keep evolving is why it stays ahead.
4. Apple
Apple's moat is rooted in the loyalty of its customers and the way its devices and services work seamlessly together. Once someone gets enmeshed in the Apple ecosystem, moving away from it is a hassle, which keeps people buying its products even at premium prices.
What's often overlooked is how much Apple has changed over the years, from being mainly a computer maker to dominating the mobile device market with the iPhone, and then building a high-margin services business. More recently, it, too, made the leap into designing some of its own chips, which gave it more control over performance and the user experience. Apple has proven it knows how to evolve without losing the loyalty that keeps its moat so strong.
5. Microsoft
Microsoft's (MSFT -0.15%) moat comes from how deeply its software is embedded in the daily processes of businesses around the world. Its Windows operating system and the Office suite of productivity titles that now come bundled into Microsoft 365 both have high switching costs that make it tough for companies to shift to rival options.
However, Microsoft does not get nearly enough credit for how it has been able to adapt over the years. It shifted from a boxed-software company to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company with Microsoft 365, and has also become a cloud computing leader with Azure. It also became one of the first large tech companies to fully embrace AI, investing in and partnering with OpenAI, and incorporating AI models throughout its different segments. That has been a big growth driver for the company in recent years.
Microsoft's combination of entrenched software and its willingness to adapt is what makes it a stock you could happily own for the next two decades."

Mr Sunak was urged to “look hard” at competition rules by Microsoft president Brad Smith in 2023, when the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the firm from taking over Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.
Mr Smith said the move had shaken “confidence” in the UK, and Mr Sunak’s official spokesman replied at the time that “those sorts of claims are not borne out by the facts”.
Microsoft later completed a deal, with CMA clearance.
Mr Sunak has also taken on a role at San Francisco-based Anthropic, which developed the Claude artificial intelligence (AI) models.

Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 3% in the morning session after investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald raised its price target on the stock, reflecting strong confidence in the company's artificial intelligence growth prospects.
The firm increased its price target to $300 from $240 while keeping an Overweight rating. This decision followed meetings where Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, and other executives detailed their vision for the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure. Adding to the positive sentiment, Huang stated that demand for computing had gone up substantially. Furthermore, key Nvidia supplier TSMC reported a second straight month of over 30% growth, fueled by demand for advanced AI chips.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $194.05, up 2.6% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Nvidia’s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago when the stock gained 2.3% on the news that several Wall Street firms raised their price targets on the stock and reports surfaced of a major deal involving its advanced AI systems.
The positive sentiment was fueled by a reported deal where cloud provider CoreWeave agreed to supply Meta Platforms with up to $14.2 billion in AI computing power using Nvidia's latest GB300 systems. This agreement highlighted the immense and sustained demand for AI infrastructure from major tech companies. Further boosting investor confidence, several financial firms, including KeyBanc, Barclays, and Citi, increased their price targets for Nvidia. Analysts pointed to an improving supply of key components and strong, continued spending in the AI sector as the primary reasons for their optimistic outlook, which helped push the stock to a record high.
Nvidia is up 40.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $194.05 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $14,100.
Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

“We are putting this out now because both internal and external customers are like, ‘This thing’s good, let’s go.’”
Quick Suite, which costs $20 per user per month, can integrate with Slack and other tools from close Amazon partner Salesforce Inc., and ingest data from internal databases, social media feeds, as well as Microsoft Corp.’s file storage or Adobe Inc.’s tools for creative professionals and marketers. The software is housed in a web app that can follow users around the internet via a browser plugin.
White said Quick Suite recently rolled out to Amazon employees, who have churned through a series of AI tools in the last few years.
“ChatGPT is great, but, you know, you can’t use it at work,” she said, nodding to the reluctance of many companies to let their workers put sensitive data into unsecured versions of the chatbot.
Plenty of people are anyway, and the largest technology companies have raced to deploy tools capable of competing with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft last week said it would move paid subscribers of its consumer Copilot chatbot into a new tier of its Office suite, an effort to shore up the company’s position with workers who want to bring AI to work. Alphabet Inc.’s Google on Thursday announced the debut of an AI platform called Gemini Enterprise, which is also aimed at everyday workers. The platform will cost a monthly fee of $30 per user, Google said.
Unlike those companies, AWS is a stranger to most laptop-toting workers, and didn’t play a leading role in the introduction of popular AI services. The most successful AWS products are building blocks like file storage and processing power for corporate technology departments and web developers."

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.
The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official. This marks the first time Nvidia has been allowed to ship its AI chips to the country since Trump became president.
The move follows the announcement of a massive AI infrastructure project called Stargate UAE during President Trump's visit to the country earlier this year. The project, unveiled in May, included a proposed 5 gigawatt data center hub in Abu Dhabi managed in part by OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and Oracle (ORCL), with infrastructure supplied by Cisco (CSCO) and Nvidia.
Trump's AI deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia have opened up new potential international markets for Nvidia as geopolitical tensions cloud its prospects in the Chinese AI market. Although the US government lifted a short-lived surprise export ban on sales of Nvidia's chips to China in exchange for a cut of its revenue from the region — a highly unusual arrangement that has yet to be finalized — China has now reportedly banned tech companies from buying Nvidia's chips.

In another boost to Nvidia stock on Thursday, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse published a note raising his price target on the company to a Wall Street high of $300 from $240, dismissing the recent growing fears of an AI bubble.
""We are still in the early innings of a multi-trillion AI Infrastructure build-out with just the Hyperscalers providing significant line-of-sight into hundreds of billions of dollars worth of demand for the next handful of years,"" Muse wrote. Hyperscalers are Big Tech cloud providers, such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet-owned Google (GOOGL, GOOG).
Muse's view highlights the bull side of the AI bubble debate, which sees Big Tech as justifiably rushing to build data centers to meet unprecedented AI demand.
""Thus, this is not a bubble, and we are still in the early innings of this investment cycle,"" Muse wrote.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also added to optimism over the company in comments to CNBC on Wednesday, saying that demand for the company's technology is showing no signs of slowing down.
""Demand for Blackwell is really, really high,"" Huang said on CNBC. ""I think we're at the beginning of a new buildout, beginning of a new industrial revolution."""

3 AI Stocks to Buy Right Now
Analog Devices is benefiting from secular growth drivers in automation, AI infrastructure, and automotive electrification. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is riding on its strong market position in high-performance analog (HPA), especially in the industrial, communications infrastructure and consumer markets. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Analog Devices has a leading market position in converters, where it has around half the market share. The company sells converters and amplifiers in integrated forms, which are categorized as “other analog” products. Analog Devices has a leading position in the digital signal processor market.
ADI expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenues to increase 23% year over year, with revenues of $3 billion at the midpoint, with industrial and consumer leading the recovery. This outlook suggests a return to Analog Devices’ long-term model growth of 7-10% annually, backed by structural tailwinds in AI, automation and electrification.
Micron Technology is benefiting from surging demand for HBM and robust DRAM pricing recovery. The pricing benefits are likely to be driven by rising AI server demand, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM supplies. This will support Micron’s margin expansion and profitability.

Micron is poised to be the key beneficiary of surging AI-related infrastructure spending, as companies continue to build out GPU clusters and AI data centers that require advanced memory solutions. AI PCs are an important part of Micron’s growth plan. MU’s new LPCAMM2 memory is made for AI-ready laptops and workstations that need to handle heavy workloads, such as AI tasks, simulations, and multitasking.
An expanding partner base that includes the likes of NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, is enabling Micron to capture a larger share of the AI infrastructure market. Deepening relationship with major cloud and enterprise customers ensures stable revenue streams and reduces the risk of pricing volatility. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Micron anticipates revenues of $12.5 billion (+/-$300 million) and adjusted earnings of $3.75 (+/- 15 cents).
Microsoft is benefiting from its strategy of infusing AI into its applications. AI assistants, including Microsoft 365 Copilot for commercial customers and the consumer Copilot in Windows, reached 100 million monthly active users in fourth-quarter fiscal 2025. The integration of AI capabilities across this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s product portfolio is driving revenues per user for Microsoft 365 commercial cloud products.
Microsoft is accelerating its AI push, committing more than $30 billion to capital expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Alongside this, the company has pledged an additional $30 billion to the U.K. over the next four years, signaling that its AI strategy is rapidly materializing and driving an aggressive global expansion. Microsoft is expanding its product ecosystem with the launch of proprietary AI models, MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-1-preview.
In terms of cloud infrastructure, Microsoft has transformed every Azure region into an AI-first environment with liquid cooling capabilities, positioning itself at the forefront of the AI infrastructure wave. Microsoft has added more than two gigawatts of datacenter capacity over the past 12 months, now operating more than 400 datacenters across 70 regions globally, above any other cloud provider."

Trading around $524 after posting year-to-date gains of 24.5%, the critical question for investors centers on timing: buy now or wait for a better entry point? The evidence increasingly suggests immediate action makes sense.
Harvard Partnership Signals Strategic Shift
The company's October 2025 partnership with Harvard Medical School represents a watershed moment in healthcare AI development. Microsoft is integrating Harvard Health Publishing content into its Copilot AI assistant to deliver medical-grade health information to millions of users. This move demonstrates a commitment to reducing OpenAI dependence while building proprietary healthcare capabilities that could generate substantial revenue streams. The partnership complements Microsoft's processing of 50 million health-related queries daily through Copilot and Bing, creating a data advantage competitors cannot easily replicate.
Financial Performance Validates AI Strategy
The financial results underlying these strategic initiatives prove remarkably robust. Microsoft delivered $76.4 billion in revenues during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, representing 18% year-over-year growth, while net income surged 24% to $27.2 billion. Full fiscal 2025 revenues reached $281.7 billion, with operating income climbing 17% to $128.5 billion. Most impressively, Azure cloud computing revenues surpassed $75 billion annually with 39% growth in the latest quarter, substantially driven by artificial intelligence services that contributed 16 percentage points to overall Azure expansion. The company's AI business alone now exceeds a $13 billion annual run rate, making it the fastest-growing segment in Microsoft's history.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is pegged at $74.99 billion, indicating 14.35% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $3.66 per share, indicating an increase of 10.91% from the year-ago period.

Healthcare AI Products Drive Real-World Impact
Healthcare AI specifically showcases Microsoft's ability to commercialize cutting-edge technology. The company launched Dragon Copilot in March 2025, creating the healthcare industry's first unified voice AI assistant combining natural language dictation with ambient listening capabilities. Clinical studies demonstrate that doctors using this technology save five minutes per patient encounter, enabling 13 additional appointment slots monthly while improving work-life balance by 70%. With more than 600 healthcare organizations already deploying ambient AI solutions, Dragon Copilot addresses the administrative burden costing the U.S. healthcare system an estimated 25% of total expenditure.
The June 2025 unveiling of Microsoft's AI Diagnostic Orchestrator achieved remarkable results, demonstrating 85% diagnostic accuracy on complex cases compared to just 20% accuracy from experienced physicians. This four-fold improvement came at a lower cost than traditional testing, suggesting enormous potential for healthcare cost reduction in an industry where spending approaches 20% of U.S. GDP.
Strategic positioning further enhances investment appeal. Unlike Amazon AMZN or Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, Microsoft operates as a trusted enterprise partner, enabling deeper collaborations with major health systems, including Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Stanford Health Care. The 20-year partnership with Epic Systems provides distribution advantages that new entrants cannot replicate."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-09T15:00:00,This distributed data storage startup wants to take on Big Cloud,Tigris has raised $25 million to expand its growing network of localized data storage centers — the storage layer for decentralized computing infrastructure.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e98bd9e0566eb972f721b3f4bd55c60967dd2779c60146d22ff582669a8be5da,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/distributed-data-storage-startup-wants-150000030.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/distributed-data-storage-startup-wants-150000030.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/distributed-data-storage-startup-wants-150000030.html,yahoo.com,200,,"The explosion of AI companies has pushed demand for computing power to new extremes, and companies like CoreWeave, Together AI and Lambda Labs have capitalized on that demand, attracting immense amounts of attention and capital for their ability to offer distributed compute capacity.
But most companies still store data with the big three cloud providers, AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, whose storage systems were built to keep data close to their own compute resources, not spread across multiple clouds or regions.
“Modern AI workloads and AI infrastructure are choosing distributed computing instead of big cloud,” Ovais Tariq, co-founder and CEO of Tigris Data, told TechCrunch. “We want to provide the same option for storage, because without storage, compute is nothing.”
Tigris, founded by the team that developed Uber’s storage platform, is building a network of localized data storage centers that it claims can meet the distributed compute needs of modern AI workloads. The startup’s AI-native storage platform “moves with your compute, [allows] data [to] automatically replicate to where GPUs are, supports billions of small files, and provides low-latency access for training, inference, and agentic workloads,” Tariq said.
To do all of that, Tigris recently raised a $25 million Series A round that was led by Spark Capital and saw participation from existing investors, which include Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The startup is going against the incumbents, who Tariq calls “Big Cloud.”
Tariq feels these incumbents not only offer a more expensive data storage service, but also a less efficient one. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have historically charged egress fees (dubbed “cloud tax” in the industry) if a customer wants to migrate to another cloud provider, or download and move their data if they want to, say, use a cheaper GPU or train models in different parts of the world simultaneously.

According to Batuhan Taskaya, head of engineering at Fal.ai, one of Tigris’ customers, those costs once accounted for the majority of Fal’s cloud spending.
Beyond egress fees, Tariq says there’s still the problem of latency with larger cloud providers. “Egress fees were just one symptom of a deeper problem: centralized storage that can’t keep up with a decentralized, high-speed AI ecosystem,” he said."

In its 3Q25 CIO survey, Morgan Stanley reported that “Microsoft remains best positioned to capture incremental share of GenAI spend and IT budgets as workloads move to the cloud.”
The bank said the company’s leadership is underpinned by its “strong alignment to key secular themes and CIO priorities, deep integrations across the software ecosystem, vast scope of products to monetise Generative AI, and significant and increasing AI infrastructure investments.”
According to the survey,“33% of CIOs expect Microsoft to gain the largest incremental share of GenAI spend in 2025, more than double the next highest vendor.
Meanwhile, over the next three years, 37% are said to expect Microsoft to gain the largest incremental share.
The bank added that Microsoft also remains the top IT wallet share gainer, with “a net +42% expecting share gains, up from +41% in our prior survey.”
Azure continues to lead in public cloud growth, with CIOs expecting it to be the fastest-growing hyperscaler in 2025.
Morgan Stanley said Microsoft is “well positioned for both growth and defence,” citing its strong exposure to AI, security, and cloud priorities.
The analysts reiterated an Overweight rating, calling Microsoft their “Top Pick in large-cap software,” adding that “valuation is still at a discount to peers.”
Overall, Morgan Stanley said Microsoft’s scale and ecosystem “translate to a higher lifetime value and stronger economics over the long-run.”

NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top recommended stocks.
Josh Brown from CNBC recently said in a program that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the best way to play the AI trade despite the stock’s bull run. He said most major AI deals end up benefiting NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Brown thinks investors should focus on the obvious winner in the space instead of thinking about the “next Nvidia.”
“NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still the most obvious way to play the AI buildout theme. Just look at the CoreWeave deal today. It’s a $14.2 billion agreement with Meta. It’s great for CoreWeave because it diversifies them a little bit away from Microsoft and adds another monster company to their roster of clients in a very big way. But what does Meta get out of this? They’re getting access to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Grace Blackwell 300 systems because CoreWeave already has that infrastructure in place and ready to go. This — all of this — benefit accrues to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the end. It may not go up the most from here relative to other AI plays, but it is the foolproof name for people that want to gain sector exposure or want to gain thematic exposure, and I don’t really see that changing. They’ve got this unbelievable competitive position. We’ve been talking about it on the show forever because it’s true, and everyone’s always like, well, what’s the next, what’s the new NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)? There are other ways to play AI. We’ve seen other chip companies work out. I’ve talked about Lam Research on the show. We’ve had Broadcom. We’ve had AMD. But in the end, I still think people would be better off looking for the obvious answers and defaulting to them. And if you’ve done that with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), congratulations. We’re now breaking into a new range, and who knows how high this one can go.”
It's hard to find cracks in Nvidia's story in the short term. Why? Nvidia owns about 90% of the GPU market, which is expected to reach $3 to $4 trillion by 2030, according to Jensen Huang. McKinsey sees data center CapEx hitting $6.7 trillion with no slowdown in sight in the short term. Nvidia’s next-generation GPU series Rubin is coming in 2026, and the company also has a software edge in AI computing with its CUDA platform, which is now the de facto standard for AI programming. With no competitor and rising global demand for its chips, Nvidia is a very strong market position.

With the Windows 10 end-of-support deadline less than a week away, refresh demand across all end-user segments continues to be the dominant factor driving shipment and activation growth.
Omdia Research Director Ishan Dutt noted, ""Business and consumer demand for PC upgrades continues to be healthy as the industry rapidly approaches the October 14 deadline to transition away from Windows 10. While Microsoft and its partners have greatly stepped up efforts to drive awareness, particularly amongst SMBs and consumers, a significant portion of the global Windows installed base remains either on Windows 10 or on a PC that is five or more years old.""
Recent polls of PC channel partners show that there is still much work to do in transitioning B2B customers onto Windows 11. Only 39% of 453 respondents in a September 2025 poll indicated that almost all of their customers’ PCs have been refreshed or upgraded. Another sizable 18% stated that their customers intend to continue using Windows 10 after the end-of-support deadline, with many likely to exercise Microsoft’s option of Extended Security Updates. For Microsoft and its OEM and channel partners, this represents a significant pool of users that will require ongoing targeting for awareness building and transition support.
""With upgrade demand spilling into Q4 and beyond, key industry players have outlined updated roadmaps for new products aimed at enticing PC purchases,"" said Dutt. Qualcomm unveiled the Snapdragon X2 Elite, a refresh of its premium positioned PC chipset, while Intel has announced its next-generation Core Ultra processors in the Panther Lake series. ""CES 2026 is set to be a showcase for new and compelling PC products as OEMs reveal updated portfolios that incorporate the latest chipsets, with on-device AI likely to be a rekindled theme following a relatively muted 2025,"" Dutt added.

Available starting at $30 per user per month for the Enterprise Standard and Plus editions and $21 per user per month for the Gemini Business plan, the platform is meant to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft's 365 Copilot. It will enable customers to use Google's Gemini to analyze corporate data and access AI agents in one place.
""Google Cloud is uniquely positioned because we offer all the layers of technology that people need in order to use enterprise AI at scale,"" Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said.
""Starting at the foundation, we offer infrastructure, both GPUs, as well as our own [tensor processing units], and Gemini is optimized on this stack to give you great performance, great quality, [and] low latency,"" he added.
Google said its offering benefits from a number of key features, the first of which is the company's Gemini AI models.
""You need a super-powerful large language model that forms the brains, or the nervous system, of how you interact with your enterprise systems using a large language model. And that is Gemini,"" Kurian said.
Gemini Enterprise also includes what Google calls a workbench, which allows users to coordinate AI agents to automate certain tasks, as well as a ""taskforce"" of prebuilt Google agents that customers can use to perform work such as deep research on topics.
Google said users will be able to connect Gemini Enterprise to existing data sources, including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and SAP. Customers can also track and audit agents to ensure they're working properly and with the appropriate data.
""What we're doing is bringing AI to every user by providing them [a] single front door through which they can chat with all of their enterprise data, search for information, and use agents ... to do a variety of tasks on their behalf,"" Kurian explained.
According to the Google Cloud CEO, companies ranging from consulting services to telecommunications to hospitality businesses to software firms are already using Gemini Enterprise for a variety of scenarios, including improving customer service and enhancing individual team productivity.
But Google's offering isn't the only game in town. Microsoft sells its own comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools that allow customers to chat with its Copilot bot to search and organize proprietary corporate data."

“That should ring alarm bells, even if the buoyant stock market keeps rising for a while amid enthusiasm for AI,” Higgins wrote in a note to clients, adding that “the current very high share of equities is a red flag to watch closely,” CNN reported.
According to Federal Reserve data cited by CNN, 45% of Americans’ household financial assets are now in stocks — an all-time high. That includes direct shareholdings as well as mutual funds and retirement accounts.

Even with periodic sell-offs — such as the sharp plunge in 2020 when the pandemic hit — the broader trend has been a powerful climb. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has returned more than 251%, (2) while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has soared about 375%. (3)
Still, Rob Anderson, U.S. sector strategist at Ned Davis Research, points out that record levels of stock ownership have historically coincided with increased risk of a downturn.
“Investors shouldn’t expect the same magnitude of returns that we’ve seen during the last decade to repeat. Going forward, over the next 10 years, there’s probably going to be a downshift in returns,” Anderson cautioned.
And economists aren’t the only ones worried. A recent Bank of America survey found that 91% of fund managers believe U.S. stocks are overvalued — the highest reading in data going back to 2001. (4)

But the fierce ascent has also raised concerns about a bubble.
AI has been the dominant theme in markets since 2022, when OpenAI first launched ChatGPT. Optimism has since spread among investors about a potential transformative AI boom, and enormous amounts of money have flowed into tech stocks. Valuations have risen to historically expensive levels.
To some analysts and economists, those are red flags that the market might be in a bubble — when investors bid up stock prices beyond what they’re worth, creating an unsustainable rally that often results in a significant downturn, as seen during the dot-com bubble that burst in 2000.
“Fired up by optimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI, global equity prices are surging,” Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech on Wednesday.
“Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” Georgieva said. “If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth.”
Jamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan Chase, said he thinks “AI is real,” but some money being invested now will “probably” be wasted.
“Take AI, there’s a lot of money going into it,” Dimon said in an interview with the BBC. “AI is real, AI in total will pay off. Just like cars in total paid off, and TVs in total paid off. But most people involved in them didn’t do well.”
Dimon also said he thinks there is a higher chance of a meaningful drop in stocks in the next six months to two years than what is being reflected in the market.
“I am far more worried about that than others,” Dimon said. “I would give it a higher probability than I think is probably priced in the market and by others.”
“The level of uncertainty should be higher in most people’s minds than what I would call normal,” he said, adding that geopolitics and government debt burdens are contributing to the uncertain outlook.
Bubble nerves
Big tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and infrastructure to build out and power AI, and have earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars for more spending.
These companies’ earnings results continue to impress Wall Street, supporting elevated valuations and the rally in stocks.
Yet some investors said there are questions about whether the spending and AI aspirations will eventually generate enough returns to justify the enormous buildout.
Concerns are growing about whether it is sustainable and what the fallout might be if there is a significant drop in stocks.
Concerns about a potential bubble intensified in recent weeks as AI stars like Nvidia and OpenAI announced deals with circular financing that raised eyebrows that the top players might be propping up the market.
The rise in valuations and emergence of circular financing are among aspects that “rhyme with previous bubbles,” according to strategists at Goldman Sachs.
“While it appears we are not in a bubble yet, high levels of market concentration and competition in the AI space suggest investors should continue to focus on diversification,” the strategists said in a note.
Despite concerns, anything related to AI has been in high demand. OpenAI on Monday announced a new deal with chip company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), sending AMD’s shares soaring almost 24%.
The rally has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble. However, investors said there is a key difference: Big Tech companies now are actually profitable and delivering strong earnings results.
“Unlike the 1990s tech bubble that featured soaring stocks from unprofitable early-stage companies, strong mega-cap company earnings are driving this year’s rally,” Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Asset Management, said in a note.
Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, said the market is signaling “bubble light” territory. He said investor sentiment has not yet reached the levels of exuberance that would signal the market is at peak risk levels.
“Valuations, positioning and flows are all certainly signaling that we’re in bubble light territory, but sentiment has just not got there yet,” Mullaney said. “And so this thing could still run.”
AI’s growing influence on the S&P 500
Big Tech is an increasingly influential part of the S&P 500, which is weighted by companies’ market value. As AI-related stocks have carried the market to record highs, they have also become a more significant part of people’s 401(k) retirement plans.
While the rapid growth of tech stocks lets individual investors and people saving for retirement take part in companies’ gains, it leaves people vulnerable to a potential extended drawdown if a bubble bursts.
Just seven stocks — Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for 55% of the S&P 500’s gains since the end of 2022, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
The Bank of England on Wednesday said the risk of a sharp downturn in the stock market has increased.
“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence,” the bank said in a quarterly report.
“This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” the bank said.
1996, 2000 or neither?
In 1996, then-Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan famously asked whether “irrational exuberance” might be taking hold in financial markets.
While Greenspan warned that the stock market could be running too hot on emotion, the dot-com bubble peak did not happen until four years later in 2000.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on September 23 said stocks are “fairly highly valued,” drawing comparisons to his predecessor’s comments 30 years ago.
Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note: “Is the stock market back on the road to the same irrational exuberance that inflated the Tech Bubble of 1999, which was followed by the Tech Wreck of the early 2000s? Perhaps.”
“However, the S&P 500 has been driven to new highs this year by better-than-expected earnings,” Yardeni said. “We are still targeting the S&P 500 to get to 7,700 by the end of next year.”"
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-09T08:12:00,"Meet the Brilliant Vanguard ETF With 59.3% of Its Portfolio Invested in the ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks",This unstoppable Vanguard ETF could supercharge the returns of any diversified portfolio.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1981b6306d90426534ebb5e854eab45c19e86f44fe73bca5f80ce77ae4e88261,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/meet-vanguard-etf-59-in-magnificent-seven-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/meet-vanguard-etf-59-in-magnificent-seven-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/meet-vanguard-etf-59-in-magnificent-seven-stocks/,fool.com,200,,"Wall Street adopted the ""Magnificent Seven"" moniker in 2023 to describe a group of seven technology companies that were consistently outperforming the rest of the market. They currently dominate different segments of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, which has accelerated their returns.
In fact, since the AI boom started gathering momentum at the beginning of 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks have delivered a median return of 178%. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained just 74% over the same period:
That means investors who don't own these powerhouse stocks have probably underperformed the broader market over the last few years, but I have some good news: There's a simple way to buy them all right now.
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK 0.59%) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests exclusively in America's largest companies, and a whopping 59.3% of the value of its entire portfolio is parked in the Magnificent Seven stocks alone.
The Magnificent Seven, with a splash of diversification
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index, which covers 70% of the market capitalization of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index. That means if we ranked all 3,508 companies in the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index by size, from the largest to the smallest, the Mega Cap Growth Index would start at the top and work its way down the list until it captured 70% of its total value.
The Vanguard ETF holds just 69 stocks, which shows the U.S. corporate sector is extremely concentrated. To put it another way, just 69 companies represent 70% of the value of all 3,508 companies listed on American stock exchanges. That leaves the remaining 3,439 companies accounting for the other 30%.
Since the Magnificent Seven stocks have a combined value of $20.7 trillion, it's no surprise they collectively have such a dominant weighting in the Vanguard ETF.

Nvidia supplies the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are the main chips used in AI development. Demand is outstripping supply for the company's latest Blackwell Ultra chips, which could fuel significant revenue growth from here.
Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are three of Nvidia's biggest customers. They each develop AI models and software for their own purposes, but they also operate cloud platforms where they rent data center capacity to businesses that use it to deploy their own AI projects.
Social media giant Meta Platforms is another one of Nvidia's top customers. It integrated AI into its content recommendation engine to keep users on Facebook and Instagram for longer periods of time, but it also developed the world's most popular family of open-source large language models (LLMs) called Llama, which power new features like Meta AI.
Apple launched its Apple Intelligence software last year, introducing powerful new AI features for its iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. With 2.35 billion active devices worldwide, this company could be one of the biggest distributors of AI software to consumers. Then there is Tesla, which is a leading developer of AI-powered autonomous driving and robotics technologies.
Despite its substantial exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks, the Vanguard ETF does offer a splash of diversification. Non-technology megacap stocks like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco Wholesale, and McDonald's are among its top 20 holdings.
The Vanguard ETF can help investors accelerate their returns
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 13.8% since its inception in 2007, and an accelerated annual return of 18.9% over the last 10 years, specifically. However, given its high degree of portfolio concentration, investors shouldn't put all of their eggs into this ETF alone.
Instead, the fund could be an ideal addition to any diversified portfolio that has little or no exposure to the Magnificent Seven already. Let's say, for instance, an investor parked $20,000 in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF 10 years ago, which is arguably the most diversified fund money can buy because it holds 3,500 stocks. That $20,000 would have grown to around $78,825 today.
However, had the investor split the $20,000 by placing $10,000 in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the other $10,000 in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, they would be sitting on $95,882 today instead.
This approach aims to ensure that investors aren't overexposed to volatile trends like AI, helping to protect them against steep losses if the technology fails to live up to expectations in the long run."

In early July, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang appeared on news platform CNN to warn that while artificial intelligence would significantly boost workplace productivity in the coming years, it could lead to job losses if industries lacked innovation. NVIDIA provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Huang said he believed that as long as companies came up with fresh ideas, there was room for productivity and employment to thrive. But without new ambitions, productivity drives down, he said, potentially resulting in fewer jobs. Nvidia, which briefly reached $4 trillion in market value, is among the companies leading the AI revolution. The technology employed by the chipmaker has been used to power data centers that companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google use to operate their AI models and cloud services.
An analyst from Goldman Sachs recently raised the price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock to $210 from $200 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. He updated the company’s model to reflect its strategic investments and partnerships with OpenAI and others. He also sees significant upside to 2026 estimates for Nvidia. The company has a strong runway of growth from core customers, plus upside from non-traditional customers, contends the analyst.
While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

What Wall Street Has Been Saying
Analyst commentary on Microsoft has intensified in recent weeks, with street research reflecting a strong mix of bullish and cautious perspectives. The company's robust financial results and ongoing momentum in AI and cloud have prompted a wave of analyst updates, but opinions remain divided on how much future upside may be priced in at current levels.
🐂 Bullish Takeaways
-
Many analysts have raised their price targets for Microsoft this quarter, noting ongoing acceleration in Azure growth and leadership in AI. For instance, Morgan Stanley recently increased its price target from $620 to $670, highlighting increased conviction in AI-fueled momentum.
-
Research notes from firms such as JPMorgan and Wedbush emphasize strong execution across cloud and productivity businesses, as well as consistent overperformance on both revenue and margins in Q4.
-
Investors continue to reward the company’s strategic clarity, effective cost management, and transparency around AI plans, supporting the view that Microsoft can sustain mid- to high-teens revenue growth over the coming years.
-
That said, even bullish analysts acknowledge that valuation is less compelling than earlier in the year and that much of the near-term upside may already be reflected in the stock price.
🐻 Bearish Takeaways
-
Some analysts, including Bernstein, caution that Microsoft's shares may be fully valued after their strong run, with limited near-term upside unless the company consistently beats ambitious financial targets. Bernstein recently reiterated its ""market perform"" rating, holding its target at $620.
-
Concerns have emerged about potential Azure capacity constraints and integration challenges related to recent large-scale contracts, such as those with Oracle, which could act as a brake on cloud growth if unresolved.
-
Bears also highlight elevated market expectations, suggesting that any stumble in execution or slower-than-expected innovation could prompt a pullback in the shares.
-
Competitive pressures across cloud and cybersecurity are noted as ongoing risks, with some analysts awaiting further proof of sustained market share gains before turning more positive."

In 2005, the two largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., when measured by market cap, were energy giant ExxonMobil at $392 billion and industrial bellwether General Electric worth $375 billion. Now, just 20 years later, technology companies spearheading advances in artificial intelligence (AI) rule the roost.
Four household names top the list. AI chipmaker Nvidia is the frontrunner at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), regularly climbing to new heights. Cloud and software provider Microsoft takes up second place, worth $3.9 trillion. iPhone maker Apple is nipping at Microsoft's heels at $3.8 trillion, and search pioneer Alphabet rounds out the top four at $3 trillion.
With a market cap of nearly $2.4 trillion, it seems almost a foregone conclusion that Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) will soon join the fold. The company has numerous growth drivers that continue to defy detractors, and the vast opportunity represented by AI will likely take the company over the finish line into the $3 trillion club.
A rare triple threat
What sets Amazon apart from the competition is its triad of successful businesses. While it's impressive for a company to have even one industry-leading business, Amazon has two and a third that's a strong contender in its field.
First up is Amazon's flagship e-commerce platform. The company made its fortune as a pioneer in the nascent e-commerce space in 1994, before ultimately earning the moniker of ""Everything Store"" and becoming the world's largest online retailer. Amazon is also the world's second-largest retailer, behind just Walmart.
Results from the second quarter help illustrate the overall magnitude of the company's success. Net sales of $167.7 billion increased 13% year over year, with 61% of the topline coming from digital retail or third-party seller services. This fueled net income of $18.2 billion, up 35%.
Amazon's second industry-leading business -- and by far its most important segment -- is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud infrastructure services business. AWS provides on-demand computing solutions, software applications, AI, and more.
The company continues to dominate the space it pioneered in 2002, with an estimated 30% of the market, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, with 20% and 13%, respectively, according to Statista. Furthermore, the cloud segment continues to grow at a respectable clip, up 17% year over year in the second quarter. AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income for the first six months of 2025, helping to fund the company's other growth initiatives.
Last but certainly not least is Amazon's fast-growing advertising business, which is fueled by its valuable product search, as well as Amazon Prime Video, live sports programming, Fire TV, and the company's live-streaming gaming platform, Twitch. Advertising revenue of $15.7 billion increased 23% year-over-year in the second quarter, accounting for 9% of total revenue. These statistics place Amazon third in the race for digital advertising dominance, behind only Google and Meta Platforms.
If that trio of successful businesses wasn't enough, Amazon is also one of the foremost authorities on AI, with more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already available for its cloud customers, and plans to offer many more. ""AI will be a substantial catalyst,"" according to CEO Andy Jassy.
The path to $3 trillion
Amazon has a market cap of roughly $2.35 trillion (as of this writing), so its stock price will only need to increase by roughly 27% to reach $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $902 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.
Wall Street is currently predicting Amazon's growth will clock in at roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. However, given its history of strong execution, that target us likely conservative and I predict the company will make the grade sooner.
Finally, at 34 times earnings, Amazon trades at a premium compared to a multiple of 31 for the S&P 500. That said, the company has delivered stock price gains of 712% over the past decade, far exceeding the 239% gains S&P 500. This helps illustrate why Amazon represents a compelling opportunity as it marches toward $3 trillion."

83% of organizations adopting Zero Trust have successfully reduced security incidents according to new global cybersecurity report
ASHBURN, Va., Oct. 9, 2025 /CNW/ - DXC Technology (NYSE: DXC), a leading Fortune 500 global technology services provider, today announced new global research, The Trust Report: From Risk Management to Strategic Resilience in Cybersecurity, conducted in partnership with Microsoft. The report found that Zero Trust has become an essential and widely adopted framework, yet organizations are still in the early stages of leveraging AI security tools - such as authentication, used by only 30% - revealing untapped potential to strengthen cybersecurity.
DXC and Microsoft commissioned global research, which included interviews with over one hundred cybersecurity experts across four continents. Security threats are rising fast, with AI giving attackers new ways to outsmart defenses and exploit weaknesses. In this climate, the Zero Trust model isn't just a best practice, it's becoming an essential framework for safeguarding organizations against an ever-evolving threat landscape. The report found that 83% of surveyed organizations adopting Zero Trust have successfully reduced security incidents, lowering remediation and support costs. At the same time, while cyber threats are on the rise due to AI, only 30% reported using AI-driven authentication tools to enhance their security practice. This striking gap underscores both the value of Zero Trust and the untapped potential of AI to deliver more proactive, adaptive protection against today's evolving cyber threats.
""Zero Trust is increasingly viewed as the standard going forward,"" said Dawn-Marie Vaughan, Global Offering Lead Cybersecurity, DXC. ""As AI-driven threats accelerate, organizations must evaluate security holistically across identity, devices, networks, applications, and data. At DXC, we're helping customers embed Zero Trust into their culture and technology to safeguard operations. Our end-to-end expertise makes it possible to both defend against AI threats and harness secure AI in the same decisive motion.""
Key findings from the report include:
-
66% of organizations cite legacy systems as their biggest challenge to Zero Trust adoption.
-
72% of enterprises say new threats are their primary driver for continuously improving Zero Trust policies and practices.
-
More than 50% of organizations discovered unexpected value in Zero Trust's ability to improve user experience alongside security.
""Most enterprises already rely on Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365 as the backbone of their IT environments,"" said Alex Simons, CVP, Microsoft Entra. ""Building Zero Trust solutions alongside DXC extends that value, enabling tighter integration, simplified operations, and greater visibility and control. By consolidating around the Microsoft stack, organizations can reduce complexity, cut costs, and accelerate their Zero Trust journey."""

The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security recently issued the Nvidia export licenses under the terms of a bilateral AI agreement hashed out in May, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity so they could discuss a sensitive issue.
The people declined to specify all the customers, but did say that the approved shipments are for American companies — including Oracle — operating facilities in the Gulf nation. Permits were not issued for Nvidia shipments to local customers such as Abu Dhabi AI juggernaut G42.
The US licenses came after the UAE made concrete plans for a reciprocal amount of investment on American soil, a US official said. The official declined to specify the exact value of the approved chip shipments and Emirati investment.
Nvidia shares rose 1.8% in US trading to a record high.
Representatives for the UAE and G42 did not respond to requests for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment. “The Commerce Department is fully committed to the transformational US-UAE AI partnership deal,” an agency spokesperson said. Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The licenses mark the first permits for Nvidia AI chip sales to the Gulf nation since Trump took office. They are a tangible sign of progress on an agreement announced nearly five months ago, centered on a massive 5-gigawatt data center in the Gulf nation’s capital that counts OpenAI as an anchor tenant. Other companies involved in that project include Oracle, Cisco Systems Inc., Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. and G42.
The UAE accord has been the source of significant consternation in Washington, where some officials in the Trump administration and on Capitol Hill have questioned the wisdom of building such a large site outside the US, especially in a place where Beijing has developed significant business and economic ties. Some in Washington have also expressed concerns about AI partnerships in Saudi Arabia, which were announced in May while Trump was touring the region.
Securing the permits is a priority for the UAE, where some officials have grown frustrated with what they see as a slow pace of US approvals. The Gulf nation is spending massively on AI infrastructure at home and overseas.
Underpinning the AI deal is an Emirati promise to invest a whopping $1.4 trillion on American soil over the next ten years, a pledge the Gulf nation has not broken down into specific projects. The US, meanwhile, planned to approve up to 500,000 advanced American AI chips annually, with a fifth slated for G42.
It’s unclear when additional licenses may be issued, the people said. The timing of permits will depend in part on how the UAE’s specific investment plans unfold. Under the accord, the oil-rich UAE will match in investment what it receives in chip shipments, on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
The Persian Gulf has major AI appetite and the money to back it, making the region among the world’s most important markets — and financiers — for technology giants like Nvidia and OpenAI. Gulf nations including the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been subject to US restrictions on advanced AI chip shipments since 2023, over concerns that the technology could be diverted to China, which is subject to more sweeping semiconductor controls.
Under President Joe Biden, US officials significantly slowed those license approvals, as they worked on a global framework that ultimately capped the volume of chip sales to many nations including the UAE. Under that policy, which Trump’s team is not enforcing and has said it will formally rescind, companies could bypass national limits in exchange for security commitments.
Biden’s team issued some licenses for chip shipments to the UAE toward the end of his term, people familiar with the matter said. Also under his administration, G42 struck a partnership with Microsoft Corp., based in large part on the Emirati firm’s promise to unravel ties with China’s Huawei Technologies Co.
Trump’s team, meanwhile, wants to go bigger. The Abu Dhabi data center was one of a spate of AI announcements to emerge from Trump’s trip to the Middle East in May. Officials have said the strategy is about both winning significant investment in the US and ensuring that Chinese companies such as Huawei don’t capture overseas customers in the AI race between the world’s two largest economies.
“President Trump’s policy boxes China out of the Middle East whereas the previous administration’s policy forced these countries into China’s arms,” White House AI czar David Sacks said this week.
Huawei has tried to woo customers in the UAE, Bloomberg reported in July, though it had gained little traction at the time. The company was offering potential clients a few thousand of its Ascend 910B AI chips, a generation-old model, plus remote access to more advanced systems located in China.
While Sacks and others have argued that’s a reason for the US to move faster, some Trump officials saw the small size of Huawei’s pitch as evidence that the Chinese hardware giant has a limited capacity to compete.
Prior to Trump’s trip, the US plan at one point had been to approve up to about 100,000 advanced AI chips annually, people familiar with the matter said. That later became up to 500,000 chips each year — an increase for which some officials feel the US did not get enough in return, particularly with regard to China-related issues. The officials believed that the bilateral accord from May lacked sufficiently detailed security conditions for the chip shipments, headed to a place with close ties to Beijing.
Sacks previously said the “vast majority” of advanced chips in the UAE “will be owned and operated by American cloud companies” — in line with the arrangement for G42 to get a fifth of the total shipments to the country.
But when local companies like G42 might secure those licenses, and under what conditions, remains an open question. Just a few weeks after Trump’s trip ended, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told lawmakers that “we are going to allow our allies to buy AI chips, provided they’re run by an approved American data center operator, and the cloud that touches that data center is an approved American operator.”

Stocks have been seeing some gains so far in October with the major indices reaching record closes. However, our next guest outlines why there is reason to be cautious and what that means for traders. Bob Lang, explosive options technical analyst joining us here now with the Options Playbook sponsored by Tasty Trade. Bob, great to see you, especially on set, sir. Uh let's start here. So the VIX perking up as it does tend to do this time of year, right? How do you play that, Bob? You know, are you concerned enough to buy protection on the general market?
Well, I look uh Josh, great to be with you. So I look at volatility in in terms of time frames, right? And when the market's been up for 7, eight, nine months of the year, like it is this year, it tends to lead to bullish behavior to the end of the year. And when that happens, we usually see a suppression of volatility. Now, the VIX is hovering around 16 17%, which is a little bit lower than normal. The average uh VIX is about 19 20%.
But it's a little bit lower than normal. It it's really feeding into more money coming into the market. Lower volatility tends to make people a little bit more relaxed, a little bit more uh aggressive into the markets. Um I think that that can be a little bit worrisome, especially since we're worried about um some uncertainties coming out here. and anything could hit out of left field, you know, whether it's tariff related or whether it's AI or whether it's something else or some earnings uh shortfalls coming up the next few weeks. I think it's really behooves most people to have some protection on and either buying volatility or else you're buying um puts, put options are very cheap right now. um with the VIX been at 16 17%. So I think that that's a that
Your bottom line is some caution is warranted here.
Absolutely.
Okay. I want to talk about AI as well. Lots of hot talk about an AI bubble from, you know, some very well respected investors saying, hey, they hear echoes of 1999. What's your what's your take on that?
Josh, you know there's always a bubble going on. There's always bubble somewhere. Um I I look, I go back to the the late 80s, right? There was a bubble in biotech. In the late 90s, there was a bubble in uh .com names in technology.
Does a bubble have to burst for you to know there was a bubble?
No, in fact, actually, you know what? The people who identify bubbles are the ones who actually are not into it. I was in the bubble during the late 90s, during the .com and I was loving it. It was great, making lots of money. And I'm sure right now, if there's a bubble going on in AI, there's a lot of people making money. Are they complaining at all? Absolutely not. So, you know, it's it's only at the end of the of the ride that people are getting upset and and and disgusted about.
Look, I mean there was some um talk from uh Paul Tudor Jones the other day. talking about, Yeah, I think yesterday he said, you know, we're in a bubble right now similar to that we're late 99 2000. And he did reference the period between October of 1999 to March 2000 where the NASDAQ went up 80%. Well, I I remember that time and I remember that a lot of short sellers got blown out of the water then during that six- month period.
So, you know, I I think you just have to keep it in context and keep the reference point is there of course uh that when you know, the market blew up and the Nasdaq dropped 72% from the highs in March of 2000 to uh to 2001. So, you you do have that reference point there, but I I do think that we really don't have to fear the fact that we're in a bubble right now. It's just make money as you can.
Um, let's get to some trades. Sticking with AI, talking about Google.
Google. So, um this has been a stock that's been one of my favorites over the past few months. And it's up something 70% since the lows in April. Um it's kind of consolidating right now. I do like the I like like the chart here. Um if it gets above 250, 253, it's got some room to to run. So I'm looking at maybe like a like a March call for uh for Google, maybe even even to January of a little bit shorter term.
But uh I'm looking at a call maybe paying about $17 in March. And if it gets past a certain level, about 253 to 255, this stock's got some got some leg to uh to run. I think that in 2026, this is going to be the year of Alphabet or Google. I think with the with a positive business environment, you've got lower interest rates coming in over the next couple of months and into 2026. And then uh deregulatory environment and also, you know, we've seen uh Google come out and settle with uh with the with the English government. And they got lawsuits with Europe and I think even in the United States, they're going to be settling these lawsuits and it's going to be a tail one for the stock.
And OpenAI, they're not going to come in and and just take search, Google's bread and butter.
I I think that Google's got a a real good foothold in this and look, they're number one in search. They they they continue to expand that footprint and search and there there really is no competition for them. And I I think going forward, um yeah, OpenAI is going to be some competition, but there's also other competitors out there too. There's Microsoft, there's Amazon, there's Apple too.
Speaking of Microsoft, you got a trade there, too?
Like I really like Microsoft. It's uh created a nice little bull shaped pattern here, Josh and it it ran up uh had an unbelievable run in the summertime, came back down, made a low here and it's making the higher highs and higher low, which is our textbook definition of an uptrend. And I I do like um Microsoft going into earnings season. Um I think it's going to make a run past uh 550 um and if it gets past that 550 marker, which is the old high back in early August, um I think it's got to run to 600.
Bob, always great to see you. Appreciate your time and those trades, sir.
Thanks, Josh."

Most Read from Bloomberg
“There’s no notion that Google has to date gained monopoly or market power” in the artificial intelligence market, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein told Judge Amit Mehta. Likewise, “there’s been no finding that Maps is a monopoly product or that YouTube is a monopoly product.”
Mehta, who found that Google has monopolized search and search advertising, is crafting a remedy to resolve the company’s illegal conduct. In a decision last month, he ruled that Google could no longer pay companies to exclusively use its Search, Chrome web browser or Google Play Store, though he declined to bar all payments outright. Mehta’s ruling incorporated aspects of proposals from Google and the Justice Department, which led to Wednesday’s hearing where both sides argued for him to adopt their language in a final order.
During the trial, witnesses testified that Google offers an “all-or-nothing” bundle to device manufactures, effectively requiring they preload nearly a dozen of Google’s apps if they want access to the the Play Store, the largest app store on Google’s Android operating system. That requirement, for example, forced Microsoft Corp. to feature Google search on its Surface Duo touchscreen device instead of its own search engine, Bing.
The Justice Department argued that the same prohibitions that apply to Search, Chrome and Play should also apply to Google’s Gemini, a proposal the company opposes.
Google’s YouTube is the TV service of choice for viewers of all ages, Bloomberg has reported. It now accounts for more than all of Walt Disney Co.’s TV networks and streaming services combined, according to recent data from Nielsen. It also generates more sales from advertising than all four broadcast networks combined, and users collectively watch over 1 billion hours of video on YouTube every day.
Google Maps, meanwhile, dominates the digital mapping and navigation market by a significant margin. Last year, the service surpassed 2 billion monthly users globally, placing it among a handful of Google’s most widely used products. Comparatively, Apple Inc. had “hundreds of millions” of Apple Maps users in 2020, the company has said. More than 5 million other apps and websites also rely on the Google Maps Platform to power location services like navigation and local business data."

In a new note, the firm called the artificial intelligence leader “the biggest case yet of Silicon Valley’s vaunted fake it ’till you make it ethos.”
“AI is a game of kings, and OpenAI knows it,” DA Davidson said, adding that the “staggering amount of compute required to build increasingly powerful frontier models” means that only a handful of companies, “MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META and Elon Inc,” can afford to compete.
According to the firm, “OpenAI has the lead with the top frontier model and the top AI chat app, and is trying to leverage that lead to become an instant mega cap.”
But its dominance “is still somewhat tenuous,” as “Google has made significant strides,” while “Anthropic is state-of-the-art for programming,” and “Meta and Elon are deploying tens of billions to catch up.”
DA Davidson said OpenAI is “likely at a $16bn revenue run rate” but “losing around $10bn this year.” Despite that, it “has embarked on its ambitious attempt to fake it ‘till you make it,” with “commitments now exceeding $500bn.”
“This is working so far,” the firm said, citing “the recent release of Sora 2,” which “represents a breakthrough in democratizing video generation.”
The firm concluded, “We prefer core AI winners MSFT and NVDA,” saying that “even if OpenAI does not ultimately succeed in becoming an instant mega cap, NVDA will have plenty of demand for its chips and MSFT will have plenty of AI customers.”

The company, which began operating in Mexico in 2006, said the investment will fund a new Mexico City office and a Global Delivery Center to support customers across the Americas.
""This $1 billion investment is a commitment to Mexico as a key market for AI-powered growth,"" CEO Marc Benioff said.
Mexico is rapidly emerging as a tech services hub, drawing investments from technology companies, particularly in the AI domain due to the country's proximity to the U.S. and growing talent base.
Microsoft announced last year that it will spend $1.3 billion over the next three years to build up its infrastructure in Mexico for cloud computing and AI.
Salesforce said Mexico is a growth market for the company, with a customer base including organizations such as Xcaret, Grupo Bafar and FEMSA.
""This investment will not only create jobs and build AI skills within Mexico but will also position our country as a key consultancy hub for markets across Latin America on AI agents and more,"" Mexico's Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said.
Last month, Salesforce forecast third-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates. The company had also announced a $20 billion increase to its existing share buyback program.
Salesforce has rolled out AI across its cloud services at a rapid pace, culminating in the 2024 commercial launch of Agentforce — its AI agent platform designed to automate tasks, streamline operations and help lift margins.

By integrating Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) with hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, the company has created a flexible and scalable environment that enables enterprises to run databases and applications seamlessly across multiple platforms. This compatibility is driving strong demand for Oracle’s infrastructure and boosting recurring cloud revenues. For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects total cloud revenues to grow from 32% to 36% in constant currency and from 33% to 37% in USD.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Oracle’s multi-cloud database services saw explosive growth, surging over 1,500% year over year. The company’s partnerships, particularly the Oracle Database@Azure initiative and a new Oracle Database@AWS launch, are expanding its reach and helping enterprises leverage the best of multiple ecosystems. This strategy is broadening Oracle’s market presence.
Looking ahead, Oracle’s upcoming Multi-Cloud AI Database is expected to further accelerate adoption. The new Oracle AI Database, set to debut at Oracle AI World, will allow customers to use large language models such as Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and xAI’s Grok directly on Oracle databases — unlocking new ways to extract value from enterprise data.
To sustain this momentum, Oracle is investing heavily by adding 37 new multi-cloud data centers and expecting OCI revenues to grow 77% year over year to $18 billion in fiscal 2026. With the Zacks model forecasting overall revenue growth of 16% in 2026 and 21% in 2027, the company’s multi-cloud expansion looks well-positioned to deliver lasting upside.
How Rivals Stack Up Against ORCL in Cloud Strategy
Microsoft MSFT Azure challenges Oracle in cloud strategy through its deep integration with Microsoft products like Office 365, SQL Server and Windows. Microsoft’s hybrid-cloud dominance, $47 billion cloud revenues and bold AI expansion, highlighted by new “Fairwater” datacenters and a $30 billion U.K. investment, underscore its leadership. With advanced Copilot AI tools and unmatched enterprise reach, Microsoft Azure delivers scale, innovation and flexibility, positioning Microsoft as the clear long-term powerhouse in cloud strategy ahead of Oracle.
Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud Platform (GCP) rivals Oracle with its dominance in AI, data analytics and open-source innovation. GCP leverages Google’s global infrastructure, BigQuery and TensorFlow to power data-intensive workloads. With $85 billion in planned 2025 capital spending — two-thirds for AI-focused datacenters — Alphabet is scaling aggressively through custom TPUs and major deals with Meta and OpenAI. Alphabet’s AI-centric strategy, hybrid-cloud flexibility and relentless innovation firmly position GCP as a powerful, next-generation challenger to Oracle’s enterprise cloud ambitions."

AAOI’s forward P/E was 84.03 according to Yahoo Finance.

Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) stands out as a speculative yet compelling beneficiary of the ongoing data center buildout, which shows no sign of slowing until lenders or hyperscalers curb spending. With U.S. data center construction projected at 10GW annually through 2030, demand for optical transceivers is set to surge, supporting AAOI’s growth trajectory. The company manufactures transceivers critical for converting fiber optic to electronic signals, a market expected to expand from $15 billion today to $35 billion by 2029.
AAOI has been approved as a supplier for at least three hyperscalers—Microsoft, Meta, and likely Amazon, with SEC filings confirming Amazon holds warrants tied to a potential $4 billion supply agreement. While not yet firm orders, early shipments are already driving performance, with Q2 revenue up 139% year-over-year and trailing twelve-month revenue up 77%. Current quarterly sales of $103 million are projected to rise another 12–23% in the near term.
AAOI’s past failures, including quality issues in 2018 that collapsed its stock from $70 to $2, still weigh on investor sentiment, explaining its high options volatility and cautious valuation. Yet management’s insider buying and growing hyperscaler ties indicate confidence in execution. If AAOI merely maintains its current 2% market share, revenues could surpass $1 billion by 2029, implying a modest doubling of market cap.
However, if it regains a 5% share, revenues could approach $2.5 billion, implying a market value near $9 billion and a stock price above $140, versus today’s $26. The key risks remain quality execution and sustainability of hyperscaler investment, but with hyperscalers generating $400 billion in annual operating cash flow and competing aggressively, the buildout appears durable. This sets AAOI up as a high-risk, high-reward play with asymmetric upside if market share expansion materializes.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Fabrinet (FN) by Industrial Tech Stock Analyst in April 2025, which highlighted the Amazon warrant deal as a strategic validation of Fabrinet’s role in hyperscaler supply chains and a catalyst for long-term growth. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 83% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. The thesis still stands as Fabrinet remains a critical optical supplier. Unemployed Value Degen shares a similar view on data center growth but emphasizes AAOI’s hyperscaler approvals and potential market share expansion as a high-risk, high-reward play."

We recently published Top 10 Trending Stocks as Famous Billionaire Predicts Massive AI Stock Rally Before Bubble Burst. CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the trending stocks.
Amit Daryanani, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, said in a latest program on CNBC that CoreWeave Inc (NASDAQ:CRWV) is positioned to benefit from the rising AI infrastructure demand. He recently started covering the stock with a $175 price target.
“You have Microsoft and Meta over here and hopefully other customers as well. I do think fundamentally what’s happening with them right now is demand for AI infrastructure is far in excess of what supply is. Coreweave is positioned to benefit really well from having one of the largest independent GPU clusters — 250,000 plus GPUs — that a lot of customers beyond just Microsoft and Meta could use. I would argue customers like Google and others could look at this as well to meet incremental demand, because that’s really what the shortage is right now: there’s not enough supply to go around for all these companies.”

While we acknowledge the potential of CRWV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Cisco Systems launched on Wednesday a new networking chip designed to connect artificial intelligence data centers, with the cloud computing units of Microsoft and Alibaba enrolling as the chip's customers.
The P200 chip, as Cisco calls it, will compete against rival offerings from Broadcom. It will sit at the heart of a new routing device that the company also rolled out on Wednesday and is designed to connect the sprawling data centers that are located over vast distances and which train AI systems.
Inside those data centers, companies such as Nvidia are connecting tens of thousands and eventually hundreds of thousands of powerful computing chips together to act as one brain to handle AI tasks.
The purpose of the new Cisco chip and router is to connect multiple data centers together to act as one massive computer.
""Now we're saying, 'the training job is so large, I need multiple data centers to connect together,'"" Martin Lund, executive vice president of Cisco's common hardware group, told Reuters in an interview. ""And they can be 1,000 miles apart.""
The reason for those big distances is that data centers consume huge amounts of electricity, which has driven firms such as Oracle and OpenAI to Texas and Meta Platforms to Louisiana in search of gigawatts. AI firms are putting data centers ""wherever you can get power,"" Lund said.
He did not disclose Cisco's investment in building the chip and router or sales expectations from them.
Cisco said the P200 chip replaces what used to take 92 separate chips with just one, and the resulting router uses 65% less power than comparable ones.
One of the key challenges is keeping data in sync across multiple data centers without losing any, which requires a technology called buffering that Cisco has worked on for decades.
“The increasing scale of the cloud and AI requires faster networks with more buffering to absorb bursts"" of data, Dave Maltz, corporate vice president of Azure Networking at Microsoft, said in a statement. ""We’re pleased to see the P200 providing innovation and more options in this space.""

HOBOKEN, N.J., Oct. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- With the end-of-life date for Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 rapidly approaching, leading Managed Services Provider (MSP) eMazzanti Technologies urges companies to take action now to ensure a smooth transition and maintain their business continuity.
""The end-of-life status of Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 will land on October 14,"" notes eMazzanti President Carl Mazzanti. ""At that point, Microsoft will no longer provide security updates or patches for these versions. This means that any new vulnerabilities discovered after the end-of-life date will not be addressed, potentially leaving your systems exposed to security threats, operational disruptions, and compliance penalties. But highly trained eMazzanti professionals can assess your organization's needs and help you implement appropriate solutions.""
He goes on to caution that organizations required to adhere to specific regulatory standards may face compliance issues if they continue to use unsupported software. ""This could result in legal and financial penalties. Additionally, without ongoing support and updates, the risk of operational disruptions increases. Any issues that arise will not be resolved by Microsoft, potentially leading to downtime and productivity losses.""
Further, ""as other software and systems continue to evolve, organizations that continue to use Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 for email, calendar management, and other communication tasks could suffer from compatibility issues with newer applications and services,"" Mazzanti adds. ""This could hinder the integration and functionality of your business processes.""
To prepare for this critical transition, Mazzanti says companies should work with an MSP to conduct a thorough assessment of their current Exchange Server environment to understand the scope of the migration and identify any potential challenges.
""Next, evaluate your migration options,"" he counsels. ""Work with a trusted MSP like eMazzanti to explore various migration paths — such as upgrading to Microsoft Exchange Online or other cloud-based solutions — to determine the best fit for your organization's needs. We can create a detailed migration plan for your organization that includes timelines, resource allocation, and contingency measures to ensure a seamless transition.""
Once a solution is determined, ""Your MSP will perform comprehensive testing and validation of the new environment to ensure all systems and applications function correctly post-migration,"" outlines Mazzanti. ""To make certain that everyone is aligned, keep all stakeholders informed about the migration process, timelines, and any potential impacts on business operations. Taking these proactive steps enables your company to mitigate risks and ensure a successful migration to a supported platform. But it is essential to act now to avoid any disruptions and maintain the security and efficiency of your IT infrastructure."""
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-08T13:03:24,"Goldman Sachs strategist: No stock market bubble, yet","The bank says tech valuations are stretched, but not all levels are consistent with past cycles.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=08f520b9092da84c292d697794d215e19a1f05d9198e6c3ad7060e58b3fed5d1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-strategist-no-stock-market-bubble-yet-130324119.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-strategist-no-stock-market-bubble-yet-130324119.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-strategist-no-stock-market-bubble-yet-130324119.html,yahoo.com,200,,"The stock market may look like it's on a high, but according to Goldman Sachs (GS), it hasn't crossed into bubble territory.
""There are elements of investor behaviour and market pricing currently that rhyme with previous bubbles,"" Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman's chief global equity strategist, wrote in a new note. ""However, we see key differences.""
The report pointed to several similarities between today's market and past speculative booms. Valuations are climbing, market leadership is narrowing, and capital intensity is increasing. Additionally, the emergence of vendor financing in the AI space is echoing dynamics seen in the late-1990s tech bubble.
Oppenheimer pointed out that bubbles typically occur when the combined market value of companies linked to a new technology far exceeds the cash flows they can realistically generate. That disconnect hasn't happened yet, he said.
The AI boom so far has been led by a group of tech giants — including Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) — with little sign of the explosive competition that typically fuels market excess.
Indeed, Big Tech's dominance has ballooned. The five largest US tech companies are now worth more than the combined markets of the EURO STOXX 50 (^STOXX50E), the UK, India, Japan, and Canada. Meanwhile, the 10 biggest US stocks — eight of which are tied to tech — account for nearly a quarter (24.5%) of the entire global equity market, at roughly $25 trillion.
That level of concentration could raise bubble comparisons and has even prompted investors to start questioning ""whether all of this is rational or ... classic signs of an unsustainable bubble.""
But unlike those earlier episodes, Oppenheimer argues that today's rally has been supported by strong fundamentals, ""rather than irrational speculation about future growth."" The report also noted the biggest winners — such as leading AI and cloud companies — have unusually strong balance sheets, providing a cushion that many dot-com firms lacked.
Still, Oppenheimer isn't dismissing concerns outright. Valuations in the technology sector are ""becoming stretched,"" the note said, citing a range of metrics including P/E ratios, PEG ratios, price-to-book versus return on equity, and dividend discount models.
However, those valuations have not yet reached the extreme levels seen in past bubbles, such as the dot-com era or the late stages of the 2020-2021 tech surge.
For now, the rally appears to be on firmer ground, though not without risks."

Chicago, IL – October 8, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: CoreWeave CRWV, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT and Nebius NBIS.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Will the $14.2 Billion Meta Deal Give CoreWeave the Edge Over Competitors?
CoreWeave's position in the rapidly growing AI infrastructure market is likely to get a boost following its recent deal with Meta Platforms. Under the partnership, CRWV will supply META with cloud computing capacity. Depending on certain conditions, Meta will initially pay up to $14.2 billion through Dec. 14, 2031, with an option to expand significantly through 2032 for more cloud capacity. This deal indicates increasing confidence in emerging AI infrastructure providers like CoreWeave, beyond established players such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.
The META deal comes after the recent OpenAI contract expansion. The new contract, worth $6.5 billion, involves CRWV supplying capacity for OpenAI training of its next-generation models. The total value of OpenAI contact now stands at an impressive $22.4 billion, which includes $11.9 billion agreement in March and $4 billion expansion in May. The contracts with META and OpenAI (which is a leading AI company) not only enhance revenue visibility for CRWV but also validate its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable.
Moreover, collaboration with NVIDIA is another positive aspect. CRWV's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. Additionally, the company deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its ""Mission Control"" for enhanced reliability and performance. NVIDIA also has an agreement with CRWV to purchase residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions.
However, the road to market dominance would not be easy, given that the incumbents in this space still command vast financial resources. There is also fierce competition from upcoming players like Nebius, which CoreWeave needs to watch out for. Another challenge will be scaling efficiently without compromising profitability and margins.
Nonetheless, these various contracts mark a pivotal moment for CRWV, but maintaining this momentum will require disciplined execution, prudent capex management and continued innovation amid rising competition."

OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), a company that hasn’t turned a profit, is spending billions building out data centers to power its artificial intelligence offerings.
On Monday, the company inked a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal with AMD (AMD) that will see the chipmaker provide next-generation GPUs to OpenAI, which will also have the opportunity to purchase up to 10% of the company. Nvidia (NVDA), in turn, is pouring $100 billion into OpenAI, which is also a major customer.
Meanwhile, tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) continue to spend billions on their own AI data centers. Then there’s the $40 billion Oracle (ORCL) is spending on Nvidia chips to power OpenAI’s Project Stargate, the Financial Times reported in May.
It all makes for a rather confusing array of deals and moves that continue to raise questions about when exactly all of this spending will turn into profits, not to mention the specter of the dot-com crash of the early 2000s.
But even if the AI hype cycle plays out like the dot-com bubble, a good amount of that investment in AI infrastructure will still pay off, at least in the long run.
“I actually do believe that there is significant long-term demand,” Ram Bala, associate professor of business analytics at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University, told Yahoo Finance.
“I think it's definitely going to pan out. The macroeconomic challenge is ... there's probably going to be this intermediate phase where it seems like we overbuilt a lot of this and demand isn't quite catching up to all of that.”
Bubbling up
Fears of an AI bubble have been percolating for months as AI stock prices and corporate valuations have continued to soar. Nvidia, the world’s AI chip leader, has a market capitalization north of $4.5 trillion. On top of that, OpenAI is now valued at $500 billion, more than Elon Musk’s SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), which is valued at $400 billion.
The explosion in AI interest and the promise of future riches have also sent Microsoft and Google’s valuations above the $3 trillion mark, with Microsoft quickly closing in on $4 trillion.
It’s enough to raise the hair on anyone’s neck.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos last week said that we’re likely witnessing an AI bubble during a discussion at Italian Tech Week, but he added that some of those investments will eventually pay off.
""When people get very excited, as they are today, about artificial intelligence, for example ... every experiment gets funded, every company gets funded,"" Bezos said. ""The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and bad ideas."""

Jeff Raikes has joined the company's board as an independent director, bringing a distinguished background that combines technology innovation and large-scale business operations. At Microsoft, Raikes helped build some of the world's most influential software platforms, and at Costco, he gained firsthand experience in global distribution and operational excellence. His expertise in scaling organizations and expanding product reach will be instrumental as Lumen advances its portfolio toward commercial launch.
Additional leadership updates include the promotion of Nhi Khuong, PhD, to Executive Vice President and Kole Krieger to Senior Vice President, and the appointment of David Saunders, MD, MPH, who joins Lumen's clinical development team after retiring as a Colonel and clinical trialist in the U.S. Army. In addition, board director Erik Anderson has been elected Vice Chairman, where he will work closely with board co-chairs and co-founders Brian Finrow and Jim Roberts. Since 2023, Lumen's team has grown nearly 39%, averaging more than 15% annual growth, and inaugurated a second dedicated GMP facility to keep pace with rising demand for clinical trial drug supplies.
These enhancements to Lumen's leadership team accompany this summer's completion of an oversubscribed $30 million Series C financing extension led by WestRiver Group with significant participation from the Gates Foundation and existing investors. The consortium of new participating investors includes visionary company builders, including Matt Horner, Executive Vice President of Global Enterprise at World Wide Technology, Jim Kavanaugh, Chief Executive Officer of World Wide Technology, Adebayo Ogunlesi, Five Raynham LLC, Jeff Raikes, former President of Microsoft Business Division and former Chief Executive Officer of the Gates Foundation, David Siegel, Co-Founder and Co-Chairman of Two Sigma, and Jerry Yang, Founder of Yahoo.
The fresh funding supports acceleration of Lumen's late-stage clinical programs and commercial readiness activities. The leadership enhancements follow the recently announced success of investigational LMN-201 for recurrent C. difficile infection in the Phase 2 segment of the RePreve Clinical Trial.
Brian Finrow, CEO of Lumen Bioscience, said:
""This milestone affirms the transformative power of spirulina-based GMP manufacturing. As our clinical programs continue to mature, we are thinking more and more about commercialization and distribution. The new investors joining us through WestRiver Group have built some of the world's most impactful organizations in the past 40 years. We're excited to be able to draw on their knowledge and expertise as we work to build Lumen into an enterprise with similar impact."""

Billionaire investor Steve Eisman warns of a very different economic reality if one were to remove the gains of AI from the equation.
The financial analyst best-known for predicting the 2008 housing collapse—and made famous by the 2015 film The Big Short—said on a recent episode of The Real Eisman Playbook podcast that the U.S. economy is a “tale of two cities”: While GDP growth may indicate a robust economy, by removing AI expenditures from the picture, you instead see stagnation.
The U.S. GDP in 2024 was $29.18 trillion, estimated to grow by 1.8% in 2025, Eisman said. That 1.8% growth is worth about $530 billion. But if you were to factor in the AI infrastructure spending by Magnificent Seven companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, it would total about $400 billion, by Eisman’s calculations, meaning if you were to subtract that sum from the projected growth of U.S. GDP, it would amount to very little.
“The U.S. economy is not even growing, really, 50 basis points outside of AI,” Eisman said. “So clearly there have to be pockets of weakness.”
A wealth of economists and tech giants have warned of an expanding AI bubble as investments in the technology mount with little robust evidence so far of the technology’s transformative ability. As concerns over little job growth and creeping inflation grow, so too does worry about the health of the U.S. economy.
Signs of a limping consumer piles onto these fears. According to a New York Federal Reserve Bank report released in August, household debt increased by $185 billion to reach $18.39 trillion in 2025’s second quarter, while auto loan balances increased by $13 billion, hitting $1.66 trillion. Student loan balances also inched up $7 billion to total $1.64 trillion.
“The pain is going to happen across the board,” Lakshmi Ganapathi, founder of investment research firm Unicus Research, told Eisman on the podcast. “It’s in the retail. It’s in the buy-now-pay-later. It’s definitely in the auto.”
Warning signs in the auto sector
Ganapathi points to the auto sector as a case study for a hidden way consumers are struggling. During the pandemic, the stimulus checks many Americans received—totaling 476 million payments worth $814 billion—made consumers appear wealthier than they really were to banks, she said. This allowed them to qualify for prime loans, despite not truly having that wealth.
“The credit score prime was an illusion,” Ganapathi said. “Whatever the prime credit scores that are sitting on the [asset-backed security] are technically subprime.”
The pandemic also marked a period of booming car sales, many above sticker price, as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) hiked prices as a result of supply-chain issues and increased consumer demand."

According to the firm, investors will be mainly watching out for how much Azure’s cloud business can grow given the incremental capacity in the first quarter.
Since the last two prints already present a high bar, the company faces tough comparisons. Nevertheless, the company is well-positioned to benefit.
“Key debate into FQ1 will be degree of Azure upside given incremental capacity in 1Q, though the last 2 prints (300/400bps Azure beats) present a high bar. With recent demand signals intensifying, expect MSFT broadly set to benefit. Raise PT to $675.”

Most Read from Bloomberg
That’s the view of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist Peter Oppenheimer, who said the record-breaking rally in tech heavyweights has been accompanied by robust earnings growth. In past bubbles, the market was driven higher mainly by speculation.
“Valuations of the technology sector are becoming stretched but not yet at levels consistent with historical bubbles,” Oppenheimer and his team wrote in a note.
Still, the strategist reiterated his recommendation that investors seek diversification to avoid risks around a narrow US stock rally and higher competition in the artificial intelligence space.
A handful of tech giants including Nvidia Corp., Broadcom Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have driven US stocks to record highs as investors bet on sustained earnings growth and improved productivity from AI.
While recent positioning metrics from banks such as Goldman and Barclays Plc suggest investors remain bullish about the outlook for further equity gains, some market participants are turning cautious about the payoff from hefty spending on AI.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index slipped on Tuesday after a report that the profit margin for Oracle Corp.’s cloud computing business is lower than many have been estimating. Meanwhile, data compiled by Bloomberg show mentions of “tech” and “bubble” in news stories have jumped in recent weeks.
Valuations are also on the rise. The Nasdaq 100 trades at 28 times forward earnings, compared with a 10-year average of 23. The All-Country World Index ex-US carries a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.
Goldman’s Oppenheimer said bubbles tend to develop when the average value of companies soars beyond implied future cash flows. This time around, he said, the best-performing tech stocks have “unusually strong balance sheets.”
Moreover, a rise in valuations across equity and credit markets means “this is less about a bubble in technology and more about the general conditions of low interest rates, high global saving and an extended economic cycle,” he wrote.
“This does leave them vulnerable to a correction if confidence in growth fades, but this is less likely to be driven solely by a bubble bursting in the technology space,” Oppenheimer said."

LONDON, October 08, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to Forrester's (Nasdaq: FORR) 2026 European Predictions, unveiled today at Forrester's Technology & Innovation Summit EMEA in London, while European firms will intensify the quest to reduce their dependence on global resources and achieve sovereignty over their technology stack and digital platforms, no European enterprise will shift entirely from US hyperscalers in 2026.
Geopolitical tensions, ongoing volatility, and the impact from new legislative acts like the European Green Deal, and the rollout of the EU AI act will prohibit European enterprises from experimenting with high-risk use cases, resulting in continued reliance on U.S. hyperscalers, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.
Key highlights from Forrester’s 2026 European Predictions include:
-
Consumers’ daily use of generative AI in Europe will double, but enterprise adoption will lag behind the US. As AI becomes ubiquitous, consumers’ daily use of AI will double in most European countries in 2026. However, due to tighter European Union regulations, and less mature AI capabilities, European firms will lag their US counterparts on AI adoption. With lighter regulation and fewer language barriers, the UK will buck both trends.
-
Defence spending will drive a 20% technology budget uplift for EU critical infrastructure operators. In June 2025, NATO members pledged to raise defence spending to 5% of GDP, with 1.5% earmarked for ""enabling"" infrastructure. Forrester predicts public-sector bodies and critical infrastructure operators will see tech budgets rise by 20% next year.
-
The UK AI strategy will drive public sector productivity but erode government trust. The UK government’s enthusiasm for US AI tech through partnerships with Anthropic and Open AI, refusal to sign international agreements on AI governance, and lack of interest in passing binding AI regulation will erode UK citizen trust in the government.
""The European Union is making a concerted effort to become more competitive and reduce its dependence on global tech infrastructure,"" said Dane Anderson, SVP, International Research & Product at Forrester. ""However, the reality is that ongoing volatility and operational constraints will compel European businesses to pursue more pragmatic strategies in both the long and short term. Forrester’s predictions are designed to help European leaders analyse the dynamics and emerging trends to watch for in the year ahead. These insights will then prepare them for future challenges and enable them to take advantage of new opportunities to thrive in 2026."""

He is the portfolio manager at Coatue Management, a hedge fund that beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) by 122 percentage points during the three-year period that ended in June.
Laffont made some notable trades in the second quarter. He sold 596,100 shares of Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), trimming his stake 5%. He also bought 3.3 million shares of CoreWeave (CRWV 3.86%), an AI stock backed by Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), which now ranks as his largest holding at 8% of his portfolio. CoreWeave stock is up 230% since going public earlier this year.
Here's what investor should know.
Amazon: The stock Philippe Laffont sold in the second quarter
Amazon has a strong presence in three big industries. The company accounts for more than 40% of U.S. e-commerce sales and 15% of digital ad spending, and it's gaining share in both markets. Also, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts for 30% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending, nearly as much market share as Microsoft and Alphabet hold combined.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of the growth strategy. In retail, AI tools help allocate inventory, forecast demand, and streamline last-mile delivery. In advertising, generative AI tools help brands create images, videos, and audio for campaigns. In cloud computing, AWS regularly introduces features to support AI workflows, such as recently added tools for building and managing AI agents.
Amazon reported second-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 13% to $167 billion on particularly strong growth in advertising and cloud services. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 1.5 percentage points as AI innovations continued to drive efficiency, and GAAP net income increased 33% to $1.68 per diluted share.
Wall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings seem fair. My guess is Philippe Laffont trimmed his position to rebalance his portfolio after Amazon stock popped in the second quarter. Whatever the reason, I am confident the decision to sell does not reflect a lack of conviction. Amazon is still his third largest position at 6% of his portfolio.
CoreWeave: The Nvidia-backed AI stock Philippe Laffont bought in the second quarter
CoreWeave is the leader among an emerging class of cloud computing platforms known as GPU clouds or AI clouds. Whereas traditional clouds like AWS and Microsoft Azure were built for a broad range of workloads, CoreWeave designed its data centers specifically for artificial intelligence and it was recently ranked as the most capable AI cloud services provider by SemiAnalysis, a research company that specializes in the semiconductor industry.
""CoreWeave's product offerings sets a new standard across the GPU cloud industry,"" wrote Chief Analyst Dylan Patel. ""As demand for high-performance compute continues to grow, CoreWeave's investments in software and hardware infrastructure makes them a clear leader in GPU cloud reliability."" The report highlighted its close partnership with Nvidia as a key strength because it affords the company early access to the latest GPUs.
CoreWeave reported explosive second-quarter financial results. Revenue surged 207% to $1.2 billion and non-GAAP operating income increased 135% to $200 million. Meanwhile, revenue backlog jumped 86% due to expanded contracts with OpenAI and an unnamed hyperscale customer (likely Microsoft or Alphabet). And there has been more good news since the quarter ended. CoreWeave last month announced a $14 billion deal with Meta Platforms.
As a caveat, CoreWeave has a substantial amount of debt due to its furious buildout of AI data centers, so much so that interest expense erased more than 20% of revenue in the second quarter. However, while investors should monitor the metric, borrowing money to capitalize on demand for AI infrastructure is not unreasonable, and CEO Michael Intrator says the company only takes on debt when a signed contract covers the costs.
Wall Street expects CoreWeave's revenue to increase at 90% annually through 2027. That makes the current valuation of 15 times sales look reasonable. Additionally, Nvidia evidently has a great deal of confidence in CoreWeave because 91% of its portfolio is invested in the company. The stock has been volatile since its March IPO, but patient investors comfortable with price swings should consider buying a small position today."

What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat?
Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them.
I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility.
On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this.
I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value.
What do you make of that, Dan?
These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future.
They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future.
The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future.
And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out.
The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold.
So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend.
But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."

A top Wall Street analyst has sounded an alarm over the U.S. equity bull market, warning that its remarkable run is built on a precariously narrow foundation: a surge in spending on, and optimistic assumptions about, infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). This spending has fueled a boom in the shares of most of the so-called Magnificent 7 and a few dozen related businesses, which have now come to account for roughly 75% of the S&P 500’s returns since the rally of the last few years began.
The commentary on September 29 by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer, Lisa Shalett, frames the current market boom as a “one-note narrative” almost entirely dependent on massive capital expenditures in generative AI, raising questions about its durability as economic and competitive risks start to mount. Shalett’s critique came squarely in the middle of some people in the AI field — and many financial commentators around Wall Street —fretting at market exuberance and beginning to talk openly about a bubble.
In an interview with Fortune, Shalett said she was “very concerned” about this theme in markets, saying her office had broadened from a belief that the market would only bid up seven or 10 stocks to roughly 40. “At the end of the day … this is not going to be pretty” if and when the generative AI capital expenditure story falters, she said.
Shalett said she’s worried about a “Cisco moment” like when the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, referring to the company that was briefly the most valuable company in the world before an 80% stock plunge. When asked how close we are to such a moment, Shalett said probably not in the next nine months, but very possibly in the next 24. When you look at the actual spending and the amount of capital coming into the space, “we’re a lot closer to the seventh inning than the first or second inning,” she said.
‘Starting to do what all ultimate bad actors do’
Shalett’s comments centered on several recent multibillion-dollar deals to scale up data-center infrastructure. As notable substacker and former Atlantic writer Derek Thompson recently noted in a post titled “This is how the AI bubble will pop,” so much money is being spent to support AI’s energy-consumption needs that it’s the equivalent of a new Apollo space mission every 10 months. (Tech companies are spending roughly $400 billion this year alone on data-center infrastructure, while the Apollo program allocated about $300 billion in today’s dollars to get to the moon from the 1960s to the ’70s.)"
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-07T21:00:01,"AlphaSense acquires Y Combinator-backed Carousel, an AI assistant for Excel","AlphaSense CEO Jack Kokko told Business Insider that the acquisition follows four straight quarters of ""hypergrowth"" fueled by AI.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8435ca4e361f4f8378a2445873765a6d3b670927fb431b9766858835e6246586,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.businessinsider.com/alphasense-acquires-carousel-ai-tool-for-excel-2025-10,https://www.businessinsider.com/alphasense-acquires-carousel-ai-tool-for-excel-2025-10,https://www.businessinsider.com/alphasense-acquires-carousel-ai-tool-for-excel-2025-10,businessinsider.com,200,,"- Fintech company AlphaSense has acquired Carousel, an AI assistant for building financial models in Excel.
- AlphaSense CEO Jack Kokko told BI that ""AI isn't replacing analysts, it's giving them superpowers.""
- AlphaSense says it just hit $500 million in annual revenue and has 6,500 corporate clients.
As Silicon Valley chases the next frontier in technology, one classic tool still reigns supreme: Microsoft Excel.
That's why business intelligence platform AlphaSense is acquiring Carousel, the New York-based startup behind an AI assistant that generates financial spreadsheets and builds models in Excel.
AlphaSense declined to disclose specific financial details about the deal, but AlphaSense CEO Jack Kokko told Business Insider in an interview that the company just crossed $500 million in annual recurring revenue and now has 6,500 corporate clients. AlphaSense launched in 2011 and is valued at $4 billion, according to PitchBook.
Kokko said the Carousel's entire team will be integrated with AlphaSense, and they'll be focused on developing AI-powered spreadsheet generation tools.
Carousel, which was part of Y Combinator's Winter 2024 batch, was founded by Daniel Wolf and Jude Rizzo in 2023.
""Carousel eliminates the most tedious parts of an analyst's workflow — extracting data from PDFs and presentations, formatting models, building formulas, and explaining complex logic,"" AlphaSense said in an announcement of the acquisition.
AI gives analysts 'superpowers'
Kokko said that the company has seen ""hypergrowth"" over the last four quarters due to the tailwinds of generative AI.
The Carousel deal follows the company's acquisition of Tegus, a provider of research, financial data, and workflow tools, for $930 million in 2024. That acquisition shifted AlphaSense's client base more toward financial services firms, Kokko said. So, the company saw opportunity in automating more aspects of these firms' work —especially modeling.
Right now, a typical AlphaSense user might leverage the platform to pull anywhere from dozens to thousands of data points from original documents to manually build a model. The company says the integration of Carousel will allow those same users to automate many of those steps through a conversational interface.
Kokko said the integration of Carousel is more likely to impact the work of its clients' entry-level workers.
""At least in the early stages, this technology will mostly be used by junior and midlevel employees — the ones actually doing the modeling today,"" he said. ""AI isn't replacing analysts — it's giving them superpowers.""
Generative AI, Kokko said, is quickly changing the way work gets done in the financial services industry — much like the way Excel rapidly expanded the number of analysts in the industry.
""It didn't replace analysts — it created an explosion in the number of analysts, "" he said about Excel. ""This will do the same, letting people model more scenarios in less time."""
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-07T20:53:37,Dizzying deal delirium: How the AI bubble bursts,"At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs. They've seen this before.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e613417d304110a22bb67dc3cc13cb7d8b65789ffa7ea5caf61a0425fd4e67aa,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dizzying-deal-delirium-ai-bubble-205337503.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dizzying-deal-delirium-ai-bubble-205337503.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dizzying-deal-delirium-ai-bubble-205337503.html,yahoo.com,200,,"So let’s get this straight: OpenAI is now taking a 10% stake in AMD, while Nvidia is investing $100 billion in OpenAI; and OpenAI also counts Microsoft as one of its major shareholders, but Microsoft is also a major customer of AI cloud computing company CoreWeave, which is another company in which Nvidia holds a significant equity stake; and by the way, Microsoft accounted for almost 20% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis, as of Nvidia’s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a parlor game to a pillar of the global economy.
You cannot help but ask, “Is this like the Wild West, where anything goes to get the deal done?” One company grants a chip supplier equity for financing data-center buildouts but takes an ownership stake in another manufacturer for the eventual development of a similar product. It is hard to imagine that Jensen Huang outsmarted his equally talented cousin, the AMD CEO, Lisa Su. The lines between revenue and equity are blurring among a small group of highly influential technology companies, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.
Su has defended AMD’s deal with OpenAI, asserting that market bears are “thinking too small.” The chief executive describes AI’s potential as sparking a new decade-long “Supercycle” that will “transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research.”
We have seen this story before, back during the “cable cowboy” days. Programmers paid the distributors. Or wait—distributors paid the programmers.
And of course, there are the frequent comparisons to the run-up to the dot-com bubble. When a dramatic technological change occurs, people are often unsure exactly what to do, but they frequently act as if they do confidently know the best path forward.
Major players in the industry have begun to call out the AI euphoria. Just last Friday alone, three of them spoke out, hedging hard on what’s to come. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he expects there to be “a lot of capital that was deployed that [doesn’t] deliver returns.” Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos called the current environment “kind of an industrial bubble.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, warned that “people will overinvest and lose money” during this phase of the AI boom.
Pockets of concern
At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs, including seasoned venture capitalists, renowned technology founders, and global partners from leading consulting firms.
While the commercial outlook for AI among business leaders was enthusiastic, there were significant pockets of concern, extending beyond safety fears, to question the frenzied paths of investment. Sure, 60% of CEOs polled didn’t believe that AI hype had led to overinvestment; however, the other 40% raised significant concerns about the direction of AI exuberance, believing a correction to be imminent."

Here's the topic. I can't think of two better guys to talk about this with. I want to get your take on the AI spending boom.
Cuz we do hear skeptics coming out. And these are not guys you can just dismiss. These are some very well-known, well-respected investors.
And you're hearing them talk about maybe an AI bubble.
They'll say, I'm hearing echoes of 1999. It's kind of some spooky stuff.
I'll start with you, Daniel Newman. You hear this talk, what do you make of it?
Yeah, I I think it's a lot of hot air in that in that balloon. I I do think that there are little bubbles within the overall AI trade. Companies that have zero revenue that are getting 10 and 20 billion dollar valuations. You see it with some of the quantum names. You see it with some of the energy names that are just running really fast.
But you look at the operating leverage and the strength of the largest, the Mag 7s, the Broadcoms, TSMCs, ASML, these are sturdy companies with incredible balance sheets that are making very intelligent bets on what the next 5 to 10 years
are going to look like. And by the way, one thing on 1999, when in 99, the earnings were not even close to keeping up in terms of the companies and the prices of these stocks.
It's not the same case. If you actually look at the line of how the earnings are matching with the revenue growth and the price appreciation, it is right in line. So, I think a lot of people want it to be a bubble. I call it the this is just the most hated rally of all time. But I actually think there is a really bright future and that AI is is really only in its beginnings, Josh.
So Patrick, let me I'm going to ask you the same question, but maybe I'll just frame it a little differently.
How confident are you that on the other side of what's literally going to be trillions spent here, that investors are going to see on the other side of that, they're going to see, okay, we're going to see material, meaningful revenue generation.
Yeah, so I was working at a .com during the .com boom and the .com crash.
Uh but I do want to buttress it on one end and just say, I'm confident for the next, let's say two years, as long as the hyperscalers can be funding their CAPEX with cash
before they have to be diving into debt or doing some equity financing. I feel really good about that. But to answer the the question, I feel a lot more confident than I did during .com. There were so many different bad business models that were out there. Literally, if you have access to a browser, you can get the benefit of AI. We have connectors now, we have APIs, we have ecosystems that quite frankly, uh didn't didn't exist. Am I going to Babe Ruth this? Absolutely not. We should be asking these questions, and what we should be looking at are milestones of that downstream."

These agents can also securely access workforce information, from employee details to payroll insights, within that same flow of work.
“By harnessing the full power of the Microsoft technology stack, Dayforce is redefining how organizations unlock value from their technology investments – freeing employees to focus on the work they’re truly meant to do,” said Joe Korngiebel, Chief Strategy, Product, and Technology Officer at Dayforce, Inc. “Together with Microsoft, we’re delivering a smarter, more seamless experience that improves the daily flow of work, empowers leaders to automate with confidence, and connects people and data in ways that drive meaningful impact.”
Powered by Microsoft, the differentiated Dayforce platform extends from the data foundation to AI agents, helping organizations maximize the value out of their technology investments by enabling leaders to:
-
Extend and customize with AI agents – build and deploy agents using Dayforce APIs and Microsoft Copilot Studio to streamline work, simplify decisions, and boost productivity.
-
Integrate and interoperate securely – connect with third-party applications, adopt the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and ensure seamless interoperability across systems.
-
Unify cross-domain workflows – bring HR, payroll, IT, and operations into one flow of work. For example, IT managers can create agents that answer policy questions or surface workforce and payroll insights directly in Microsoft tools."

OpenAI, backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), just gave ChatGPT a major upgrade. At its DevDay 2025 event in San Francisco, CEO Sam Altman announced the new Apps SDK, which lets users access third-party apps right inside ChatGPT no switching tabs required.
Figma (FIG) was one of the first apps showcased, and its stock jumped 10% by the end of the keynote. Other early integrations include Canva, Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG)(Z), and Coursera (NYSE:COUR), with more like DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG) coming soon. DoorDash rose nearly 4% after the event, while Expedia and Coursera also ticked higher. Altman called the SDK an exciting new chapter for developers.
OpenAI also launched AgentKit, a toolkit to help anyone quickly build and deploy custom AI agents. In a live demo, engineer Christina Huang built one in under eight minutes. Meanwhile, OpenAI's Codex SDK moved out of research mode and is now fully available, complete with integration into Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) Slack.
The day wrapped with even bigger news the debut of GPT-5 Pro, the Sora 2 video model, and a new multibillion-dollar partnership with AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Altman summed it up simply: Software that used to take months to build can now be built in minutes."

Hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, founder and CIO of Tudor Investment Corporation, has raised alarms about the state of financial markets in 2025, drawing pointed comparisons to the explosive tech-driven boom of 1999, while clarifying that today’s environment could be “so much more potentially explosive.” The reason why has to do with what the market veteran knows about how bull markets always play out.
Speaking to Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times’ DealBook on CNBC’s Squawk Box ahead of the upcoming Robin Hood Foundation investor conference, Jones described today’s investment climate as uncannily similar to the one that preceded the 2000 dotcom bust.
“It feels exactly like 1999,” he said, implying that the market was acting like the famous Prince song with the lyrics, “Party like it’s 1999.” He urged investors to position themselves like it’s October 1999, when the Nasdaq doubled in a matter of months before collapsing, a pattern Jones sees as increasingly plausible today. The difference is that this could be even worse than the dotcom bust, he said.
Jones told Sorkin his concerns had to do with investor behavior in every bull market, specifically at the end, when the cliff is nearing and nobody is sure where it is.
The stampede
Jones underscored that in every bull market, the “greatest price appreciation is always the 12 months preceding the top,” like what happened after October 1999. For investors, he said, the challenge is timing: “If you don’t play it, you’re missing out on the juice. If you do play it, you…have to have really happy feet because there will be a really, really bad end to it,” he said, seeming to refer to the American football phrase for when a quarterback is antsy and tiptoeing around the pocket, rather than standing their ground.
“If anything, now is so much more potentially explosive than 1999,” Jones argued, citing the backdrop of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. He noted the Fed is set up for several rate cuts, with monetary policy taking the economy to a real interest rate of zero, meaning incentives to invest and spend given such a low cost of capital. In terms of fiscal policy, the Congress had a budget surplus in 1999 and today it has a 6% budget deficit. “That fiscal/monetary combination is a brew that we haven’t seen since, I guess, the postwar period, early ’50s, something like that,” he said. “And that was crazy times, right? Coming out of the war.”
Still, Jones insisted he wasn’t calling a bubble or predicting a crash."

Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition: Jeff Bezos calls AI a ‘bubble’ of a kind…Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows an alarming self-awareness…Microsoft demonstrates an AI-powered bioterrorism “zero day”…and is the U.S. economy now just “one big bet on AI”?
I want to tie together two big pieces of news from yesterday that, at first, might not seem related, other than that they both involve OpenAI.
The first was the announcement of a major new strategic partnership between OpenAI and chipmaker AMD. The deal will see AMD provide its M4150 graphic processing units (GPUs) to OpenAI’s data centers beginning in the second half of 2026. OpenAI will use these chips primarily for inference—that is, running its AI products such as ChatGPT, Sora, and its API, rather than for training new models.
Eventually, OpenAI has committed to purchasing six gigawatts worth of AMD chips, and AMD has granted OpenAI warrants that could, if certain conditions are met, give OpenAI rights to up to 10% of AMD’s shares. AMD’s stock initially jumped by more than a third on the news, before eventually closing up about 26% for the day. My colleague Sharon Goldman had more on the deal here.
The second news item yesterday was OpenAI’s announcement of a new apps feature in ChatGPT. This essentially allows ChatGPT to easily call on other services, such as Spotify for music, or Expedia for travel inquiries, and deliver responses from those apps directly into the chat.
At first, this might seem like OpenAI taking aim at the market for existing digital assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and the Google Assistant. All of these assistants already interact with third-party apps—Amazon called these interactions “skills”—to perform functions from the voice-based assistant. ChatGPT has already won over a lot of users—its 800 million active weekly users tops the 600 million “Alexa-enabled” devices that Amazon claims to have. And this move could be seen as a way to prevent the upgraded, LLM-powered versions of these other digital assistants from stealing back any market share.
But I think something else, something far more profound, is actually afoot. OpenAI wants ChatGPT to become nothing less than the new, universal interface to our digital lives. And while the idea of “ambient intelligence” (always-on AI that we can summon at any time, by voice or the touch of a button) has been around for a while, Siri and Alexa never lived up to that vision. They simply weren’t capable enough."

- Enterprise software sales through hyperscaler cloud marketplaces are set to increase more than five times, from $30 billion in 2024 to $163 billion by 2030, according to research from Omdia published Monday. The exponential sales growth reflects enterprise adoption of marketplace procurement, as well as increased agentic AI sales.
- Enterprise customers are engaging in more strategic marketplace procurement and cloud commitment negotiations that incorporate a broader group of vendor products into their cloud strategies, Omdia researchers found. Increased multiyear cloud commitments are driving enterprise software sales. Omdia estimates close to $470 billion in upfront cloud commitments exist across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.
- “Hyperscaler marketplaces continue to see rapid momentum as a route to market for vendors across the technology industry,” Alastair Edwards, chief analyst at Omdia, said in a news release accompanying the research.
Dive Insight:
Enterprises turn to hyperscaler marketplaces in a bid to expand their access to services and products as agentic AI drives further cloud investments.
Three main technology categories will make up nearly two-thirds of total spending through hyperscaler marketplaces, Omdia found:
- Infrastructure software: $10.5 billion
- DevOps: $9.1 billion
- Business applications: $9.1 billion
AI will also drive marketplace spending. Growth of multiagent protocols will push AI marketplace spend to nearly $25 billion, at a 37% compound annual growth rate, Omdia reported.
Microsoft, Google and AWS are all investing billions in cloud and AI buildouts to support enterprise customers. Simultaneously, as enterprises’ cloud maturity advances, agentic AI will create more opportunities for businesses, according to Omdia.
“The hyperscalers are competing hard to win the race as a channel for agentic AI through their agent marketplaces, because this accounts for an ever-greater proportion of cloud consumption,” Edwards noted in the release.
Enterprise channel partners are also adapting to hyperscaler marketplaces, often with support from the major providers themselves. Omdia predicts that by 2030, channel partners will facilitate nearly 60% of all marketplace transactions. Channel partners will serve a distinct role in helping enterprise customers purchase across different cloud marketplaces.

Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) continues to cement its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, ranking fifth among U.S. corporate treasuries with approximately $80 billion in digital assets, according to company data and recent regulatory filings.
A chart published by the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla.
Bitcoin Holdings and Valuation
According to the company’s latest Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion.
The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC.
The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date.
The appreciation reflects Bitcoin’s sustained rally through Q3 2025. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense, noting the accounting implications of its Bitcoin-centric balance sheet.
ATM and Preferred Stock Programs
The filing further detailed updates to Strategy’s extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which collectively represent about $63.9 billion in potential capital issuance. These include:
• $2.1 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF)
• $4.2 billion in Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC)
• $21 billion in 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK)
• $4.2 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD)
• $21 billion in Class A common stock (MSTR)
The company reported no new share issuances during the period, noting that any proceeds from potential future sales would be presented net of commissions.
Financial Position and Oversight
As of the end of Q3 2025, Strategy’s digital-asset carrying value remained $73.21 billion, with a corresponding deferred-tax liability of $7.43 billion. The figures reaffirm Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as its core corporate reserve asset.
The financial disclosures were internally prepared and reviewed by KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. With Bitcoin’s market value continuing to climb, Strategy’s holdings now place it firmly among the top five U.S. corporations by total treasury size — a rare achievement for a firm whose reserves consist primarily of digital assets.

NBIS is scaling aggressively to capture the surging demand for AI compute, positioning itself as a fast-emerging player in the global AI infrastructure market. The company recently reported more than doubling its revenues from the first quarter and becoming EBITDA positive in its core AI infrastructure business ahead of projections. Nebius’ rapid expansion of data centers is key to its growth story.
By the end of this year, the company expects to secure 220 megawatts of connected power, either active or ready for GPU deployment. This expansion includes major data centers in New Jersey and Finland. Two additional greenfield data center projects in the US are nearing completion, signaling the company’s commitment to scale aggressively and meet the surge in AI compute demand. Overall, Nebius is on track to secure more than 1 gigawatt of power by the end of 2026.
Also, Nebius announced plans to launch its first major GPU cluster facility in the UK, located just outside London. The site is expected to come online in the early fourth quarter, marking a significant milestone in the company’s global expansion. Nebius anticipates being the first provider to deliver Nvidia’s B300 GPUs to the U.K. market.
Moreover, the company recently closed a deal with Microsoft Corporation MSFT for $17.4 billion, which involves NBIS providing dedicated GPU capacity to the latter from the new data center in Vineland, NJ, beginning later this year through 2031.
The company is focusing on building a global footprint, with capacity in the United States, Europe and the Middle East. In June, Nebius launched NVIDIA GB200 capacity in Europe and deployed Blackwell Ultra GPUs in the UK. In the first quarter of 2025, the company added three new regions, including a strategic data center in Israel.
With Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and data center capacity ramping up significantly, it expects a sharp increase in sales by year-end. Driven by these factors, Nebius has updated its year-end annualized run rate (ARR) guidance from the previous $700 million–$1 billion range to a new $900 million–$1.1 billion range.
However, scaling aggressively (multiple data centers in various regions) involves execution risk. Moreover, stiff competition and broader macroeconomic uncertainties could pose challenges to NBIS’ growth trajectory. Nebius competes with technology giants like Microsoft and CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV.
Taking a Look at NBIS’ Competitors
Microsoft remains a dominant force in technology, leading cloud infrastructure through Azure while rapidly expanding in AI infrastructure. Its deep partnership with OpenAI has established Azure as a leading platform for AI workloads, reinforced by AI integration across Office, GitHub and Dynamics. The company has transformed every Azure region into an AI-first environment equipped with liquid cooling technology, adding more than 2 gigawatts (GW) of new data center capacity over the past year and operating more than 400 data centers across 70 regions worldwide. Microsoft projects Azure growth of 37% for fiscal first-quarter 2026."

AI stumbled at the start of fiscal 2026, with the first quarter’s revenues declining year over year by 19%, reflecting softer demand for demonstration licenses and disruption caused by organizational changes and leadership transitions. However, this setback did not discourage the company; but rather boosted its confidence in moving forward on capitalizing on the opportunities set for an Artificial Intelligence software provider like itself.
C3.ai is not only enhancing its product offerings by sidestepping the current market trends, but also opting for opportunities through other effective strategies, like collaborations or partnerships. During the first quarter of 2026, the company’s business accounted for 90% of its revenues through alliances with heavyweights such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and McKinsey QuantumBlack. These collaborations not only amplify C3.ai’s go-to-market reach but also embed its Agentic AI platform more deeply into the enterprise fabric, supporting use cases ranging from defense logistics to manufacturing optimization.
The company highlighted some advancements in its partnerships during the first quarter of fiscal 2026. These include Nucor's commitment expansion into a multi-year partnership to build an enterprise-wide AI program across its facilities, wherein C3.ai will support and optimize everyday planning, inventory and scheduling decisions. Besides, a global leader in chemicals, Qemetica, debuted its enterprise-scale AI program with C3.ai. Additionally, America’s top military shipbuilder, HII, is also extending its partnership with C3.ai to accelerate throughput at Ingalls and Newport News, with the goal of strengthening U.S. Navy fleet readiness.
To sum up, C3.ai’s technological edge and alliances place it well within the global AI ecosystem, but partnerships alone cannot compensate for weak execution. To regain its stride, the company must translate its high-profile collaborations into consistent and scalable performance, which will then determine whether its platform can truly power the next wave of enterprise AI adoption.
C3.ai vs. Other Market Players
Firms like Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR and Snowflake Inc. SNOW offer substantial competition to C3.ai across the enterprise AI or AI-solutions market.
Palantir leverages its strong government and commercial partnerships to expand its Foundry and Gotham platforms, emphasizing integrated data analytics and operational decision-making. Snowflake, on the other hand, continues to scale its Data Cloud ecosystem, embedding AI and machine learning tools to make data insights more accessible and automated.
Compared with Palantir and Snowflake, C3.ai’s model is more vertically specialized, aiming to accelerate digital transformation through pre-built AI solutions. However, Palantir’s established contracts and Snowflake’s broad enterprise adoption give them scale advantages. Thus, as the market consolidates around data-driven AI integration, C3.ai must strengthen its ecosystem and monetization pace to sustain competitive momentum against Palantir and Snowflake."

The update was announced recently at Fal.Con 2025 and adds phishing-resistant MFA, improved privileged access management, and identity-driven case management.
The new FalconID tool provides passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA using FIDO2 standards. Delivered through the Falcon mobile app, it uses real-time endpoint and identity signals to stop attackers from bypassing traditional MFA. This could appeal to enterprises that want stronger defenses against credential-based breaches.
CrowdStrike also expanded Falcon Privileged Access, making it easier to handle complex Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID setups. The tool is focused on automating access grants and revocations through Microsoft Teams and Falcon Fusion SOAR. This is aimed at reducing standing privileges while also lowering risk.
Another addition includes identity-driven case management, which aims to link related detections into a single case inside Falcon’s Next-Generation SIEM. The feature combines endpoint, cloud, and SaaS telemetry, giving security teams full context to investigate and respond faster.
Identity security is one of CrowdStrike’s fastest-growing areas. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, CrowdStrike’s identity business reached $435 million in ARR, up 21% year over year. With these newer updates, CrowdStrike is aiming to pull customers away from legacy IAM and PAM tools to drive higher adoption of its platform. If this strategy becomes successful, Identity Security could help CrowdStrike to move closer to its long-term target of $10 billion in ARR by fiscal 2031.
How Competitors Fare Against CRWD
CyberArk (CYBR) and Okta Inc. (OKTA) are key players competing with CrowdStrike in identity security.
CyberArk is an established leader in identity security and privileged access management. CyberArk is rapidly enhancing the capabilities of its identity security platform with AI integration. CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution and CORA AI are the two most important recent additions to its portfolio, enabling it to secure a full spectrum of identities, including human, AI and machine.
Okta is best known for its identity and access management solutions. Okta has been adding AI-driven tools that automate risk detection and reduce manual processes in managing user access. Enterprises can implement Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI to leverage AI and machine learning techniques for real-time detection of the entire spectrum of Identity attacks."

(CRWV) has signed an agreement to acquire Monolith AI Limited, known for applying AI and machine learning to solve complex physics and engineering problems. This move not only creates buyout synergies for CRWV but also for users, as it aims to develop a comprehensive AI platform that helps enterprises significantly reduce R&D cycles, speed up product design, and reach new levels of efficiency and innovation.
By integrating Monolith’s simulation and test-based machine learning with CoreWeave’s specialized AI cloud, the combined organization is positioned to offer a comprehensive AI platform tailored for industrial and manufacturing firms. It aims to foster a seamless AI-enabled environment where engineers can utilize advanced AI tools directly within their workflows. The synergy of Monolith’s software strengths and CRWV’s infrastructure enables enterprises to speed up innovation and shorten time-to-market, which is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge.
For CRWV, the acquisition builds on its previous strategic moves, including the acquisition of OpenPipe (focused on reinforcement learning) and Weights & Biases, a leading platform for model iteration and experiment tracking. Additionally, acquiring Core Scientific Inc. is likely to expand CRWV’s infrastructure footprint and lower lease obligations, boosting operational efficiency and financial flexibility.
Furthermore, Monolithic positions CoreWeave to expand its AI capabilities into mainstream automotive design and manufacturing, enabling faster, smarter, and more efficient vehicle development. Other industrial sectors, such as Aerospace, are also expected to leverage the combined platform to accelerate R&D and innovation. However, frequent acquisitions increase integration risks. It already has a debt-heavy balance sheet and has raised $25 billion in debt and equity since 2024 to support capacity expansion amid surging demand for AI computing. While the capital raise allows CRWV to accelerate data center investments and meet growing AI demand, it also adds financial pressure.
Who’s Threatening CRWV’s Market Share in the AI Infra Space
CoreWeave’s fierce competitor, Nebius Group N.V. (NBIS), is dedicated to building a focused AI infrastructure business. It is quickly expanding in the AI infrastructure sector, aiming to reach 1 GW capacity by 2026. The company signed a five-year agreement with Microsoft to supply GPU capacity, valued at $17.4 billion through 2031, with the potential to increase to $19.4 billion if Microsoft boosts its demand. Unlike CoreWeave, it has grown organically, developing AI ventures such as Toloka (data labeling), TripleTen (tech education), and Avride (autonomous driving). Nebius raised its guidance for annualized run rate (ARR) revenues from the previous range of $750 million to $1 billion to the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion."

Brittany from Indiana called into “The Ramsey Show” with what sounded like a dream scenario. She and her husband had paid off their home in 2023, wiped out all debt, and were following Dave Ramsey's “Baby Steps” exactly as he teaches. But when Brittany spoke, she admitted they weren't feeling the payoff they expected.
Contentment Can Feel Like A Moving Target
“We don't feel the sense of freedom, I guess, that we kind of expected or wanted,” Brittany told Ramsey and co-host John Delony. “We're currently saving for a big home renovation. Our house was built in the 70s and a lot of the original exterior components are in need of being replaced.” In other words, they're trying to balance enjoying freedom with staying intense so that they can get the renovations done and then really feel free.

Ramsey responded with a dose of perspective. “It is devastating that no matter what stage of money you get at, you find out it's finite,” he said. “Contentment is kind of a bully in the schoolyard. It says, ‘Step across this line and I'll punch you.’ You step across the line, it backs up and draws another line. It’s a moving target.”
He explained that Brittany's feelings are common, even for people who become millionaires. “Intellectually, you didn't think it was going to be unlimited, but emotionally you felt like you were going to feel like you were unlimited.”
Delony added that it’s like thinking you’re a millionaire, so you don't have to budget anymore.

Freedom Is About Choices, Not Just Money
Delony pushed Brittany to reframe how she looked at her situation. “Here's my promise to you. The day these renovations are over, if you and your husband don't get together ASAP and change how you experience the world, you're going to find yourself in yet another self-created prison,” he said. “You are choosing to live in an old house, which means you are choosing to update this stuff. Some stuff has to be done, some stuff doesn't. These are all choices. You're not owned by it.”"

Today's Featured Research Reports
Microsoft's shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+24.5% vs. +20.7%). The company capitalizes on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion. Recently, MSFT introduced its first proprietary AI models, MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-1-preview.
Microsoft projects Azure growth of 37% for fiscal first-quarter 2026. Strong Office 365 Commercial demand has been propeling Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth. ARPU is increasing through E5 and M365 Copilot uptake across key segments. Strategic execution through expanding scale and enterprise customer growth is driving non-AI services.
Xbox revenues are benefiting from strength across third-party and first-party content offerings. The Zacks analyst expects fiscal 2026 net sales to grow 12.9% from fiscal 2025. However, elevated operating expenses and Azure investments amid intensifying cloud competition remain headwinds.
(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)
Shares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+20.8% vs. +19.5%). The company's top-line is driven by steady momentum in Prime and AWS. Strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate is contributing well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio are beneficial.
Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive. Robust advertising business is also contributing well. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on GenAI is a major plus. The Zacks analyst expects 2025 net sales to grow 10.6% from 2024.
However, weak third-quarter operating income guidance of $15.5-20.5 billion and concerns about margin pressure from heavy AI investments totaling $100+ billion in capital expenditure plans are overhangs. Elevated operating expenses amid intensifying cloud competition remain headwinds.
(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)
Johnson & Johnson's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+34.1% vs. +10.7%). The company's Innovative Medicine unit is showing a growth trend, driven by existing products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli.
Though in the MedTech segment, sales are being hurt due to headwinds in China and competitive pressure in some categories, the Cardiovascular segment is contributing to growth. J&J expects sales growth in both segments to be higher in the second half than in the first. J&J is making rapid pipeline progress and has been on an acquisition spree lately.
However, the Stelara patent cliff and the impact of Part D redesign are significant headwinds in 2025. J&J's shares have outperformed the industry this year so far. Estimates are stable ahead of Q3 results. J&J has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.

Shares of Willis Lease Finance have declined -9.4% over the past year against the Zacks Transportation - Equipment and Leasing industry's decline of -12.7%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $930.95 million delivered strong Q2 2025 results, with net income up 42% to $60.4 million and EPS rising to $8.43, driven by 88.3% lease utilization and asset monetization. H1 earnings of $77.2 million highlighted operational momentum and scalable margins.
Revenues grew 30.7% YTD to $353.2 million, led by higher lease rents, a surge in spare parts/equipment sales, and 13% growth in maintenance services. WLFC strengthened liquidity with $596 million ABS issuance and extended credit facilities. Shareholder value is reinforced via a 25-cent dividend and $60 million repurchase program.
However, risks include: operating costs climbed sharply, with technical and G&A expenses pressuring margins; maintenance services continue to generate thin or negative profitability; and consulting remains subscale. Shares are down 34% YTD, trading at 4.7x EV/Sales and 8.9x EV/EBITDA, discounted vs peers.

With Soracle’s selection of Archer’s Midnight aircraft for urban air mobility in Japan, we'll consider how this partnership shapes Archer Aviation’s investment narrative.
Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.
What Is Archer Aviation's Investment Narrative?
Owning Archer Aviation stock hinges on believing that electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft will become commercially viable and that Archer can secure a leading role in this market. The recent Osaka partnership with Soracle, which names Archer as the primary fleet provider for air taxi services, could be a genuine catalyst. It not only puts Archer at the forefront of early-stage deployments in a major global city but also signals Japanese regulatory and market acceptance, potentially easing a key operational risk. While Archer is still pre-revenue and burning cash, confirmed international partnerships could help justify its ambitious growth forecasts and extended path to profitability, at least in the eyes of some market participants. That said, the jump in Archer’s share price following the announcement suggests the market is factoring in more immediate progress toward commercialization, which may shift short-term expectations. However, big risks remain, including ongoing high losses, cash burn, and the need for further regulatory approvals. On the other hand, ongoing unprofitability and cash needs remain critical to watch.
Archer Aviation's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. Find out how large the opportunity might be.
Exploring Other Perspectives
With 47 individual fair value calls from the Simply Wall St Community ranging from just over US$2.99 to nearly US$30, opinion on Archer’s worth is far from settled. This broad spread comes as some see new international partnerships as a signal for runway growth, while others question the timeline to meaningful revenue.

(INOD) is expanding its delivery capabilities to strengthen operational efficiency and maintain a competitive edge in the fast-evolving AI services market. The company continues to focus on building a stronger delivery framework that supports rising project volume and new customer engagements across major technology clients. By scaling its global operations and enhancing technical delivery, the company aims to manage increasing demand for complex data and AI integration projects.
A stronger delivery network remains central to the company’s long-term growth strategy. The expansion is designed to improve execution speed, service quality and project scalability, which are key factors in maintaining strong client relationships. With growing interest in generative and enterprise AI, delivery capacity plays an important role in enabling faster response times and handling larger, more specialized contracts.
In the second quarter of 2025, the company directed about $1.4 million toward growth-focused initiatives, including new hires across delivery, product innovation and go-to-market functions. These investments reflect a broader plan to enhance delivery efficiency and strengthen operational capabilities. Looking ahead, the company expects such growth investments to increase in the second half of the year, with approximately $1.5 million planned for the third quarter to further support delivery expansion and ongoing projects.
By aligning delivery investments with rising demand, the company is reinforcing its ability to deliver consistent performance in a competitive market. These efforts not only strengthen execution but also position Innodata to capture new opportunities as AI adoption accelerates globally, supporting long-term scalability and operational resilience.
Rivals Push Boundaries in AI Services
Innodata operates in a rapidly expanding AI services market where established technology leaders are also advancing their capabilities. Two notable competitors shaping this landscape are Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR).
Microsoft has been expanding its Azure OpenAI Service and Copilot ecosystem, offering enterprise-scale generative AI solutions. The company is also progressing toward agentic AI by embedding reasoning, planning and autonomy into workflows. Microsoft’s global infrastructure, extensive customer base and significant financial resources provide a scale advantage that is difficult for smaller firms to match.
Palantir, on the other hand, is focusing on its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which integrates data management with autonomous decision-making. This positions Palantir strongly in high-stakes areas such as government and large-scale enterprise contracts. The company’s emphasis on agentic AI further strengthens its competitive stance."

Under the partnership, CRWV will supply META with cloud computing capacity. Depending on certain conditions, Meta will initially pay up to $14.2 billion through Dec. 14, 2031, with an option to expand significantly through 2032 for more cloud capacity. This deal indicates increasing confidence in emerging AI infrastructure providers like CoreWeave, beyond established players such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s MSFT Azure.
The META deal comes after the recent OpenAI contract expansion. The new contract, worth $6.5 billion, involves CRWV supplying capacity for OpenAI training of its next-generation models. The total value of OpenAI contact now stands at an impressive $22.4 billion, which includes $11.9 billion agreement in March and $4 billion expansion in May. The contracts with META and OpenAI (which is a leading AI company) not only enhance revenue visibility for CRWV but also validate its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable.
Moreover, collaboration with NVIDIA is another positive aspect. CRWV’s cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. Additionally, the company deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its “Mission Control” for enhanced reliability and performance. NVIDIA also has an agreement with CRWV to purchase residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions.
However, the road to market dominance would not be easy, given that the incumbents in this space still command vast financial resources. There is also fierce competition from upcoming players like Nebius NBIS, which CoreWeave needs to watch out for. Another challenge will be scaling efficiently without compromising profitability and margins.
Nonetheless, these various contracts mark a pivotal moment for CRWV, but maintaining this momentum will require disciplined execution, prudent capex management and continued innovation amid rising competition.
Taking a Look at Competitive Position for NBIS & MSFT
Nebius, while smaller in scale, has emerged as an intriguing challenger to CoreWeave. NBIS is also experiencing hypergrowth with revenues surging 625% year over year to $105.1 million in the second quarter of 2025. AI cloud infrastructure revenues grew more than nine times year over year, driven by demand for copper GPUs and near-peak GPU utilization. Explosive revenue growth demonstrates Nebius’ ability to capture demand in a rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. With the new Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and its data center capacity expanding significantly in parallel, the company expects a substantial increase in sales by year-end."

The agreement, which the companies announced late last week, covers four different solar developments; one is already operating and three are under construction. The deal covers output from the plants for 20 years.
Seattle-based Microsoft already operates two data centers in Japan. Microsoft’s compute capacity is slated to expand as the company invests $2.9 billion in the country over the next year.
Solar has become a favored source of power for tech companies and data center operators in recent years because it is quick and cheap to build. Solar is among the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, and projects are generally completed within 18 months. Plus, users can begin drawing power before the entire project is complete.
Microsoft has been a big buyer of solar in recent months. Since the year began, the company has contracted more than 1 gigawatt of solar capacity."

Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) shares ticked higher Monday after the company stepped in to squash growing rumors that it was done making Xbox consoles.
Speculation had been swirling online that the Xbox Series X and S would be the last of their kind, with Microsoft supposedly shifting to a cloud-only future centered on Xbox Game Pass. But the company made it clear that's not the plan.
In a statement to Windows Central, Microsoft said, We are actively investing in our future first-party consoles and devices designed, engineered and built by Xbox. The tech giant also pointed to its ongoing partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is working on new hardware for the next generation of Xbox devices.
That reassurance was enough to nudge Microsoft's stock up about 1% for the day, adding to its nearly 25% year-to-date rally. Most of those gains have been driven by Microsoft's booming AI business, but the update gave gaming investors something to cheer about too.
The rumor made waves partly because Xbox hardware sales have been under pressure this generation. Microsoft has leaned more into cloud gaming and cross-platform releases, making several first-party titles available on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles a big shift from its traditional console strategy.
Still, Monday's response showed Microsoft isn't walking away from hardware anytime soon. With a new wave of AMD-powered devices already in the works, the Xbox brand appears to be sticking around for the long haul.
Wall Street remains confident in Microsoft's broader outlook. Analysts have a Strong Buy consensus, with an average price target of $628 about 20% higher than where the stock trades today."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-06T18:20:41,Why Shares of Nebius Group Skyrocketed 64.3% in September,The hype surrounding this hyperscaler stock continues to grow.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d4e17f149bee032876ebbff60a3e017b4e00622b911ce12e0bee75ab38b8a30a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/why-shares-of-nebius-group-skyrocketed-643-in-sept/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/why-shares-of-nebius-group-skyrocketed-643-in-sept/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/why-shares-of-nebius-group-skyrocketed-643-in-sept/,fool.com,200,,"The dog days of summer had nothing on Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%). Shares of the hyperscaler soared more than 25% in August, and the momentum continued.
With the company inking an agreement with a notable name in the tech industry -- and Wall Street providing some bullish takes on Nebius stock -- investors found sufficient cause to buy shares. According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Nebius stock rose 64.3% in September.
A multibillion-dollar agreement has a funny way of grabbing investors' attention
After jumping higher in August, Nebius stock didn't do much through the first week of September. In the second week, however, the fireworks began. On Sept. 8, Nebius announced that it will provide Microsoft with dedicated capacity to support its artificial intelligence (AI) workloads from its data center located in New Jersey starting later this year and lasting for five years. In total, the contract is valued at $17.4 billion through 2031.
Nebius also hinted that the deal with Microsoft is a harbinger of things to come. Arkady Volozh, CEO of Nebius, stated in the accompanying press release:
Nebius's core AI cloud business, serving customers from AI start-ups to enterprises, is performing exceptionally well. We have also said that, in addition to our core business, we expect to secure significant long-term committed contracts with leading AI labs and big tech companies. I'm happy to announce the first of these contracts, and I believe there are more to come.
Another catalyst for the stock's outperformance came in the form of analysts' optimistic outlooks.
- BWS Financial hiked its price target to $130 from $90, maintaining a buy rating on the stock.
- DA Davidson raised its price target to $125 from $75.
- Maintaining an outperform rating, Northland boosted its price target 158% to $206 from $77.
Is it too late to nab shares of Nebius?
For investors waiting on the sidelines for an opportunity to buy Nebius stock during a pullback, the stock refuses to slow down. As of this writing, Nebius stock is already up almost 20% in October. With the stock's tremendous performance, shares are now trading at 122 times sales. For comparison, CoreWeave, a prominent hyperscaler competitor, trades at a considerably lower valuation of 14.8 times trailing sales.
While value investors may want to skip over Nebius stock, those committed to holding on to it for several years -- at least -- may be rewarded as the company provides leading cloud computing solutions uniquely suited for AI applications. Of course, those looking to mitigate risk may also want to consider an exchange-traded fund like the Roundhill Generative AI ETF, in which Nebius has a 2.8% weighting."

On October 14, 2025, support for the operating system will officially end. While these PC devices will continue to function, they will no longer receive security updates or technical support, leaving them more vulnerable to viruses, malware, and phishing attacks.
With just days left, Microsoft is reminding consumers to upgrade to Windows 11, the most secure version of Windows yet. In addition to enhanced security, Windows 11 offers faster performance, smoother navigation, and built-in tools that make everyday tasks easier.

Here's how to prepare. Start by checking if the PC device has Windows 10 and can upgrade to Windows 11 at no extra cost. Simply go to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update, and then select Check for updates.
If the PC device isn't eligible for an upgrade, there are more options. Consider purchasing a new Windows 11 or Copilot+ PC device, which can offer faster performance, more power, and the latest productivity and creativity features. Or personal users can enroll in the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program for $30, while businesses can subscribe for $61 per device, renewable annually for up to three years. And files, photos, and personalized settings can be transferred easily using Windows Backup.
With support for Windows 10 ending on October 14, 2025, consumers should act soon to benefit from Windows 11's stronger security, faster performance, and enhanced features and shouldn't wait until the last minute, but take the steps today to ensure their PC device stays secure, protected, and ready for what's next.

finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-06T16:45:03,Microsoft (MSFT) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Microsoft (MSFT) could produce exceptional returns because of its solid growth attributes.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=957c87bdc8f930e2586621f1dc441a393c8ddc9a18675bbd7c6960fdc8a235c5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-msft-incredible-growth-stock-164503133.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-msft-incredible-growth-stock-164503133.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-msft-incredible-growth-stock-164503133.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.
By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.
However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Our proprietary system currently recommends Microsoft (MSFT) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this software maker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Microsoft is 15.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12%.
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Microsoft is 23.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.8%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 19% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.5%."

finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-06T15:56:10,Why Plug Power (PLUG) Stock Is Trading Up Today,"Shares of fuel cell technology Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) jumped 8.2% in the morning session after the stock continued its rally from the previous trading session, fueled by a significant analyst price target upgrade and positive operational updates.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a11c0ea4363fec4e50043d5f450c55ae588a534fe7be464205af423f7c7b7b93,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-plug-power-plug-stock-155610798.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-plug-power-plug-stock-155610798.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-plug-power-plug-stock-155610798.html,yahoo.com,200,,"What Happened?
Shares of fuel cell technology Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) jumped 8.2% in the morning session after the stock continued its rally from the previous trading session, fueled by a significant analyst price target upgrade and positive operational updates.
The shares built on a remarkable gain from the prior trading day, which saw the stock surge over 30%. The momentum was initially sparked after investment bank H.C. Wainwright more than doubled its price target on the company to $7 from $3, reaffirming a Buy rating. Analysts noted that rising electricity costs created a supportive environment for the green hydrogen sector.
Adding to the positive news, Plug Power reported tangible operational milestones. The company achieved record production levels at its Georgia hydrogen facility and delivered its first 10-megawatt electrolyzer system to Galp, a major energy company in Portugal. The sharp price increase also appeared to trigger a short squeeze, as traders who had bet against the stock were forced to buy shares to cover their positions, further driving up the price.
Is now the time to buy Plug Power? Access our full analysis report here.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Plug Power’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 98 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 36.1% on the news that H.C. Wainwright more than doubled its price target on the company's shares to $7 from $3 while maintaining a 'Buy' rating.
The analyst firm pointed to a few key factors for the optimistic outlook. It noted that significant increases in electricity prices over the previous few months and growing regulatory support for nuclear power created a more favorable environment. These conditions, combined with strong demand for power from data centers and industrial electrification, were expected to make green hydrogen more competitive in price. This could support wider use of Plug Power's hydrogen solutions.
Plug Power is up 73.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.04 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Plug Power’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $248.61.

According to The Verge, Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) is trying out a new version of its Xbox Cloud Gaming service that would let people play without a Game Pass subscription. This version would be sponsored by ads. Employees can stream some titles after seeing around two minutes of advertising during internal tests. Microsoft may change the constraints before the public debut, but for now, access is limited to one hour each session and five hours per month. With the free tier, users could stream games they already own, take part in ""Free Play Days"" on weekends, and access a library of old Xbox games. The tests are happening at the same time as Microsoft's recent changes to its Game Pass levels. Xbox Cloud Gaming is now part of both the Premium and Essential plans. The Ultimate plan, on the other hand, went up in price by 50%. Game Pass Ultimate users can stream in 1440p at speeds of up to 30 Mbps. Lower levels can only stream in 1080p at speeds of up to 12 Mbps. Microsoft might reach more people with the free version of Xbox and make more money from ads at a time when subscription prices are going up. It also fits with the company's larger cloud and gaming strategy, which aims to get more people involved and make money in other ways. Wall Street is still positive. Analysts agree that MSFT stock is a Strong Buy, with an average price target of $627.95, which means it might go up more than 21% from where it is now."

The AI market has grown into the billions of dollars and is forecast to reach beyond $2 trillion within the coming years. And companies offering AI tools and services, as well as those applying AI to their businesses, are set to benefit.
Nebius may be one of the first to win since it offers something that tech leaders are scrambling to get ahold of right now, and that's the capacity to run AI workloads. The company sells access to compute, and just recently it signed a multibillion-dollar deal to provide AI infrastructure to tech giant Microsoft. Revenue is already taking off at Nebius, as it surged more than 600% in the recent quarter -- and the company's shares are on track to gain more than 350% this year.
Considering all this, is Nebius your ticket to becoming a millionaire? Let's find out.
The infrastructure buildout
So, first, let's take a look at the current AI market and what may unfold in the coming years. Right now, tech powerhouses such as Microsoft, mentioned above, and others, like Alphabet and Meta Platforms, are pouring investment into building out AI infrastructure. They, and even smaller AI customers, need more and more AI compute -- the graphics processing units (GPUs) or AI chips that power AI tasks.
Nebius offers this, allowing customers to rent access to it as well as a variety of managed services to support their AI platforms. Some companies, such as Microsoft, for example, may own their own GPUs and data centers but may also turn to Nebius for additional infrastructure. Smaller players might not invest in GPUs but instead rent from Nebius as needed. This means Nebius could attract a broad range of companies during this infrastructure scale-up and beyond.
And moving forward, as AI is applied to real-world situations, compute continues to be necessary to power models as they do their job of solving problems. All of this suggests Nebius could see ongoing demand for its services as the AI story unfolds, and that should support significant revenue growth.
An increased forecast
In the latest quarter, Nebius forecasted an annualized revenue run rate for its AI business of $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of this year. That's up from an earlier estimate of $750 million to $1 billion. Nebius operates two other units, one specializing in autonomous driving technology and another focused on tech career training, but its core AI cloud business is driving growth and has even reached positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) ahead of schedule.
Of course, Nebius faces some challenges moving forward, such as funding the necessary scale-up to meet the needs of customers and potential customers. For example, Nebius recently closed a public offering of shares and a private offering of convertible senior notes, raising more than $4 billion to support such spending.
So, investing in Nebius involves some risk because the company must build up debt to grow, and at the same time, any potential slowdown in tech spending could weigh on revenue and the stock's performance. This means Nebius stock may not be the best choice for cautious investors, at least at the moment, but could be an interesting option for investors who don't mind these risks.
An opportunity for aggressive investors
Now, if you're an aggressive investor and decide to buy Nebius, could the stock be your ticket to becoming a millionaire? Let's say you invest $10,000 in the stock, and it becomes a 10-bagger -- if demand continues to soar and earnings climb, this is possible. Such an increase would bring Nebius to a $267 billion market cap, which also could happen in such a scenario. This would bring the value of your investment to $100,000, which is great, but far from $1 million.
And all this brings me to the following conclusion: It's unlikely that one stock, on its own, unless you invest a massive amount -- and that's way too risky -- will make you a millionaire. But the good news is that a promising stock like Nebius could help you along the path to millions if you add it to a portfolio that's well diversified across quality stocks and hold on for the long run."

Maximor said it raised the funding to scale its AI-driven finance automation platform. The funding round was led by Foundation Capital, with participation from Gaia Ventures and Boldcap.
Maximor's platform connects to ERPs like NetSuite and Intacct, payroll, billing, customer relationship management, software-as-a-service data, and banking systems to automate repetitive accounting work while producing audit-ready outputs.
The company said that the system helps deliver cleaner audits and faster closes, lowering compliance and valuation risk, while giving finance leaders unified visibility across financial and operational data. Its proprietary Audit-Ready Agent architecture causes its agents to generate workpapers, reviewer notes, and audit trails by default.

Finance departments face a talent crisis that will change corporate accounting within five years, according to Maximor. The startup said three-quarters of accountants are expected to retire by 2030, while fewer graduates enter the field. Companies are stretched thin, raising the odds of costly errors and audit delays.
Finance teams using Maximor report roughly 40% more capacity for strategic work, according to the company.
Proptech company Rently cut its month-end close from eight days to four within the first month of using Maximor. The company avoided two additional accounting hires for repetitive work. ""With Maximor, our team delivers reliable, audit-ready outputs efficiently while freeing up nearly 50% of our capacity for strategic work,"" Rently Chief Financial Officer Dustin Neal said in the Maximor statement."

“Amazon. I think AWS will reacelerate this quarter.”
Photo by Austin Distel on Unsplash Amazon offers an opportunity to bet on the lucrative AI and Cloud market as well as the behemoth e-commerce market. Amazon is expected to grow revenues by around 10% annually over the next four years, while EPS is projected to rise more than 18% over the next five years. However, there are concerns about AWS growth and rising competition from Oracle and Microsoft, which resulted in the stock's weak performance over the past few months.
Mairs & Power Balanced Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“The Fund also started a new position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the second quarter, where the company is well positioned to continue capturing market share in retail while also growing its market leading cloud business. The Fund took advantage of weakness in the stock during April to start the position as tariff news and a precipitous market decline provided an opportunity to build a position.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-05T11:15:00,Nvidia vs. Microsoft: Which Stock Is the Better Buy After Their OpenAI Investments?,Both companies should continue to benefit from their OpenAI investments.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6b6f557d9a4e19ae017e6317923ff5ae0044e23e741a992b01520ff8d3ec5c96,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/nvidia-vs-microsoft-which-stock-is-the-better-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/nvidia-vs-microsoft-which-stock-is-the-better-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/nvidia-vs-microsoft-which-stock-is-the-better-buy/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) both made big bets on OpenAI, but they are coming at the opportunity from very different directions. Nvidia's move is about keeping its chips at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout and expanding into the software side, while Microsoft's early investment let it weave OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) into its cloud computing and software businesses.
The question, though, is which stock is the better buy after their OpenAI investments.
Nvidia's big AI investment
Nvidia's plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI is not just about buying a stake in a hot AI company. It also gives one of the companies that are leading the charge in AI infrastructure buildout financing, which it will then likely funnel back to Nvidia by buying or renting its graphics processing units (GPUs). This gives Nvidia a massive, long-term, guaranteed customer for its chips.
Locking that in helps solidify Nvidia's position as the essential infrastructure provider for the AI industry. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom are fighting to break into the AI chip market, but by partnering closely with OpenAI, Nvidia helps solidify its position as the market leader. The deal also gives Nvidia financial exposure to OpenAI's software business. CEO Jensen Huang has said OpenAI could become the world's next multitrillion-dollar company.
Another underappreciated angle is that the two companies will work together at the chip, software, and systems level. That collaboration gives Nvidia a first look at the computing needs of the most advanced AI models, letting it shape future chips to match those workloads. That would give the company yet another edge.
Nvidia also has advantages that it built long before it invested in OpenAI. Its CUDA software platform, launched in 2006, locked in most AI developers since so much of the foundational code was written for it. Its NVLink interconnect, meanwhile, lets its GPUs operate as one giant unit. With OpenAI expected to lead the charge in AI data-center spending in the coming years, Nvidia looks as well positioned as any company to be a big winner.
Microsoft's early and smart AI play
Microsoft's investment in OpenAI was smaller in dollar terms, but it was transformational. It got in early when OpenAI's ChatGPT was starting to go mainstream, and that early move gave it preferred access to its models. That alone was a game-changer because it was able to become the growth driver behind its cloud computing unit, Azure.
The partnership helped create the Azure OpenAI Service, which lets Microsoft's enterprise customers tap into OpenAI's most advanced models using its infrastructure. That initial exclusive access to OpenAI's models drew in customers looking to use them to power their AI workloads. Azure growth has been skyrocketing, including last quarter when it soared 39% despite running into capacity constraints.
Microsoft also integrated OpenAI's technology directly into its software, using its models to create its Copilot AI assistants. Its Copilot can do many things, from simply summarizing a document to allowing someone to use Python in Excel using only natural language. The bottom line, though, is that it can help workers be more productive, and at $30 per user per month, it's an affordable way for companies to help increase worker efficiency, while also being a nice growth drive for Microsoft.
Another advantage of Microsoft's OpenAI investment is that it gives it early access to OpenAI's newest technologies, which cuts its own development risk and cost. By being first in, Microsoft secured a preferred-partner status that its competitors still don't have.
The better investment versus the better buy
Microsoft clearly made the better OpenAI investment by getting in early. Its initial investment is now worth way more than it was just a few years ago. At the same time, that relationship has been critical in helping drive the company's own growth.
Nvidia's investment is coming much later, but it locks in massive chip sales and helps cement its role as the backbone of AI infrastructure. It also gives it exposure to OpenAI's potential upside and to work together to advance the future of AI.
If you're judging by who got the better deal on OpenAI, that was Microsoft. But if you're looking at the stocks today, Nvidia looks better positioned moving forward, given the massive opportunity still ahead of it, helped by its OpenAI investment."

A $6.3 billion agreement between red-hot CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) and the company at the very heart of the AI boom, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), sent both stocks higher. So what exactly is a backstop, and what does this latest announcement mean for both CoreWeave and Nvidia?
What is a backstop?
A backstop agreement is a safety net -- a guarantee that a company will step in as a buyer of last resort if things don't go according to plan. Many of these deals have involved the guarantee of a lease. If, say, Microsoft agreed to provide a $1 billion backstop for a lease between a data center operator and a cloud provider, the data center operator will be made whole if the cloud provider fails to pay its lease (up to a maximum of $1 billion).
Much like a cosigner on a loan, these backstops from large, successful companies allow smaller companies to access significantly more credit at better rates than they could otherwise.
In CoreWeave's deal, Nvidia is obligated to pay the company up to $6.3 billion through 2032 if the cloud provider has unsold capacity. The agreement was actually signed in 2023, but was only publicly revealed in an SEC filing this month.
CoreWeave needs Nvidia's guarantee
The benefit to CoreWeave is pretty straightforward. Building AI data centers is extraordinarily expensive. There are few companies that have cash flows large enough to pay for substantial data center capacity outright. CoreWeave is using debt -- a lot of it -- to build its data centers and acquire capacity from existing infrastructure providers.
CoreWeave needs money, and Nvidia's backstop allows it to access the capital it needs. Lenders are much more likely to agree to favorable terms -- or extend credit at all -- when they know one of the most successful companies on the planet is on the hook for billions of dollars.
Since the agreement is not new, its public revelation won't really change anything for CoreWeave's ability to access financing. However, it does help quell growing concerns from investors over the sustainability of its business model. That's great for its stock price.
Nvidia has a lot to gain, too
While CoreWeave's benefits are more readily apparent, Nvidia wins as well. CoreWeave serves an important role in Nvidia's ecosystem -- a role that extends well beyond being just another customer.
CoreWeave lowers the friction for companies that can't afford or justify massive, upfront graphics processing unit (GPU) purchases. Wider access means more sustainable demand. It means more AI workloads inside the CUDA software ecosystem -- a key element of Nvidia's moat -- reinforcing developer lock-in.
It also gives Nvidia a buffer and offloads risk. Nvidia gets to reap the benefits of supplying the AI data center build-out without directly spending its own money to build capacity and drive demand. It lets CoreWeave do so instead. That means it's CoreWeave that is spending enormous amounts of its cash -- and the cash it has borrowed -- to build capacity.
If AI demand drops sharply, obviously, it would be bad for Nvidia, but it could be disastrous for CoreWeave. Nvidia's obligation to creditors is capped at $6.3 billion. It's CoreWeave that's on the hook for the full amount of its debt.
Critically, the deal is structured so that Nvidia gets to use the unsold capacity it is paying for.
Who wins?
In the short term, both companies get what they need. Over the long term, however, Nvidia is the clear winner. If AI demand continues at the levels we are seeing today, both companies win. If AI demand cools, however, CoreWeave is in a tight spot.
CoreWeave is walking a tightrope, and its success requires AI demand to stay hot. I'm not sure that will happen. It's entirely possible that even if AI succeeds over the long term, there will be a period of retraction. This could prove fatal to CoreWeave given its enormous -- and expensive -- debt load."

Based on the forecasts above, Meta Platforms is the best trillion-dollar AI stock to buy now, though Microsoft and Amazon are close behind. Read on to learn more about the social media company and its pursuit of superintelligence.
Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve its advertising business
Meta Platforms owns three of the four most popular social media networks, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as measured by monthly active users. That those platforms attract 3.4 billion people daily makes Meta a key advertising partner for countless brands. And investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are only strengthening the value proposition.
Meta is using AI to create more engaging experiences across its social media. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says, ""AI is significantly improving our ability to show people content that they're going to find interesting and useful."" Users spent 5% more time on Facebook and 6% more time on Instagram during the second quarter due to improvements in the underlying recommendation engines.
Meanwhile, Meta made improvements to Andromeda (a machine learning system that powers ad retrieval) and applied the model to Facebook Reels, which increased conversion rates by 4%. Also, the company made improvements to GEM (a machine learning system that ranks and personalizes ads) that raised conversion rates by 3% on Facebook and 5% on Instagram.
Here's the big picture: Adtech spending is projected to grow at 14% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Meta Platforms, the second-largest adtech company, is well positioned to benefit from AI product development. Indeed, Malik Ahmed Khan at Morningstar writes, ""Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share.""
Meta Platforms sees a tremendous opportunity in smart glasses and superintelligence
Meta has established a business unit called Superintelligence Labs, which is focused on model development and product initiatives. The company has invested heavily to build data center infrastructure, with capital expenditures topping $100 billion in the last two years, and is actively recruiting top talent in the field.
The ultimate goal is to develop and monetize superintelligence, which means an AI system that is not only fundamentally smarter than people but also has the capacity to improve itself by learning without human intervention. There are several ways Meta could monetize such a system, but the company is particularly focused on smart glasses.
""Personal devices likes glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices,"" Zuckerberg wrote in July. ""Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful.""
Importantly, Meta is already the dominant player in the smart glasses market, and its lead is widening. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025, up from 66% in the second half of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Investors have good reason to think that trend will continue.
Meta recently introduced its first pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses called Ray-Ban Meta Display, which overlay the real world with a holographic color display on the right lens. The glasses are controlled by a wrist-worn device that tracks finger movements. It integrates with the conversational assistant Meta AI, but future models could integrate with a superintelligence system.
Smart glasses could become a substantial revenue stream for Meta. The augmented reality market is forecast to increase at 38% annually to reach $600 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.
Meta Platforms stock trades at a reasonable valuation
Wall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17.3% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate is reasonable given that adtech spending is forecast to increase at 14% annually through 2030. But it also leaves room for upside if smart glasses or another superintelligence form factor becomes a material source of revenue.
Regardless, the present valuation of 25.9 times earnings is reasonable even if the forward earnings estimate is spot-on. Those numbers give a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.5. In that context, Meta is actually tied with Nvidia as the cheapest trillion-dollar stock. So, patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position today."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-05T07:40:00,Should You Buy CoreWeave Stock After the $14 Billion Meta Deal?,A recent 8-K filing revealed CoreWeave signed a $14.2 billion cloud deal with Meta Platforms.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9fc9a5e3d82caacd54535690dec4841f3fa38a0f640cc9e53380bc946ba2b1ac,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/should-you-buy-coreweave-stock-after-the-14-billio/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/should-you-buy-coreweave-stock-after-the-14-billio/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/should-you-buy-coreweave-stock-after-the-14-billio/,fool.com,200,,"Since debuting on the public markets earlier this year, CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) has swiftly established itself as a central character in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure narrative.
Its latest milestone -- securing a six-year, $14.2 billion deal with Meta Platforms -- has further cemented its position and raised an important question for investors: Does CoreWeave merit a position in your portfolio right now?
What does CoreWeave do, and why is it important for AI infrastructure?
Unlike traditional hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, CoreWeave belongs to the emerging category of neoclouds -- a new class of cloud providers designed to excel at one function above all else: delivering GPU compute power at scale. Instead of offering a broad suite of enterprise services, neoclouds specialize in rapid chip provisioning, building dense GPU clusters, and offering flexible pricing tailored to the needs of AI developers.
This business model matters because the foundational layer of AI infrastructure is shifting. The competitive edge now lies less in general-purpose compute and more in securing the right partners to deliver accelerated hardware at scale -- removing supply chain bottlenecks in the process.
Simply put, companies pushing the frontiers of training large language models (LLMs), powering agentic AI systems, and running increasingly complex inference workloads require uninterrupted access to compute -- downtime or resource constraints are not an option.
By making Nvidia GPUs available on demand through its cloud-based platform, CoreWeave directly addresses this pain point. Its ability to provide scale quickly and reliably has made the company an attractive solution for businesses demanding additional AI capacity beyond their own data centers.
Who does CoreWeave compete with?
CoreWeave is not the only company capitalizing on the neocloud opportunity. Nebius Group recently secured a $17 billion deal with Microsoft, while Oracle signed a staggering $300 billion arrangement with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Even Iren, which was once focused on Bitcoin mining, is beginning to repurpose its power infrastructure to host Nvidia accelerators -- a move that highlights the economic convergence between energy and compute.
Despite their differences, these players are stitched together through a common strategy: Lock in long-dated, high-value contracts with leading AI companies; use those agreements to finance massive data center buildouts; and scale rapidly to keep pace with secular demand trends.
For customers, these partnerships mitigate the risk of GPU shortages and help stabilize pricing mechanics. For providers, they offer visibility into revenue and cash flow growth in a market evolving at unprecedented speed.
Is CoreWeave stock a buy right now?
Interestingly, CoreWeave's blockbuster contract with Meta comes on the heels of another multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI. Together, these wins give the company an enviable backlog. Nevertheless, investors should weigh the full picture before pouring into the stock purely based on headline figures.
On the bullish side of the equation, CoreWeave has secured long-term demand at a time when GPU supply remains severely constrained and heavily concentrated among a handful of big spenders. These contracts provide scale, enhance credibility, and create more predictable revenue streams that could support margin expansion.
That said, the risks are equally pronounced. Neoclouds are inherently capital-intensive, often relying on vendor financing and circular structures where a company like Nvidia serves as both a hardware supplier and financial backer. This dynamic introduces a complicated layer of fragility should demand begin to slow, liquidity tightens, or existing customers migrate toward alternative chips (including their own custom silicon).
Given these factors, I see CoreWeave less as a reliable long-term compounder and more like a momentum stock riding the wave of AI-driven tailwinds. For aggressive growth investors seeking direct exposure to the GPU boom, CoreWeave could be a compelling opportunity on pullbacks. But for more conservative investors, the established hyperscalers still offer greater diversification and the safety of blue chip branding."

Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) and Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) are widely seen as key beneficiaries of this revolution. Alphabet (through Google Cloud and Workspace) and Amazon (through AWS) serve enterprise markets. Still, they are also heavily exposed to consumer-driven segments, such as digital advertising and e-commerce.
On the other hand, Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) is more enterprise-centric, with a business model primarily based on seat-based subscriptions and long-term contracts. This recurring, enterprise-first model gives Microsoft stronger visibility than its peers, which are more reliant on cyclical consumer markets.
This edge may help propel Microsoft's market capitalization ahead of Alphabet and Amazon by 2030. Here are some other reasons why this prediction can become a reality in the next few years.
The case for Microsoft
Microsoft's enterprise-focused AI strategy is proving to be a key advantage. Overall, over 800 million monthly active users are engaging with all the AI features embedded in its portfolio.
The company has integrated Copilot across its core offerings, including Office, Teams, Dynamics, Security, and GitHub, and monetizes it through either recurring subscriptions or consumption-based pricing. The Copilot family of apps caters to over 100 million monthly active users. While Copilot is used by nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies, there remains a significant opportunity to further expand usage within existing accounts.
Copilot is also the fastest-growing product in the Microsoft 365 productivity suite. With an installed base (paid M365 commercial seats) of over 430 million and initial pricing of $30 per seat per month, there is still a long runway for seat penetration and an increase in average revenue per user in future years.
Increasing adoption of cloud computing is also a significant growth catalyst. Azure has become the second-largest cloud infrastructure services player globally, with a 20% market share. By aggressively expanding its data center capacity, which now spans over 400 Azure data centers across 70 regions, Microsoft is preparing to meet the rapidly increasing demand for AI.
The company is also rolling out liquid cooling and software improvements at data centers, which are crucial for conserving power while running complex AI workloads. All this can translate into lower unit costs and better margins for Microsoft, especially as workloads scale.
Beyond compute, Microsoft has also built an extensive technology stack. At the data layer, the company has a complete data and analytics platform called Fabric. The company operates Azure AI Foundry at the model layer, enabling enterprises to build, manage, and customize AI applications and agents at scale. Finally, at the application layer, Copilot, Copilot Studio, Copilot Tuning, and SharePoint enable organizations to create millions of custom agents embedded directly in their daily workflows.
Together, this can position Microsoft as the operating system for enterprise AI -- another exceptional opportunity for the long run. The end-to-end stack helps create a sticky customer base, reduces customer churn, and increases contract size. Microsoft already has a contracted backlog of $368 billion at the end of fiscal 2025. The company also has a 98% annuity mix, implying that 98% revenues are recurring in nature. The company, thus, enjoys high revenue visibility in the coming years.
Microsoft trades at 28.3 times forward earnings, which is not exactly cheap. However, the premium is justified considering the durability of its enterprise-first model and the fact that it is in the early stages of AI adoption. Hence, Microsoft's shares could still offer considerable upside over the next five years.
Alphabet and Amazon may stumble
Although Alphabet and Amazon are formidable players in AI, Microsoft appears far more resilient. Alphabet's Gemini family of models is now helping enhance monetization across its core offerings, including Search, YouTube, and Android. Google Cloud is also the third-largest cloud infrastructure services provider, with a 13 % market share.
However, increasing evidence suggests that the company's flagship Google search business has come under intense threat, especially from AI chatbots and other AI-enhanced search engines.
Alphabet also faces risk to its digital advertising business in the current challenging economic environment. The rising number of antitrust cases in the European Union limits its ability to integrate search and digital advertising with AI capabilities. Hence, while at 22.8 times forward earnings, Alphabet looks cheaper than its peers, the discount can be attributed to the inherent challenges faced by its business.
Amazon is also investing heavily in generative AI technologies to strengthen its e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. The company's Bedrock service (used by customers to develop and scale custom AI applications, while also giving access to multiple foundation models) is gaining traction. The company says its custom Trainium chip is showing 30% to 40% better price-performance than other graphics processing units (GPUs) providers in inference workloads. AWS remains the leader in the cloud infrastructure services market, with a 30% market share.
However, the company's key engine, AWS, saw revenue grow at 17.5% year over year in the recent quarter, far lower than the 34% year-over-year growth reported by Azure. The company's e-commerce margins are also low. Hence, Amazon's ability to fund future AI initiatives without compromising on near-term profitability looks weak. Despite these challenges, the company is trading at an elevated valuation multiple of 28.9 times forward earnings, leaving little room for error.
Many prominent analysts also view Microsoft as a company with significant upside potential. Coatue's Philippe Laffont estimates Microsoft's market capitalization to be nearly $5.7 trillion by 2030. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities expects Microsoft's market capitalization to potentially surpass $5 trillion by the end of 2026 (18 months from June 2025).

Mastercard Investment Narrative Recap
To be a Mastercard shareholder, you need to believe in the persistent growth in digital payments, the company’s ability to create value-added services, and its scale protecting market share as payment ecosystems evolve. The recent launch of Mastercard Commerce Media, while expanding addressable markets and reinforcing the company’s customer engagement ambitions, doesn’t directly offset the largest near-term risk, which is the potential headwind from alternative domestic payment rails in emerging markets eroding transaction volumes and margin expansion opportunities. For now, these news events do not materially alter the most important catalysts or risks for Mastercard’s core business.
Among recent announcements, the extended partnership with Smile ID in Africa stands out as Mastercard’s efforts to integrate secure digital identity tools for mobile onboarding and fraud prevention. This reveals the company’s continued push into high-growth, underpenetrated regions, aligning with the core catalyst of rising digital and mobile payment adoption, while aiming to differentiate value-added services even as competition remains intense.
Yet, against Mastercard’s ambitions, expanding real-time payment systems in markets like Brazil and India pose an existential challenge investors should watch…"

With Rental Registries, Cities Seek to Close Data Gap With Landlords
Even some of AI’s biggest cheerleaders acknowledge the market is frothy, while still professing their belief in the technology’s long-term potential. AI, they say, is poised to reshape multiple industries, cure diseases and generally accelerate human progress.
Yet never before has so much money been spent so rapidly on a technology that, for all its potential, remains somewhat unproven as a profit-making business model. Tech industry executives who privately doubt the most effusive assessments of AI’s revolutionary potential — or at least struggle to see how to monetize it — may feel they have little choice but to keep pace with their rivals’ investments or risk being out-scaled and sidelined in the future AI marketplace.
What are the warning signs for AI?
When Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure plan known as Stargate alongside other executives at the White House in January, the price tag triggered some disbelief. Since then, other tech rivals have ramped up spending, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who has pledged to invest hundreds of billions in data centers. Not to be outdone, Altman has since said he expects OpenAI to spend “trillions” on AI infrastructure.
To finance those projects, OpenAI is entering into new territory. In September, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. announced an agreement to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s data center buildout, a deal that some analysts say raises questions about whether the chipmaker is trying to prop up its customers so that they keep spending on its own products."

Altman has held discussions since late September in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan with major suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Foxconn, Samsung, and SK Hynix to boost AI chip production and secure top-priority orders for OpenAI, the report said.
Altman was pushing these companies to increase production capacity and give priority to OpenAI's orders, the newspaper added.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Microsoft, TSMC, Foxconn, Samsung and SK Hynix couldn't immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours.
Earlier this week, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix had signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers.
Altman has planned to visit investors in the United Arab Emirates to raise money to help fund OpenAI's infrastructure expansion and research, WSJ said.
OpenAI recently told its investors and business partners that it was likely to spend around $16 billion in renting computing servers this year, and that the expenditure could rise to around $400 billion in 2029, the report added, citing people familiar with the matter.

While valuations are high, comparisons to the dot-com era suggest this may be a structural shift.
The combined market value of the United States' Magnificent Seven tech giants has now exceeded the entire output of the European Union, as a relentless rally in technology stocks stretches valuations and stokes concerns over potential market excess.
As of the close on 2 October 2025, the seven leading US tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla — commanded a total market capitalisation of $20.8 trillion (€17.7tn), eclipsing the EU’s total economic output of $19.4tn (€16.5tn).
Nvidia alone, now the world’s most valuable company, boasts a market valuation of around $4.3tn (€3.9tn) — equivalent to the GDP of Germany, Europe’s largest economy.
This extraordinary milestone is fuelling debate. Is this a transformative moment for global capitalism, or are we witnessing the early signs of a new tech bubble?
To assess that, we must ask: What truly defines a technology stock bubble — and how does today compare to the speculative frenzy of the early 2000s?
What is a tech bubble?
A tech bubble could be defined not just by high valuations, but by a widespread disconnect between market prices and the underlying economic reality or business fundamentals.
It’s characterised by speculative fervour, excessive investor optimism, and the belief that rapid technological change will deliver limitless profits — often without regard to earnings or sustainable business models.
Renowned economist Robert Shiller describes bubbles as periods of “social contagion” — where stories of quick riches fuel mass enthusiasm, drawing in more investors and driving prices even higher, regardless of the fundamentals.
In this phase, fear of missing out overrides risk assessment.
“Speculative bubbles are fuelled by the contagious spread of market stories, which inspire enthusiasm and a desire to participate among a growing number of investors,"" Robert Shiller wrote in his 'Irrational Exuberance'.
Hyman Minsky, another influential economist, argued that during euphoric booms, speculation becomes the dominant force in markets.
As asset prices climb, they are increasingly justified by narratives rather than data. Eventually, a trigger — whether macroeconomic, regulatory, or psychological — bursts the illusion, leading to a sharp correction. In tech bubbles, this dynamic is often amplified by the allure of innovation.
Investors project exponential growth onto emerging technologies — from dot-coms in the late 1990s to blockchain in the 2010s, and now potentially artificial intelligence.
‘This is not a bubble, but a reshaping of capitalism’
Jordi Visser, senior managing director and head of macro research at 22V Research, argued that branding today’s rally as a bubble misses the point.
“To separate AI from the lazy shorthand of ‘bubble’, we have to recognise that what’s unfolding is not speculative mania but a structural arms race,” he said, pointing to deep investment by governments and corporations in AI capabilities as a matter of national and economic security.
Rather than being driven by unsustainable euphoria, Visser suggests that AI is accelerating a decades-long process of economic concentration. That's one where wealth and innovation are being compressed into fewer hands, be they companies, households or nations.
“Bubbles lift everyone into euphoria; concentration leaves most behind,” he said.
Still, there are signs that investor sentiment is stretching. The speed of capital inflows into AI-themed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the speculative rise of small-cap AI names, and the dominance of a few megacaps over the broader market may not suggest a full-blown bubble, but they do indicate heightened risk.
Moreover, the structural bets being placed on AI may not all yield long-term gains. As with previous technological revolutions, not every firm will emerge a winner. The ghosts of AOL, BlackBerry and Yahoo! — once market leaders — still linger as reminders of how quickly innovation can outpace incumbency.
Are we in dot-com-like euphoria?
To assess whether we’re in a bubble similar to the late 1990s, it’s worth revisiting the numbers. The current tech rally can be traced back to November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT — a landmark moment for generative artificial intelligence that ignited a new wave of enthusiasm in Silicon Valley and beyond.
Since then, the Nasdaq 100 — the benchmark index for the largest US tech firms — has surged by 140% in under three years.
That’s impressive, but still modest compared to the dot-com era. In the three years leading up to the March 2000 peak, the Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 500%.
By that measure, we’re still far from the level of euphoria that defined the turn-of-the-century tech boom. Valuations, while elevated, are not yet extreme.
One of the most widely used indicators to assess equity valuations is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company’s current share price to its expected earnings over the next 12 months.
Here’s how the Magnificent Seven currently stack up:
Nvidia: 33.2x
Microsoft: 33.2x
Apple: 33.3x
Alphabet: 24.8x
Amazon: 32.1x
Meta: 25.5x
Tesla: 220.0x
Only Tesla appears significantly out of line, trading at a forward P/E of 220 — the highest in the Nasdaq 100 alongside Palantir, another AI-focused firm. Excluding Tesla, the group’s valuations are actually lower than the broader Nasdaq 100, which currently trades above 40x forward earnings.
In this context, while pricing is undoubtedly rich, it doesn’t yet reflect the frothy excesses of the dot-com bubble, at least not by traditional valuation standards.
Bottom Line
Today’s tech rally is extraordinary in both scale and symbolism.
That the world’s top seven tech companies can collectively outvalue the European Union’s economic output speaks volumes about the shifting balance of economic power in the digital age. But by traditional measures of euphoria — explosive price increases, irrational valuations, widespread retail mania — the current cycle falls short of the dot-com peak.
That may offer comfort to some, but the line between structural transformation and speculative excess is often thin."

Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) products are as integrated into our professional lives as meetings that could've been emails, but these ""boring"" and decades-old tools are the fuel Microsoft is using to compete in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.
As AI progresses and automates away chunks of the professional world as we know it, the legacy suite of Microsoft 365 products shows no signs of slowing down. This ability to quietly and reliably generate revenue is funding Microsoft's riskier AI bets.
Office products generated $54.9 billion in fiscal year 2024 (the 12 months ended in June 2024). That was 22% of all of Microsoft's revenue. Microsoft 365 will keep the company on the leaderboard of AI innovators for years to come. This is great news for long-term Microsoft investors.
Microsoft's lagging AI strategy
Microsoft is still playing catch-up when it comes to generative AI. OpenAI leads with more than 200 million weekly active users and set the gold standard with the release of ChatGPT in 2022. Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms both have models nearly equivalent to OpenAI.
Compared to these companies, Microsoft got a late start in deciding on an AI strategy. However, it has since closed the gap significantly by partnering with competitor OpenAI and, as of the end of 2024, was beginning to build models in-house.
Microsoft also purchased billions in Nvidia chips and continues to innovate on its cloud computing platform, Azure, and agentic powerhouse, Copilot. These strategic moves are, thus far, keeping pace with the other major players in the AI industry.
Microsoft requires immense amounts of capital to remain competitive in the AI landscape. Fortunately, its decades-old productivity and business lines are the stable engine propelling Microsoft into its new, automated era.
The Office moat
Normally, when one thinks of a legacy business, it's of an outdated, shrinking portion of revenue. That is not the case with Microsoft's Office products. Microsoft 365, including the applications Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Teams, and Outlook, is still growing by double digits year over year.
This indicates these product lines are not only here to stay, but are so universally adopted by businesses and individuals alike that it'll be nearly impossible to dethrone them anytime soon.
These products are also mostly recession-resistant, as businesses are unlikely to cut them in an economic downturn. Microsoft also switched to a subscription model more than a decade ago, making revenue from these lines of business extraordinarily predictable and dependable.
The significant growth in the legacy products is also great news for the capital-intensive investments Microsoft will need to continue making for the next several years. Microsoft reports that it's on track to invest approximately $80 billion to build out AI-enabled data centers for training and deploying AI models and applications.
Microsoft's AI revenue is exploding
In its earnings call on July 30, Microsoft revealed Azure's income for the first time: a whopping $75 billion, an increase of 34%, according to chairman and CEO Satya Nadella.
The CEO added, ""Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector. We're innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era.""
Microsoft's market cap is approaching $4 trillion, and there seems to be quite a bit of room left for growth, particularly if the company's big AI bets pay off.
Microsoft remains a top competitor
For investors, Microsoft remains a solid long-term play, largely because of the stable products users have known for years. With a quarterly dividend of $0.91 per share, investors are rewarded on both the value and growth side, though the dividend yield is under 1%. Microsoft's burgeoning agentic and innovative technologies will continue to produce massive revenue alongside mature, reliable products.
Overall, Microsoft's total revenue increased 18% from Q4 2024 to Q4 2025. There's plenty of risk associated with investing in AI technologies, but thanks to Microsoft's steady lines of business, the downside is far less than that of many competitors."

In a statement, the Army’s chief information officer also said the problems with the NGC2 system were “identified early and mitigated immediately,” and that the issues were fixed in a controlled testing environment.
Friday’s share move was the biggest decline for Palantir since August, and the stock was the worst S&P 500 performer for the day. The drop follows a remarkable upward trajectory for the company, whose shares have gained more than 2,000% in the last three years. Other tech companies also slipped Friday following threats from the White House to lay off government workers.
Lieutenant General Jeth Rey said that finding security vulnerabilities was an important part of integrating advanced technology in a statement about the report. “We found a risk and we mitigated it right out of the gate,” he said. “I think it’s a good news story for us going forward.”
According to an Army memo dated Sept. 5, reported by Breaking Defense and Reuters, the communications networks for the companies had been vulnerable to “insider threats, external attacks, and data spillage,” with “critical deficiencies in fundamental security controls, processes, and governance,” before the interventions.
Anduril also said that the problems had been addressed. “The recent report reflects an outdated snapshot, not the current state of the program,” the company said. “NGC2 is progressing through the normal process of iterative development, we find risks early, address them quickly, and harden the system before fielding.”
Army CIO Leo Garciga said that the problems identified in the memo were part of the process of updating military technology — something many technologists and defense experts say is badly needed as the nature of warfare evolves. “It’s important to see these memos in the context of modernizing the Army and improving the speed of capability delivery,” he said in a statement, adding that the Army was trying to get new tools to soldiers “in a much more rapid fashion than we have done historically.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The much-needed modernization of the U.S. Army's battlefield communications network being undertaken by Anduril, Palantir and others is rife with ""fundamental security"" problems and vulnerabilities, and should be treated as a ""very high risk,"" according to a recent internal Army memo.
The two Silicon Valley companies, led by allies of U.S. President Donald Trump, have gained access to the Pentagon's lucrative flow of contracts on the promise of quickly providing less expensive and more sophisticated weapons than the Pentagon's longstanding arms providers.
Military drone and software maker Anduril boasted it had a prototype of the NGC2 communications platform working during a battlefield test just eight weeks after winning the contract award. But the September 5 memo provides fodder for critics who argue that Silicon Valley’s move-fast, break-things ethos may not be the best approach for vital military equipment.
The memo from the Army's chief technology officer about the NGC2 platform that connects soldiers, sensors, vehicles and commanders with real-time data paints a bleak security picture of the initial product.
""We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure,"" the memo says.
Those concerns have been addressed already as part of the ""normal process"" of development, Anduril said. ""The recent report reflects an outdated snapshot, not the current state of the program,"" the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters.
A Palantir spokesperson said, ""No vulnerabilities were found in the Palantir platform.""
However, the Army internal memo written by Gabriele Chiulli, the Army chief technology officer authorizing official on the NGC2 prototype, said, ""Given the current security posture of the platform and the hosted 3rd party applications the likelihood of an adversary gaining persistent undetectable access to the platform requires the system be treated as very high risk.""
Palantir stock closed down 7.5% on Friday. Anduril is not publicly traded, although company founder Palmer Luckey has said a public offering is planned.
A September 30 article on Anduril’s website touted the NGC2 system’s performance during a live-fire exercise in Fort Carson, Colorado: ""Soldiers fired 26 live missions with M777 howitzers on Fort Carson's live-fire ranges, running AXS side-by-side with legacy crews.

Welcome to good buy or goodbye. Our goal here to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves your portfolio. I'm here today with Ben Connard, Carnegie Investment Council, portfolio manager. Ben, it is great to see you. So we're going to start off on a name you like Ben, and that would be Microsoft, which has had a good run already, Ben. It's up about 25% year to date.
Uh most analysts on the street, they still like this one. You do too. So let's walk through some of the reasons why. The first reason, Microsoft 365 commercial revenue.
Sure. Uh Microsoft has a huge base. They've got about uh 400 million commercial users. Um that provides a steady source of revenue for the company. It's pretty uh economically resistant. It's not going to move much. And um it provides a steady cash flow for them that they can invest otherwheres in other places in their business.
Second point, Ben, second reason you say this one's by set up to monetize AI.
Yeah, it's actually related to the first point with the with all those users, uh they can add their co-pilot to that, their uh AI agent. And uh they can upsell uh those commercial users, the co-pilot, uh they charge more for it. They almost double the revenue per user. And so that's a big source. And then they have co-pilot in uh GitHub, which is their software development uh program. And that's that's uh grown quite nicely. They're about 20 million uh GitHub users using the GitHub co-pilot and so it's a nice uh added revenue and they're one of the few companies that are already uh monetizing AI.
And a third reason you'd commit capital to Microsoft, Azure cloud growth.
Yeah, Azure is their cloud infrastructure product. Uh it's growing nicely. Uh I think it grew 39% uh quarter of uh year-over-year last quarter. Um they are uh obviously providing the infrastructure that data setters need to uh run AI. They obviously have a good relationship with OpenAI. Um and that's leading to steady growth. And then just in general, we still have tech uh companies moving their technology from on premise to the cloud. And since Microsoft has an established relationship with a lot of companies uh through their legacy server business, uh that provides uh an easy guide, be like, using us now, let's transition to the cloud.
All right, finally, Ben, uh before you all pile in, Yeah. Let's talk about some downside risk. Cloud business has lower margins. Walk us through that.
Yeah, in general, the cloud business has lower gross margins than their other businesses. And it's also their fastest growing business. So if you just think about that, that's going to lower their overall margins. Um and then it the cloud business is very competitive and it's becoming increasingly competitive with Oracle. So you already have Amazon Web Services, you have Google Cloud, and now uh Oracle Cloud has joined and they're growing uh exceptionally well.
And that that competition means their margins aren't likely going higher. Uh and that'll that'll impact Microsoft uh going forward.
Let me ask you when you look at a name like Microsoft, basically everybody likes Microsoft. 97% of analysts who are paid to give you an opinion about Microsoft, 97% have a buy. Does that ever give you any cause for concern when you see a name and basically everybody's piled on one side of the boat?
Yeah, it is and I mean, you see it in the valuation. Microsoft's not a cheap stock right now. It's over 30 times multiple. But it's a, to us, it's still a core holding and it should be in your portfolio. And, um, there's still those businesses, the lines we just talked about provide downside protection. And say, yeah, let's let's keep owning this stock, or let's buy it.
All right, so that's one you like. Let's now talk about one you don't like as much. you'd avoid. That would be Adobe. Now this stock is already down. It's down about 20% year to date. You don't see that as an opportunity. You would still avoid Adobe. So the first reason is competition.
Yeah, so uh Canva and Figma, they've been around for more than 10 years. This isn't really new competition. But it's in, it's increasing competition as Adobe expands beyond professionals into non-professionals, they're running into Canva more. Um, and so it's just something to be wary of and the competitive landscape has changed for Adobe.
Second reason you say avoid Adobe, AI native products also a source of competition.
Yeah, you know, uh Open AI has a product, uh Google has some AI products that help video editing, uh image editing. And that's added competition. And again, it's, it's for the non-professional users, but it erodes Adobe's ability to grow users quickly.
Finally, reason you steer clear, pricing power threats.
Yeah, it's obviously connected. uh Adobe, you know, they grow revenue through more users and also increasing the revenue per user. And that is they have the pricing power to basically increase prices. And when you have more competition, you don't have that power and then it's going to make them, it's going to make harder for the company just to grow the top line.
All right, so you say avoid Adobe. But finally, Ben walks through how could you be wrong on this call?
Uh right there. Adobe, it's still the marketing standard for professionals. So they have a base that's not going to be dislodged for a lot of professionals in the marketing space. Uh it's part of their workflow using the Adobe products. So it's not like uh companies can just sweep in and take that business away. Uh and as the the chart you just showed, the stock's been hit, it's priced uh uh pretty cheaply, but ultimately, we think that there's still downside because the competition is too great with the Canva Figma and then the new competition from native AI.
All right, so buy Microsoft, avoid Adobe. Ben, thanks so much for your time today those picks. Appreciate it. And thank you all for watching good buy or goodbye."

The memo, reported by Breaking Defense and Reuters, describes the NGC2 platform as a ""very high risk"" due to security vulnerabilities that could allow adversaries to gain ""persistent undetectable access"" to the system. The assessment was written by Gabrielle Chiulli, the Army’s chief technology officer authorizing official, in September.
Among the critical flaws identified in the memo are issues with access control, where ""any authorized user can access all applications and data regardless of their clearance level,"" with no logging system to track user actions. The document also noted that third-party applications integrated into the system had not undergone proper Army security assessments, with one application revealing 25 high-severity code vulnerabilities.
The NGC2 platform is designed to connect soldiers, sensors, vehicles, and commanders with real-time data on the battlefield. Anduril was awarded a $100 million contract to create a prototype of the system with partners including Palantir, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and several smaller contractors.
Despite the memo’s critique, Leonel Garciga, Army chief information officer and Chiulli’s supervisor, said in a statement that the report was part of a process that helped in ""triaging cybersecurity vulnerabilities"" and mitigating them.

Talk to enough experienced dividend investors and chances are they'll rattle off sectors like consumer staples, healthcare and utilities as some of their favorite payout destinations. Odds are equally good that they won't mention technology.
That's understandable, because the 12-month distribution rate on the largest exchange traded fund (ETF) tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index is a piddly 0.48%Obviously nothing to write home about, but that data point obfuscates tech's status as a rising payout growth spot. In fact, in dollar terms, Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) and Apple (AAPL 0.54%) are two of the biggest dividend payers in the S&P 500.
Apple and Microsoft are widely held stocks, but in what amounts to a pleasant surprise for equity income investors, the duo is an appetizer in the tech dividend equation. Seven-course meals are available with the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV 1.18%) and the ProShares S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats ETF (TDV 0.81%).
Similar tickers, but different methodologies. So, let's examine how these ETFs live up to their tech dividend billings.
TDV: A familiar playbook
As its name implies, the ProShares S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats ETF has Dividend Aristocrats DNA. The TDV follows the S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats – a collection of tech companies that have increased payouts for at least seven straight years.
With tech and dividends still considered newlyweds, that index requirement sounds confining, but TDV holds 38 stocks. That roster size is aided by index flexibility that allows for ""tech-related"" companies. Mastercard (MA -0.83%) and Visa (V -0.73%) being prime examples.
If there's a rub with TDV's plumbing, it's that the dividend increase streak requirement precludes some big names from entering the index. For example, Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) and Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) are dividend payers, but they haven't increased payouts for seven straight years, so they're not yet candidates for TDV admission.
TDV has points in its favor, including equally weighting its holdings. That means the ETF can be an income-generating complement to stakes in tech funds that weigh components by market capitalization – many of which have rosters where a small number of stocks command whopping percentages of the portfolios.
TDIV: Tech dividend flexibility
While TDV's dividend increase streak mandate has a country club membership feel to it, the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund has its own elements of exclusivity. The fund follows the Nasdaq Technology Dividend™ Index, which has several rules dividend investors need to acknowledge. Those include requiring member firms to have paid a dividend over the past year, no payout cuts over that time and a minimum yield of 0.50%.
By eschewing the payout increase streak protocol, TDIV sports a significantly larger roster than its rival – 94 holdings to be precise. There's another big difference between the tech dividend ETFs. TDIV holdings are dividend value-weighted. In plain English, the ETF's index places added emphasis on stocks with big dividends and massive market caps. Hence, Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), Oracle (ORCL 1.54%) and Microsoft combine for nearly a quarter of the ETF's weight. TDIV has a different way of doing things, but it's hard to argue with its performance since inception in August 2012.
There are other marquee differences between TDIV and its nearest competitor. Notably, the First Trust ETF can hold international stocks, some of which have been additive to performance, and 20% of its portfolio can be allocated to communication services stocks. The latter point is pertinent because if Alphabet and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) increase their payouts enough to drive their yields to 0.50%, those stocks would be eligible for TDIV admittance, perhaps increasing the ETF's growth profile along the way.
Different tech dividend strokes for different folks
For fee-conscious investors, TDV is an appealing option because its annual expense ratio is 0.45%, or $45 on a $10,000 position, compared to TDIV's 0.50%, but fee tussles aren't the end ETF comparisons. Smart investors know there's more to the story.
The ProShares ETF may be more appropriate for investors seeking documented dividend dependability via an instrument that as currently constructed, leans into mature, older guard technology companies. Plus, the fund's equal-weight methodology may be attractive at a time when so many cap-weighted indexes are heavily concentrated in a small number of stocks.
On the other hand, TDIV is perhaps the better choice for growth investors that want a dash of income. Past performance isn't a guarantee of future returns, but it shouldn't be ignored that over the past three years, TDIV's returns and volatility traits stacked up well against some traditional tech ETFs, indicating its flexibility and index mechanics play in investors' favor."

The Inherent Inefficiency Nvidia Can’t Fix
Paik sees Nvidia’s market dominance as both formidable and fundamentally vulnerable.
“Nvidia’s greatest strength—a legacy built on general-purpose [graphics processing units]—is also its Achilles’ heel,” he declared.”There is inherent inefficiency and architectural complexity that stems from using a general-purpose GPU architecture for specialized AI computing.""
Paik added, ""GPU makers have developed extremely sophisticated hardware and software workarounds to mitigate these limitations. But their efforts are directed at advancing on their current path, making it difficult for them to pivot to a new paradigm that is uniquely suited to AI.”
FuriosaAI started from first principles in 2017, designing the Tensor Contraction Processor architecture specifically for AI computations. “Our chip architecture, the Tensor Contraction Processor, works at a higher abstraction level,” Paik told Benzinga. “Tensor contraction is the fundamental operation in deep learning, which makes complex optimization problems much more tractable compared to the lower-level matrix multiplication used by GPUs.”
The architectural choice delivers practical advantages. “This means that when new AI models emerge, our compiler can run them efficiently without a massive effort to write hundreds of new, hand-tuned kernels,” Paik said. “It also means our chips minimize wasteful data movement, resulting in breakthrough power efficiency.”"

Analyst Edison Lee cut his rating on the stock to underperform from hold, writing that the stock’s current valuation prices in an “overly bullish iPhone outlook.” Shares fell 0.9% on Friday.
The stock’s consensus recommendation — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — now stands at 3.93 out of five, making Apple the least-loved of the Magnificent Seven except for Tesla Inc. Even so, bearish ratings for the stock are relatively rare. Fewer than 7% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a sell-equivalent rating on the shares. Roughly 57% recommend buying, while that ratio is above 90% for Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Amazon.com Inc.
The stock has risen more than 20% off a low hit in early August, an advance that has returned it near record levels. Despite that advance, the stock is barely positive this year, while the Nasdaq 100 Index has risen more than 15%.
Much of the recent strength has come on stronger-than-expected demand for the company’s latest iPhone, as well as optimism over an upcoming foldable model.
Lee wrote that “better demand for iPhone 17, partly due to a price cut on the base model, is already in the price,” and this “has led to excessive expectations on 18 Fold, and the replacement cycle.”
He added that it was unclear what market there would be for a phone that costs around $2,000, and trimmed his price target to $205.16 from $205.82. The stock last closed at $257.13, meaning the new target points to downside of more than 20%.

Oct 2 - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has struck a major agreement with neocloud provider Nebius (NASDAQ:NBIS) to secure computing power for its internal AI teams, according to Bloomberg.
The deal gives Microsoft access to more than 100,000 of Nvidia's (NVDA) newest GB300 chips. It follows a previously announced $17.4 billion, five-year partnership with Nebius, which could climb to $19.4 billion if Microsoft opts for extra capacity.

Even this year, the stock has already climbed 23.2%. While the last month’s 2.1% return is more measured, there is always something moving under the surface with a company like this.
Recently, a string of headlines has kept Microsoft in the spotlight. The company’s deep connection to OpenAI has only grown as the AI powerhouse hit a staggering $500B valuation. This development bodes well for Microsoft’s own ambitions in artificial intelligence. New deals with major chipmakers like Samsung and SK Hynix for OpenAI’s next-generation data center could further strengthen Microsoft’s hold on the AI ecosystem. You might have also seen headlines about Microsoft integrating its AI subscription into Office, signaling an even stronger push to monetize AI for everyday users.
With all this action, you are probably wondering if Microsoft is still undervalued or if the boat has sailed. According to our analysis, Microsoft scores a 2 out of 6 on our value score, meaning it appears undervalued in only two of six key checks. That is not a clear screaming buy, but it is not an overpriced red flag either.
So how does Microsoft really stack up on the valuation front? Next, we will walk through each of the main approaches to valuing a stock like Microsoft. Toward the end, we will highlight an even more insightful way to think about value in today’s market.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future free cash flows and discounting them back to today's dollars. This approach helps investors gauge what Microsoft's cash-generating power is truly worth right now.
For Microsoft, the most recent Free Cash Flow stands at $83.87 billion. Analyst forecasts run about five years into the future, projecting steady growth in those cash flows. By 2030, Microsoft's Free Cash Flow is expected to reach $199.48 billion, with later years extrapolated by Simply Wall St. Each year, projected cash flows are discounted to reflect today's value, using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.
This analysis produces an intrinsic value estimate for Microsoft stock of $497.41 per share. The DCF suggests Microsoft is currently 3.7% overvalued, so the stock price is quite close to what the model suggests is fair."

Nebius Group Investment Narrative Recap
The core thesis behind Nebius Group is that surging enterprise demand for cloud-based AI compute will sustain the company’s rapid expansion and revenue growth potential. The multi-billion dollar Microsoft partnership strengthens Nebius’ position as a go-to provider of dedicated AI infrastructure, but the biggest near-term catalysts, like accelerated revenue growth from hyperscaler contracts, remain tightly linked to execution. The most immediate risk is potential dilution from heavy capital raising; the Microsoft deal does not eliminate this concern, though it could help ease funding pressures depending on contract terms.
One of the most relevant recent events is the completion of Nebius’s US$1 billion follow-on equity offering in September, a move that adds to its financial resources to meet rising infrastructure needs. This announcement ties directly to the short-term growth opportunities presented by the Microsoft agreement, but also heightens shareholder sensitivity to dilution and long-term returns on new capital invested.
However, investors should be aware that despite strong momentum, shareholder dilution risk remains elevated in the near term...
Read the full narrative on Nebius Group (it's free!)
Nebius Group's narrative projects $3.2 billion in revenue and $428.7 million in earnings by 2028. This requires 133.9% annual revenue growth and a $238.5 million earnings increase from current earnings of $190.2 million.
Uncover how Nebius Group's forecasts yield a $153.00 fair value, a 22% upside to its current price.
Exploring Other Perspectives
Thirty-eight members of the Simply Wall St Community estimate Nebius Group’s fair value anywhere from US$7.35 to US$333.76 per share. While some see major upside, others remain cautious of ongoing dilution and capital needs, signaling divergent views on long-term performance drivers."

She may not have the same name recognition as other tech execs like Tim Cook, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg—not yet, anyway—but Mira Murati is one of the most-watched entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. The former chief technology officer from OpenAI, who left to launch her own AI startup last year, just celebrated a major milestone: Her company, Thinking Machines Lab, just launched its first product this week, called Tinker. Rather than be another generative-AI chatbot like ChatGPT, Tinker is designed to help researchers and developers fine-tune AI models without the need to manage massive computing infrastructure. The launch represents the first commercial product from Thinking Machines, which raised a record-breaking $2 billion in seed funding at a $12 billion valuation.
Murati, the 36-year-old Albanian-American engineer-turned-executive, has emerged as a defining figure in the AI boom. Her journey from a mechanical engineering student to the chief technology officer who helped create ChatGPT exemplifies the rapid transformation of both AI technology and the careers of those building it. More recently, her ability to resist Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive recruitment efforts—including reported billion-dollar offers to acquire her company and poach her talent—has solidified her reputation as a leader willing to chart her own course in an industry dominated by tech giants.
From Albania to the world stage
Born on December 16, 1988, in Vlorë, Albania, during the final years of the country’s totalitarian regime, Murati’s early life was shaped by political upheaval and economic uncertainty. Her parents, both high school teachers who taught literature, encouraged her academic pursuits, but Murati told Microsoft’s CTO Kevin Scott in 2023 that she had an “organic interest towards math and science,” where she excelled in Olympiads and competitions throughout her schooling.
At 16, Murati won a scholarship from United World Colleges—a program that brings together students from over 80 countries to promote intercultural understanding and social responsibility—to study at Pearson College on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. But after graduating from Pearson in 2005, Murati pursued an unusual academic path that would prove prescient for her later career. She enrolled in a dual-degree program, completing a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Colby College in 2011 and a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Dartmouth College’s Thayer School of Engineering in 2012. This combination of liberal arts and engineering disciplines provided her with both analytical thinking skills and technical expertise, which would prove handy in her later roles in Silicon Valley."

The jump comes as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 were up 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively.
The artificial intelligence (AI) cloud provider announced on Tuesday that it has signed a major deal with Meta Platforms. The deal will be worth up to $14.2 billion and lasts roughly six years, ending Dec. 14, 2031. Meta does, however, have the option to ""materially expand"" its commitment through 2032 if it so chooses.
CoreWeave shares are also getting a lift from Microsoft's chief technical officer (CTO), who told CNBC at a conference this week that regarding the lack of AI computing capacity, a ""massive crunch is probably an understatement."" Demand remaining white-hot is critical for CoreWeave's growth.
Investors should remain cautious
The opportunity for CoreWeave and other AI infrastructure providers is enormous, but so are the risks. The company already carries a significant debt load and will continually have to borrow more at high rates or dilute its shareholders through stock sales for the foreseeable future. If AI demand lags -- and that is a real possibility that investors need to consider -- CoreWeave will be in serious trouble.

Targeting lighter contact center needs, it appeals to businesses aiming for cost efficiency and usability, with future AI advancements anticipated.
Dublin, Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Microsoft Unify Model for Teams-Contact Center Integration: What Buyers Need to Know"" report from Metrigy has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
Microsoft's new Unify integration model, generally available as of September 1, 2025, allows third-party vendors to embed Microsoft Teams Phone services directly into their contact center platforms using Azure APIs. This model is one of three provided by Microsoft for connecting Teams Phone with third-party contact centers, alongside the earlier Connect and Extend models.
The Unify model and this paper's discussion of it are driven by the fact that Microsoft has become a global leader in the unified communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) market, with a 21% share. Additionally, a significant number of companies already have or plan to integrate Teams Phone with their contact centers to streamline agent workflows, simplify infrastructure, and leverage AI like Microsoft Copilot.
The three integration models serve different needs. The Connect model is the most basic, using a certified session border controller to link Teams Phone to the contact center platform, enabling simple call transfers. Agents do not require a Teams Phone license. The Extend model uses Teams Phone for all call management, with the contact center platform sitting on top to provide additional features like routing and analytics. In this model, agents need a Teams Phone license.
The Unify model is a native cloud-based solution where contact center providers build their platforms on Azure using Teams Phone extensibility APIs. This allows for a single, integrated platform with native Teams Phone integration. Like the Extend model, agents require a Teams Phone license. Unify-based solutions offer benefits such as unifying PSTN access across both platforms, which simplifies architecture and can reduce operating costs. These solutions are currently best suited for lighter-weight contact center needs, such as internal help desks, rather than complex scenarios requiring sophisticated skills-based routing or advanced workforce management.
A few vendors are currently certified for the Unify model, including AudioCodes, CentrePal, Computertalk, Heedify, Landis, and Microsoft's own Dynamics 365 Contact Center. The paper concludes with recommendations for companies to evaluate these new Unify-model solutions for potential cost savings and usability, while also understanding their current limitations. It suggests that companies should expect continued advancement in the Unify model's capabilities, especially concerning AI.

Stocks to Gain from Quantum Computing in 2025
This year has seen quantum computing being pushed from lab interests toward practical deployments. Vendors and tech giants published official updates showing progress on error correction, larger qubit systems, hybrid quantum-classical stacks and new research centers aimed at real-world use.
Google reiterated its Willow roadmap and published research on error correction and scalable chips and NVIDIA launched a dedicated “Quantum Day” and announced an Accelerated Quantum Research Center to couple AI supercomputing with quantum research. Pure plays like Rigetti highlighted multi-chip systems and new commercial availability in their quarterly results. Together, these companies have sketched a year of measurable engineering advances and growing commercialization pathways.
Below are four stocks expected to gain from quantum computing in 2025.
Microsoft
Microsoft’s first-half 2025 quantum computing-based developments center on Majorana 1 and on partnerships to scale quantum hardware and control. Earlier this year, the company unveiled Majorana 1 as a breakthrough topological-qubit processor and a measurement/control approach intended to simplify qubit control and make very large qubit counts practical, positioning Microsoft to pursue a distinct, potentially more scalable hardware path than superconducting or trapped-ion approaches.
Microsoft’s focus on developer toolchains and collaborations to accelerate scalable systems suggests the company is pushing both hardware differentiation and cloud integration as its path to commercial quantum advantage. For investors who prefer a diversified tech heavyweight’s exposure to quantum instead of startups, Microsoft’s official roadmap points to multi-front engagement.

But this industry is expanding rapidly, and so are the potential opportunities.
Elastic N.V. (ESTC -1.98%) developed a portfolio of AI software products to help businesses turn their data into useful tools for their employees and customers. Demand is climbing fast, which recently drove an acceleration in the company's revenue growth.
Elastic stock remains 54% below its 2021 record high, when a frenzy in the tech sector drove its valuation to an unsustainable level. However, the majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given the stock a buy rating, with none recommending selling, so there could be an opportunity here for investors. Let's dive in.
Helping businesses solve big-data problems
According to the International Data Corporation, around 480 exabytes of new data are created every single day. To put things in perspective, a single exabyte is one million terabytes, so it's no surprise businesses are struggling to manage this enormous pile of information, let alone extract value from it.
Elastic created an innovative tool called Elasticsearch, which sits on top of an organization's internal data. It allows employees to run simple search queries using natural language to find information, as opposed to manually digging through thousands of different documents. For example, if an employee wants to know the organization's policy on hybrid work, but can't locate the specific document, Elasticsearch can pull the information they need instantly.
Elastic created a new platform called Search AI to make the user experience even more powerful. It enables businesses to build generative AI into Elasticsearch, which leads to higher-quality responses even if queries contain fewer words or less contextual information. Plus, it can reduce the response time from minutes to milliseconds.
Search AI can also bring a unique search experience to sales channels, transforming the way customers buy products.
Let's say a customer wants to build a retaining wall in their backyard; in the past, they would use a tool like Alphabet's Google Search to figure out what products they need. But through a website powered by Search AI, the customer can enter a query like ""what tools and materials do I need to build a 100-foot-long, 4-foot-high brick retaining wall?"" The website will then return a curated list of products they can buy with a couple of clicks.
Accelerating revenue growth
Elastic generated $415 million in revenue during its fiscal 2026 first quarter (which ended on July 31). It was a 20% increase from the year-ago period, which marked an acceleration from the 16% growth the company delivered in the prior quarter three months earlier. It was also comfortably above management's forecast of $397 million.
The result was partly driven by high-spending businesses. At the end of Q1, Elastic had a record 1,550 customers with annual contract values of at least $100,000, which highlights how important its products are becoming within large, complex organizations.
Elastic managed to deliver the impressive Q1 revenue result while carefully managing costs to improve its bottom line. The company's total operating expenses increased by just 13% year over year, which was a much slower pace than the increase in its revenue. Therefore, while Elastic still lost $24.6 million on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, it was a 50% reduction from the $49.2 million net loss it generated in the year-ago period.
On a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis, which excludes one-off and non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation, Elastic was actually profitable to the tune of $64.8 million during Q1. That represented a whopping 74% increase from its year-ago result.
Wall Street is bullish on Elastic stock
The Wall Street Journal tracks 30 analysts who cover Elastic stock, and 19 have assigned it a buy rating. Three others are in the overweight (bullish) camp, while the remaining eight recommend holding. None recommend selling.
The analysts have an average price target of $119.91, which implies a potential upside of 42% over the next 12 to 18 months. But the Street-high target of $150 suggests Elastic stock could soar by 77% instead.
Based on Elastic's current valuation, I think those targets are achievable. Its stock was trading at a sky-high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of almost 30 in 2021, which was completely unsustainable. However, the company's consistent revenue growth since then, combined with the decline in the stock, has pushed its P/S ratio down to a more reasonable level of 5.7. In fact, that is close to Elastic's cheapest valuation since it went public in 2018:
According to Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management, AI could create a staggering $13 trillion opportunity in the software space by 2030 as businesses arm themselves with powerful productivity-boosting tools, which is exactly what Elastic offers. That implies a very long runway for potential growth based on the company's current revenue, so I think Wall Street's bullish consensus on this stock is justified."

- Over the next three years, 42% of firms expect to spend more than 30% of their cloud budget on generative AI, according to a survey of 215 North American IT buyers published by TD Cowen earlier this month. Nine in 10 leaders expect generative AI use cases to account for 10% of the cloud budget.
- Enterprise generative AI workloads are moving rapidly to public cloud hyperscalers such as Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Generative AI usage has increased across nearly all functions within organizations, according to TD Cowen. The survey findings revealed that IT buyers’ cloud spend on generative AI workloads will rise fourfold by 2028.
- “As more than 90% of large enterprises deploy Gen AI applications by 2028, IT leaders must prepare for higher costs tied to advanced infrastructure and new workloads,” Hardeep Singh, a principal analyst at Gartner, told CIO Dive.
Dive Insight:
As generative AI workloads increase cloud budgets, it could affect the way IT leaders manage their cloud platform costs.
CIOs are often taking a multi-pronged approach to managing spend, including negotiating commitment-based contracts with vendors to increase cost transparency and capacity guarantees, Singh said. Deployment of cost management tools also helps IT leaders track usage and optimize available resources. CIOs are increasingly turning to cost tracking practices such as FinOps to analyze cloud spend.
A key strategy includes “right-sizing cloud environments” by matching resource allocation with workload requirements and implementing autoscale strategies to adjust capacity based on demand, Singh said.
“These measures help organizations ensure efficient consumption and keep cloud spending aligned with financial goals as AI adoption accelerates,” he said.
As IT executives seek more value from their cloud products, Singh said enterprises want to go beyond basic cloud services to products tailored to their business needs. Hyperscalers are responding by investing billions into their cloud and AI buildouts.
Data sovereignty regulatory requirements are also driving demand for specialized or hybrid cloud products to ensure compliance, he added. SAP, for example, is pouring billions into building out its sovereign cloud offerings in Europe.
“Enterprises are moving beyond generic cloud services toward more industry-specific solutions that address unique regulatory and operational needs,” Singh said."

Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) has signed a deal with Nebius (NBIS, Financials) to provide computing power for internal AI development, Bloomberg reported. The agreement gives Microsoft access to more than 100,000 Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) GB300 chips.
The deal, valued at $17.4 billion over five years and expandable to $19.4 billion, is part of Microsoft's effort to manage a shortage of data center capacity. By shifting some workloads to neocloud providers such as Nebius, the company is freeing up its own infrastructure to deliver cloud services and run OpenAI models.
Microsoft has signed more than $33 billion in commitments to neocloud firms, including CoreWeave, Nscale, and Lambda. Its foundation AI models under consumer AI chief Mustafa Suleyman were trained at a CoreWeave facility in Oregon.
Scott Guthrie, who leads Microsoft's cloud division, said the surge in demand for generative AI has strained computing infrastructure. He noted that the company is in land-grab mode as it races to scale capacity.
The partnerships contrast with Amazon (AMZN, Financials) and Alphabet, which have been slower to embrace neocloud providers. Google is renting limited capacity from CoreWeave, while Amazon has not announced similar collaborations.
Microsoft continues to adjust its infrastructure roadmap, pausing or shifting projects as it balances regulatory requirements and regional capacity needs."

With lingering caution over the Chinese economy and cutthroat market competition, short bets on Alibaba spiked last month. But a share price that’s still relatively attractive and low investment levels among global funds are seen leaving room for a prolonged rally.
“We expect this underweight position to change,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at Gam Investment Management who still sees “significant upside” in Alibaba. “The sentiment could also be fueled by the fear of missing out following the strong share price rally.”
The stock is still in a deep hole versus its 2020 peak following a yearslong selloff on regulatory crackdowns, internal upheaval and faltering Chinese consumption. Domestic price wars in the food-delivery space that briefly interrupted the recent rebound remain a concern as well.
It’s trading at about 22 times estimated forward earnings in Hong Kong, double its three-year average, though just in line with the Hang Seng Tech Index. And it’s well below Alibaba’s peak level of 29 times, and current multiples for Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
“I don’t think anyone will be calling Alibaba’s valuation egregious anytime soon,” said Richard Clode, who manages Janus Henderson’s $6 billion Global Technology Leaders Fund in London. “That’s likely why many global investors feel more comfortable entering here.”
Shares rose as much as 1.7% Friday to the highest level since August 2021, bucking declines in the broader Hong Kong market.
A key question for investors is how much richer a valuation does Alibaba deserve. AI stock valuations worldwide have been raising some eyebrows once again on concerns that services have yet to go mainstream and earn big revenues.
China AI Leader
One of the major drivers for stocks of late has been how much companies plan to spend on developing their AI businesses: the more the better."

David Risher, the current CEO of Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT), recently shared a bold career move he made in 1996 that earned him a scathing rebuke from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates.
Gates Questions Risher’s Unconventional Move To Amazon
In a recent episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, Risher recounted a conversation with Gates in 1996. At that time, Risher was a successful employee at Microsoft when he decided to leave for a new startup called Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.
Gates was not shy about expressing his opinion on Risher’s decision. “You mean to tell me you’re leaving this company for some tiny, little internet bookstore that nobody’s ever heard of... that has got to be the stupidest decision I’ve ever heard anyone made,” Risher quoted Gates as saying.
Risher's Bold Choices Fuel Lyft's Comeback With Customer Focus
Despite Gates’ strong words, Risher was drawn to the opportunity at Amazon. Reflecting on the decision, Risher admitted it wasn’t “entirely rational,” but it marked a significant turning point in his career. Today, he is tasked with scripting a “comeback story” for ride-sharing company, Lyft Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT).
Lyft CEO Risher, who took over in 2023, is focusing on a customer-first approach to revive the company, which had lost market share and profitability. He works undercover as a driver to understand rider and driver experiences, leading to innovations like the ""Price Lock"" feature and a 70% earnings guarantee for drivers, boosting driver preference over competitors.

Gates-Bezos Come Together For Robotics
Risher’s leap to Amazon came at a time when the company was still a startup. His decision was influenced by Bezos’s customer-focused approach, a principle that has been a cornerstone of Amazon’s success. Bezos’s philosophy of obsessing over customers and thinking long-term has helped Amazon grow into a $2.3 trillion company today.
Interestingly, both Gates and Bezos have shown interest in the robotics startup FieldAI. This shared interest suggests that despite their differences, both tech moguls recognize the potential of emerging technologies."

With Rental Registries, Cities Seek to Close Data Gap With Landlords
Global companies — especially big tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. — have been trying to secure clean-power sources to decarbonize their supply chains. Corporate PPAs, which are long-term contracts between buyers and sellers for renewable sources like solar and wind, have become a popular tool. In 2024, the volume of such deals from offsite energy sources increased in the Asia-Pacific region by 51% from the year before to 10.3 gigawatts, according to BloombergNEF data.
The three solar projects linked to Microsoft’s PPAs with Shizen have completed project financing, and are located in Japan’s Kyushu and Chugoku regions in the nation’s west, the person said. One of the projects is operating while the others are under construction, according to the person.
Microsoft signed its first long-term renewable deal in Japan in 2023, also with Shizen. The company has a target of cutting more carbon than it emits by 2030, and its contracted volume of clean power has increased 18-fold since 2020, according to its latest sustainability report.
Shizen was founded in 2011 in the wake of Fukushima nuclear disaster as Japan geared toward expanding solar and wind power. It had developed 1.2 gigawatts worth of projects globally as of 2024, and most recently signed a PPA with Alphabet Inc.’s Google for its data center in Chiba prefecture.

They Sold Their Last Real Estate Company for Nearly $1B — Now They're Building the Future of U.S. Industrial Growth
Intel CEO Tan Says Corintis Is Becoming Industry Leader With 10,000 Systems Deployed
The Switzerland-based company emerged from stealth with a solution to one of AI's most pressing limitations: heat. Corintis says it has already manufactured over 10,000 cooling systems with deployments running in data centers on leading-edge AI chips.
Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent adoption of liquid cooling for its latest generations of data center graphics processing units highlighted this key demand.
“Cooling is one of the biggest challenges for next-generation chips,” Tan said in the statement. “Corintis is fast becoming the industry leader in advanced semiconductor cooling solutions to address the thermal bottleneck, as made evident by its growing customer list.”
Microsoft Collaboration Proves 3X Cooling Performance Gain Works at Scale
Microsoft announced on Sept. 23 that it successfully developed an in-chip microfluidic cooling system for servers running core services in collaboration with Corintis. Tests showed microfluidic cooling embedded inside the chip removed heat three times better than the most advanced technology commonly used today.

Cooling today is not adapted to the chip, relying on simplistic designs where several parallel fins are carved into a block of copper with a blade.”
Van Erp added: ""Thermal engineers need to pull a rabbit out of a hat on a daily basis to make sure chips don’t overheat and break, and that’s where Corintis comes in. Our mission is to unlock 10x better cooling to enable the future of compute, in a short cycle time, and while leveraging the existing infrastructure investments in a data center today.”"

The AI cloud infrastructure company reinvented itself, transitioning from a crypto mining company by repurposing its GPUs to provide AI computing power to customers like Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI.
With the AI boom in full swing, that business model has led to jaw-dropping growth. In its second quarter, its revenue jumped 206% to $1.21 billion, showing how fast demand for its services is ramping up.
Now, CoreWeave just got another shot in the arm as the stock jumped 12% on Tuesday after announcing another blockbuster deal, this time with Meta Platforms (META 1.20%).
What's happening with CoreWeave and Meta?
Meta is committing to spend up to $14.2 billion through 2032 on cloud computing capacity from CoreWeave, with an option to expand its commitment.
The deal comes at a time when Meta has been ramping up its spending on AI, seeing it as a must-win for its future. In June, Meta acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data-labeling start-up, and poached its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to run its new AI lab.
On the same day that the CoreWeave news came out, Meta also announced that it's buying the chip start-up Rivos, which designs chips based on RISC-V architecture, an alternative to those used by leading CPU architecture designers Arm, Intel, and AMD. Rivos is also expected to help Meta build out full-stack AI systems.
For CoreWeave, the deal builds on the earlier momentum it earned when it signed an expanded $6.5 billion agreement with OpenAI in September, bringing its total contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.
The drumbeat of positive news for AI includes rival Nebius's $17 billion deal with Microsoft, Oracle's huge cloud computing forecast, and CoreWeave's own wins, including OpenAI, Meta, and a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia, in which it will buy any of CoreWeave's unused capacity, effectively backstopping the company's growth.
Those news items, and improving sentiment around CoreWeave, sparked a recovery in the stock last month. After falling by more than 50% from its peak in June, CoreWeave jumped more than 50% off its lows early in September.
Is CoreWeave overvalued?
CoreWeave is a challenging stock to value. The company is delivering phenomenal top-line growth, but it's also reporting huge losses. The company's business model is risky. It's borrowing billions of dollars to buy Nvidia GPUs and build out the infrastructure to provide next-generation AI computing.
That high-interest debt has also led CoreWeave to pay significant interest expense, set to be above $1 billion this year, essentially preventing CoreWeave from turning a profit.
For most stocks, to determine an appropriate valuation, you just look at the numbers. However, CoreWeave is in a class of its own. Given its growth rate, in which revenue is still tripling, the upside potential for the stock is tremendous, and conventional cloud computing businesses like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure have shown how profitable cloud computing can be at scale.
Rather than parsing the numbers for CoreWeave to determine whether the stock is overvalued, investors are better off considering the future of the AI boom. If the massive capex buildout continues, including on CoreWeave's infrastructure, the stock is a good bet to be a winner. At a market cap of $66 billion, the stock still has room to move higher.
However, if the AI boom turns into a bubble and spending suddenly slows, CoreWeave is likely to plunge. While it's locked in multi-billion-dollar deals with the likes of Meta, the company will need more of those to turn profitable and justify its current valuation.
Either way, expect the volatility in the stock to continue."

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Joseph Shaposhnik from Rainwater Equity explained in a latest program on Schwab Network that MSFT is among the best names to benefit from AI. Here is how he made the case of the software giant:
“We’ve owned Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) because it certainly is one of the most recurring revenue businesses on Earth and clearly is benefiting and is really in the catbird seat when it comes to benefiting from AI. It is using all of the technology that AI has enabled to improve its products, reduce its costs, and obviously grow substantially on the Azure side of their business. So we think Microsoft will continue to be able to add innovations and co-pilot like products to its suite, price up its product and continue to grow its unit volumes on the Microsoft 365 side. What is unbelievable is I don’t know anybody that doesn’t have Microsoft 365 or Office and yet Micr Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) osoft is growing its units and seat count at 6 to 8% a year despite the fact that almost everybody on Earth has access to it, but clearly there’s still opportunity to access individuals that are not subscribers yet. So Microsoft is growing its customer base. It’s growing its prices. It’s increasing prices over the years as it adds innovation and it is obviously clearly a huge AI beneficiary.”

Brown Advisory Large-Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a global leader in software and cloud services, saw its shares trade higher in the second quarter following an earnings report and guidance update that exceeded consensus expectations. The company delivered strong performance across all business segments, with particularly robust growth in both core and AI-related Azure services. Management’s outlook for Azure remains especially positive, citing rising customer demand for AI solutions.”

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after a share sale catapulted OpenAI to a staggering $500 billion valuation, making it the world's most valuable startup and fueling broad optimism for artificial intelligence.
The deal involved current and former employees selling approximately $6.6 billion in stock to investors, including Thrive Capital and SoftBank. This landmark valuation is having a ripple effect across the market, bolstering investor confidence in the entire AI ecosystem. The enthusiasm has helped propel the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the broader S&P 500 to record highs, as investors increasingly see the technology sector as the primary driver of market growth.

Teladoc’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 5.5% on the news that a steeper-than-anticipated drop in U.S. consumer confidence raised alarms about future consumer spending.
The Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in September, its lowest reading since April. The decline was attributed to growing pessimism among Americans regarding inflation and a weakening job market. This data is particularly concerning for companies reliant on discretionary spending, such as those in online retail, travel, and the gig economy, as reports suggest a bleak consumer outlook could curb spending on non-essential items and services. The survey's Expectations Index, a measure of short-term outlook, has remained below a key threshold that often signals a future recession, adding to investor concerns about the economic landscape."

Zooming In On Lyft (LYFT)
Lyft’s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 4.6% on the news that Mizuho initiated coverage on the company with a Neutral rating and a $24 price target.
A ""Neutral"" rating often suggested that an analyst believed the stock was fairly valued with limited potential for significant gains. This lack of a strong ""buy"" signal from a new analyst covering the stock appeared to weigh on investor sentiment. Adding to this view, MoffettNathanson LLC also maintained its own neutral recommendation on Lyft's shares. While MoffettNathanson did raise its price target to $20 from $16, the prevailing neutral stance from the analysts seemed to have prompted the sell-off.
Lyft is up 65.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $22.60 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $22.93 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Lyft’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $817.77.

Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.
The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday.
The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015.
But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas.
“Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.”
He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that ""over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.”
Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos.
OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang.
OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose."

The jump comes as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were little changed.
The stock of the artificial intelligence (AI) data center company is getting a boost from comments from Microsoft's chief technical officer (CTO) at a conference this week. The CTO, Kevin Scott, made clear that even after all of the data center building in the last few years, there is still a significant gulf left between what companies like his want and what is available.
Demand is still red hot for AI data centers
Just a month after inking a major deal with CoreWeave that will use its primary data center's full capacity, investors were encouraged by Scott's comments that the industry can't get enough AI computing capacity and that calling it a ""massive crunch is probably an understatement.""
The opportunity for Applied Digital and other AI data center builders is enormous, but so are the risks. The company already carries a significant debt load and will have to borrow more at high rates or dilute its shareholders through stock sales. If AI demand lags, things could turn south.
The risks are too great here, and I would stay away from Applied Digital stock -- and CoreWeave stock as well, for that matter."

Enterprises that once ran small pilot projects are now rolling out real deployments, and the capital flowing into related infrastructure, security, and applications is expanding quickly. The focus is moving beyond a handful of chip leaders toward the companies building specialized capacity and real use cases.
October is a key month, with Q3 earnings reports starting and IT budgets locking in for 2026. Three AI stocks stand out: CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%), a GPU cloud provider emerging as a credible alternative to the hyperscalers; Nebius (NBIS -1.73%), an infrastructure dark horse that just secured Microsoft as an anchor client; and SoundHound AI (SOUN 2.59%), a conversational AI platform starting to scale commercial adoption.
Here is a brief overview of these three top AI stocks.
1. The hyperscaler alternative
CoreWeave has become one of the most significant independent providers of GPU cloud power. In September, the company expanded its OpenAI contract by $6.5 billion, which brought total 2025 commitments to about $22.4 billion, and it also signed a $14.2 billion compute deal with Meta Platforms that extends through 2031.
Taken together, the agreements add up to nearly $37 billion in bookings, a remarkable achievement for a company competing directly against Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Unlike those larger cloud providers that package GPUs as just one of many offerings, CoreWeave is dedicated solely to high-performance AI infrastructure.
The decision by OpenAI and Meta to rely on the same independent supplier underscores how limited GPU availability has become. Multiyear contracts of this size give the company unusual visibility into future revenue streams and suggest strong confidence in its ability to deliver.
The obstacles are substantial, including heavy capital demands, the need for rapid expansion, and dependence on a few massive customers. Even so, demand for alternatives to the big three cloud players has already lifted CoreWeave into the center of the AI infrastructure market.
2. From zero to Microsoft partner
Nebius stunned the AI infrastructure world with a multibillion-dollar deal when it secured a $17.4 billion agreement with Microsoft to supply GPU capacity over five years, with the option to expand the total to $19.4 billion. This move transformed Nebius from a little-known player into a direct competitor for large cloud contracts.
Nebius claims it can deliver GPU compute more efficiently, with pricing 20% to 25% below traditional providers, leveraging optimized data center design and power efficiency. If Nebius demonstrates it can scale with Microsoft's specs or secures another large client, Wall Street could rerate its valuation quickly. The terms of the Microsoft deal alone give Nebius a rare valuation bridge to growth peers -- though execution risk looms large in this capital-intensive business.
3. Voice AI hits its moment
SoundHound AI is bringing conversational interfaces into the mainstream. The company reported $42.7 million in revenue for Q2 2025, a 217% increase from the prior year. Non-GAAP gross margin reached 58.4%, while automotive partners such as Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis continue to embed its technology across millions of vehicles. In restaurants, brands like Chipotle and White Castle are already using SoundHound's platform to automate drive-through ordering.
Recurring usage fees and subscriptions provide visibility once deployments are in place, though profitability remains out of reach. SoundHound posted a GAAP net loss of $74.7 million in Q2 and a non-GAAP (adjusted) net loss of $11.9 million.
Still, with a market capitalization of more than $6 billion, investors are valuing the company as a serious mid-cap contender in the AI space. At current growth rates, analysts expect operating leverage to improve and a potential path to breakeven within two years, making SoundHound a leading independent player in conversational AI."

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 3.8% in the afternoon session after reports surfaced that the company was in early talks with its competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), about a potential deal to manufacture chips for them.
The potential deal was viewed as a major vote of confidence in Intel's push to build its foundry business, which makes chips for other companies. A partnership would be significant because AMD, a fierce competitor, has historically relied on Taiwan's TSMC for manufacturing its chips. For Intel, securing its main rival as a customer would validate its manufacturing technology and its ambition to compete with global foundry leaders. For AMD, the arrangement could provide a US-based production alternative and increase its bargaining power with other suppliers.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $37.33, up 3.9% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 36 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% as an analyst note from Deutsche Bank tempered investor enthusiasm, leading to some profit-taking.
The bank reiterated a ""hold"" rating on the stock. While it raised its price target to $30 from a previous $23, the new target remained below the level where the shares were trading. The cautious view gave investors a reason to sell and lock in gains, especially after the stock had a strong rally through September. The move also came as the broader market showed weakness amid concerns over a potential government shutdown.
Intel is up 84.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $37.33 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $731.86.
Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link."

He is recognized for translating complex technologies into customer-centric solutions and building high-performing product teams.

Trained on proprietary, brand-specific data, BlueOcean delivers 97% improvement in operational efficiency while unleashing exponentially more time for creativity–from strategy through execution
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BlueOcean today announced the launch of an innovative marketing-specific agentic AI platform, designed to give brand leaders–from the C-suite to marketing practitioners–instant, contextual insights that fuel creativity and accelerate decision-making.
Built by marketers for marketers, the platform combines five years of proprietary data across more than 3,000 sources with purpose-built agents to deliver clarity where generic AI falls short. Early adopters at AWS, Cisco, Databricks, Intel, Microsoft, Roche and SAP have already reported up to a 97% improvement in operational efficiency, freeing teams to shift focus from manual reporting to bold, creative strategy.
A recent MIT report found that 95% of generative AI pilots are failing, but these ""failures"" are actually crucial steps in organizational learning–and measuring value only by short-term revenue misses the broader impact. Success depends on three fundamentals: integrating AI into workflows, ensuring data readiness and investing in change management.
BlueOcean embeds these fundamentals into its platform by combining five years of proprietary brand data with purpose-built agents. The result: contextual, actionable insights that not only improve efficiency but also give marketers the confidence to move faster and more creatively.
BlueOcean has developed Spark™, an enterprise-ready, multi-agentic intelligence engine built to enable marketers to instantly answer questions like:
-
How did my ad spend last quarter track to brand awareness, compared to my top 3 competitors?
-
What key activities are my competitors using to grow?
-
Was there a moment last year where my brand took a hit–if so, when and why?
BlueOcean not only answers these questions but also presents enterprise-ready, actionable data so teams can immediately begin formulating their next strategic action or campaign. Brands can view their live BlueScore™, a cumulative assessment of five key factors of brand reputation, and dive into each factor to see how their awareness, distinctiveness, consistency, impact, and trust are shifting over time and compare against competitors.
""When clients see the platform in action, they immediately recognize the impact: weeks of work reduced to minutes and insights ready to fuel creativity,"" said Liza Nebel, Co-founder, President and COO of BlueOcean. ""Our purpose-built agents are like a team of creative strategists always on and ready to go. Instead of waiting weeks and spending thousands on traditional one-off reports, marketers can ask direct questions such as 'What themes make our brand most distinct in this category?'—and instantly receive context-aware insights."""

The ""we should keep an eye on that"" news is that it's now historically pricey, which leaves it more susceptible to a pullback if investor sentiment quickly shifts (which isn't far-fetched).
Despite the priciness of the current market, one stock remains a no-brainer buy: Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%). The stock is up over 22% year to date through Sept. 26 and flirting with its all-time high, which it reached in early August.
A good amount of the market's growth, based on the S&P 500, has come from tech stocks skyrocketing in valuation due to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, of which Microsoft is a part, now account for over one-third of the S&P 500. That's not ideal from a diversification perspective.
Microsoft stands out as a no-brainer amid the current environment due to the diversity of its business compared to most other companies, regardless of industry. I like to refer to Microsoft as the tech Swiss Army knife because it touches so many different parts of the tech world. It has enterprise and consumer productivity software (Excel, Word, Teams, etc.); a thriving cloud platform (Azure); hardware (PCs, tablets, accessories); gaming (Xbox); professional networking (LinkedIn); and search/advertising (Bing).
While other tech companies' valuations may be propped up by the recent AI hype, Microsoft's diversified business ensures it remains reliable even if/when the AI hype fades, and if one or a couple segments lag, Microsoft has plenty of others that can hold their own weight. This doesn't mean it can't experience down periods; however, in the long term, it's in a great position."

AI initially fueled dizzying rallies in chipmakers and software firms. Then, as the power demands became clear, a boom in shares of utilities and builders of data centers. Now, investors are moving further afield in search of beneficiaries from the hundreds of billions of dollars flowing into the build-out of the AI economy.
“You just saw a market that was thirsty for non-Magnificent Seven winners regarding, effectively, the information economy or the digital economy,” said Brian Sponheimer, a portfolio manager at Gamco Investors Inc.’s Gabelli.
Shares of Caterpillar surged 14% in September, the best month since December 2023. The rally brought the stock’s year-to-date gain to 32%, far outstripping the 17% gain in the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index and the 19% advance in the cohort of the seven top US tech giants.
The stock advanced another 0.8% on Wednesday, with investors seemingly unperturbed after news that Dutch pension fund ABP had sold a €387 million ($455 million) stake in the company amid backlash over links to Israel’s war in Gaza.
The surge wasn’t entirely predicated on Caterpillar’s turbines business. The shares had slumped after the company warned at the end of August that it expects tariffs to cost it as much as $1.8 billion this year, crimping profit margins. But the manufacturer has a record backlog of nearly $40 billion as of the end of June, softening the blow from higher costs for steel and aluminum. It also stands to pay lower taxes thanks to Congress’s spending bill. The Federal Reserve’s first rate cut this year helped, as well.
The September rally, though, gained momentum after Oracle Corp. delivered a unexpectedly robust forecast for its cloud computing business — a unit that will require massive amounts of electricity and processing power. To meet that kind of demand from the tech sector, investors are betting, Caterpillar’s turbines will be needed. The company’s shares jumped in eight of the nine trading sessions after Oracle’s forecast."

The strategy is aimed at coping with a shortage of AI data center capacity and letting Microsoft free up its own server farms to provide lucrative AI services to customers.
This is just one of a string of deals Microsoft has struck with so-called neoclouds — a new category of small infrastructure providers that lease out AI-focused computing power. Microsoft has inked more than $33 billion in commitments to such providers, including Nebius, CoreWeave Inc., Nscale and Lambda. The deals demonstrate the company’s growing willingness to use relative newcomers for important infrastructure.
Cloud vendors have generally operated their own data centers, but Microsoft is struggling to bring sufficient computing capacity online. Renting access to servers from neoclouds speeds things up since they have already solved logistical challenges including obtaining sufficient power and chips.
“We are in very much land-grab mode in the AI space,” said Scott Guthrie, who leads Microsoft’s cloud efforts. “We’ve made the decision that we don’t want to be constrained in terms of capacity.”
Nebius shares were up about 5.5% at 10:17 a.m. in New York, while Microsoft was mostly unchanged. Nebius and the other neocloud firms declined to comment.
The advent of power-guzzling generative AI has put enormous strain on data center infrastructure. So Microsoft is freeing up capacity in its own data centers for cloud clients by running some computing for internal and OpenAI work at neocloud facilities, Guthrie said.
For example, the first foundation AI models built under consumer AI chief Mustafa Suleyman were trained at a CoreWeave data center near Portland, Oregon, according to people familiar with the work."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-02T09:20:00,3 Red-Hot Growth Stocks to Buy in 2025,Investing in AI leaders could be a smart move.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=40b60d897fa7b2fee13009445deba3ece96b7bb861ef5320a1d26cd9c601321b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-red-hot-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-red-hot-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/02/3-red-hot-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-2025/,fool.com,200,,"The market's obsession with artificial intelligence (AI) isn't fading, and the technology could help reshape how businesses operate in the future. As such, it could be a smart move to invest in some of the top companies leading the AI charge.
Let's look at three red-hot growth stocks to buy this year.
1. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) is best known as a networking hardware company, but the bigger story is how it has become the go-to name for custom AI chips.
As companies try to save money on AI computing costs, more and more are turning to Broadcom to help them develop custom chips, called ASICs, that can reduce inference costs. While ASICs are non-programmable, and thus lack the flexibility of graphics processing units (GPUs), they tend to have better performance and more efficiency for the specific task for which they've been designed.
Broadcom scored a huge victory when it helped Alphabet develop its highly successful tensor processing units (TPUs), which now power a lot of its Google Cloud business. This opened the door for more design wins with Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) and TikTok owner ByteDance. Combined, Broadcom believes these three customers have the potential to be a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity by its fiscal 2027.
And the company got even more good news when it announced a fourth customer (largely believed to be OpenAI) has placed a $10 billion order for next year. Add in that Broadcom is also working with Apple on its own custom AI chips, and the opportunity in front of it is just huge.
On top of that, Broadcom's networking gear is also seeing greater demand as data centers need to move huge AI workloads at high speed. In addition, its VMware virtualization business is seeing strong momentum, as enterprise customers are turning to its solutions to help run a hybrid cloud strategy to power their AI workloads.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms has gone from being written off as a slow-growth social media stock to one of the biggest AI winners. The company figured out how to use AI to keep users glued to Instagram and Facebook by feeding them more of the content they want to see, which in turn creates more ad slots to sell. That simple dynamic powered a 22% jump in ad revenue last quarter, driven by both more impressions and higher ad pricing as advertisers get better returns.
The exciting part is that Meta is just beginning to serve ads on WhatsApp and Threads. WhatsApp alone has 3 billion users and is barely monetized today. Threads, meanwhile, is still in its infancy and has a long runway of growth.
At the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not pulling back on big swings, pouring billions into AI talent and infrastructure to build what he calls ""personal superintelligence."" He's also pushing the company into consumer smart glasses and is still building his metaverse. If any of these bets hit, they could move the needle in a big way over the next few years.
The combination of strong current growth together with potential upside from new products is exactly what makes Meta a stock a buy.
3. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) proved with AI that it can still move quickly when it sees a big opportunity. Its early investment and partnership with OpenAI gave it a head start rolling out Copilot AI assistants across its Office suite, and that has turned into a meaningful new revenue stream.
That said, the bigger story is with its cloud computing unit, Azure. Cloud revenue surged 39% last quarter and likely would have been even higher if not for running up against capacity limits. The company has been pouring capital into GPUs and servers to meet that demand, which is helping fuel strong growth. Azure has become the go-to platform for companies that want both the most advanced AI models and newest infrastructure to run their AI workloads on.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's investment in OpenAI continues to give it preferred access to the company's strong AI technology.
With productivity tools that are deeply embedded in the corporate world and a cloud platform that is on the rise, Microsoft is one of the few tech giants that has both sides of the enterprise AI opportunity covered. That combination puts it in a good position to see strong growth both this year and beyond."

2 Great AI Stocks to Buy in October and Hold for 10 Years
Artificial intelligence spending is fueling the Wall Street bull market as big tech bets big on power-hungry AI data centers and beyond. The AI hyperscalers, including Amazon, Meta, and others, are projected to spend roughly $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone. Global data center infrastructure spending is expected to reach $7 trillion by 2030.
There is no end in sight to the wave of AI spending that extends to energy and grid infrastructure because generative AI platforms like ChatGPT use 10X the energy of an average Google search.
The two AI-related stocks we dive into today are not the tech stocks most associated with AI, such as Nvidia. Nonetheless, Constellation Energy and Arista Networks benefit directly from the AI megatrend that’s poised to dominate Wall Street in the back-half of the decade and beyond.
Let’s dive into why investors should buy CEG and ANET now before possible breakouts in October and the fourth quarter. Both AI-boosted stocks are also long-term buy-and-hold candidates.
Nuclear Energy Stock Constellation is a Must-Buy AI Winner
Constellation Energy is at the forefront of the growing relationship between big tech and nuclear energy. CEG earned 20-year power purchase agreements with Microsoft and Meta over the last year to support their AI expansion efforts.
The largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator is ready to transform into one of the energy industry titans of the AI age through Constellation’s $27 billion deal to buy natural gas and geothermal powerhouse Calpine.
CEG’s acquisition, which is expected to close in Q4, creates the largest clean energy firm and expands Constellation’s footprint into power-hungry, tech-heavy Texas and California.
Constellation stock is poised to be one of the most surefire long-term winners in the AI-driven energy age as the U.S. government aims to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and AI hyperscalers go all-in on nuclear and natural gas.
It’s poised to power large swaths of the economy and AI data centers via CEG’s established portfolio of reliable 24/7 power. Constellation is also expanding into next-gen small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), where it competes against pre-revenue home-run stocks such as Oklo.
Constellation raised its dividend by 10% in 2025 and 25% in 2024 as part of a plan to consistently boost its payout to shareholders. The nuclear energy powerhouse is expected to grow its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 9% in 2025 and 27% in 2026."

The proliferation of artificial intelligence has led to an explosion of demand for cloud hyperscalers, where Amazon Web Services has the biggest market share. It’s followed by Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud Platform, with Oracle’s huge growth suggesting there’s a fourth major player on the field. CoreWeave Inc. is also garnering investor attention.
The scope of Amazon’s challenge becomes clear in its dwindling stock market valuation. At roughly 25 times expected earnings over the next 12 months compared with 27 times for the Nasdaq 100 Index, Amazon is close to its biggest discount to the tech-heavy benchmark on record. Oracle, on the other hand, is trading at 40 times estimated earnings, near its highest P/E ratio since the dot-com era, while Microsoft trades at nearly 32 times, above its 10-year average.
Alphabet shares are trading for 22 times forward earnings, a modest premium to the company’s long-term average. Although that’s less than Amazon’s multiple, the gap used to be much wider.
Amazon shares dipped 0.6% on Thursday while Alphabet gained 0.1% and Oracle gained 1.7%. Microsoft was little changed.
While the overall expansion of the cloud services market means there may be room for everyone to co-exist, the rising competition is troubling for Amazon since AWS accounted for more than half of operating profit in the second quarter. In late July, the company reported cloud revenue growth that lagged far behind Microsoft and Alphabet, and it gave a weaker-than-expected forecast for operating income.
“Q2 provided the first warning signal that AWS is falling behind Azure when it comes to winning AI work flows, but they are falling behind Oracle and CoreWeave to an even greater extent,” said Clare Pleydell-Bouverie, co-manager of the Liontrust Global Innovation Team in London, which manages roughly $1.3 billion.
These companies will likely remain industry leaders over the coming years, but Amazon may start coming up short by comparison, she added. “We’re not seeing that same AI induced acceleration in their backlog.”"

Chicago, IL – October 2, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT.
Is Apple Stock About to Break Out?
After stumbling out of the gate this year, sliding more than 30% in the first four months, Apple has staged an impressive comeback. Over the past three months, the stock has outpaced nearly every other tech giant, trailing only Alphabet.
Earlier in the year, skeptics pointed to Apple’s lackluster AI strategy and slower growth compared with rivals like Microsoft and Alphabet. But a strong Q3 report, highlighted by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales and record services revenue, has helped the company reclaim leadership. The latest iPhone launch has also fueled optimism, delivering meaningful upgrades across the product line, including the new iPhone Air.
At the same time, Apple is signaling a more deliberate approach to AI, committing $500 billion in US investments tied to artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and data centers. Additionally, rather than racing to build its own standalone AI model, Apple may be positioning itself as a strategic partner in the broader AI ecosystem and leveraging its strong position in eyeball real estate with mobile devices.
With strong momentum behind it, Apple now looks poised for a technical breakout that could carry shares to fresh record highs. Below, I’ll break down the trade setup.
Apple Stock Forms Bull Flag
In recent months, Apple’s price action has resembled that of a classic growth stock, climbing steadily higher. Over the past two weeks, shares have been consolidating into an increasingly tight bull flag, which typically signals an imminent breakout.
The key level to watch is $257. A decisive breakout and close above this resistance would confirm the bull flag and likely propel Apple to new record highs.
Today’s session briefly pushed above $257 before reversing back into the range, underscoring why it’s important to wait for a closing confirmation rather than intraday moves. On the downside, a close below support at $253.50 would suggest the stock needs more time to reset before attempting another leg higher.
Are Apple Shares Overvalued?
Concerns about Apple’s valuation are valid. The stock is trading at an elevated multiple while sales are expected to grow only in the mid–single digits. That said, Apple still commands an extraordinary position with over 1.5 billion iPhone users and a rapidly expanding services business. It’s also worth noting that nearly all Mega cap tech stocks are trading at premium valuations."

The Street was quick to hammer the stock because he didn’t say that.

But he had been in talks with a man named Jeff Bezos, who was running a brand-new startup called Amazon. When Risher decided to leave the tech giant to join the fledgling online retailer, Gates himself sent an email and called him into his office.
“He says, ‘Hold on for a second. You mean to tell me you’re leaving this company for some tiny, little internet bookstore that nobody’s ever heard of … that has got to be the stupidest decision I’ve ever heard anyone made,'” Risher recalled.
While Risher admitted the move wasn’t “entirely rational,” he said he was drawn to the opportunity. He had first connected with Bezos a year earlier, when the Amazon founder was conducting a reference check. What ultimately convinced Risher to take the leap was Bezos’s intense focus on the customer. “He was very customer-obsessed,” Risher said, noting Bezos’s logic that on the internet, “everyone is one click away from somebody else, so you have to create a great customer experience.” (In fact, Bezos’s management style stressed to Amazonians that they should approach every day from a “day one” mindset.)
Bezos also laid out a compellingly ambitious vision: to grow the then-$15.6 million business into a billion-dollar company by the year 2000. Risher, an avid reader, was captivated by the chance to build something new at the “crazy intersection of technology and culture.” He joined Amazon as its 37th employee, tasked with helping build the “everything store” by adding music, video, and toy categories. The company hit its billion-dollar target a year early, in 1999. The move paid off so well that a “Thank You” letter from Bezos to Risher, dated February 2002, remains on Amazon’s website to this day."

Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) is looking to take more control over the chips powering its data centers, saying it wants to rely mainly on its own silicon in the future as demand for artificial intelligence shows no sign of slowing.
Speaking at Italian Tech Week, Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott said Microsoft has been using a mix of Nvidia and AMD processors, but is steadily building out its own lineup, including the Maia AI Accelerator and Cobalt CPU launched last year. The goal, he said, is to have more freedom to design systems end to end from chips to networks to cooling so they can run AI workloads more efficiently.
We will literally entertain anything in order to ensure we've got enough capacity to meet this demand, Scott said, but he added that over time, Microsoft expects its own chips to take the lead.
Like Google and Amazon, Microsoft has been investing heavily in custom semiconductors to reduce reliance on outside suppliers and to fine-tune performance for AI tasks. The strategy comes as the industry faces what Scott called a massive crunch in computing power.
Even our most ambitious forecasts are turning out to be insufficient on a regular basis, he said. We've deployed an incredible amount of capacity over the past year, and it still isn't enough.
Tech giants including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are on track to spend more than $300 billion this year on AI-related infrastructure. For Microsoft, much of that will go toward ensuring its data centers can keep up with the explosive growth in demand."

Shares of the company closed at $32.53 versus an IPO price of $21. Fermi sold 32.5 million shares after pricing them within a marketed range of $18 to $22.
The trading gave the Amarillo, Texas-based REIT, which was co-founded by former US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, a market value of about $19.3 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. The company’s shares debuted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on Wednesday and are expected to begin trading on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday.
The onset of AI revived interest in companies that produce power, and investors have driven up shares for firms including NRG Energy Inc. and Vistra Corp. on hopes that they’re effective proxies for the booming technology. Fermi is the latest to get a boost, even though it hasn’t generated any revenue since its formation in January.
“There are limited ways to play the AI energy demand angle,” said Morningstar analyst Travis Miller. “Investors are looking for new ways to play this theme when the traditional power producers have already run up.”
Fermi’s “Project Matador” is a development-stage advanced energy and data center campus with more than 5,000 acres of land leased from Texas Tech University. Fermi also refers to the site as the President Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus.
The company hopes to draw data center and hyperscaler tenants and expects to have one gigawatt of power online by the end of next year, according to filings. By 2038, Fermi aims to have up to 11 gigawatts of power to run computing centers on-site through a mix of natural gas, solar energy and nuclear power.
Perry, who was governor of Texas prior to serving in President Donald Trump’s cabinet during his first term, is a director at Fermi. The company had a net loss of $6.37 million from its inception through the end of June, its filings show.
The public listing is a massive windfall for Fermi’s founding team. Perry owns shares worth about $540 million as of Wednesday’s close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In addition, his son Griffin independently controls a $2.4 billion stake."

finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-01T17:59:00,Is Apple Stock About to Breakout?,After a rough start to the year Apple stock has regained its leadership position,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=15837729edb1d12bcbbe02dd9dca4aad7c7aefbd5ce31d09cbb1ea9e3eb3b269,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-breakout-175900183.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-breakout-175900183.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stock-breakout-175900183.html,yahoo.com,200,,"After stumbling out of the gate this year, sliding more than 30% in the first four months, Apple (AAPL) has staged an impressive comeback. Over the past three months, the stock has outpaced nearly every other tech giant, trailing only Alphabet (GOOGL).
Earlier in the year, skeptics pointed to Apple’s lackluster AI strategy and slower growth compared with rivals like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet. But a strong Q3 report, highlighted by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales and record services revenue, has helped the company reclaim leadership. The latest iPhone launch has also fueled optimism, delivering meaningful upgrades across the product line, including the new iPhone Air.
At the same time, Apple is signaling a more deliberate approach to AI, committing $500 billion in US investments tied to artificial intelligence, silicon engineering, and data centers. Additionally, rather than racing to build its own standalone AI model, Apple may be positioning itself as a strategic partner in the broader AI ecosystem and leveraging its strong position in eyeball real estate with mobile devices.
With strong momentum behind it, Apple now looks poised for a technical breakout that could carry shares to fresh record highs. Below, I’ll break down the trade setup.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Apple Stock Forms Bull Flag
In recent months, Apple’s price action has resembled that of a classic growth stock, climbing steadily higher. Over the past two weeks, shares have been consolidating into an increasingly tight bull flag, which typically signals an imminent breakout.
The key level to watch is $257. A decisive breakout and close above this resistance would confirm the bull flag and likely propel Apple to new record highs.
Today’s session briefly pushed above $257 before reversing back into the range, underscoring why it’s important to wait for a closing confirmation rather than intraday moves. On the downside, a close below support at $253.50 would suggest the stock needs more time to reset before attempting another leg higher.

Are Apple Shares Overvalued?
Concerns about Apple’s valuation are valid. The stock is trading at an elevated multiple while sales are expected to grow only in the mid–single digits. That said, Apple still commands an extraordinary position with over 1.5 billion iPhone users and a rapidly expanding services business. It’s also worth noting that nearly all Mega cap tech stocks are trading at premium valuations.

TORONTO, Oct. 1, 2025 /CNW/ - (CanXP AI) - Today marks a bold new chapter in Canada's AI future with the initial public release of CanXP AI (""CanXP""), the first truly Canadian AI ecosystem for everyday use. Designed for professionals, students and privacy-conscious Canadians, CanXP delivers private and affordable access to world-class intelligence under Canadian jurisdiction, ensuring knowledge stays at home and never trains external models.
This launch comes at a time when concerns over foreign AI tools are intensifying globally.
Microsoft's Copilot - a foreign agent, was reported by Concentric AI's latest data risk report to have accessed nearly three million sensitive records per organization in just six months. Unlike Copilot, CanXP is developed and hosted in Canada, on Canadian owned servers. CanXP is a sovereign alternative built to protect Canadian knowledge and restore trust.
""Canada deserves more than a seat at the AI table. We deserve our own table,"" said Vince McMullin, CEO of CanXP AI. ""We're building a Canadian owned and operated platform for all Canadians. We innovate responsibly, transparently, and with sovereignty from coast, to coast, to coast.""
An estimated 5–6 million Canadian office workers are turning to unsanctioned AI tools, what experts call ""shadow AI,"" to access models and productivity features not provided by their employers. CanXP reduces the risks of this behaviour by offering the tools and models workers want in a way enterprises can trust, helping to stem billions in national losses from compliance failures, the drain of Canadian knowledge into foreign models, and the billions paid to U.S. AI platforms each year.
To begin restoring Canada's digital sovereignty, Canada is uniting behind the $2 billion Sovereign AI Compute Strategy, guided by the Hon. Evan Solomon's national task force. CanXP.ai is proud to be part of this moment. Signup today and join the movement https://CanXP.ai.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Reddit? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Reddit’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 64 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 21 hours ago when the stock dropped 5.5% on the news that a steeper-than-anticipated drop in U.S. consumer confidence raised alarms about future consumer spending. The Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in September, its lowest reading since April. The decline was attributed to growing pessimism among Americans regarding inflation and a weakening job market. This data is particularly concerning for companies reliant on discretionary spending, such as those in online retail, travel, and the gig economy, as reports suggest a bleak consumer outlook could curb spending on non-essential items and services. The survey's Expectations Index, a measure of short-term outlook, has remained below a key threshold that often signals a future recession, adding to investor concerns about the economic landscape.
Reddit is up 25.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $208.59 per share, it is still trading 22.9% below its 52-week high of $270.71 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Reddit’s shares at the IPO in March 2024 would now be looking at an investment worth $4,135.

The company successfully tested microfluidics technology, which uses tiny channels etched directly into a chip to carry liquid coolant right where heat is generated. This approach removes heat up to three times more effectively than today’s advanced “cold plate” systems, positioning Microsoft to push its AI chips harder and outpace its rivals.
The innovation comes as AI chips grow more powerful and generate more heat. Traditional cooling methods, such as fans or cold plates, are reaching their limits, threatening to slow progress. By cooling chips directly at the silicon level, Microsoft not only reduces heat but also improves efficiency, sustainability and cost-effectiveness in its data centers.
Researchers say the technology could allow for denser server designs, more powerful AI chips and even new 3D chip architectures. If widely adopted, microfluidics could reshape how data centers are built and help Microsoft strengthen its competitive edge in the fast-growing AI market.
Cooling Innovation Becomes a Strategic Necessity
As AI chips become more powerful, they also generate unprecedented levels of heat. Traditional methods like fans and cold plates are no longer sufficient to sustain performance, threatening to create a bottleneck for future breakthroughs. This makes cooling not just a technical challenge but a strategic imperative for companies competing in the AI space.
Microsoft's microfluidics innovation directly addresses this obstacle by removing heat from the silicon layer, which is three times more effective than cold plates. Beyond performance gains, this efficiency translates into lower energy costs, improved sustainability and the potential for more compact and denser server designs. In a market where speed, scale and cost-efficiency define leadership, cooling technology has become as important as chip design.

Azure Managed Redis delivers fast, reliable data access for AI agents and applications, and critical memory capabilities to ground AI reasoning and decision making
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Redis, the world’s fastest data platform, today announced the integration of Azure Managed Redis with Microsoft Agent Framework, delivering production-ready memory infrastructure for enterprise AI agents and applications. Powered by Redis, Azure Managed Redis provides Azure developers with a native, enterprise-grade memory layer that is fast, reliable, and compliant – enabling them to build intelligent agents with greater speed and confidence.
AI agents are quickly evolving from simple chatbots to sophisticated, context-aware systems that reason, orchestrate tools, and adapt over time. Memory and context are at the heart of that transformation. Redis has co-developed Azure Managed Redis with Microsoft to give developers a unified memory platform that eliminates the need for disparate vector databases or memory services. Azure Managed Redis allows developers to take full advantage of Redis Enterprise capabilities, including the Redis Query Engine, JSON, replication, and low-latency performance, directly in Azure.
Building a Reliable Memory Layer with Azure Managed Redis
Agents are exacting when it comes to context. Not enough data can leave agents struggling to make decisions and perform tasks. Too much data can exceed context windows, causing hallucinations and increasing operating costs. Azure Managed Redis enables agents to retain context from every interaction, capturing individual preferences to build a complete understanding of each user. Over time, this creates the highly personalized and reliable experiences that will power the next generation of agentic web applications and experiences. Additional benefits include:
-
Production-Ready Scale and Reliability: Built-in active-active geo-replication, high availability, and durable storage ensure agents can scale globally while preserving context across sessions.
-
Enterprise Security and Compliance: As a first-party Azure service, Azure Managed Redis integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Entra ID, TLS, Private Endpoints, and role-based access to provide the controls and safeguards that enterprises demand.
-
Optimized for AI Latency: Azure Managed Redis delivers sub-millisecond lookups that enable real-time agent interactions that feel fluid, natural, and human-like to deliver best-in-class experiences for end users.
“The biggest limitation for agents today is the memory infrastructure that lets them do complex tasks,” said Rowan Trollope, CEO of Redis. “Making intelligent, reliable agents that are ready for production requires a memory layer that delivers the perfect amount of context, right when it’s needed. With Azure Managed Redis, we’re giving developers a ready-to-use memory layer that delivers the speed, reliability, and scale that the next generation of agents demand from enterprise data.”"

Nearly half of the analysts covering CoreWeave now have buy-equivalent ratings after at least three raised their recommendations in September. It’s a stark shift from mid-July, when less than 20% of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommended buying the stock.
The improving sentiment follows recent agreements with companies including OpenAI that quelled fears CoreWeave was too beholden to Microsoft Corp., which accounted for more than 70% of its revenue at the end of June. On Tuesday, CoreWeave said it will provide Meta Platforms Inc. with as much as $14.2 billion worth of computing power. The news sent the stock soaring, capping its best month since June with a gain of 33%.
“The Street is finally seeing the stickiness and the demand story when it comes to CoreWeave,” said Tejas Dessai, director of thematic research at Global X ETFs, which holds CoreWeave shares. “Once you get these data centers up and running, of course the demand exists, and then the infrastructure in terms of using AI compute services can be a very attractive business.”
Since its initial public offering in March that was propped up by long-time backer Nvidia Corp., CoreWeave has been one of the most controversial stocks on Wall Street. Bulls see a new breed of computing services provider that is poised to win more business as spending on AI continues to climb. For bears, it’s a cash-burning trap that’s destined to end badly when demand eventually slows.
CoreWeave shares have gained more than 230% since their debut but remain down 27% from a June peak when the market capitalization of the Livingston, New Jersey-based company briefly exceeded $88 billion. The stock fell 1.9% at 10:05 a.m. in New York trading on Wednesday.
The shares have considerable upside even after September’s run up, with strong demand expected to translate into future profits, Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note on Tuesday initiating coverage of CoreWeave with an outperform rating. The analysts’ 12-month price target is $175, implying potential for a gain of more than 25% from Tuesday’s closing price."

These AI agents are purpose-built for the profession and designed to automate complex audit and reporting tasks while maintaining transparency, accuracy, and compliance.
Disclosure Agents and Excel Agents embed directly into familiar audit workflows and address two of the most time-intensive and error-prone parts of the job: checking disclosures against IFRS/GAAP and running complex tasks in Excel.
""Disclosure Agents and Excel Agents are built to solve our customers' biggest pain points, manual testing, complex disclosures, and fragmented workflows,"" said Vidya Peters, CEO at DataSnipper. ""By embedding AI directly into the tools professionals already use, we're helping teams move faster, reduce risk, and reclaim time for higher-value work.""
Why AI Agents Matter in Audit and Finance
Audit and finance professionals face unique challenges: strict regulatory requirements, high volumes of unstructured data, and constant pressure to deliver fast, accurate results under tight deadlines. Traditional automation can speed up repetitive tasks, but it fails when judgment, structure, or context are required.
DataSnipper's AI Agents change that.
By combining the efficiency of automation with the adaptability of human-like understanding, they deliver faster turnaround on complex, compliance-heavy tasks without sacrificing accuracy. Every output is linked back to its evidence, reducing the risk of AI hallucination and errors.
The result is scalable expertise to handle fluctuating workloads and evolving standards, and more time for analysis and strategic thinking as routine processes are handled by AI.
By embedding AI Agents directly into the tools finance teams already use, DataSnipper delivers innovation that transforms audit, compliance, and financial reporting workflows without disrupting how teams operate today.
""Building on our collaboration with DataSnipper, this launch highlights how Azure OpenAI can accelerate innovation in complex, regulated environments,"" said Jaime De Mora, CTO Startups & Digital Natives at Microsoft EMEA. ""AI Agents in audit and finance are a powerful example of technology working alongside professionals to enhance quality and efficiency.
Disclosure Agents – AI That Knows IFRS and GAAP
Disclosure reviews are critical, but painfully manual. Teams spend days reviewing disclosures against IFRS, GAAP, and internal checklists, often working across disconnected tools."

SAN FRANCISCO, October 01, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Flywl, the cloud marketplace platform transforming enterprise software procurement, today announced that it is now fully transactable on Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Flywl can facilitate software transactions on Azure through Multi Party Private Offers (MPOs), enabling enterprise buyers to route spend through the Azure Marketplace and use their Azure Consumption Commitments.
This milestone expands Flywl’s hyperscaler footprint and strengthens its position as the go-to infrastructure for marketplace-native procurement.
""Becoming fully transactable on Azure expands our cloud marketplace presence and unlocks a powerful new channel for enterprise deal flow. It empowers buyers to procure with precision, transact on their terms, and maximize every dollar of their cloud commitment,"" said Ankur Srivastava, CEO of Flywl.
MPOs allow Microsoft customers to purchase software solutions through Azure Marketplace while distributing payment to multiple parties, including ISVs, resellers, and partners. For organizations with Azure Consumption Commitment agreements, these transactions count toward their committed spend with no annual caps—a significant distinction from other marketplaces.
This Azure activation marks a key step in Flywl’s broader strategy to support multi-cloud procurement across hyperscalers, enabling faster, finance-aligned software transactions wherever enterprise buyers choose to transact.
About Flywl

Boosted by hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), AI spending could reach $2.8 Trillion by 2029. For more live coverage of markets watch the full episode of Market Sunrise and head to Yahoo Finance.
Is AI a bubble about to burst? Well, many analysts are still saying AI is a strong buy.
Yes, valuations have risen to sky high levels and questions are growing as many AI software stocks have started showing some cracks in recent weeks.
But the huge demand for AI infrastructure is only set to grow further. That's according to many bulls, including analysts at City and Jeffries.
City Group is out with a new forecast saying Big Tech's AI spending is not slowing down anytime soon.
They now see infrastructure spending climbing past $2.8 trillion by 2029.
That's half a trillion more than they were estimating just a few months ago. Why?
Hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are racing to build data centers and secure more compute power with AI capital expenditures projected projected to hit $490 billion by 2026 alone.
And almost every company in the world right now is looking into how to embed AI tools into their operations.
Also, keep in mind that nations around the world from the US to China to Europe are all investing to be more self-sufficient in AI infrastructure.
Just today, the US and Taiwan are negotiating over who should be building more chips.
So, what are the companies that are set to keep growing?
Brent Thill from Jeffries shared his view with Josh Lipton here on Yahoo Finance.
I think the application names that, you know, Salesforce, Adobe, those names, investors are re-underway. They see these open AI demos they just launched about customer care or doing digital signatures and you you start to see what OpenAI is saying, what Sam Altman's saying about wanting to get into SAS or software as a service.
I think that's freaking everyone out. So, you're seeing a lot of money, you're seeing names like Hubspot down 10% today, Braze down 10, Docusign down 11% in one day on the fear of Open AI entering the application game.
It doesn't matter what happens with AI, they're going to need infrastructure. OpenAI is going to need Microsoft, Oracle, Core Weve. And so, I think this the conversation we're having with our clients is the application names are under duress and I don't think it's as bad as the stocks are are telling you, but no one wants to be there right now because there is no S-curve.
So software's kind of a tale of two cities. One side, you know, um, there's zombies and in in trash and in a crazy amount of debris floating in the air and that's in the apps category.
And then on the infrastructure side, it's like the sun's out, you know, temperature's perfect, and everyone wants to be there. And I I'm a little that that's been our our view to stay stay overweight in infrastructure.
I think that trade lasts till 26 before we see money shift back to the broader software coverage. But right now, it's, um, you know, my group continues to underperform semis, AI infrastructure. And and so I think investors will come back to these names at some at some point when they see an S-curve or an inflection in in AI revenue. We don't see that yet in the application names yet.
Brent, since you mentioned Core Weve and I have you here, I want to ask you that they did ink this $14 billion meta deal. I want to get your thoughts on that headline, Brent. And also just you also cover meta.
Whether you have any concerns, Brent, that you have these hyper scalers maybe becoming, are they becoming too relying on kind of one key AI infrastructure name, Brent?
For many that know Meta's infrastructure, they would characterize them as one of the best builders on the planet of data center infrastructure.
And the fact that they would go to Core Weve tells you how good Core Weve is.
And that's all you need to know. Like, Meta can't even keep up with their own plans to build their own infrastructure, and they need to go to Core Weve to help them build that infrastructure.
Same thing, Microsoft, Core Weve, you've heard Google talk. So, all the hyper scalers, all the consumer grade, you know, standout leaders in internet are all turning to Core Weve because they can't make their plans for AI deployments without the help of Core Weve.
And they are considered kind of the master luxury builder if you will of AI.
And many ask, you know, how how long this is going to last, like what's Core Weve's competitive advantage. And over time, I think Core Weve's going to look a lot like Amazon AWS, which is it was the infrastructure to begin with, and then it becomes a software story. and AWS is a giant software story. I think if Core Weve
can pull this off. I said this when Palenteer went public. Like, if Palenteer can go from selling really high-end, you know, was like Tesla, selling really high-end cars to then selling cars that nurses, doctors, you know, can drive, the mass market can drive, then then we're in a great spot. I think Core Weve can get to the mass market over time.
But right now they're winning the best builders in in AI and and and as long as these contracts keep coming and we think they are, you know, stock's going to keep going higher."

finnhub,MSFT,2025-10-01T09:30:00,This ETF Has Beaten Every Stock in the Magnificent Seven This Year. Is It Too Late to Buy?,This semiconductor ETF has been an overlooked champ.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4f15f790c8378ed52c410bd25890d55f1e53d0eae62d5a1f6b49e46c71da4fa3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/this-etf-has-beaten-every-stock-in-the-magnificent/,fool.com,200,,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" has been driving the AI boom ever since its earliest days.
The group of seven stocks, which includes seven of the most valuable stocks on the market -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- all have some exposure to AI and are seen as the leading technological companies.
However, after driving the stock market rally through 2023 and 2024, the Magnificent Seven's performance has been more pedestrian this year. In fact, three of the seven have underperformed the S&P 500 so far.
A basket of all seven of those stocks would have gained 17.5% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 through Sept. 26, which was up 13%. That's a solid return, and investors can get exposure to the Magnificent Seven through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF.
However, there's one ETF that has not only nearly doubled the return of the Magnificent Seven this year, it's beaten every stock in the elite group through Sept. 26. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH 2.48%), which is up 33.2% year to date, and has a long track record of outperforming the S&P 500.
Meet the VanEck Semiconductor ETF
The VanEck Semiconductor ETF aims to replicate the MVIS U.S.-listed Semiconductor 25 Index, and like the Magnificent Seven, its biggest holdings have significant exposure to AI. These are the top 10 stocks in the ETF.
| Stock | % of ETF |
|---|---|
| Nvidia | 21.8% |
| Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) | 10.6% |
| Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) | 9.5% |
| Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) | 6% |
| Lam Research | 4.4% |
| Analog Devices | 4.4% |
| ASML | 4.2% |
| Micron Technology | 4.1% |
| Texas Instruments | 4.1% |
| Qualcomm | 4.1% |
Nearly 40% of the value of the ETF comes from Nvidia, TSMC, and Broadcom, three stocks that have been top performers in the AI boom. Notably, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has also outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF because the SMH's holdings are more concentrated in those three leading stocks.
While the Magnificent Seven might hold better-known stocks like Apple and Tesla, semiconductor companies have seen their business soar during the AI boom as they are providing the core computing power to make AI applications work. They form the building blocks of the AI revolution, and should as long as the data center buildout phase continues, with companies like Oracle pledging to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure.
Is the VanEck Semiconductor ETF still a buy?
The VanEck SMH ETF is not only outperforming the S&P 500 this year, but it has a long track record of delivering superior returns. Since its inception in 2011, the fund has gained more than 2,000%, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $200,000 and trouncing the S&P 500 along the way, which is up by less than 600% during that time.
Looking at its valuation, the SMH ETF isn't cheap, but it's not as expensive as you might think. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 39, which is much cheaper than popular AI stocks like Tesla or Palantir Technologies, and is only moderately more expensive than the S&P 500 at a P/E of 28. Meanwhile, some of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top holdings, like Taiwan Semiconductor, still look cheap considering its growth rate.
Given its exposure to the top chip and AI stocks and its diversification across the industry, the SMH ETF still looks like a strong buy. Over the long term, the fund looks like a good bet to continue to outperform the S&P 500, and given the massive capex spending in AI, it has an edge over the Magnificent Seven group as well."

Since the start of 2023, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) is up a whopping 73%, and even a brief plunge on tariff concerns hasn't been able to slow it down. Paced by the so-called Magnificent Seven, the broad market index has soared as AI-driven growth has fueled stocks like Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft.
There is some evidence that a bubble could be forming in the S&P 500. After all, the index is unusually expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and the CAPE ratio, which adjusts for inflation, is even more expensive. The so-called Buffett indicator, a ratio of the S&P 500's market cap to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is also at an all-time high.
However, the AI stocks leading this charge aren't as expensive as you might think. The chart below shows five of the leading AI stocks.
Although none of those stocks are cheap, they are mostly in line with the S&P 500, and all are delivering double-digit percentage growth. Nvidia, which is the most expensive of the group, is also the fastest growing, and its revenue is forecast to grow by 56% in its next quarterly report.
Where the bubble is forming
Rather than in large-cap stocks, the bubble forming in the stock market appears to be happening in zero-revenue, emerging technology stocks, and it's reminiscent of earlier stock market bubbles.
For example, in the dot-com era, droves of small internet companies went public with little or no revenue and unproven business models. That helped hasten the bust in 2000.
During the pandemic era, we saw a similar phenomenon with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), nearly all of which crashed or went bankrupt, even though they generally had successful debuts.
Other emerging technology stocks with little revenue, like electric vehicles, mostly went bankrupt or crashed in that era. Even the higher-profile newcomers like Rivian and Lucid lost more than 90% of their value.
This time around, there are a number of emerging sectors that are demonstrating similar trends. For example, modular nuclear reactor company Oklo (OKLO -1.34%) has jumped 1,200% during the past year even though the company has no revenue and doesn't expect to generate revenue until at least late 2027. It is currently attempting to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and has not sold a purchase agreement yet. Oklo currently has a market cap of almost $17 billion.
Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are another sector that has gotten frothy despite minimal revenue. Archer Aviation (ACHR -0.08%), which also has no revenue, currently trades at a market cap of $6 billion.
Finally, quantum computing stocks have soared this year, even though that sector is still producing little or no revenue. One stock, Quantum Computing (QUBT -2.52%), is up nearly 3,000% during the past year and its market cap has reached $3.7 billion, though it expects to generate less than $1 million in revenue this year.
What it means for investors
Investor enthusiasm for AI stocks seems to have carried over to emerging technology sectors that are unproven, much as it did in the dot-com era and during the pandemic.
Although companies like Oklo and Archer Aviation have potential, their current valuations don't seem to factor in the downside risk in the stock. It's likely to take years to build significant revenue, and even if they get there, that's not a guarantee of success.
In the current stock market, any of these stocks could crash if investor sentiment starts to shift. For the businesses to grow into their valuations without a major pullback seems unlikely."

Chicago, IL – October 1, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Comcast CMCSA, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Cisco CSCO.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Can AI-Driven IoT Unlock a Long-Term Path for Comcast?
Comcast operates across broadband, wireless, media and entertainment, but its growth strategy is increasingly pivoting toward enterprise technology. With traditional cable and media businesses facing slower expansion, artificial intelligence has become a critical lever for Comcast to diversify and capture higher-value opportunities. AI allows the company to move from being just a connectivity provider to becoming an enabler of efficiency, automation and smarter decision-making for businesses.
This strategic shift is evident in its MachineQ unit, which has introduced AI-powered insights for enterprises. It currently delivers device-to-cloud IoT connectivity, but the latest upgrade embeds machine learning to transform raw sensor data into actionable intelligence. Instead of simply monitoring connected devices, enterprises can now use the platform to generate predictive and prescriptive insights, reducing downtime, anticipating maintenance needs, improving compliance and even enhancing workplace safety. By targeting industries like healthcare, manufacturing, real estate and hospitality, MachineQ aims to solve real operational pain points, making Comcast an active partner in digital transformation initiatives.
CMCSA’s Competitive Positioning
Amazon has built scale in enterprise IoT with AWS IoT Core and continues to expand AI-driven analytics across its cloud, making Amazon a dominant force in connected services. Microsoft has strengthened Azure IoT with digital twin and predictive AI features and is increasingly seen as a trusted partner for enterprises modernizing operations. Cisco has carved out a strong position with AI-powered IoT networking and edge solutions and remains widely used across industrial deployments.
Against these rivals, Comcast’s MachineQ differentiates by offering a fully integrated, end-to-end IoT service that reduces adoption complexity and brings real-time AI insights to enterprises, allowing CMCSA to compete by focusing on simplicity, while Amazon, Microsoft and Cisco often require broader integration.
Investment Outlook: Positive
The MachineQ expansion highlights Comcast’s ambition to diversify beyond its core media and broadband business. By embedding AI into IoT solutions, it has created a pathway to tap enterprise technology budgets while reinforcing its Connectivity & Platforms segment. Success will depend on scaling adoption and proving efficiency gains for customers. If Comcast can compete effectively with Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft, the AI-driven MachineQ platform could become a meaningful growth lever over the long term."

Wall Street will be laser-focused on the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, which tend to grow faster than the rest of the market thanks to powerful trends like artificial intelligence (AI).
The Magnificent Seven stocks include:
Meta Platforms and Alphabet (Google) are heading into this earnings season with significant momentum across their various businesses, mostly thanks to AI. They also happen to be the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks by one traditional valuation metric, making them a great value for investors.
Here's why they might be great buys in October (and beyond).
The case for Meta Platforms
Over 3.4 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every single day, which include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Meta generates most of its revenue by showing ads to those users, so the longer they stay online, the more money the company makes.
Meta uses AI in its recommendation algorithms to learn what type of content each user likes to see, so it can show them more of it. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), this strategy drove a 6% increase in the amount of time users were spending on Instagram compared to the year-ago period, and a 5% increase for Facebook.
Meta has applied a similar AI-powered strategy to its ad-recommendation engine to target users more accurately, which is driving a modest increase in conversions. This allows the company to charge a higher price per ad, because businesses are getting a greater return on their investment.
Meta is also using AI to power new features like its Meta AI chatbot, which launched in late 2023 and already has over a billion monthly active users. It's powered by the company's Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which rival some of the best models from leading start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic. As Meta AI's capabilities expand, it's likely to become a major tailwind for engagement.
Meta's revenue increased by 22% during the second quarter, accelerating from its first-quarter result of 16%. In other words, better engagement and higher ad conversions are driving significant momentum in its business. According to Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street now expects the company to generate $196.1 billion in revenue for the whole of 2025, with earnings of $28.15 per share. Both figures would be record highs.
Meta stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.9 as I write this, making it the second-cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. As a result, there might be plenty of room for upside from here.
The case for Alphabet
When AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT went mainstream in 2023, investors were worried they would take traffic away from traditional internet search engines because they gave consumers a faster and more convenient way to access information. That would have spelled bad news for Alphabet, because Google Search accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue.
Alphabet met those concerns with innovation, developing its own AI models called Gemini, along with a chatbot with the same name. The Gemini models power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to provide holistic answers to search queries. These responses appear above the traditional search results, so users no longer have to sift through web pages to find the information they need.
Overviews strike a good balance between the traditional Google Search experience, and the convenience provided by AI chatbots. As a result, Alphabet said more than 2 billion people were using them at the end of the second quarter, and since they monetize at a similar rate to traditional Google Search results, they aren't hurting the company's valuable core business.
Finally, Google Cloud deserves a special mention because it has become a key part of Alphabet's AI strategy. It provides computing power from state-of-the-art centralized data centers, in addition to an expanding list of ready-made LLMs from top third-party developers. These are the main two ingredients required to develop AI software, which is why nearly all AI unicorns (start-ups worth $1 billion or more) are using Google Cloud in some capacity.
Google Cloud's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 32% during the second quarter. That momentum is likely to continue because the platform's order backlog climbed at an even faster rate of 38%, reaching a whopping $106 billion, which will be converted into revenue as Alphabet brings more data centers online.
Alphabet stock has soared by 48% over the past year, yet its P/E ratio is still just 26.2 which makes it the cheapest member of the Magnificent Seven. Considering the company's resounding success in the AI space so far, I think its stock could be destined for much higher ground."

NEW YORK, September 30, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UiPath (NYSE: PATH), a global leader in agentic automation, today announced the UiPath Platform™ for agentic automation and orchestration is integrating with Azure AI Foundry. The integration will allow for the orchestration of business-critical workflows with enterprise-grade governance.
UiPath’s integration with Azure AI Foundry enables customers to automate end-to-end processes using UiPath agents interacting with Azure AI Foundry agents and models. The use of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) extends the native, bi-directional integrations with Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Studio, allowing UiPath Maestro to deploy and scale end-to-end orchestrated workflows across Microsoft or UiPath agents. This gives process owners and analysts the trust, transparency and governance needed to deploy AI agents in real-world enterprise workflows and realize business value faster.
Agents and Orchestration Together Advance Medical Imaging for Better Patient Outcomes
An example of this type of AI automation and orchestration is an agent-led process for detecting and communicating incidental findings – often detrimental to patient health outcomes – in healthcare imaging, findings that are sometimes missed, potentially leading to delayed care or higher costs.
The combination of UiPath AI agents, Azure AI Foundry agents, and orchestration by UiPath Maestro creates an agentic process that can analyze past imaging results against current ones, flagging issues that can be combined into a comprehensive follow-up report. The entire workflow can then be routed to a physician or specialist for review to initiate timely follow-up care.
UiPath is featured as a launch listing in the new AI Apps and Agents category on Microsoft Marketplace. By unifying Microsoft Cloud, Azure AI Foundry, Copilot and the UiPath platform, enterprises can scale agentic automation across industries—from healthcare to financial services—bringing AI out of silos and into enterprise-ready processes.
""Enterprises don’t just need AI. They need it running inside the processes that matter most,"" said Graham Sheldon, Chief Product Officer at UiPath. ""By bringing Azure AI Foundry into the UiPath Platform, we’re making it possible for customers to connect Microsoft AI agents with UiPath AI agents and orchestrate them at scale. The result is agentic automation with the governance, trust, and enterprise execution our customers rely on, turning AI potential into measurable business impact."""

On September 24, 2025, UBS maintained its Buy rating and $173 price target on Vertiv Holdings Co. (NYSE:VRT), signaling a 20% upside despite recent stock weakness following Microsoft’s announcement of a new liquid cooling system.
UBS clarified that Vertiv Holdings Co. (NYSE:VRT) is not directly impacted, as it provides fluid management via liquid cooling loops, including chillers, heat exchangers, distribution units, sensors, and controls. Vertiv’s importance in data center thermal management and its global presence across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa reaffirm its resilience.
Vertiv Holdings Co. (NYSE:VRT) develops and maintains vital digital infrastructure technologies and lifecycle solutions for data centers, communication networks, and industrial environments worldwide. It is one of the Stocks That Will Double.

Village Board to vote on rezone on Oct. 14.
The Microsoft data center in Caledonia cleared a major hurdle after the village Plan Commission voted 5-2 on Sept. 29 to rezone the property from agricultural, rural residential and low-density residential to light industrial.
Village Trustee Nancy Pierce, who serves on the commission, and Ami May voted against the rezone.
The rezone of the 244-acre property now goes to the full village board to be voted on at the Oct. 14 meeting.
Residents opposed to the data center packed the Plan Commission meeting.
For weeks residents have been expressing their discontent with the project before they were aware Microsoft was behind it. But for some residents who are against the development, knowing Microsoft was the company behind the project didn't change their feelings.
Village administrator Todd Willis said roughly 50 people spoke at the meeting with a majority speaking against the development.
“There was a lot of people but not everyone in attendance spoke,” Willis said adding officials from Racine County Executive Ralph Malicki's office, Gateway Technical College and Racine Area Manufacturers and Commerce spoke in favor.
In a statement, Microsoft said:
""We appreciate the time and attention of all members of the Plan Commission, Village staff and Caledonia community. As members of the Village Board consider next steps, we look forward to continued conversation and partnership.We are eager to work together with neighbors in Caledonia to build a project that reflects the values and priorities important here – including those related to the character of the community and the natural resources that are precious here.""
To add more context to the potential financial impact of a data center, Willis prepared a memo laying out several different outcomes.
If the rezone is approved by the village board and the development moves forward, Willis calculates that one operational buidling could generate $420,959 in village taxes and reduce the residential tax burden from 88% of the general fund to 85%.
If there is a two operational buildings, that could generate $809,039 in village taxes and reduce the tax burden for residents down to 83%; and if there are three operational buildings it could generate $1,197,119 in village taxes and reduce the tax burden of residents to 82%.
""These are not precise calculations on what the value of the buildings or the tax benefit from the proposed project, but more of creating a range of possible outcomes during the construction period or when operational,"" the memo states. ""As the project continues through the process a more concise evaluation of all valuation factors related to the project with the finalization of civil site design submittals can be completed by the Village Assessor.""
There was also some mention in the memo of potentially making a tax incrimental district (TID) for the project, which would significantly impact the amount of taxes collected by the development.
“We are definitely not considering a TID. That’s not on the table at all,” Willis said adding he included it in the memo because a few board members were curious about what the revenue would be.
A TID is often used by municipalities to attract developers by temporarily keeping the tax rate frozen for a particular property while the company develops the land and can pocket the difference for what it would have been paying in taxes."

DeepSeek is taking another swing at the AI heavyweights with the launch of DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, an experimental version of its flagship model rolled out Monday on Hugging Face.
The new release builds on last year's V3.1-Terminus and debuts DeepSeek Sparse Attention, a feature designed to make training and inference more efficient when working with long chunks of text. The company called it a step toward its next-generation architecture, adding that the research is focused on squeezing more efficiency out of transformer models without sacrificing performance.
To sweeten the deal, DeepSeek also cut API pricing. Inputs now cost as little as $0.028 per cache hit, down from $0.07, while outputs dropped to $0.42 from $1.68. That pricing move underscores the startup's pitch: powerful models at a fraction of the cost of U.S. rivals.
DeepSeek has been turning heads with its lean training approach. Its reasoning-focused R1 model, for instance, cost just $294,000 to train using slightly more than 500 Nvidia (NVDA) H800 GPUs. By comparison, reports suggest Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI's GPT-4 burned through more than 10,000 GPUs."

Microsoft’s Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, which include emissions Microsoft is responsible for across its entire value chain, fell by 8% in its 2024 fiscal year compared to a rise of 3% in the previous reporting year. Other companies’ emissions rose by less than in previous years.
However, this may prove to be temporary given current data centre construction plans. GlobalData’s construction projects database lists 621 new data centre projects due to start in 2026, up from 518 in 2025 and nearly double 2024’s figure of 311. While data centres are energy-intensive, their construction has a significant impact on Big Tech emissions due to the emissions from concrete and steel production, as well as the production of components.
Big Tech will need lots of carbon offsets
Microsoft and Google both have commitments to fully offset their emissions by 2030. This can be achieved through reducing emissions or buying carbon offsets. Since emissions will likely rise, Microsoft and Google will need to source large volumes of carbon offsets.
However, the offset market has suffered from several years of growing scrutiny. Companies across different industries have faced reputational damage for buying low-quality offsets—credits linked to projects that either overstate their impact or would have happened anyway. In response, Big Tech has raised its standards, which shrinks the pool of eligible offsets it can buy and makes sourcing them more expensive.
Microsoft managed to procure more offsets than its emissions in 2024, but not all of these can be applied immediately. Many were so-called offtake agreements, which are advance purchases intended to finance projects that are still being developed. Google is also making long-term bets but faces similar constraints. Unless high-quality offset markets scale up rapidly, Big Tech will fall short of its 2030 promises.
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataOther key emissions reduction investments, like small modular nuclear reactors, will only impact emissions after 2030. The same is true of low-carbon building materials like steel and concrete, which depend on the scaling of hydrogen produced using renewable energy and carbon capture. Big Tech is trying to support some of these industries. Microsoft, Google, and data centre providers like Equinix and Standard Power have already announced offtake-type deals for power from small modular reactors near their operations.
The water problem
Emissions are not the only climate challenge for Big Tech. Water use is a rising risk, particularly as data centres expand into regions already facing shortages. Big Tech companies have recognised this, with Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple setting water neutrality targets for 2030, aiming to replenish water at the rate that they use it. The main problem is cooling systems, which consume vast quantities of water, and while solutions are emerging, the adoption of key water-saving technology remains in its infancy.
Google has said it favors air cooling in water-stressed areas, while Microsoft is piloting advanced techniques such as direct-to-chip cooling, where coolant circulates in a closed loop attached to chips. Another innovation announced in September 2025 by Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer at Microsoft, is in-chip cooling, where a coolant runs through microscopic grooves in chips themselves.
At the same time, tech companies are investing in water replenishment projects to restore natural sources. These can include wetland restoration or aquifer recharge, but the field lacks consistent standards. Measuring and verifying actual water impact remains difficult, which complicates transparency and reporting. Governments are also struggling to keep up. In June 2025, the UK Environment Agency admitted it did not have enough information on data centre water use to forecast national needs out to 2050. Without better monitoring and planning, both regulators and industry risk being blindsided by water scarcity linked to the digital economy."

Roughly half of the funding, about $15 billion, will be directed toward building advanced cloud and AI infrastructure, including the nation’s largest supercomputer, in partnership with Nscale, powered by more than 23,000 NVIDIA GPUs. The remaining amount will strengthen Microsoft’s local operations, supporting AI research, product development, gaming and customer support, while deepening ties with organizations like Barclays, Vodafone, the NHS and the London Stock Exchange Group.
Meanwhile, Microsoft is expanding its product ecosystem with the launch of proprietary AI models, MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-1-preview. With Azure revenues projected to grow 37% in the first fiscal quarter of 2026 and Microsoft 365 Copilot boosting revenue per user, the company is firmly positioned at the forefront of the generative AI revolution.
Can Microsoft’s U.K. Expansion Give It a Competitive Edge?
Microsoft’s U.K. investment comes at a pivotal moment, with the regulatory landscape becoming more favorable for global tech. By building local AI infrastructure, the company aims to boost security, speed and compliance while reducing reliance on overseas data centers.
The plans also align with the U.K.’s ambition to become a global AI hub. New data centers and supercomputing capacity will provide businesses and researchers with advanced tools to drive innovation while creating thousands of jobs in technology, research and operations. Universities, startups and enterprises stand to benefit through closer collaboration with Microsoft’s growing footprint.
This expansion deepens Microsoft’s alignment with U.K. priorities and positions the company as a trusted partner in the country’s digital future, potentially giving it an edge in partnerships, market share and long-term competitiveness.
Rivals Step Up in the AI Race
Rival tech giants are stepping up their U.K. commitments, with Nvidia NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL, OpenAI and Salesforce CRM collectively pledging more than $40 billion, which is a clear sign of intensifying AI competition.
Nvidia unveiled a landmark £11 billion ($15 billion) plan with partners Nscale and CoreWeave, highlighted by the deployment of 120,000 Blackwell GPUs in the U.K. — its largest-ever rollout in Europe. Google followed with a £5 billion ($6.8 billion) pledge, anchored by a new data center in Waltham Cross that will power its cloud and AI services while supporting more than 8,000 jobs annually. Salesforce, meanwhile, increased its U.K. investment to $6 billion, building on a $4 billion commitment made in 2023.
The surge in competitor investments signals that Microsoft could face stiff competition if the U.K. emerges as a leading hub for global AI."

Washington, D.C., Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The AI revolution is accelerating. NVIDIA’s stock has surged, Microsoft is pouring billions into AI supercomputers, and Elon Musk has warned that artificial intelligence will require more power than the global grid can currently supply.
But experts caution that the bottleneck isn’t just energy — it’s materials. The chips driving AI models rely on rare minerals like copper, cobalt, and lithium. And right now, most of those resources are controlled overseas.
Beijing Pulls the Plug
The danger is already here. “China blocked the export of these critical minerals to the United States. Meaning if we don’t act – our whole economy could tip into crisis”, Rickards said in a recent interview.
He compares the move to the oil embargo of the 1970s. “This reminds me of the 1970s, and the Arab Oil Embargo”
Only this time, the stakes aren’t just cars and gasoline — they’re the chips fueling America’s technological future.
A Supreme Court Breakthrough
Rickards believes the timing is no accident. He argues that a recent Supreme Court decision has changed the playing field.
This, he says, paves the way for America to unlock vast mineral deposits that have been trapped under federal land for generations.
A $150 Trillion “Endowment”
At the heart of Rickards’ case is what he calls a “national endowment.” “As we speak – Trump and his team are pushing for the release of a ‘national endowment’ worth at least $150 trillion. As soon as October 1st”
He explains: “It’s enough to pay off the national debt, four-times over… take a 100% stake in every company listed on the NASDAQ… and buy every private home in the United States”
Unlike government bailouts, this isn’t about checks in the mail. Rickards stresses: “It is a chance for the average American to become richer than they ever imagined. And a chance for a few little-known companies to become household names, in the years ahead”
About Jim Rickards
Jim Rickards has advised four U.S. Presidents, the Treasury, CIA, and Pentagon. He helped craft the Petrodollar Accord, helped end the Iranian Hostage Crisis, and testified before the Treasury ahead of the 2008 financial collapse."

The brokerage said it views CoreWeave as uniquely positioned to serve both AI-first startups and traditional enterprises building and deploying AI models, calling it an “at scale AI-as-a-Service pure play.”
CoreWeave operates more than 250,000 GPUs across 33 data centers, making it one of the largest independent GPU cloud operators globally.
Unlike traditional hyperscalers such as Amazon or Microsoft, CoreWeave’s infrastructure is purpose-built specifically for AI workloads, allowing it to deliver more than 20% better hardware utilization, Evercore said.
The bank pointed to several near-term catalysts, including an expanded partnership with OpenAI, the potential addition of Google as a cloud customer, a supply agreement with Nvidia that guarantees any unused capacity will be absorbed through 2032, and upcoming disclosure of a new large-scale hyperscaler contract.
Evercore said CoreWeave has strong forward revenue visibility, with about 98% of its sales coming from multi-year “take-or-pay” contracts, typically priced per GPU-hour.
Customer commitments in backlog recently climbed to about $30 billion, roughly half of which stems from OpenAI.
While customer concentration remains high, Microsoft and OpenAI accounted for nearly 80% of second-quarter revenue, Evercore expects the client mix to broaden as new enterprise wins ramp.
The firm flagged high capital expenditure requirements as a key debate, with CoreWeave expected to double spending to more than $20 billion in 2025 to build out new data centers.
However, it said operating margins should expand from the mid-to-high teens to the mid-20% range by 2027 as the business scales and older GPUs move past their depreciation window.
Evercore values the company at 10 to 11 times estimated 2027 EBITDA, a discount to larger cloud and data center peers.

Microsoft’s AI strategy is transforming it into a critical global infrastructure player, with investments and partnerships positioning it far beyond a conventional software vendor. The adoption of Microsoft Copilot by the U.S. House of Representatives illustrates this shift, as AI moves from a productivity tool to essential infrastructure capable of supporting state-scale operations. Globally, Microsoft is deploying more than $56 billion in AI-focused projects, including sovereign cloud regions and supercomputing hubs in the U.K., Norway, and the U.S., with total CapEx for fiscal 2025 expected to approach $80 billion.
These initiatives combine renewable energy, GPU clusters, and strategic partnerships, creating a distributed, resilient infrastructure network that spans continents and aligns with sovereign priorities. In the Middle East, alliances with G42 in the UAE and sovereign cloud regions in Saudi Arabia extend Microsoft’s influence into fast-growing AI markets, effectively tying its growth to politically aligned, capital-rich projects and providing a strategic counterweight to Chinese technology influence. Despite this scale, the market has largely overlooked Microsoft’s moves, favoring smaller, unprofitable AI players.
The company’s embedded presence in government, sovereign partnerships, and global cloud infrastructure provides durable pricing power and revenue visibility, supporting a potential stock valuation of $600 by year-end. Beyond commercial returns, Microsoft’s investments represent soft power, shaping AI adoption, digital infrastructure, and geopolitical influence, while enabling NVIDIA and other tech partners to thrive.
With unmatched scale, innovation leadership, and embeddedness across governments and enterprises, Microsoft is building the global rails of the AI economy, offering long-term, resilient upside for investors and anchoring portfolios in a way smaller startups cannot replicate. Its global AI infrastructure positions the company as a quasi-state actor, securing both technological and strategic advantage for decades.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) by Ray Myers in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s strong enterprise software position, cloud growth via Azure, gaming expansion, and AI integration. The stock has appreciated approximately 11.9% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as Microsoft’s fundamentals remain robust. The Edge of Power shares a similar view but emphasizes Microsoft’s global AI infrastructure and geopolitical influence."

(LOGI) has launched two new headsets, the Zone Wireless 2 ES and the Zone Wired 2 for Business, designed to help office workers cut out noise and stay focused.
The headsets use adaptive noise cancellation that changes automatically based on the surroundings and AI-powered microphones that block background sounds like typing or chatter. The headsets are certified for Microsoft Teams, part of Microsoft’s (MSFT) collaboration suite, Zoom and Google Meet, which makes setup easier and reduces IT issues. Microsoft Teams and Google Meet have native Bluetooth call control, allowing headsets to connect directly without a dongle, eliminating the need for a USB port.
Moreover, the wireless version runs up to 20 hours of talk time and 25 hours of listening time, while the wired version removes the need for charging and is a simple plug-and-play option. Both headsets can get remote software updates through Logitech Sync, so employees don’t have to stop working for updates.
Logitech borrowed design features from gaming headsets, such as a strap that spreads weight evenly for long use. The headsets also allow customization of audio and settings through the Logi Tune app. Sustainability is also a part of the design. The company used recycled plastics, metals, and cobalt, and has replaceable parts like earpads and straps to make them last longer.
The Zone Wireless 2 ES will be available in November at $159.99 for the Bluetooth variant or $179.99, which comes with a receiver. The Zone Wired 2 will be available in December for $129.99. This launch fits Logitech’s wider plan to grow its enterprise and hybrid work products, moving beyond consumer accessories into solutions that help businesses improve productivity.
Logitech’s Innovative Product Line Drives Growth
Alongside the new Zone headsets, Logitech has been adding products across gaming, streaming, and spatial computing. At its Logitech G PLAY 2025 event, the company showed one of its biggest portfolio updates so far, covering PC and console gaming, esports, sim racing, and streaming tools.
A highlight was the launch of the Streamlabs AI Streaming Agent, created with NVIDIA’s (NVDA) ACE technology. The tool can act as a co-host and live producer, handling scene switching, clipping highlights, and fixing issues in real time. Streamers can even add a lifelike virtual avatar, built with NVIDIA Audio2Face. The same technology is being offered to developers through the Streamlabs AI SDK to create new overlays and interactive tools."

Meta has been spending at a torrid pace as it invests in AI infrastructure that includes a mammoth 4 million-square-foot data center in Louisiana. The Instagram parent raised its 2025 capital expenditure guidance to a range between $66 billion and $72 billion in its most recent quarterly financial report.
Tuesday's development comes on the heels of CoreWeave's $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), announced last week. The company is working to diversify its customer base away from Microsoft (MSFT), which accounted for roughly 70% of the company's revenue in its most recent quarter.
""This is clearly a step in the right direction for diversification,"" Intrator told Bloomberg.
Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Felix Wang, who holds a short position on CoreWeave, called the deal ""a positive surprise."" Tech analyst and Bokeh Capital Partners chief investment officer Kimberly Forrest said the partnership was ""a good deal for both"" firms and is an indication that current demand for high-end AI chips is ""limitless.""
Futurum Group tech analyst David Nicholson was more skeptical of the deal and what it says about the AI chip market. Nicholson said there is an ""odd market dynamic"" at play, given Meta has chosen to rent data center capacity from CoreWeave rather than buy Nvidia's chips directly to put in its own data centers.
""It doesn't make sense that Meta would not prefer to do what it does with all of its other technology, and that is build and manage it on its own,"" he said.
CoreWeave's new partnership with Meta comes amid a flurry of other recent AI deals as Big Tech rushes to add compute capacity in data centers to power their artificial intelligence ambitions. Those deals include Nvidia's $100 billion OpenAI investment, announced last week, and OpenAI's reported $300 billion contract with Oracle (ORCL). Citi analysts forecast on Tuesday that AI capital expenditures from 2025 through 2029 would hit $2.8 trillion."

With traditional cable and media businesses facing slower expansion, artificial intelligence has become a critical lever for Comcast to diversify and capture higher-value opportunities. AI allows the company to move from being just a connectivity provider to becoming an enabler of efficiency, automation and smarter decision-making for businesses.
This strategic shift is evident in its MachineQ unit, which has introduced AI-powered insights for enterprises. It currently delivers device-to-cloud IoT connectivity, but the latest upgrade embeds machine learning to transform raw sensor data into actionable intelligence. Instead of simply monitoring connected devices, enterprises can now use the platform to generate predictive and prescriptive insights, reducing downtime, anticipating maintenance needs, improving compliance and even enhancing workplace safety. By targeting industries like healthcare, manufacturing, real estate and hospitality, MachineQ aims to solve real operational pain points, making Comcast an active partner in digital transformation initiatives.
CMCSA’s Competitive Positioning
Amazon AMZN has built scale in enterprise IoT with AWS IoT Core and continues to expand AI-driven analytics across its cloud, making Amazon a dominant force in connected services. Microsoft MSFT has strengthened Azure IoT with digital twin and predictive AI features and is increasingly seen as a trusted partner for enterprises modernizing operations. Cisco CSCO has carved out a strong position with AI-powered IoT networking and edge solutions and remains widely used across industrial deployments. Against these rivals, Comcast’s MachineQ differentiates by offering a fully integrated, end-to-end IoT service that reduces adoption complexity and brings real-time AI insights to enterprises, allowing CMCSA to compete by focusing on simplicity, while Amazon, Microsoft and Cisco often require broader integration.
Investment Outlook: Positive
The MachineQ expansion highlights Comcast’s ambition to diversify beyond its core media and broadband business. By embedding AI into IoT solutions, it has created a pathway to tap enterprise technology budgets while reinforcing its Connectivity & Platforms segment. Success will depend on scaling adoption and proving efficiency gains for customers. If Comcast can compete effectively with Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft, the AI-driven MachineQ platform could become a meaningful growth lever over the long term."

The agreement includes providing the social media giant access to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest GB300 systems, according to a report from Bloomberg News, citing CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator. ""They loved our infrastructure in earlier contracts and came back for more,"" Intrator said in an interview.
This major deal helps CoreWeave diversify its revenue streams beyond Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which accounted for 71% of the company’s revenue in the quarter ending June. ""When we came out in the IPO, we got dinged because of our customer concentration,"" Intrator noted. ""This is clearly a step in the right direction for diversification.""
The Meta agreement follows another multibillion-dollar commitment from OpenAI announced last week. CoreWeave’s stock has more than tripled in value since its March initial public offering, as major technology companies race to secure computing resources for advanced AI model development.

MONTREAL, Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Tato, the AI-native project platform purpose-built for system integrators, today announced a $5 million Seed round led by Ridge Ventures, with participation from Myriad Venture Partners, Betaworks, RRE Ventures, and others. The funding will be used to scale the team as it continues to fix implementation problems that have crippled digital transformation for decades.
Since the 1990s , high-profile ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) disasters have tormented companies like Nike, Hershey, PG&E, Waste Management, and Hewlett-Packard. Many Fortune 500 businesses spend up to 5% of annual revenue—hundreds of millions or more—to license, implement, and support ERP solutions. However, by 2027, more than 70% of recent ERP projects will fall short of desired business goals. Up to 25% will fail entirely.
Tato bridges the gap between agentic AI and seamless ERP implementation. Its AI-powered solution facilitates massive IT projects featuring dozens of workstreams, hundreds of stakeholders, constant changes, and stringent deadlines and budgets. Like a trusted colleague, Tato captures communications from calls, chats, and project management apps. This data then enters a real-time knowledge base that keeps teams organized and proactively flags issues.
Tato is primarily used by system integrators (SIs) to help manage ERP implementations. It simplifies communication, team onboarding, risk management, and other challenges faced by system integrators.
""I spent years watching ERP projects fail, companies lose millions, people lose their jobs,"" said Justin Delisle, Tato co-founder and CEO. ""AI can finally give projects the memory and foresight they've lacked.""
Tato's key product features include:
-
Capture and organize every interaction: Tato connects to meetings, chats, and project tools, automatically capturing activity and tagging it by participants, project references, and AI-driven analysis for accurate, secure organization.
-
Enterprise security built in: With single-tenant architecture and SOC 2 compliance, Tato offers enterprise-grade security, flexible deployment, and context-aware access for every team member.
-
Instant insights from project activity: Tato generates RAID logs, AI-assisted reports, and real-time summaries so teams stay informed and can track every decision.
""You couldn't find a better team to transform ERP implementation,"" said Akriti Dokania, Partner at Ridge Ventures. ""Tato's co-founders are domain experts and proven company- and product-builders. Justin is a globally recognized leader in the space. He speaks the language of system integrators stuck in ERP purgatory."""

BOSTON, September 30, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Onapsis, a global leader in SAP cybersecurity and compliance, today announced the launch of a new integration between its flagship Onapsis Defend threat monitoring product and Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP, based on Microsoft’s AI-powered cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. The integration provides security operations centers (SOC) with unified visibility and threat detection and response capabilities for SAP security events.
SOC teams struggle with a profound visibility gap into activity happening in their mission-critical SAP landscapes, which commonly serve as foundational systems of record for enterprises. This gap includes identifying SAP threats, detecting SAP-targeted exploits and zero-day activity, suspicious user or insider behavior, sensitive data downloads, security control violations and more. The new integration provides organizations with a superior early warning system with proprietary exploit detection rules for business-critical SAP applications, enabling their security teams to detect exploit attacks on vulnerable SAP systems before patches are even released.
""The collaboration extends the power of Onapsis’ SAP-endorsed, industry-leading threat monitoring directly into Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP,"" said Sadik Al-Abdulla, Onapsis Chief Product Officer. ""By unifying Onapsis' context-rich insights with Microsoft Sentinel’s Solution for SAP, enterprises can investigate and respond to SAP threats faster, meet strict disclosure requirements with confidence and strengthen their security posture across both on-prem, cloud and RISE with SAP environments.""
Key benefits of the integration include:
-
Specialized Exploit and Zero-Day Detection: The Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP offers advanced pre-patch exploit protection and early warning alerts against cyberattacks, enriched with threat intelligence from Onapsis Research Labs and their Global SAP Threat Intelligence Network. This collaboration enhances Microsoft Sentinel’s native SAP capabilities with specialized insights from one of the industry’s most trusted research teams.

-
Unified Security Operations: With market-leading SAP threat and exploit detection from Onapsis, organizations can push security events to Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP for correlation with broader enterprise events to streamline incident handling and reduce response times through a unified view of the overall threat landscape in the Microsoft Unified SecOps Platform."

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Ken Gawrelski, Wells Fargo senior internet analyst, said in a recent program on CNBC that while Amazon shares look “stuck in neutral,” they can gain in the coming days. Here is how the analyst explained his bullish case for the e-commerce and Cloud giant:
""You’ve had accelerating industry growth at the same time that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has kind of been stuck in neutral, right? And this is why we upgrade the shares today: we think this is about to change. Anthropic has been a core, key partner of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Note that OpenAI, which has been a very big spender in cloud and the subject of a lot of the headlines you’ve no doubt reported about over the last three to four weeks, is more aligned with Microsoft and also does some work with Google, but really not with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). So Amazon has not had that exposure. We do think Anthropic has great momentum as a business and will be accelerating its compute spend. Notably, we think there will be a big capacity project that the two are working on together, which will benefit next year. We see it as a nice driver to AWS and an accelerant to the business.""

Mairs & Power Balanced Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“The Fund also started a new position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the second quarter, where the company is well positioned to continue capturing market share in retail while also growing its market leading cloud business. The Fund took advantage of weakness in the stock during April to start the position as tariff news and a precipitous market decline provided an opportunity to build a position.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

CRWV: An Explosive Growth Story
The booming demand for AI infrastructure is greatly benefiting CoreWeave, which saw its revenues skyrocket by 207% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. This marked the company's significant milestone of its first-ever billion-dollar quarter. Adjusted EBITDA almost tripled to $753.2 million.
Strategic partnerships with major players like OpenAI and NVIDIA bode well. CoreWeave recently announced yet another expansion of its contract with OpenAI. The new expansion contract, worth $6.5 billion, involves CRWV supplying capacity for OpenAI training of its next-generation models. The total value of OpenAI contact now stands at an impressive $22.4 billion, which includes $11.9 billion agreement in March and $4 billion expansion in May. OpenAI’s (which is a leading AI company) massive contract not only enhances revenue visibility for CRWV but also validates its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable.
Collaboration with NVIDIA is another positive aspect. CoreWeave was among the first cloud providers to put NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. Additionally, it deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its “Mission Control” for enhanced reliability and performance. NVIDIA also has an agreement with CRWV to purchase residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions.
CoreWeave is actively expanding its data center network, enabling it to serve a diverse client base with low latency and high reliability. With over 900 MW of active power targeted by year-end, CRWV is positioning itself as a top-tier provider capable of supporting large-scale AI training and inference workloads. The launch of a new Ventures Fund to invest in AI startups and several acquisitions like Weights & Biases (acquired), Core Scientific, and OpenPipe (announced) strengthen CRWV’s position."

Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) are designing cutting-edge AI chips.
Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle (ORCL 1.54%) are pushing the bounds of cloud computing.
Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel manufacture chips using equipment supplied by companies like ASML, Applied Materials, and Lam Research.
There's also the indirect method of investing in AI, which can be achieved through any company that utilizes it to enhance efficiency. For example, Walmart's AI-powered supply chain optimization.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with an AI bent offer a simple way to invest in a portfolio of companies rather than picking and choosing just a handful of names. Here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 0.77%), iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX 3.08%), and the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG 0.55%) are AI ETFs that have what it takes to outperform the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) over the next five years.
1. Vanguard Information Technology ETF
This ETF mirrors the performance of the tech sector. Big gains from ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Oracle have made the ETF heavily concentrated in just a handful of names.
Just 10 holdings make up 57.8% of the fund. However, many of those holdings have a ton of exposure to AI.
Not long ago, the tech sector was dominated by software names. However, big gains from companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which are powering data centers with AI chips, have given the tech sector much more exposure to semiconductor, materials, and hardware. These industries, along with electronic equipment and components, now make up well more than half of the tech sector.
The Vanguard Information Technology ETF is one of the least expensive ways to invest in the tech sector, with an expense ratio of just 0.09%.
2. iShares Semiconductor ETF
If you like the technology sector's increasing reliance on semiconductor stocks, then you'll love this ETF. It's the ideal pick for folks who believe the semiconductor industry is one of the best ways to invest in AI.
The strategy has paid off, as the iShares Semiconductor ETF has achieved a staggering 184% total return over the last five years, which is better than the 151% total return for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and far better than the 151% total return for the S&P 500.
This fund has a higher expense ratio than the aforementioned Vanguard ETFs, at 0.34%. However, it's a great way to get exposure to semiconductor companies that have very low weightings in the S&P 500 (or aren't included at all).
Advanced Micro Devices has a 7.1% weighting in the fund, Qualcomm makes up 5.8%, and Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, Intel, Lam Research, Marvell Technology, Applied Materials, KLA, ASML, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all more than 4%.
3. Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF
This fund isn't limited to a single sector. Rather, it essentially filters the S&P 500 by doubling down on top growth stocks and leaving out value-focused companies.
This strategy has helped the fund slightly outperform the S&P 500 over the last five years. But it could easily beat the market over the next five years if mega-cap growth stocks continue leading the major indexes to new heights.
Around 55% of this ETF is invested in the Ten Titans, which have plenty of upside potential from AI. What's more, the ETF has a very low expense ratio of just 0.07%, or $7 for every $10,000 invested.
Add it all up, and it's a simple and low-cost way to get exposure to growth-focused S&P 500 companies.
Winning ETFs with room to run
The discussed ETFs are ideally suited for investors looking to build their AI exposure around today's leading companies. However, they may not be suitable for investors seeking to diversify into newer companies.
A common mistake is duplicating holdings across ETFs, which results in more exposure than an investor may realize. For example, if an investor owns Nvidia stock outright but also has $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund, that's another $720 in Nvidia simply because it makes up 7.2% of the index.
However, it could also be a mistake to ignore today's leaders just because they are hiding in plain sight. Big tech firms are ramping up spending on AI, and a lot of that spending is funneling to the semiconductor industry and associated hardware and infrastructure companies. That gives Nvidia and Broadcom the green light to pour excess profits into research and development to expand their lead over the competition.
In this vein, doubling down on top tech stocks through low-cost ETFs may be one of the simplest ways to potentially beat the S&P 500 over the next five years."

finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-30T08:05:00,Will a Stock Market Crash Follow the AI Boom? Billionaire Ken Griffin Warns About Echoes of the Dot-Com Bubble.,The artificial intelligence (AI) trade has pushed the S&P 500 to a very expensive valuation that has historically correlated with negative forward returns.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=00f74b49494e5508084b7791022c1e6cbd499b84c0ab9f00a3578d8750ea7ccf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/stock-market-crash-after-ai-boom-billionaire-warns/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/stock-market-crash-after-ai-boom-billionaire-warns/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/30/stock-market-crash-after-ai-boom-billionaire-warns/,fool.com,200,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution began in earnest with the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. The S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) has advanced 72% since then despite headwinds arising from high interest rates, stubborn inflation, and sweeping tariffs.
Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at J.P.Morgan, recently said, ""AI related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth, and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched.""
Naturally, some experts have drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble, a period where rich valuations across the technology sector in the late 1990s led to a stock market crash in the early 2000s. Hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin recently told CNBC, ""There are obviously echoes of the dot-com bubble in this moment.""
How the artificial intelligence (AI) boom differs from the dot-com bubble
Billionaire Ken Griffin runs the most successful hedge fund in history as measured by cumulative net gains, so his opinion should carry weight with investors. However, his recent comment about the artificial intelligence (AI) boom echoing the dot-com bubble should be considered in context.
Griffin in the second quarter purchased a substantial amount of stock in three companies at the very heart of the AI boom: Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft. Those stocks now rank among his six largest holdings, which suggests Griffin is comfortable with their valuations and has confidence in their future growth prospects.
Importantly, while valuations are elevated today, they are still a far cry from the valuations seen during the dot-com bubble. The five largest technology stocks in 2000 had a market-cap weighted forward PE ratio of 59, according to JPMorgan. Comparatively, the five largest technology stocks today have a market-cap weighted forward PE ratio of 34.
""During the dotcom bubble, rampant speculation surrounded young companies flaunting internet excitement before profitability,"" according to JPMorgan strategist Stephanie Aliaga. ""In contrast, today's AI beneficiaries are already very profitable companies that make their money selling key infrastructure and resources.""
In short, the dot-com bubble was fueled by speculative bets on internet companies, many of which were losing money, and valuations during that period were much higher than what we see today. Furthermore, many of the most heavily weighted AI stocks in the S&P 500 today are paragons of financial strength.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" in aggregate reported earnings growth of 27% in Q2 2025, while the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 reported earnings growth of 8%, according to FactSet Research. The ""Magnificent Seven"" are on pace to report faster earnings growth than the rest of the index for the third straight year, and analysts expect that trend to remain intact through 2026.
The S&P 500 still trades at a pricey valuation that has historically correlated with negative forward returns
While valuations may have been frothier during the dot-com bubble, that does not mean the stock market is cheap today. The S&P 500 recorded a cyclically adjusted price-to-earning (CAPE) ratio of 38 in August, a material premium to the monthly average of 31 during the last decade.
There have only been 40 incidents where the S&P 500's monthly CAPE multiple exceeded 37 since the index was created in 1957. Even more alarming, economist Robert Shiller has back-tested the data using a precursor to the S&P 500 (called the S&P 90) and there have only been 40 incidents where the monthly CAPE ratio has topped 37 since 1928, a period that covers 1,172 months.
Put differently, the S&P 500 -- widely considered the best barometer for the U.S. stock market -- has only been this expensive 3.4% of the time in history. And the index has usually performed poorly in the aftermath. The chart below shows the median return during the one, two, and three years following monthly CAPE readings above 37.
|
Holding Period |
S&P 500 Median Return When CAPE Is 37+ |
|---|---|
|
1 Year |
(8%) |
|
2 Years |
(13%) |
|
3 Years |
(19%) |
As shown above, the S&P 500 has typically produced negative returns during the one, two, and three years following monthly CAPE readings above 37. And if its performance matches the historical median, the index will decline 19% over the next three years.
Here's the bottom line: The artificial intelligence boom has carried the U.S. stock market much higher in the last three years. Valuations are nowhere close to the those seen in the years preceding the dot-com crash in the early 2000s, but the S&P 500 still trades at a very expensive CAPE ratio that has historically coincided with negative forward returns.
So, investors should avoid risky behavior. That means scrutinize valuations closely before you invest money, and never buy a stock if you aren't prepared to hold through a downturn. Also, good opportunities may be difficult to find in the current environment, so it's OK to focus on building a cash position to capitalize on the next drawdown."

The new cooling system is capable of removing heat up to three times better than cold plates that are commonly used. The latest technology leverages microfluidics, an approach that brings liquid coolant directly inside the silicon where the heat is generated. In this case, tiny channels are created at the back of the silicon chip to remove heat efficiently.
According to researchers, microfluidics may increase the sustainability and efficiency of next-generation AI devices. Cold plates, which are isolated from the heat source by multiple layers that restrict the amount of heat they can remove, are currently used to cool the majority of GPUs running in data centers today.
“Microfluidics would allow for more power-dense designs that will enable more features that customers care about and give better performance in a smaller amount of space,” said Judy Priest, corporate vice president and chief technical officer of Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft.

On September 26, Morgan Stanley named the stock as a “Top Pick” and raised its price target to $625 per share from $582.
“Confidence in a path to shedding those weights and a broadening set of growth drivers elevates MSFT to Top Pick.”
The firm noted that even though the pace of adoption and monetization is slow, Microsoft stands to benefit from the AI boom. Its robust ties to the industry and its enterprise solutions have had the firm bullish on the stock.
Morgan Stanley particularly pointed out to Azure cloud computing platform’s growth amid an enterprise spending boom. One of the surveys conducted by the firm revealed how 49% of CIOs quoted Azure to be the likely top IT budget share gainer over the next three years.
The company’s cloud is also likely to benefit from AI-industry tailwinds.
“With its integration of the OpenAI model family, Microsoft has already gained a large group of new commercial applications. With AI workloads set to become a larger portion of cloud spend and driving an increase in the percentage of workloads in the cloud higher, Azure is well positioned to benefit.”
The firm believes that Microsoft has “the clearest and highest probability positive risk/reward in the space.”
“The strong positioning of Microsoft for multiple secular growth drivers – GenAI (polls #1 as the biggest wallet share gainer), migration of Enterprise workloads to the Public Cloud (polls #1 as the biggest wallet share gainer), Cyber-security (the largest vendor in the space with >$40 billion in revenues) and across all these an ongoing push towards consolidation of spend with fewer vendors – enables an under-appreciated durability of high-teens total return profile, currently under-priced at a <26x GAAP CY27 EPS multiple compared to the >$50Bn large-cap software average at 32x non-GAAP EPS. Sustained momentum on the top-line, better appreciation of the breadth of growth drivers and resolution of uncertainty around the OpenAI relationship should drive shares toward our upwardly revised $625 price target. Reiterate Overweight, making Microsoft our Top Pick in large-cap software given the clearest and highest probability positive risk/reward in the space.”

Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, was seen smiling as he accompanied Tiffany Trump, the US president’s youngest daughter, down the red carpet at Windsor Castle’s state banquet.
He exchanged small talk with the Prince of Wales and enjoyed a prime spot at the table, sitting a few seats down from King Charles and the US president.
But while the bosses of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI trumpeted multibillion-pound investments in the UK as part of the visit, Cook had much less to say.
Apple was absent from any of the investment announcements made by the UK Government, which totalled £150bn from some of America’s biggest companies.
Nor, unlike some of his counterparts, did he take to the airwaves to hail the benefits of being in Britain.
Unusually, for someone who regularly documents their visits around the world, Cook also did not post on social media about the event. By contrast, last week he tweeted five times about a short trip to Japan.
“The likes of [Salesforce chief Marc] Benioff and Jensen [Huang, the Nvidia founder] were everywhere, and he certainly wasn’t,” says one investor present at many of the private business events during the state visit.
The silence may mean nothing, particularly as Apple typically refuses to appear on press releases alongside competitors, and Cook has a busy diary.
But a close follower might also see evidence of a cooling relationship between the iPhone giant and the UK.
The order, known as a Technical Capability Notice, struck at the heart of Apple’s promise to protect users’ privacy, a key element of the company’s sales pitch.
The UK is already one of the most active countries in terms of requesting data from Apple, according to the company’s law enforcement reports, but the demand was unique among Western nations.
To put the request into context, only China has previously demanded that the company compromise the encryption that protects people’s iCloud accounts.
Neither the Government nor Apple has acknowledged the secret order, but the Silicon Valley tech giant has pushed back fiercely.
In February, it disabled encryption for iCloud backups in Britain – sending a message that it would rather remove a feature than be seen to weaken it – and said it was “gravely disappointed” at the situation.
Apple has challenged the case at the secretive Investigatory Powers Tribunal, and in August, Trump’s national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard said the Home Office had agreed to drop the matter.
However, there has yet to be any official confirmation of this, and a subsequent court document indicated the notice was still live.
“No other government has this power,” says Gus Hosein of campaign group Privacy International. “And when industry gets out of line with this Government’s interests, it strikes out.”
The tech giant is also feeling the heat from empowered competition regulators. In July, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it planned to classify Apple as having “strategic market status” in the smartphone industry.
If it follows through with the threat, the CMA has wide-ranging powers that could see it crack down on lucrative parts of Apple’s business, including the App Store, which accounts for billions of dollars in revenue.
The CMA may also require Apple to offer more choice regarding web browsers and enforce interoperability.
This could allow rival smartwatch and headphone manufacturers to connect to iPhones in the same way that the Apple Watch and AirPods do.
In response to the threat, Apple has accused the CMA of an “EU-style” crackdown, claiming that the UK regulator is imitating Brussels in its battle against big tech.
Worryingly for Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves’s growth ambitions, the company also suggested that the proposed action might affect its investment plans in Britain.
“There is no basis for this intervention, which would be unnecessary and send a hostile signal to businesses making long-term investments in innovation and infrastructure in the UK,” it told the CMA.
Last week, in a potential sign of where things could lead, the company stepped up its battle with Brussels, warning that it could withhold new products from Europe.
Meanwhile, the CMA has so far held firm and rejected the comparison to Europe’s digital laws, saying Britain’s competition regime “works in a fundamentally different way to the EU”.
However, Britain’s fractious relationship with one of the world’s biggest tech companies has not gone unnoticed on the other side of the Atlantic.
Cook has long had a healthy relationship with Trump, who has taken a dim view of foreign governments’ attempts to rein in America’s tech giants.
Trump described the Home Office’s encryption demand as “something that you hear about with China”, while JD Vance, the vice-president, was also instrumental in getting Britain to pull back on its demands.
Trump’s White House has also tacitly criticised the proposed CMA crackdown.
In response to news of the regulator’s actions, it told the Maga-friendly news magazine The Washington Examiner: “The administration has made its position on digital services taxes and other unfair regulations targeting American technology firms abundantly clear, and we are actively addressing our concerns in discussions with our trading partners.”
Cook may not have made a big impression during Trump’s visit to Britain. But if his presence led to the president pushing Starmer to back off Apple, then he might have considered it worth the trip."

The corporate Bitcoin treasury playbook just got another high-profile convert as Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive (NASDAQ: ASST) on Sept. 22 announced a $1.3 billion all-stock acquisition of Semler Scientific (NASDAQ: SMLR).
The deal values Semler at $90.52 per share—a staggering 210% premium to the Sept. 19 close—while Strive simultaneously announced plans to purchase an additional 5,816 Bitcoin for $675 million.
For investors watching corporate America’s crypto adoption, this merger represents both validation of the Bitcoin treasury strategy and a potential preview of what’s coming next.

The Ramaswamy Factor Behind the Bitcoin Bet
Ramaswamy, the former Republican presidential candidate and longtime crypto advocate who co-founded Strive in 2022, is betting big that companies holding Bitcoin will outperform traditional cash-heavy competitors. He, who previously founded drugmaker Roivant Sciences (NASDAQ: ROIV) before leaving its board in February 2023 to focus on his presidential campaign, sees this acquisition as more than just financial engineering.
The timing couldn’t be better for Ramaswamy’s crypto thesis. Bitcoin has surged 20.5% this year, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13.3% gain, as regulatory wins have helped bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance.

Why This Deal Matters Beyond the Numbers
While the headline-grabbing Bitcoin accumulation will capture attention, the strategic rationale reveals something deeper about how companies are thinking about digital assets. Semler isn’t just a crypto play—the company operates a legitimate healthcare business offering point-of-care tests that measure arterial blood flow in the extremities.
This dual-business model provides cash flow diversification while maintaining significant Bitcoin exposure, potentially offering a template for other companies considering similar strategies. The combined entity plans to fund future Bitcoin purchases using a “preferred equity only” model, avoiding the debt-fueled approach that has sometimes concerned traditional investors.
The market reaction was swift but mixed. Semler shares are down more than 20% from their Sept. 22 high of $36, while Strive has fallen 40% from its $4.26 peak, suggesting investors are still digesting the implications of this aggressive expansion strategy."

Chipmaker Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against Wall Street's long-term outlook for the company, saying analysts are underestimating the scale of artificial intelligence demand.
Dismisses Wall Street Forecasts
On last week's Open Source podcast, Huang was asked about Wall Street consensus from 25 analysts projecting Nvidia's growth ""flatlining"" after 2027. He said he had no issue with those forecasts but argued they fail to capture the scale of AI adoption that is now underway.
During the podcast, Huang said, “We're comfortable with that,” adding that his company has “no trouble beating the numbers on a regular basis.”
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
He described a “massive divergence of belief” between what AI leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Satya Nadella are projecting and what Wall Street models assume. “Our opportunity, as I described it, is much larger than the consensus,” he said.
Huang pointed to what he called “two exponentials” driving compute requirements, that is, the rapid increase in the number of users engaging with AI tools, followed by the exponential growth in compute needed per user as models move from one-shot inference to reasoning.
“Until we fully convert all general-purpose computing to accelerated computing and AI... the chances [of a glut] are extremely low,” he said.

Huang Defends $100 Billion OpenAI Investment
On the podcast, Huang defended his decision to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, calling it “some of the smartest investments we can possibly imagine.”
Huang said, “OpenAI is likely going to be the world’s next multi-trillion-dollar hyperscale company,” adding that Nvidia will be working with the company “at the chip level, at the software level, at the systems level, at the AI factory level” to help build and operate its AI infrastructure.
This comes amid growing investor concerns that the company was creating a “circular” investment loop by investing in OpenAI, which would in turn acquire chips from Nvidia.

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.
But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?
DeepSeek’s trader origins
DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.
AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.
In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.
From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.
DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.
DeepSeek’s strong models
DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.
DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.
DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety.
According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o."

In other words, OpenAI might be on the path to reshaping who holds power in e-commerce.
OpenAI’s new “Instant Checkout” feature is available to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free logged-in users buying from U.S.-based Etsy sellers, with more than 1 million Shopify merchants like Glossier, Skims, Spanx, and Vuori “coming soon,” per OpenAI.
Instant Checkout builds on previous shopping features on ChatGPT that surfaced relevant products, images, reviews, prices, and direct links to merchants in response to shopping questions like “what should I get my friend who loves ceramics?” or “best sneakers to wear to the office.” Now, instead of having to leave the conversation, users can just tap “Buy” to confirm their order, shipping, and payment details (options include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or credit card) to complete the purchase.
Last year, Perplexity introduced a similar in-chat shopping and payments feature. Microsoft also offers merchants the ability to create in-chat storefront capabilities with the Copilot Merchant Program.
This type of frictionless experience has the potential to spark a new movement in how people shop online — one that moves away from search engines like Google and e-commerce platforms like Amazon toward conversational agents with curated recommendations, comparisons, and easy checkout experiences.
It’s also setting the stage for new power brokers to emerge in e-commerce. Google and Amazon have long been the gatekeepers for retail discovery. If more purchases start inside AI chatbots, the firms behind them will suddenly have more control over what products are surfaced and what commissions or fees they charge.
Both Amazon and Google have previously leveraged their dominance to favor their own products or preferred partners, pushing down competitors in search results or charging steep fees to sellers simply to maintain visibility. OpenAI said in a blog post that the product results it surfaces are “organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user,” and that it will charge merchants a “small fee” for completed purchases.
TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for more information."

That’s made it the largest contributor to the $36 billion in equity being put in to finance the deal, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing non-public information.
The transaction is the latest win for Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a video-game fan who is partial to Microsoft Corp.’s He’s focused on gaming as part of a national strategy to provide tens of thousands of new jobs and diversify the kingdom’s economy away from oil.
Mohammed, who chairs Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, has already invested some $30 billion in the industry, according to market researcher Aldora. That includes building up a stake in Nintendo Co. and acquiring the publisher of the hit game .
The kingdom also constructed a sprawling city that’s home to four different gaming arenas as part of that effort.
“Their overarching strategy is to bring jobs to Saudi Arabia — that’s a generational move over the next 20 years,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc.
Electronic Arts, whose hits include the football franchise, the shooting series and the soccer game, “checks all those boxes,” Pachter said.
The Electronic Arts deal comes after the prince announced in May that he would boost investment in the US to $1 trillion in the coming years as part of a push to deepen trade ties between the kingdom and the world’s largest economy.
The company, based in Redwood City, California, earned $1.12 billion on sales of $7.46 billion in its latest fiscal year. A highly anticipated new game is set for an Oct. 10 release.
If consummated, the deal would be the largest leveraged buyout in history. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is providing $20 billion in debt financing.
Saudi Arabia first invested in Electronic Arts in 2021, when it acquired a $1.1 billion stake in the company. The kingdom bought more shares, bringing the value of its holding to $4.8 billion as of Sept. 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

(Reuters) -Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) unveiled the Claude 4.5 AI model on Monday, saying the newest version can code for longer uninterrupted stretches and handle finance and scientific tasks better, as the startup pushes deeper into enterprise AI.
The Alphabet and Amazon.com-backed AI startup is racing rivals to build models that can reliably operate software and complete multi-step work, key for AI agents, which can perform tasks on behalf of humans.
The Sonnet 4.5 model created a web app from scratch in internal tests, and one customer had the AI chatbot code autonomously for 30 hours, up from a seven-hour run achieved by Anthropic's earlier Claude Opus 4 for a different client, Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger said.
Anthropic is targeting power users and business customers rather than chasing a viral consumer moment, he said.
Claude 4.5 is stronger at finance and scientific reasoning and better at using computers, scoring about 60% on a benchmark that tests operating-system dexterity versus roughly 40% for prior models, the company said.
""It's a lot more visceral when you just see the model using a computer the way a person does if you're not a coder,"" said Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan.
Separately on Monday, Microsoft said it would add new Microsoft 365 Copilot features powered by Anthropic models, including ""Agent Mode"" in Excel and Word and an ""Office Agent"" in Copilot chat, with PowerPoint to follow.
Microsoft last week said it would bring Anthropic's models to Microsoft 365 Copilot to diversify beyond longtime partner OpenAI.
Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives, has positioned Claude for workplace use with guardrails it says reduce risky outputs. The company has been marketing Claude's coding and data-analysis skills to regulated industries and teams that want models to work across multiple software tools.
Krieger said the company's focus is on sustained, reliable performance over long tasks rather than short demos.

Under the new regulation, companies must pay a $100,000 annual fee per H-1B visa application. Following the announcement, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google urged employees abroad to return to the US immediately and keep any dependents from travelling abroad.
Although the administration quickly clarified that the changes would not impact current visa holders, the new fee directly contradicts the Trump administration’s attempt to grow US tech manufacturing. The US tech ecosystem has strongly benefited from its ability to attract global expertise and resources. Restrictive immigration policies not only stifle innovation but also incur millions of dollars in costs for companies trying to reshore production back to the US, potentially disincentivising companies from investing in the US tech industry.
What are H-1B visas?
The H-1B is the US’s largest non-immigrant temporary work visa program. It allows US companies to sponsor foreign employees in specialised fields, including IT, healthcare, and engineering. The scheme is capped at 65,000 visas per fiscal year, with successful applicants granted an initial three-year stay in the US that can be extended up to six years, followed by an opportunity to pursue permanent residency after these six years. According to January 2025 data from fwd.us, there are as many as 730,000 H-1B holders in the US, alongside an additional 550,000 dependents such as spouses and children.
The scheme is primarily used by US and Indian tech companies to bring high-skilled foreign employees to the US. Around 70% of H-1B visa recipients are from India, with another 10% from China. Amazon has the highest number of workers on H-1B visas, with more than 10,000 H-1B approved applications in H1 2025. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Microsoft, and Meta are also big employers of H-1B recipients, with more than 5,000 approvals each in H1 2025.
H-1B visas have been a point of contention in US politics for some time. Announcing the new $100,000 fee, which company sponsors will have to pay per visa recipient, the Trump administration said that the visas were being “abused” to undercut US wages and “outsource IT jobs to lower-paid foreign workers.”
US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataThe US tech sector relies on H-1B visas
Alongside its anti-immigration stance, the core of the Trump administration’s economic policy involves reindustrialising the US manufacturing sector. Advanced manufacturing industries, such as the tech and auto sectors, are incentivised to build factories and assembly plants in the US.
While the US has always had a strong auto manufacturing industry, its tech industry has outsourced manufacturing and services to low-cost countries for decades. As a result, the US labour market has limited expertise in those tech areas. The H-1B visa helps companies address that skills shortage by allowing them to import educated and skilled foreign workers.
The use of H-1B visas is even more relevant now that tech companies face high import tariffs and are encouraged to use government subsidies and tax credits from the 2022 CHIPS Act to reshore manufacturing back to the US. In 2024 and 2025 alone, Big Tech has pledged more than $1trn to reshoring efforts. The H-1B visa program helps bridge the gap between the tech industry’s plan to reindustrialise the US and the absence of high-skilled workers in the US tech manufacturing labour force.
As an example: TSMC, the world’s leader in advanced chip manufacturing, is building three chip fabrication plants in the US. This project should be hugely beneficial for the US’s position in advanced technologies, but the US offshored most of its chip manufacturing back in the 1980s and has never developed its advanced chip manufacturing capabilities. For this project’s success, TSMC will rely on high-skilled foreign labour, predominantly from Taiwan, to fill its manufacturing facilities.
Over time, the US academic system will adapt to new industry demands, attract funding, and offer the necessary training to support the domestic tech industry. However, this will not happen overnight. Beyond the skills gap, there are other financial hurdles facing the US labour market. The US tech industry began offshoring manufacturing due to the availability of skilled, cheap labour in countries like India. Today, US wages remain higher than foreign employee salaries.
Repercussions of restrictive domestic immigration policies on the tech sector
H-1B visas only make up around 5% of total immigration visas issued in the US annually. However, this shift towards more restrictive immigration control could seriously impact the US tech ecosystem. It may stifle US tech innovation if imported talent cannot work in the US. Notably, many US-based tech executives, like Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, moved to the US on student or work visas at the start of their careers.
In general, restrictive immigration policies have a detrimental impact on advanced manufacturers’ planned US investments. They increase the cost of moving production to the US and impact the existing labour force. Specifically, the Trump administration’s planned mass deportations will have implications for the cost and availability of labour for constructing factories, plants, and data centers to support the growth of the US tech sector. Altogether, restrictive immigration policies may discourage companies from moving production to the US, as the financial burden of reshoring outweighs the benefits of circumventing the trade restrictions or potential penalties of selling to the US market."

NBIS is an upcoming player in the AI-infrastructure market, while Microsoft Corporation MSFT is an established tech behemoth. Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform is the second-largest cloud platform after Amazon Web Services or the AWS platform. MSFT’s investment in OpenAI has made it the go-to platform for innovative AI applications.
Per an IDC report, spending on AI infrastructure is expected to exceed $200 billion by 2028. This uptrend in spending benefits both Microsoft and Nebius, but not equally. So, if an investor wants to make a smart buy in the AI infrastructure space, which stock stands out?
Should investors back a high-volatility pure play like NBIS, or do you lean into the stability and scale of Microsoft? Let us delve a little deeper to assess which is the better stock pick?
NBIS: High Risk, High Reward
NBIS is a specialized AI infrastructure, a neo cloud company with hyper revenue growth. In the last reported quarter, NBIS revenues surged 625% year over year to $105.1 million. AI cloud infrastructure revenues grew more than nine times year over year, driven by demand for copper GPUs and near-peak GPU utilization. With the new Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and its data center capacity expanding significantly in parallel, the company expects a substantial increase in sales by year-end.
The company expects the additional capacity, which comes online later in the year, to help it achieve updated ARR guidance. NBIS has raised its year-end ARR guidance to $900 million to $1.1 billion (previous estimate: $750 million to $1 billion), underscoring the strength of its contracted pipeline and near-term visibility. NBIS plans to secure 220 megawatts (“MW”) of connected power (active or ready for GPU deployment), including 100 MW of active power by 2025. The 1 GW capacity target by 2026 positions Nebius to capture incremental upside from accelerating demand for AI compute.
As companies build GPU-intensive data centers, Nebius emerges as one of the key beneficiaries. The recent deal with MSFT involves NBIS providing dedicated GPU capacity to Microsoft from its new data center in Vineland, NJ, beginning later this year. The GPU services will roll out in several tranches during 2025 and 2026, with the agreement valued at approximately $17.4 billion through 2031. Microsoft could also purchase extra services or capacity as per the terms of the deal, which would raise the total value to around $19.4 billion. While this represents NBIS’ first major long-term contract with a big tech firm, the company has indicated that more multi-faceted deals will likely follow, further solidifying its capacity and reach in the booming AI cloud space."

Plasma One integrates saving, spending, and sending functions into a single app, the company says. The neobank also offers up to 4% cash back on purchases with either physical or virtual cards, usable at more than 150 million merchants across 150 countries.
The app provides free and instant stablecoin transfers between users, while onboarding is designed to be quick, giving new customers a virtual card within minutes.
Plasma said it built the app for real-world use cases, pointing to exporters in Istanbul who secure digital dollars to protect earnings, merchants in Buenos Aires who pay staff in stablecoins, and commodity traders in Dubai who rely on them for cross-border transactions.

The neobank also acts as a proving ground for Plasma's broader ecosystem, which spans its blockchain, payment rails, and developer tools. According to its website, the Layer 1 blockchain can process over 1,000 transactions per second with sub-second block times.
The company reported more than $2.5 billion in stablecoin total value locked at launch.
The vertical integration across blockchain, tooling, and application allows end-to-end optimization. By being its own first customer, Plasma said it can refine its payment stack more quickly before opening it to external developers and institutions.
Its strategy is aimed at offering wallets, banks, and fintech apps a foundation that has been tested under global demand rather than in controlled environments. The external partners will eventually launch on Plasma using battle-tested technology rather than building from scratch, the company said."

Rezolve categorically rejects the misleading and inaccurate allegations contained in the report. The publication selectively misrepresents facts, recycles outdated information, and disregards our audited financials, SEC filings, and the reality of our operations.
A Report Driven by Self-Interest, Not Truth
Fuzzy Panda openly discloses that it holds a short position in Rezolve’s stock. Its business model is to issue sensationalised “research” that depresses share prices so it can profit from covering those short positions. This latest report is a clear example of that strategy built on mischaracterisations, inferences, and unfounded claims designed to spook genuine investors.
“Fuzzy Panda’s report is a self-serving attempt to inject misinformation into the market. It is designed to spook genuine investors into selling so that short-sellers can cover their positions and profit from aggravated rumours and inferences. We will not allow such tactics to distort the reality of our business,” said Daniel M. Wagner, Founder & CEO of Rezolve Ai. “Our fundamentals are strong, our partnerships with Microsoft, Google, and Tether are real, and we remain focused on executing our growth strategy and creating long-term value for shareholders.”
Revenue & ARR Integrity
Rezolve’s revenue and ARR are fully reflected in audited financial statements and SEC disclosures. We stand firmly behind these numbers, which have been reviewed by independent auditors.
Acquisitions & Growth
All acquisitions have been properly disclosed and are part of a deliberate strategy to expand our AI-commerce capabilities. To suggest otherwise is false and deliberately misleading.
Technology Leadership
Rezolve’s proprietary brainpowa LLM and AI-commerce platform are the result of years of research and development, with multiple patents granted and pending. Any assertion that Rezolve is merely a “wrapper” on another service is incorrect and ignores the scale of our differentiated infrastructure and customer deployments.
Governance & Related-Party Transactions
Rezolve has strong governance procedures, overseen by an independent Board and external advisers. All material transactions have been appropriately approved and disclosed in line with Nasdaq and SEC requirements.
Transparency and Next Steps
Rezolve remains focused on delivering value to customers and shareholders. We will continue to provide updates where appropriate and material, but do not intend to respond to every short-seller allegation. Our priority remains long-term growth and shareholder value."

finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-29T13:30:02,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Microsoft (MSFT): Should You Buy?,"The average brokerage recommendation (ABR) for Microsoft (MSFT) is equivalent to a Buy. The overly optimistic recommendations of Wall Street analysts make the effectiveness of this highly sought-after metric questionable. So, is it worth buying the stock?",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1b043e95e772f065da4afe22077a65a8a7c9da75b76bf3850f4898dc3333c576,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133002129.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133002129.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133002129.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?
Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Microsoft (MSFT).
Microsoft currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.23, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 48 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.23 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.
Of the 48 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and five are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 10.4% of all recommendations.
Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MSFT
Check price target & stock forecast for Microsoft here>>>
While the ABR calls for buying Microsoft, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.
Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.
In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.
Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.
Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR

SAN FRANCISCO, September 29, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Flywl, the cloud marketplace platform for enterprise software procurement, today announced the launch of FUID (Flywl Unique ID), a standardized, marketplace-agnostic identifier for software products to bring clarity and speed to cloud marketplace discovery, fixing broken data. It gives every listing a single, trusted identity — clean, consistent, and verified across platforms, systems, and teams.
In today’s marketplace ecosystem, software is noisy. Products show up under inconsistent names, incomplete metadata, missing version numbers, or dead-end SKUs. Listings are duplicated across platforms, and buyers waste hours trying to verify what’s real, current, and purchasable.
FUID changes that. By assigning every product a single, structured identity, FUID brings order to the chaos. It normalizes product and company naming, applies versioning intelligence, eliminates duplicates, and makes listings live, searchable, and trusted across Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Marketplace systems. One product. One ID. Recognized everywhere.
""FUID isn’t just a backend fix — it’s a complete reframe,"" said Ankur Srivastava, CEO of Flywl. ""For buyers, it means instant clarity; for sellers, it means fewer blockers; and for the ecosystem, it’s a new standard. Search once, find it everywhere.""
FUID developed a solution to a real-world data challenge encountered during Flywl’s internship program. A team of top university interns, guided by Flywl’s leadership, confronted the inconsistencies of data across enterprise systems. With their contributions, Flywl filed a patent for FUID, establishing it as proprietary infrastructure for identity governance. Together, they helped architect the first steps toward solving a $467B data problem.
The FUID engine is designed for smart discovery and fast validation across procurement, IT, and growth teams. Users can search by company name, product name, or FUID — even with typos. Here’s how it works:
-
Search & Match: Smart suggestions and ""Did you mean?"" prompts help avoid errors, while built-in version logic flags whether records already exist or need to be created.
-
Generate & Standardize: New entries are instantly structured and tagged, with moderation workflows in place to keep out spam and ensure clean, high-confidence data.
-
Ask AI: A built-in AI assistant powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) lets users ask product-specific questions and get immediate, contextual answers.
-
Data Integrity: FUID search can also be embedded on public-facing websites, allowing teams to surface verified listings and reduce friction at the top of the funnel."

Strategic Partnerships with Microsoft and Google Driving Enterprise Adoption
NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rezolve Ai (NASDAQ: RZLV), the enterprise AI-commerce company, today issued a statement to clarify recent misconceptions surrounding its latest SEC filing and to reaffirm the company’s strong financial position, strategic partnerships, and customer traction.
No Dilution in Recent F-3 Filing
On September 25, Rezolve filed a Form F-3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to re-register for resale certain shares that had previously been registered for resale on Form F-1, a more administratively burdensome form for the Company. The registered shares were already outstanding shares held by investors. No new shares were issued in connection with the Form F-3 and the Form F-3 is not an indication of imminent selling activity by these shareholders. This filing is an administrative requirement to allow prior investors flexibility and to ease the administrative costs of maintaining the registration statements imposed on the Company, and it does not create dilution for existing Rezolve shareholders.
As previously reported on September 26, Rezolve recently completed a $200 million capital raise, further strengthening Rezolve’s balance sheet and intended to fund its global expansion strategy. As previously disclosed and agreed in the definitive documentation, Rezolve intends to register for resale on Form F-3 the shares issued in connection with such capital raise to provide flexibility for the investors in the coming days. This filing is fully consistent with the Company’s previously disclosed plans.
Truly Strategic Partnerships with Microsoft and Google
Rezolve reaffirmed that its partnerships with Microsoft and Google go far beyond marketplace listings. Senior executives Nick Parker of Microsoft and Tara Brady of Google have publicly described Rezolve as a strategic partner in driving the future of retail AI (Microsoft video | Google video). These partnerships involve joint go-to-market commitments, deep technical integration, and coordinated customer engagements across global retail and enterprise sectors.
Addressing the Industry’s Hallucination Problem
One of the most critical challenges in AI adoption is the risk of hallucinations. Rezolve’s proprietary brainpowa™ LLM has been engineered to achieve zero hallucinations, delivering reliable, accurate outputs in enterprise deployments (see demonstration). This differentiator is central to building enterprise trust in Rezolve’s platform."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-29T11:00:00,"Got $5,000? 5 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",Demand for artificial intelligence hardware and services isn't slowing down. These companies are already tapping into it.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6987b623d5c2f4082bf7bd4e4ba1d830189447372df526f1a183194fb2f7b838,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/got-5000-5-tech-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-lon/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/got-5000-5-tech-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-lon/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/got-5000-5-tech-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-the-lon/,fool.com,200,,"Technology stocks have been on a tear lately, mostly due to the industry's embrace of artificial intelligence. AI could add an estimated $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030, according to PwC, as companies integrate AI into everything from cloud computing to virtual assistants and e-commerce.
With nearly every tech company attempting to ride the AI wave right now, it can be difficult to parse out which will truly benefit and which are just following the pack. Here are five that are leading the way and will likely be good investments for years to come.
1. Nvidia
There's one big reason why Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is on every AI stock list: The company's semiconductors are in an estimated 70% to 95% of artificial intelligence data centers. That gives Nvidia a massive advantage over other chip designers and ensures that as companies invest in AI, Nvidia will likely be one of the biggest winners.
AI data centers are Nvidia's bread and butter, and in the most recent quarter, sales from the segment jumped 56% to $41.1 billion. More growth could be on the way as companies continue to upgrade and expand their AI footprint, which is why Nvidia CFO Colette Kress estimates global data center spending could reach up to $4 trillion by 2030. With Nvidia's leading position in AI chips, the company's future continues to look bright.
2. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) has a multi-pronged approach to benefiting from AI. Its early moves to integrate ChatGPT's platform into its suite of services have already paid off, with millions of users now using the company's Copilot AI services. That's helped increase Microsoft's total sales, which jumped 18% in Q4 to $76 billion and helped non-GAAP earnings rise 24% to $3.65 per share.
But the real long-term opportunity for Microsoft is likely its cloud computing business, Azure, which already has 20% of the public cloud market. As demand for AI services increases, companies need more powerful cloud computing platforms. Azure is already benefiting -- generating $75 billion in fiscal 2024, a 34% increase from last year. And with global AI cloud computing revenue estimated to reach $2 trillion by 2030, Microsoft should be able to tap this market for years to come.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%), also known as TSMC, is a semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse that produces some of the world's most advanced processors. The company has a near monopoly in the AI processor manufacturing market, with close to 90% of advanced processors made by the company.
That lead has been a boon to TSMC's bottom line. The company's earnings popped 67% in Q2 to $2.47 per American depositary receipt (ADR). And in case you're worried about demand slowing down any time soon, consider that Taiwan Semiconductor's management said that its artificial intelligence revenue will double this year, compared to 2024.
4. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) may be one of the lesser-known names on this list, but it would be a mistake to overlook this AI powerhouse. The company designs application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for AI data centers that are used by Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), Meta Platforms, and others, and management says AI sales will reach $6.2 billion in the current quarter, up 19% sequentially.
The company is benefiting from the AI boom and profits are rising quickly -- with non-GAAP earnings jumping 36% to $1.69 in Q3. Broadcom estimates that more growth from AI is on the way too, with AI revenue estimated to reach up to $90 billion annually by 2027 -- a 650% increase from last year.
5. Alphabet
Alphabet's artificial intelligence niche can be found in its increasingly popular Gemini chatbot, which has an estimated 400 million monthly active users. While there have been concerns that AI chatbots will take ad revenue away from the company, that doesn't appear to be the case yet -- Google ad sales were $71.3 billion in Q2, a 10% increase from the year-ago quarter.
Creating an advanced AI chatbot that helps keep Google users wrapped in the company's ecosystem is smart, but it's only one of Alphabet's opportunities. The other comes from its Google Cloud services, which has about 13% of the public cloud market. Like Microsoft, Google is benefiting from the increasing need for AI cloud services, which led to sales from Google Cloud rising 32% in Q2 to $13.6 billion in the most recent quarter.
With all of the tech companies on this list already carving out their niches in artificial intelligence, each one would be worth putting some of your $5,000 toward -- and holding for the long term."

Two former Microsoft executives view it as a problem — and they have started Maximor to replace spreadsheets with AI agents for the grunt work finance teams perform.
Excel spreadsheets are everywhere in finance. Even with dedicated ERP, CRM, and billing systems, many mid-sized companies and enterprises still export transactions into Excel for manual reconciliation. Teams often treat spreadsheets as makeshift databases, sometimes even relying on functions like VLOOKUP — a function used to pull matching numbers from one table into another — to line up figures across files.
Maximor aims to replace finance teams’ reliance on Excel with its AI system, and has emerged from stealth with a $9 million seed round led by Foundation Capital.
The startup uses a network of AI agents that connect directly to ERP, CRM, and billing systems to continuously pull transactions. That, co-founder and CEO Ramnandan Krishnamurthy (pictured above, right) said in an exclusive interview, helps unify operational and financial data and provide real-time financial visibility — instead of waiting until month-end to sort it all out.
The approach should help reduce the time needed for the month-end close, he believes. For instance, Maximor says that proptech firm Rently, one of its early customers, cut its closing from eight days to four and avoided two additional accounting hires. Rently was able to redirect nearly half its team’s time to strategic work after using Maximor’s agentic platform, Rently’s CFO Dustin Neel said.
Maximor’s financial agents plug into ERPs like NetSuite and Intacct, accounting tools such as QuickBooks and Zoho Books, and a range of payroll, CRM, and other SaaS platforms. Once connected, they generate workpapers, reviewer notes, and audit trails — helping streamline audits.
Although Maximor aims to reduce reliance on Excel, it still allows teams to export reconciled data into spreadsheets — a format that many auditors and finance staff prefer before sending numbers to audit.
“We’re interoperable with Excel on that part, as our platform does the work and can present it in our own UI or in Excel directly,” Krishnamurthy told TechCrunch.
In addition to its AI agents, Maximor offers human accountants as a human-in-the-loop option for its AI work, or as an accounting service for companies without in-house finance teams. It’s an interesting failsafe, given that Maximor pitches itself as an AI startup that automates this work. Relying on humans may seem at odds with that promise."

By slashing interest rates to near-zero levels and expanding its balance sheet via quantitative easing (QE), the Fed injected trillions of dollars into the financial system. This liquidity tsunami didn’t just stabilize markets; it supercharged them.
Nowhere was this more evident than in the tech sector, where companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. used the cheap capital to innovate and give their growth a good boost via good old-fashioned financial engineering.
The buyback boom: Financial engineering on steroids
Apple alone has repurchased US$704-billion worth of its own stock over the past decade. That figure exceeds the market capitalization of all but 13 companies globally.
Microsoft, meanwhile, spent US$199 billion on buybacks during the same period. Meta and Alphabet Inc. added another US$207 billion and US$317 billion, respectively. In total, just four tech giants deployed more than US$1.4 trillion on buybacks.
These buybacks reduced share counts, artificially boosted earnings per share (EPS) and helped sustain lofty valuations. In essence, companies used Fed-fuelled liquidity to build new products or expand operations and to juice their stock prices, like athletes on performance-enhancing drugs.
Enter AI: A new kind of financial loop
Now, with the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in full swing, we’re witnessing a new form of circular financial engineering. Companies aren’t just selling products; they’re investing in their customers to ensure those customers can afford to buy more of their products to justify forward growth and implied valuations.
Take Nvidia Corp., OpenAI Inc. and Oracle Corp. Nvidia recently announced a US$100-billion investment in OpenAI to build out 10 gigawatts of AI data centres. That’s equivalent to the output of 10 nuclear reactors and involves deploying four million to five million graphics processing units (GPUs), essentially Nvidia’s entire annual production.
But here’s the twist: OpenAI will use that capital to buy Nvidia’s chips. Nvidia gets equity in OpenAI and OpenAI gets the hardware it needs to scale. It’s a self-referential loop as Nvidia invests in OpenAI, which then turns around and spends that money on Nvidia’s products.
Oracle is also in on the game, committing US$40 billion to purchase Nvidia chips for OpenAI’s Texas-based Stargate data centre. Oracle will lease the facility to OpenAI under a 15-year agreement, effectively financing its own future revenues."

The second edition of GlobalData’s ESG Executive Briefing states that carbon offset purchases are ramping up and that 2030 net-zero targets “are just about still achievable.” However, it adds that, while AI-fuelled emissions growth has begun to slow, Big Tech’s announced capital expenditure plans suggest this will be temporary, with data centre construction to accelerate.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
As such, the report says: “The key question for climate targets will be whether enough carbon offsets can be bought to match emissions in 2030 and beyond. In its 2024 reporting year, Microsoft massively increased its offset purchases, contracting an amount above its full-year Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.”
Microsoft is alongside Google, Meta and Apple in having committed to achieving carbon neutrality across their value chains by 2030. Its example demonstrates that purchasing carbon offsets at high volumes is feasible – but contracted offsets must still be delivered, and maintaining a pipeline of offsets to the high standards for purchasing set by Microsoft and Google poses a challenge.
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are another tool being employed by Big Tech in pursuing emissions targets. These allow firms to fund renewable projects in exchange for securing clean energy to help meet their sustainability goals.
“PPAs will continue, and there will be more for small modular reactors,” the report states. “Their ability to provide consistent power makes them a good match for data centres, which run 24 hours a day. Big Tech has already signed PPAs for small modular reactors, but most will not be up and running until 2030 or later.”

Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
By GlobalDataGlobalData adds that other barriers to PPAs are tariffs on equipment made in China and delays in connecting new plants to power grids.
The report states that the long-term challenge for Big Tech will be reducing Scope 3 emissions.
“Expanding net-zero strategies to companies across the value chain will be needed to reduce Scope 3 emissions,” it explains. “Big Tech must help smaller suppliers sign their own PPAs for low-carbon energy. Suppliers to Big Tech can expect procurement standards on emissions to tighten over time, requiring suppliers to achieve emissions reduction at or below a certain emissions intensity.”"

(Reuters) -Belgian chip research hub imec will appoint Patrick Vandenameele as its new chief executive with current CEO Luc Van den hove becoming chairman, the company told Reuters on Monday.
Belgium's imec, one of the world's top semiconductor R&D firms, has made the change to help it adapt to the changing demands of artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaking, Vandenameele said in an interview.
The rising influence of AI is reshaping the company's priorities as it seeks to deepen its ties with cloud computing providers.
Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta (META.O), and Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O), known as hyperscalers, control about half of the world's data‑center capacity and are rapidly expanding their market share as AI build‑outs surges.
This AI boom has created demand for new, more efficient chips to fill their multibillion-dollar data centres.
""They are screaming for solutions to scale up, scale out, and to do this at a sustainable power balance. Power is the key problem in this case,"" Vandenameele said.
Belgium's imec matches the most advanced and expensive tools of makers like ASML and Applied Materials, with chipmakers and designers like TSMC, Nvidia, Apple and Google.
VENTURE & CHIPS ACT
Vandenameele, 52, began his career at imec in the 1990s, co‑founding four startups—three based on imec technology before taking on senior leadership roles at firms like Qorvo, and Huawei.
Under his leadership, the company plans to launch more spin-offs based on its technology. It will give start-ups earlier access to its chipmaking lines and help European deep tech firms overcome its funding and manufacturing hurdles, he said.
""The barrier for these small companies to get access to leading-edge technology is usually very high because they need to compete with huge companies to get access to these fabs"", Vandenameele said.
The Belgium-based lab is building a sub-2 nanometer chip pilot line, using funding of 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) from the European Union's act, to give European tech firms access to manufacturing technology that would otherwise be economically unattainable.
The research organisation is closely associated with top lithography equipment maker ASML, which was founded the same year across the nearby Dutch border, in Veldhoven.

On September 22, the company confirmed plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. In addition, the company is to supply the AI startup with data center chips as the two companies look to capitalize on the AI boom.
The $100 billion investment will give Nvidia a financial stake in the prominent AI company, which is already one of its biggest and most important customers. The investment will also provide the Microsoft-backed startup with the cash and access it needs to purchase advanced chips, which are necessary to strengthen its prospects in the burgeoning segment.
Nvidia is to start investing in OpenAI for non-voting shares once the deal closes. The two companies have also signed a letter of intent for the deployment of 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems.
“Everything starts with compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor giant that develops graphics processing units used in data centers, computers, and gaming consoles. It also creates high-performance hardware and software platforms, like its CUDA software ecosystem, to power Artificial Intelligence (AI), graphics, and other complex computational tasks.

The S&P 500 added 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%. All three are near their all-time highs set a week ago.
Big Tech stocks ticked higher to lead the way. Amazon added 1.1% following its 5.1% drop last week, and Microsoft rose 0.6% to recover some of its 1.2% decline. While their moves were modest, they were still two of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500 Monday because they’re two of Wall Street’s most valuable stocks.
On the losing end of the market were companies in the oil business, which were hurt by slumping crude prices. Drops of 2.6% for Exxon Mobil and 2.5% for Chevron were two of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.
This week’s highlight is scheduled to arrive on Friday, when a report will be due about how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed last month. The hope is that it will be balanced enough to keep the Federal Reserve on track to continue cutting interest rates.
The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more through the end of next year. That’s critical for investors because U.S. stocks have shot to records from a low in April in large part because of expectations for several cuts from the Fed. Easier rates can give the job market a boost and make investors more willing to pay high prices for stocks and other investments.
If Friday’s job numbers prove too strong, they could make the Fed less willing to cut rates. That could hurt stocks, which already face criticism that they’ve become too expensive following their big rally. If the job numbers are too weak, they could mean a recession that would hurt stock prices on its own.
One wild card may pop up in the interim: The U.S. government is nearing a deadline that could result in its shutdown.
The United States has already had many such shutdowns in the past, which have caused only minimal waves for the U.S. stock market and for the economy. But another shutdown could delay the collection and release of economic data, such as on jobs and inflation. Without those reports, increasing uncertainty on Wall Street could make markets more twitchy.
This shutdown may also be different because the White House may push for large-scale firings of federal workers this time around.
“We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility,” according to Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute."

The quantum computing threat to Bitcoin may be more urgent than some think, according to Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko.
""I feel like 50/50, within five years, there is a quantum breakthrough,"" Yakovenko said at the All-In Summit 2025 earlier this month. ""We should migrate Bitcoin to a quantum-resistant signature scheme.""
The debate over quantum computing’s potential threat to Bitcoin has intensified recently, spurred by advances such as Google’s Willow. The fear is that quantum computers will soon be able to run Shor's algorithm, which is widely believed to have the potential to break encryption systems, such as elliptic curve cryptography. Elliptic curve cryptography secures Bitcoin wallets.

While some argue that the threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography remains distant, Yakovenko cautions that the rate of AI advancement suggests otherwise.
""I would try to encourage folks to speed things up,"" he said, stressing that ideas were moving from research paper to implementation at an ""astounding"" rate. He also pointed to Google and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) moving to quantum-resistant stacks as a sign of the times.
But it will likely not be as easy for Bitcoin to upgrade as it is for Google and Apple. Bitcoin does not have the centralized management of Google and Apple. The network also lacks an established governance structure and a recognized development team that can push upgrades like most other blockchains.
The network’s less structured governance means that determining consensus on upgrades is challenging. While this ensures that the network is more reliable and adds to its decentralization lore, it can arguably be a handicap in urgent situations.

‘Bitcoin Is Resilient'
While Yakovenko warned of the risks posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin, he still hailed the network for its resilience against current threats.
""I think Bitcoin is resilient to these entities collapsing,"" he said in response to questions raised about how a collapse of Bitcoin treasury firms such as MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) could affect the asset. These firms have accumulated substantial amounts of BTC using several leverage strategies, sparking sustainability fears and questions about the potential market impact if they collapse."

A heartbreaking call to a recent episode of “The Ramsey Show” revealed a family tragedy that spiraled into financial ruin, elder abuse and a legal mess. Wendy told Dave Ramsey and John Delony that her sister financially exploited their elderly parents, drained everything they had and left their home in such poor condition it looked like “a meth house that squatters got into.”
Sister Took Control Before COVID
“There’s no easy way to say this, so I’m just going to jump right into it,” Wendy began. Her sister moved in with their parents just before COVID and slowly took over their home and finances. “My sister stole everything from my parents in their senior years,” she said. Wendy believes her mother died as a result of neglect, and her father, now in late-stage dementia, was hospitalized just days later.

Wendy said her sister maxed out their credit cards, cleaned out their bank accounts, and burned through a $450,000 reverse mortgage. “[She] just abused them because they weren’t mentally and physically able to do anything about it,” she said.
“What a lovely girl,” Ramsey responded sarcastically. Delony added, “That’s heartbreaking.”
A Fight To Protect Her Dad
After her mother’s death and her father’s hospitalization, Wendy and her husband stepped in. It took her seven months of legal fights to gain conservatorship and protect what little was left. “He ended up homeless and living with my husband and I,” she said. They cared for him at home until his health declined and he was moved to a secure memory care facility.
Despite the house being trashed, it sold at auction and left $130,000 in surplus funds. Wendy was granted control of that money, but it immediately disqualified her father from Medicaid, forcing the family to switch to private pay for care. She used some of the funds to reimburse herself for legal expenses and care-related costs.

A Will That Didn’t Count
The family’s will was not notarized and was deemed invalid under state law. “Every banking institution and everyone we dealt with said that it wasn’t valid,” Wendy said. That means, legally, her father’s assets would be split equally among the three siblings—including the sister who caused the harm.
Ramsey told Wendy to make sure the money is spent legally and completely. “Go prepay the nursing home with the conservator’s permission and put the rest in your pocket to recoup all of your time, your expenses, your legal fees,” he said. “I’m going to go buy him an $80,000 bed and put it in there. I’m serious. There’s not going to be any money left.”"

IonQ (IONQ) is making a deliberate bet on the commercial viability of quantum computing within this decade, positioning itself to be among the first to scale the technology. The company is deliberately unprofitable today, investing heavily in trapped-ion quantum processors, systems integration, and intellectual property to secure a leadership position, attracting interest from Amazon, Microsoft, and U.S. defense agencies.
Revenue grew 95% YoY to $43 million, and with roughly $340 million in cash and zero long-term debt, IonQ has the runway to fund R&D for several years. Despite this, the business model remains highly speculative, with net margins of -770%, free cash flow margins of -287%, and SG&A at 545% of revenue. Most revenue comes from experimental use cases and government partnerships, as quantum computing is still far from scalable for enterprise adoption, and profitability is not expected through 2027.
Valuation reflects this speculation, with a price-to-sales ratio of 206x and EV/EBITDA of -42x, pricing in commercial dominance that has yet to materialize. Technically, the stock appears to be peaking at the top of a corrective rally, completing a five-wave impulse and an ABC correction, with key resistance near $47–$49 and support at $44.75. Failure to hold this support could trigger a deeper wave toward $34 or lower, while a breakout above $49.90 could signal a renewed upward impulse, potentially targeting $54–$58 if driven by breakthroughs or partnerships.
For traders, this setup may offer short-term opportunities, while medium- to long-term investors should exercise caution, recognizing IonQ as a vision trade rather than a value investment. The risk-reward remains skewed, with substantial upside possible if quantum technology scales commercially, but downside is significant until clearer proof of progress or profitability emerges.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on IonQ, Inc. (IONQ) by Maestroszq in October 2024, which highlighted the company’s rapid revenue growth, patent portfolio, and scalable quantum hardware as key drivers. The stock has appreciated approximately 516% since coverage, as the thesis played out with rising market recognition. Investing With Purpose shares a similar view but emphasizes speculative fundamentals, high cash burn, and technical risks."

On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.
Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI
This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.
It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.
The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.
OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs."

The woman explained that her commitment to pay for her siblings' college came from seeing their father struggle financially. She said that both were ""thrilled"" when she pledged support, and she worked in tech to set money aside for their future education.
Her father's remarriage complicated matters. His wife has two children, ages 16 and 15, who are also preparing for college. He told the original poster that she should ""be fair"" and not ""pick favorites."" She refused, saying that she had no relationship with them and never made them a promise.
Accusations Of Being Cold
The OP said that her father accused her of ""punishing"" his wife's children because they were not biologically related, which created a rift in the family.

She added that her stepmother insisted, ""love makes a family,"" and argued that all four teenagers should benefit equally. ""My siblings are upset too,"" the OP wrote. ""They feel like their future is being stolen.""

The post drew strong reactions on Reddit. Many sided with the OP's decision and said that her father's demand was unreasonable.
""You're definitely NTA, OP. They should be ashamed of trying to pirate your goodwill as well as your hard-earned money,"" one comment read.

Constellation Energy Group (CEG), headquartered in Baltimore, is the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in the U.S., with 32 GW of capacity—70% from nuclear and the balance from natural gas, hydro, wind, solar, and storage. Its nuclear fleet alone provides ~20% of all U.S. nuclear generation, making it the single largest source of carbon-free power in the country. CEG counts hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google among its key customers and recently announced a 20-year deal with Meta beginning in 2027.
The company also expects to close its acquisition of Calpine in Q4 2025 and has authorized a $400 million share repurchase program, reflecting strong capital allocation discipline. In Q2, revenue grew 11.3% to $6.1 billion, while GAAP EPS rose 3.5% to $2.67. Nuclear output declined modestly to 45,170 GWh due to unplanned outages, but CEG continues to operate at a 94% capacity factor, underpinned by heavy investment in digital optimization through AI dispatch systems and digital twin modeling, which are designed to enhance margins and operational efficiency.
Growth prospects are further supported by secular demand from AI, electrification, and reshoring, alongside favorable policy tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act. While CEG trades cheaply on sales, its 33.8x 2025 EPS multiple is elevated relative to peers like NextEra, Duke, and Southern, though its scale and carbon-free focus justify a premium. With EPS growth forecast at 9.1% in FY25 and 18% in FY26, CEG offers a compelling combination of stability, growth, and strategic positioning in clean energy despite near-term technical downside risks.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG) by jackandjillonthehill in March 2025, which highlighted margin expansion, strong ROE, and undervaluation despite nuclear power volatility. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 47% since our coverage. This is because rising demand and higher pricing played out. The thesis still stands as Oliver | MMMT Wealth shares a similar but emphasizes on strategic growth drivers.
Constellation Energy Corporation is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 79 hedge fund portfolios held CEG at the end of the second quarter which was 83 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

But if you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft on Nadella's first day on the job, your investment would be worth $140,000 today and paying out nearly $1,000 in annual dividends.
That same investment in an S&P 500 index fund would only be worth about $38,000 today. Let's see why Microsoft crushed the market -- and if it's still a good stock to buy.
How did Microsoft become a growth stock again?
Under Ballmer, Microsoft struggled to keep pace with Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), Alphabet's Google (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in the mobile and cloud markets. Its Windows and Office products still relied on periodic desktop upgrades, and its Windows Phones couldn't keep up with iPhones and Androids.
But after Nadella took over, Microsoft adopted an ambitious ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy. It transformed its Office desktop software into cloud-based services, expanded its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, and integrated those upgrades into Windows. It also scrapped its Windows Phone program, launched iOS and Android versions of its top productivity apps, rolled out more Surface devices, and expanded its Xbox business with new products and bold acquisitions.
Microsoft launched more AI services to process all the data that flowed through that sprawling ecosystem. It also started to accumulate a big stake in OpenAI -- the creator of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications -- in 2019. It then integrated OpenAI's tools into its Bing search engine, Azure's cloud platform, and its Copilot AI services.
Microsoft's aggressive investments in the mobile, cloud, and AI markets initially squeezed its margins. But from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2025 (which ended this June), its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%, its gross margin expanded from 64.7% to 68.8%, and its earnings per share (EPS) increased at a CAGR of 5%. It maintained that momentum even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts rattled the global economy.
Most of Microsoft's recent growth was driven by its cloud-based services. Azure is now the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Office suite -- which was rebranded as Microsoft 365 in 2020 -- holds a near-duopoly in the productivity software market with Google Workspace.
Why will Microsoft keep growing?
From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 15% and 16%, respectively. That robust growth should be driven by the secular expansion of the cloud and AI markets. More companies should migrate their data to its public cloud, hybrid cloud, and edge deployments, while the expansion of its data centers should support the development of even more powerful AI applications across its ecosystem.
Microsoft still faces intense competition from Amazon and Google in the cloud and AI markets, but it will likely draw in big companies that compete against those two tech giants in the e-commerce, streaming media, and digital advertising markets. Its Xbox gaming business, which absorbed Activision Blizzard and many other top game publishers, could also generate more recurring revenues with its Game Pass and Cloud Gaming services. The company also still held $94.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2025. That gives it plenty of room to expand its business via more acquisitions or buy back more shares to boost its EPS.
Is it the right time to buy Microsoft's stock?
Microsoft's stock doesn't look cheap at 33 times this year's earnings, but the robust growth of its cloud and AI businesses might justify that higher valuation. Even if it trades at a more modest 30 times forward earnings and it merely matches analysts' expectations through fiscal 2028, its stock could still rise about 26% to $645 over the next two years.
That return might not dazzle growth-oriented investors, but it would likely keep Microsoft's stock ahead of the S&P 500, which has generated an average annual return of 10% ever since its inception. Therefore, I think it's still a great stock for long-term investors to buy, hold, and forget."

Here’s what went down 25 years ago that ultimately burst the dot-com boom
The comparison between today’s artificial intelligence frenzy and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s has become impossible to ignore. As AI companies command valuations reaching into the hundreds of billions—minting dozens of new billionaires in 2025 alone—and tech giants pour unprecedented sums into data centers, investors and analysts are asking a similar question: Are we watching history repeat itself?
The similarities are striking. Like the internet companies of two decades ago, AI firms today attract massive investments based on transformative potential rather than current profitability. Global corporate AI investment reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to research from Stanford University, with the sector growing thirteenfold since 2014. Meanwhile, America’s biggest tech companies—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capital expenditures this year alone, much of it for AI infrastructure.
Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company is valued at approximately $500 billion despite launching ChatGPT just two years ago, acknowledges the parallels. “
Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”
But what actually caused the dot-com bubble to burst in March 2000, and what lessons does it offer for today’s AI boom? Let’s take a stroll down memory lane—or, if you weren’t born yet, some plain ole history.
The perfect storm of 2000
The dot-com crash wasn’t triggered by a single event, but rather a convergence of factors that exposed fundamental weaknesses in the late 1990s tech economy. The first critical blow came from the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates multiple times throughout 1999 and 2000. The federal funds rate climbed from around 4.7% in early 1999 to 6.5% by May 2000, making speculative investments less attractive as investors could earn higher returns from safer bonds.
The second catalyst was a broader economic recession that began in Japan in March 2000, triggering global market fears and accelerating the flight from risky assets. This one-two punch of higher rates and global uncertainty caused investors to reassess the astronomical valuations of internet companies.
But the underlying problem ran much deeper: Most dot-com companies had fundamentally flawed business models. Commerce One reached a $21 billion valuation despite minimal revenue. TheGlobe.com, founded by two Cornell students with $15,000 in startup capital, saw its stock price jump 606% on its first day of trading to $63.50, despite having no revenue beyond venture funding. Pets.com burned through $300 million in just 268 days before declaring bankruptcy."

Many of those stocks -- including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon -- were in the tech sector. Amazon, the top cloud infrastructure company, also became the first online retailer to join the 12-zero club.
Yet not a single brick-and-mortar retailer has joined that elite group. Could Costco Wholesale (COST 0.85%), with a market cap of $420 billion, cross that threshold in the near future?
How fast has Costco grown since its public debut?
Costco, the world's largest warehouse club retailer, went public at a split-adjusted price of $1.67 per share on Dec. 5, 1985. Today, it trades at about $950 -- a $1,000 investment in its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth nearly $569,000 today and pay out more than $3,100 in annual dividends. That 56,786% gain over the past 40 years was driven by its constant construction of new warehouses, its rising number of cardholders, and its high renewal rates.
From fiscal 1985 (which ended in September 1985) to fiscal 2024, Costco's number of warehouses increased from 11 to 891 locations, its number of cardholders jumped from 1.3 million to 136.8 million, and its annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from $1.1 billion to $254.4 billion.
How does Costco keep expanding?
Costco generates most of its profits from its high-margin membership fees, which allows it to sell a lot of its products at low, break-even, or even loss-leading margins. It also leverages its scale to negotiate favorable bulk rates with its suppliers, and it promotes its own Kirkland private-label products as a cheaper alternative to name-brand products.
Costco carries a narrower selection of products than superstores like Walmart, but it constantly rotates them to draw its shoppers back for return visits. Its gas stations, food court, vision center, and other ancillary services reinforce that strategy. So as long as Costco keeps growing its comparable store sales, opening new warehouses, gaining new cardholders, and locking them in with high renewal rates, its business will flourish. All of those core growth metrics headed in the right direction over the past few years -- even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds rattled the global economy.

Costco weathered the pandemic because it remained a top destination for stocking up on household goods, while inflation drove more cost-conscious shoppers to its stores. It raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years last September to offset the inflationary pressure on its margins, but that price hike didn't impact its growth.
Costco hasn't reported its full-year earnings for fiscal 2025 yet, but it ended the third quarter with 142.8 million cardholders and a healthy global renewal rate of 90.2%. For the full year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow 8% and 9%, respectively.
Could Costco become a trillion-dollar company?
From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Costco's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 8% and 10%, respectively. That growth should be fueled by its ongoing overseas expansion, its rising e-commerce sales, and upgrades for its ancillary services.
We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Costco has a proven track record of expanding through bear and bull markets. But it isn't a bargain at 47 times next year's earnings -- presumably because too many investors bought it as a safe haven play in this choppy market. If Costco matches analysts' expectations, continues to grow its EPS at a CAGR of 10% over the following eight years, and trades at a more reasonable 30 times earnings, its stock could rise nearly 50% to $1,420 over the next 10 years.
That would be a decent gain, but it would only boost its market cap to $630 billion. It could also underperform the S&P 500, which has generated an average annual return of about 10% since its inception. So while Costco is still a stable investment, it's getting overheated and probably won't become a trillion-dollar retailer within the next decade."

Nvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.
While Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.
In past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.
The extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.
In addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.
Tangled webs of investment
Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently.
The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back."

Established cloud giants like Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) Azure, and Alphabet's (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) Google Cloud serve a variety of general compute customers. However, Oracle's data centers are specifically designed for AI.
Oracle is a good example of why lacking a first-mover advantage isn't a deal-breaker. Oracle's data centers are newer and faster. And it's bringing over 70 of them online in just a few years, which is why it expects OCI growth to reach an inflection point in fiscal 2027.
When it comes to high-performance computing, OCI is magnitudes faster than alternatives -- saving customers time and money for AI workflows. Oracle achieves this advantage by embedding native versions of its database services into the big three clouds to boost performance. This is why I'm predicting Oracle will become the top cloud for AI by 2031, making it one of the best cloud computing stocks to buy for risk-tolerant investors.
2. Oracle is landing major deals with leading hyperscalers
Oracle is winning high-value contracts across the AI landscape, from Meta Platforms to OpenAI. Reports are that Oracle's $20 billion deal with Meta involves a multiyear agreement for training and deploying Meta's AI models.
The OpenAI deal is the backbone of Oracle's five-year roadmap. But it depends on OpenAI raising money -- as OpenAI is unlikely to turn free cash flow positive anytime soon.
Fortunately, that doesn't seem to be a problem. OpenAI plans to transition from a nonprofit to a Public Benefit Corporation, which is a corporation with philanthropic and community impact requirements rather than a purely profit-driven objective. On Sept. 22, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) announced up to a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to power next-generation AI models. This is great news for Oracle, as its cloud growth depends on OpenAI's financial stability.
On Sept. 23, OpenAI said that it is teaming up with Oracle and SoftBank on five new AI data centers under its Stargate AI infrastructure platform. In that press release, OpenAI put a dollar figure of over $300 billion on its 4.5-gigawatt (GW) Stargate capacity partnership with Oracle. The company also said that Stargate's capacity will be nearly 7 GW and over $400 billion of investment over the next three years, and reach $500 billion of committed investment, or 10 GW of committed capacity, before the end of the year. This 10 GW number is the same figure used by Nvidia in its strategic partnership announcement, which aims to invest progressively in OpenAI as each GW is deployed.
This is all great news for Oracle, which will collaborate with Nvidia to develop data center and cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI. This powerhouse of a partnership provides a clear runway for sustained earnings growth for Oracle. And it justifies its aggressive capital expenditure ramp-up and leveraged balance sheet.
3. Oracle continues to grow its partnerships with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
An integral aspect of Oracle's investment thesis is that its competitors are also its customers. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are major Oracle customers through OCI's multicloud offering.
Multicloud enables customers to manage workloads across multiple cloud providers while leveraging the Oracle database. The idea is to minimize data movement by bringing AI to the dataset rather than bringing the dataset to the cloud provider. Again, this goes back to Oracle embedding native versions of its database into the big three cloud providers, which reduces latency costs and lowers compliance risk.
AI is an exciting investment opportunity because it unlocks a new way to leverage data through large language models across text, images, audio, video, and code. By bringing the dataset to the source rather than moving it around, AI models can operate much faster and at a lower cost, which helps Oracle win business even if customers use a rival cloud provider instead of OCI.
Oracle is worth its premium price
Oracle is a pure-play business-to-business company. It doesn't have a lot of moving parts and consumer-facing divisions like Amazon, Microsoft, or Alphabet. It can win business by offering its integrated suite of cloud, database, and enterprise software services, or leverage its database services with a different cloud giant.
Based on multicloud alone, Oracle already had a compelling investment thesis before the announcements with Meta and OpenAI. But these deals take Oracle to the next level by showcasing the value of its next-generation data centers and its cross-selling opportunities for enterprises.
Oracle stock has run up a lot in recent years. It's far from cheap at 46.1 times forward earnings. However, the price is arguably worth it for investors who believe that Oracle will play a pivotal role in OpenAI's data center buildout for years to come."

About the Study
Generative AI caused a 13% relative decline in hiring for early-career workers ages 22–25, particularly in highly AI-exposed professions like software engineering, according to the study.
Jobs with the most significant exposure to generative AI are the most vulnerable, but AI is rapidly improving. The study notes that in 2023, AI could solve only 4.4% of problems in a software engineering database, but by 2024, this had increased to 71.7%.

The study, using data from payroll services provider ADP, focused on monthly, individual-level payroll records through July. It notes that changes in employment outcomes are most acute beginning in late 2022, around the time widespread adoption of generative AI tools began.
Key Findings
The study found a 13% relative drop in hiring of early-career workers most exposed to generative AI. The study reported that workers saw a 6% decline from late 2022 to July, while older workers saw a 6% to 9% increase.
Hiring, Not Compensation
The study also emphasizes that these trends are primarily related to hiring, rather than compensation. Younger workers may face a more challenging job market, but they don't necessarily earn less when they do find work. The result was consistent across all age groups, so young workers can still have strong earning potential.

Automation vs. Augmentation
While generative AI is having significant effects on employment, its effects are not universal. Specifically, the study indicates that the impact is greater when observing applications of AI that automate work compared to those that augment it. If AI can do the work of a human on its own, those jobs are more likely to be impacted than those where humans only use AI to supplement their work.
Not Industry- or Company-Specific
The relative drop in hiring of younger workers is not caused by industry- or company-specific events that could impact hiring practices. The example it provides is interest rate shocks, which could affect specific sectors more than others. However, these factors did not appear to have any impact on the study's results."

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP
Recent estimates are that Bill Gates owns around 270,000 acres of farmland around the United States. Gates himself has said in a recent Reddit AMA that he owns roughly 1/4000 of all farmland in the U.S. Given there are more than 893 million acres of farmland in the U.S., this number appears to be roughly correct.
For instance, over the past six years Gates has reportedly spent roughly $113 million purchasing Nebraska farmland and now owns about 20,000 acres in that state alone.
But the question is: why is Bill Gates investing so heavily in this asset class? Here’s what to consider when it comes to investing in farmland.
Investing directly in farmland
Farmland is a broad asset class that refers to acreage that can be farmed. It’s an attractive investment for those looking to hedge against inflationary periods. According to a 2023 article from Nasdaq, the value of farmland has been shown to rise alongside inflation, with the value of U.S. farmland hitting 10.2% in 2022 at a time when the average inflation rate was 8%.
The thing about investing in physical farmland is the price tags associated with large farms (or even small to medium-sized farms) can be massive. These are also assets that aren’t as easy to get financing for, particularly for investors and those without direct farming expertise.
The USDA and other organizations do provide programs for individuals to purchase farmland, but for all intents and purposes, this asset class is one that’s reserved for accredited investors."

Citing her roles as “a senior National Security aide under Barack Hussein Obama, and a Lawfare and Weaponization obsessed Deputy Attorney General under Crooked Joe Biden and Lisa’s Puppet ‘Boss’ Attorney General Merrick Garland,” Trump posted on Truth Social that Monaco’s current role gives her access to “Highly Sensitive Information,” which he deemed “unacceptable.”
“It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco,” he wrote.
As Trump noted, Monaco worked with both Barack Obama and Joe Biden, including as a deputy attorney general under the Biden administration. Trump rescinded Monaco’s security clearance earlier this year, in an order that did the same for Biden, Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, and the Biden family.
A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. Monaco joined the company in May, taking on a role overseeing the company’s cybersecurity policy and its relationship with world governments.
Far-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer has repeatedly criticized Microsoft for hiring Monaco in posts on X, complaining in one post that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was “born in India” and accusing him of “disgraceful scammer behavior.” On Friday, Loomed triumphantly quoted Trump’s post and again called on the president to “cancel all of Microsoft’s government contracts.”
This isn’t the first time Trump has targeted a tech executive since returning to office. He previously said that Intel President Lip-Bu Tan must “resign immediately” over alleged conflicts of interest. Then, after Intel gave the government a 10% stake in exchange for funding already committed by the Biden administration, Trump described Tan as a “Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer.”"

Volkswagen Investment Narrative Recap
For investors to remain committed to Volkswagen, they need confidence in the company’s ability to overcome near-term volatility in electric vehicle demand and navigate global trade pressures. The recent temporary EV plant closures reflect heightened exposure to both of these issues, which have quickly become the primary short-term catalysts and risks for the stock; any recovery will likely hinge on how rapidly Volkswagen can realign production and protect margins as competition and policy changes bite. For now, the operational impact appears material, as it directly affects key profit drivers and future growth narratives.
One relevant announcement was Volkswagen’s reaffirmation of its 2025 earnings guidance, including flat sales revenue expectations despite these new headwinds. The move suggests management is focused on cost control and capital allocation, but the forecast signals that near-term earnings may come under further strain as EV launches are delayed and production is curtailed. The ability to stick to guidance in the face of shifting demand and tariffs will be closely watched as a signal of operational resilience.
On the other hand, investors should be mindful that persistent brand-specific challenges in China’s luxury market...

Financial expert Suze Orman is urging Americans not to wait when it comes to opening a Roth IRA. Even if you only have a single dollar to contribute, she says in a recent episode of her ""Women & Money"" podcast, getting an account started now can save you from future tax headaches.
The reason comes down to the ""five-year rule,"" a little-understood rule that determines when your Roth IRA money can truly be withdrawn tax-free.
Why Roth IRAs Are So Valuable
A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars, meaning you don't get a tax break when you contribute. The advantage is that the money can grow tax-free, and once certain conditions are met, both contributions and earnings can be withdrawn without additional taxes.

But while the rules for contributions are straightforward — you can always take out what you put in without penalty — the earnings portion is more complicated. That's where the five-year rule comes in.
The Five-Year Rule for Contributions
Orman explained that the five-year rule does not apply to your original contributions. For example, if you put $7,000 into a Roth IRA for three years straight, you could withdraw your $21,000 in contributions at any time without taxes or penalties, regardless of age or how long the account has been open.
The earnings, however, are different. You must be at least 59½ and have had the Roth IRA open for at least five years before you can withdraw the growth tax-free. Without meeting both conditions, your earnings could be subject to ordinary income tax.

What If You Start Later in Life?
The timing becomes especially important if you open a Roth IRA later in life. Orman gave the example of someone who starts an account at age 58. Even if they're over 59½, they still must wait five years before accessing any earnings tax-free. Otherwise, those gains will be taxed, though the 10% early withdrawal penalty no longer applies after 59½.
The Additional Rule for Conversions
Roth conversions — when you move money from a traditional IRA into a Roth — carry their own five-year rule. Each conversion starts its own five-year clock. If you withdraw the converted amount before that period is up and you're under 59½, you could face a 10% penalty, even though you've already paid taxes on it."

Acadia Healthcare Company Investment Narrative Recap
To own Acadia Healthcare, an investor needs confidence in the long-term growth of behavioral health services, steady reimbursement, and the company’s ability to convert expansion into meaningful earnings. The recent push from Engine Capital for operational and governance changes adds urgency around execution and capital allocation but does not appear to materially alter the primary short-term catalyst, which is improving management stability and operational efficiency. The most prominent risk remains ongoing regulatory investigations and substantial legal costs, which could weigh on earnings if unresolved.
The announcement of a board-authorized share repurchase plan for up to US$300,000,000, along with completed buybacks in recent months, stands out as timely given Engine Capital’s call for capital returns and operational discipline. This move aligns with shareholder interests by returning capital and supporting the stock price, but ongoing questions around legal risks and execution remain important for the near term.
On the flip side, investors should also be aware that ongoing legal and regulatory investigations...

These 10 hidden gems don't build foundation models or design AI chips -- they apply existing AI technology to transform inefficient industries and outdated processes.
From insurance underwriting to drug discovery, each company uses AI as a competitive weapon rather than a marketing buzzword. Here's why these 10 under-the-radar names deserve attention from growth investors seeking the next wave of AI winners.
The enterprise automation enabler
Freshworks (FRSH -0.63%) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for customer support, IT service management, and customer relationship management (CRM) with over 68,000 global customers. Its Freddy AI features make enterprise-style automation accessible to small and midsize businesses, a segment often overlooked by giants like Salesforce and ServiceNow. The company's mid-teens revenue growth and improving margins suggest the AI strategy is gaining traction, though profitability remains elusive.
The healthcare disruptor
Oscar Health (OSCR -0.29%) is a tech-enabled health insurer focused on simplifying member and provider interactions. Its new Superagent AI assistant promises to cut service costs and improve speed, giving it a disruptive edge in a notoriously inefficient industry. With healthcare costs spiraling and administrative burden crushing providers, Oscar's AI-first approach could capture significant market share if execution delivers on the promise.
The education transformer
Nerdy (NRDY -2.21%) runs Varsity Tutors and an AI-powered Live + AI platform that scales tutoring and education services. With school districts piloting AI tutors, the stock taps into the edtech wave of personalized, automated learning. The company's ability to blend human expertise with AI scalability creates a differentiated model in the $100 billion tutoring market.
The insurance innovator
Lemonade (LMND -0.10%) is a digital insurance company using AI bots to underwrite policies, answer claims, and handle customer onboarding. Its automation could expand margins if loss ratios stabilize, making it an intriguing bet on AI in financial services. The challenge remains proving that AI can actually improve underwriting accuracy while maintaining the rapid growth that justifies its valuation.
The biotech revolutionary
Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX 15.11%) is a biotech that uses AI and massive proprietary datasets to accelerate drug discovery. Its supercomputer-scale partnership with Nvidia positions it as a potential leader in AI-driven therapeutics. While the market cap of around $2 billion reflects significant speculation, successful clinical trials could validate the AI approach and trigger explosive gains.
The defense intelligence provider
BigBear.ai (BBAI -4.38%) provides decision intelligence platforms and analytics for the U.S. Department of Defense and industrial clients. As defense digitization accelerates, its AI-based mission planning and predictive systems give it a clear growth angle. Government contract volatility and execution risks make this suitable only for investors comfortable with lumpy revenue patterns.
The product optimization platform
Amplitude (AMPL -0.64%) delivers product analytics software that helps companies optimize user engagement and conversion. Its new AI agents generate insights and suggest experiments automatically, appealing to investors betting on AI-enhanced analytics. Competition from Adobe and free alternatives creates pricing pressure, but the product-focused approach maintains differentiation.
The incident response accelerator
PagerDuty (PD) is a DevOps and IT incident management platform used by thousands of enterprises. Its AI assistant and automation tools shorten incident response times, creating a measurable return on investment (ROI) that resonates with enterprise buyers. The company's shift toward AI-driven operations positions it well as businesses demand faster resolution of increasingly complex technical issues.
The customer experience orchestrator
Sprinklr (CXM 1.20%) operates a unified customer experience management platform used by global brands. Its AI tools for listening, insights, and engagement put it at the center of how companies interact with customers in the AI era. Customers include global brands such as McDonald's and Nike, giving Sprinklr the scale to benefit from AI adoption across marketing departments.
The data infrastructure play
Innodata (INOD 9.38%) provides data engineering, content services, and AI training data sets for large enterprises and AI developers. As demand for high-quality training data soars, its niche infrastructure role makes it a hidden beneficiary of AI adoption.
The hidden gem portfolio
These 10 stocks won't compete with Nvidia for AI supremacy, but they don't need to. Each applies AI to solve specific business problems, creating defensible niches in massive markets. The risks vary widely -- Lemonade and Oscar face insurance industry headwinds, Recursion depends on clinical trial success, and BigBear relies on government contracts. Spreading capital across multiple hidden gems reduces single-stock blow-up risk while maintaining exposure to AI's practical applications."

By identifying and investing in these companies, you can shift your focus to other stocks while just letting these safe choices do their thing. However, investors must identify a trend that allows these companies to succeed over the long term; otherwise, they could turn out to be losing picks.
Three stocks that I think are worth buying and holding forever are Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), and Amazon (AMZN -0.45%). These three are all considered AI hyperscalers, but they're benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI) through another important business segment: cloud computing.
The boom in cloud computing
Cloud computing is a genius business model, and all three of these tech giants have a thriving operation in it. Most companies don't want to spend huge amounts on computing power or storage. And upkeep on this equipment can be expensive and require specialists. So instead of having to build huge computing capacity, many companies choose to rent it from cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The business model for cloud computing providers is extremely simple: build out capacity and rent it out for more than it costs to build and operate. All three companies have mastered this model and are seeing great results.
AWS is the largest cloud provider, although it's growing the slowest, so that gap is closing. In the second quarter, AWS grew 17% to $30.9 billion and made up 18% of Amazon's total revenue. However, it's a huge income source: It generated 53% of Amazon's total operating profits.
With AWS making up the majority of Amazon's profits while growing faster than its e-commerce business, the cloud segment will continue to become a larger part of the parent company with each year, further transforming it from an e-commerce play to a cloud computing play.
Google Cloud was the last of the three primary cloud services to enter that arena, so it's behind the other two. But it's still doing phenomenally well. Its revenue increased 32% year over year to $13.6 billion in the second quarter, and its operating margin increased to 21%.
Google Cloud is one of Alphabet's fastest-growing segments, and with huge computing demand still emerging, it's a trend that will boost the company's stock over the long term.
Microsoft, in second place in cloud market share with Azure, is growing the fastest of this trio. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending June 30), Azure's revenue rose 39% year over year.
Unfortunately for investors, Microsoft doesn't break out the exact revenue total for this division, so investors are kept guessing how much it generates. However, we still know it's less than AWS, as the divisions that Azure is within (Intelligent Cloud) produced $29.9 billion in revenue, below AWS' total. Still, with continued elevated growth, Azure could surpass AWS as the cloud computing leader soon.
Cloud computing is a quickly expanding business
Clearly, cloud computing is doing well right now, but will that continue?
Once a company has moved to the cloud, it's hard to go back. This creates high switching costs for clients, essentially locking them in for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, cloud computing is a huge part of how AI is being deployed. Few companies are building AI capacity on-premise, and these three are building huge AI data centers to meet computing demand from their clients.
With two major tailwinds blowing in cloud computing's favor (general workloads and AI workloads), it's no surprise that third-party market projections think the business will soar over the next few years. Grand View Research estimates that the cloud market in 2024 was about $752 billion. However, it's expected to rise to $2.39 trillion by 2030.
That's monster growth, and because companies are always launching new workloads, it means continued growth even after these five years.
Cloud computing is an excellent segment to invest in, and this trio is the best way to do it. I think buying all three and holding them forever is a smart idea since they have what it takes to provide long-term market-beating returns."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-27T08:45:00,Is The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund a Buy?,"With a 0.03% expense ratio and broad exposure to the full U.S. market, this boring fund keeps beating flashier alternatives by doing absolutely nothing special.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2b6635f8e867dbe1176882948dc399b86a471271d58b2792a834db1d135974e9,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/is-the-vanguard-total-stock-market-index-fund-a-bu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/is-the-vanguard-total-stock-market-index-fund-a-bu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/is-the-vanguard-total-stock-market-index-fund-a-bu/,fool.com,200,,"The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI 0.42%) might be the most boring investment on Wall Street -- and that's exactly why it works. While hedge funds chase the next big thing and retail traders bet on meme stocks, this exchange-traded fund (ETF) quietly delivers the entire U.S. stock market for 3 basis points. No stock picking. No market timing. No clever strategies. Just own everything and let American capitalism do the heavy lifting.
The fund's 12% year-to-date return won't make headlines, but it's beaten roughly 90% of actively managed large-cap funds over the past decade. That's the paradox of index investing: doing nothing special consistently produces special results. With 3,524 holdings spanning megacaps to micro-caps, the fund offers the ultimate set-it-and-forget-it exposure to U.S. equities.
Is this top Vanguard ETF a buy right now? Let's break down the fund's key features to find out.
The Magnificent Seven's boring wrapper
The fund's portfolio reads like a who's who of American corporate dominance. Nvidia leads at 6.49% of assets, followed by Microsoft at 6.05% and Apple at 5.57%. The top 10 holdings -- including Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- comprise about one-third of the fund. That concentration might seem risky, but it simply reflects market reality: These companies have grown so large that they dominate any market-cap-weighted index.
The beauty lies in what happens beyond the giants. The ETF holds everything from Broadcom at 2.25% down to thousands of small caps, each representing fractions of a percent. This breadth provides natural diversification across sectors, styles, and company sizes. When megacap tech stumbles, smaller value stocks might cushion the blow. When growth roars back, the fund captures those gains too. The 2% annual turnover keeps transaction costs minimal while ensuring the portfolio stays current with market changes.
The compound interest machine
At 0.03% annually, the fund's expense ratio approaches free. On a $10,000 investment, you pay $3 per year -- less than a fancy coffee. Compare that to the average actively managed fund charging 0.5% to 1%, and the math becomes compelling. Over 30 years, that seemingly tiny difference compounds into tens of thousands of dollars. Jack Bogle's simple insight -- costs matter more than almost anything else -- remains devastatingly true.
The fund's structure amplifies this advantage. As an ETF, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF trades throughout the day with tight bid-ask spreads, typically just a penny or two. Tax efficiency comes built-in through the creation-redemption mechanism that allows the fund to shed appreciated shares without triggering taxable events for remaining shareholders.
The case against excitement
The fund won't make you rich quickly. It won't beat the market because it is the market. During corrections, it falls with everything else -- no defensive positioning softens the blow. The fund's U.S.-only focus means missing international opportunities, particularly in emerging markets that might offer higher growth potential in the years ahead. And yes, owning 3,524 stocks means holding plenty of mediocre companies alongside the winners.
But these limitations double as strengths for most investors. The inability to beat the market eliminates the risk of underperforming it. The lack of international exposure keeps things simple and avoids currency risk. The broad diversification ensures you'll always own the next Nvidia or Tesla before they become giants. Studies consistently show that investors' biggest enemy is themselves -- trading too much, chasing performance, abandoning strategies during downturns. The fund's boring nature acts as a behavioral defense mechanism.
For investors seeking a core U.S. equity holding, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF remains an exceptional choice. It won't generate alpha or provide cocktail party bragging rights. But over decades, this simple, cheap, comprehensive fund will likely beat most alternatives precisely because it doesn't try to be special. Sometimes the best investment strategy is admitting you don't have one -- and letting the market do the work for you."

With technology continually shifting, this is the key to long-term success and leadership.
Let's look at two top companies that have not only grown to become the largest in the world today, but also have bright futures, given their ability to adapt and find new opportunities.
1. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) built its e-commerce business by spending years pouring money into warehouses and logistics, and now it is using artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to get more out of that network. Its DeepFleet AI model is now coordinating more than 1 million robots across its fulfillment centers, and these robots are doing more than just moving boxes around. Some can spot damaged products before they get shipped, which means fewer returns, and some can even repair themselves.
But the use of AI does not stop there. Amazon is also using AI to figure out which warehouse should hold a product, the best route to get it to a customer, and even where the driver needs to go in a huge apartment complex to drop a package off. This is leading not only to quicker deliveries, but also to lower costs.
Amazon is also using AI to help advertisers better target users with its high-gross margin sponsored ad business. This is resulting in strong operating leverage in its e-commerce business, with its North American operating income surging 47% last quarter on only an 11% increase in revenue.
At the same time, AWS is still a powerful growth engine. It continues to lead the cloud market with nearly 30% share and grew revenue by more than 17% last quarter. Demand is strong because customers are rushing to build AI models and applications, and AWS makes that simple with tools like Bedrock and SageMaker.
The company is also pushing into agentic AI with Strands and AgentCore, which let customers build AI agents and run them safely. Its custom Trainium and Inferentia chips make training and running those models cheaper and faster, which keeps customers on its platform.
Amazon is making a lot of capital expenditures (capex) to build its AI infrastructure, but it has a history of spending big, then reaping the rewards later. With margins expanding in e-commerce and AWS still capacity constrained, the growth story here is far from over, and the stock still looks like a long-term buy.
2. Microsoft
In the past, Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) was often viewed as a slow mover, but with AI, it moved quickly, which has proven to be the right move.
The company made a large, early investment in OpenAI, which gave it early access to its GPT models and let it roll out Copilot AI assistants across its Office suite. Those tools are valuable because they can save workers time, and at $30 per user, per month, this can add a lot of growth.
The bigger growth driver, though, is its cloud computing unit Azure. Microsoft's cloud revenue jumped 39% last quarter, and it could have been higher if it hadn't run into capacity constraints. The company is spending heavily to add more graphics processing units (GPUs) and servers, which should allow it to capture even more demand in the quarters ahead. Microsoft is also diversifying its AI stack, adding models from xAI and building its own in-house models, giving customers more flexibility.
What makes Microsoft a compelling stock to own for the next decade is that Azure is the fastest-growing of the big three cloud providers, and it has a chance to eventually challenge AWS for the No. 1 spot in cloud computing. That is where enterprise AI workloads are being run, and Microsoft is quickly becoming one of the top choices for companies that want access to the best models and the infrastructure to run them at scale.
Microsoft has proven it can adapt and act quickly, which is exactly what you want to see from a tech leader."

Luckily, the husband said he still loves his wife, and she is just tired of seeing him struggle. Their relationship seems healthy, but what about the husband's entrepreneurial pursuits? Several Redditors shared their thoughts in the comments.

The same commenter who critiqued the husband for selling his wife a false dream too many times offered a solution for getting her back on board. Ultimately, it comes down to results. If the husband launches a successful business, it seems like the wife will be supportive of his project.
""She is going to stick with reality, which is only rational,"" the commenter said. ""You need to make your fantasy into reality for her to join in.""
A wife responded to the comment, saying that she is in a similar position. She cares about her partner but gets hurt inside each time her partner isn't able to make his dreams come true.
""She probably wants to join you, but by doing the same things over again and not getting anywhere is the definition of insanity,"" the wife said in the comments. ""Also, stop spending 12+ hours per day on the job. That isn't helping your relationship (trust me). You have to work smarter, not harder.""

You don't see them, yet they're the brains that power almost every electronic device that we interact with daily. And there's nobody better at manufacturing semiconductors than the appropriately named Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 3.22%), also known as TSMC.
TSMC is the world's leading semiconductor foundry by a large margin. It has around a 70% market share, while second-place Samsung's market share is only around 7%. The foundry model means that TSMC doesn't make chips for general sale. Instead, companies will design the chips they need for their products, and TSMC will use its manufacturing ability to bring them to life.
At the time of this writing, TSMC's market cap is around $1.4 trillion. To hit the $2 trillion mark by 2028, it would need to average around 14% annual returns over the next few years. You should never use past performances to predict future ones, but given the company's growth prospects and its 29% average annual returns over the past decade, I'm confident it can happen.
TSMC's role in the AI ecosystem
TSMC isn't your typical artificial intelligence (AI) stock in the sense that it has a generative AI app or other software people interact with. Yet its role in the AI ecosystem is as important as almost any stock you can name.
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Alphabet all design chips and other hardware that power data centers, which are essentially the backbones of training and developing AI models. Yet most of this wouldn't be possible without TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability.
When it comes to manufacturing advanced AI chips, TSMC is essentially the only go-to. Without it, you could make a valid argument that data centers would be less efficient, which means that AI training would be less efficient, which means many of the AI applications we interact with today would be less capable and scalable.
TSMC is improving its profit and margins
TSMC has long been an impressive moneymaker, but it has stepped it up a lot in the past few years. In the second quarter, it made $30 billion in revenue, which was up 44% year over year and close to 18% higher than the first quarter. If its third-quarter revenue falls between $31.8 billion and $33 billion, as it predicts, that will represent between 35% and 40% year-over-year growth.
In Nvidia's latest earnings report, it noted that it expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure through 2030. With TSMC being a key part of AI infrastructure, this should be music to the company's ears.
The revenue growth is impressive, but TSMC's expanding margins may be the most noteworthy. Since last year, its profit margin has expanded from 36.8% to 42.7%, gross margin has expanded from 53.2% to 56.8%, and operating margin has expanded from 42.5% to 49.6%.
These expanding margins are a testament to TSMC's ability to command premium pricing because of its advanced manufacturing ability, and its customers knowing that it's essentially their only choice if they want the most powerful chips.
TSMC is trading at a good value for long-term investors
TSMC is currently trading at around 23.5 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months. It's not ""cheap"" by most standards, but it also seems like a good value for a company that's as dominant as TSMC and has its growth potential.
TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability isn't something that can be easily caught up to and replicated because it takes many years of experience and billions invested into research and equipment. That gives it a competitive advantage that's likely to last for quite a while, especially because it's not easy for its customers to switch manufacturers without risking performance or reliability.
That edge gives me confidence that TSMC can enter the $2 trillion club within the next few years."

Basketball.fun will tokenize NBA players instead of adopting the typical fan token model popularized by projects like Socios, CoinDesk reported, citing a press release. The value assigned to player-themed tokens will fluctuate in real time in response to sentiment and performance, the outlet reported. Fans will earn from speculating on rising talent, according to CoinDesk.
Thompson is partnering with Improbable CEO Herman Narula and co-founder Hadi Teherany to launch the project, CoinDesk reported.
""The way fans value and perceive players should be different than owners and news networks,"" Teherany told CoinDesk. ""We're trying to give power back to the fan — not just to predict who they think is great, but to actually earn incentives from it. Imagine being able to prove that the fan consensus on a rookie's potential is more accurate than a team's front office.""
Trending: Shaquille O'Neal wants people to take heart health seriously — this AI-ECG could make that easier.
Teherany also told CoinDesk that the decision not to launch a token for basketball.fun was partly informed by experiences from a previous project called TracyAI, a basketball-focused AI agent also launched by Thompson. According to Teherany, the project has become too dependent on the token performance. The project’s token TRACY was last trading at $0.000078, down 99.6% from its February price record of $0.018.
Thompson has become a vocal advocate of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in recent years. He has cited the missed opportunity to put all or part of an $82 million 2015 contract in Bitcoin as motivation to educate others, especially younger players in the NBA, about the industry.

Trump has long been critical of Monaco, who was US deputy attorney general under former President Joe Biden, accusing her of using that post to push various investigations into his conduct.
He revoked Monaco’s security clearances and access to classified information in March, and cited that decision on Friday to argue that she should be dismissed from Microsoft, claiming her position at the tech giant gave her “access to Highly Sensitive Information” that made her a “menace to U.S. National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government.”
“It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco,” Trump added.
Monaco’s position at Microsoft was reported in June. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump’s call for Monaco’s firing comes just a day after the US Department of Justice indicted former FBI Director James Comey, a dramatic illustration of how the president has moved to seek retribution against government officials he says have wronged him.

According to Scaramucci, burdensome regulations discourage firms from listing publicly.
""It's hard for the public to get access,"" he said, adding that he hopes the SEC reduces layers of red tape to make IPOs more attractive.

Comparing Microsoft In 1986 To Today
Scaramucci pointed to Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT) 1986 IPO, noting that early investors who recognized its potential were well-positioned to build substantial wealth.
He contrasted that era with today's market, where growth often happens behind closed doors among venture capitalists and private equity backers.
He urged regulators to create a system that allows retail investors to put money behind ""all-star CEOs"" such as Coinbase's Brian Armstrong and other visionary founders earlier in their growth cycles.
Robinhood Aims To Give Retail Investors Access To Private Firms
Echoing Scaramucci's concerns, Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD) this month unveiled Robinhood Ventures Fund I or RVI, aimed at expanding retail investor access to private companies.
The closed-end fund has submitted its initial registration on Form N-2 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will be overseen by Robinhood Ventures DE, LLC, a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary.
The fund is designed to let everyday investors participate in private company growth ahead of IPOs — an investment channel long dominated by wealthy individuals and institutional players.

The move appears to be the latest effort by Trump to exact retribution on those he sees on political enemies and comes one day after the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey.
Monaco had helped coordinate the Justice Department's response to the January 6, 2021, attacks by Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol.
She served as a security aide in the administration of President Barack Obama and was the deputy attorney general in President Joe Biden's administration. Monaco started working for Microsoft in July to lead the firm's engagements with governments globally, according to her LinkedIn profile.
Trump on Truth Social said Monaco was ""a menace to U.S. National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government.
""It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco,"" he posted.
Monaco's security clearances were revoked in February. On Friday, Trump said the U.S. government has also banned her from all federal properties because of ""Monaco’s many wrongful acts.""
Microsoft declined to comment on Trump's post. Monaco also did not immediately respond.
On Thursday, Comey, who led the FBI when it began an investigation into ties between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Russian government, was indicted on charges of false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.
Trump on Friday said he expects more indictments against perceived enemies, saying to reporters: ""I think there will be others"" but said he did not have a list.
Since Trump returned to office in January, he has used his powers as president to hamstring law firms that represented causes he dislikes, leveraged federal funding to force changes at universities and fired prosecutors who took part in investigations against him.
He has also pushed for charges against former national security adviser John Bolton, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff.

Yet another compound growth story is unfolding in the world of big tech that it would be easy to overlook. With a market-leading cloud computing business, a high-margin advertising business, and a faster, automated logistics network that continues to lower costs, Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) may soon take the investing world by surprise. Here's why Amazon's market capitalization could cross $5 trillion by 2030.
Impressive financial performance
Amazon's recent financial results have been impressive. In the second quarter, revenues were up 12% year over year to $167.7 billion, while operating income surged 31% to $19.2 billion. Its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), saw revenues grow 17.5% to $30.9 billion, while advertising revenues were up 22% to $15.7 billion. Amazon has also generated a robust $18.2 billion free cash flow in the last four reported quarters.
Management expects revenues to fall in the range of $174 billion to $179.5 billion in the third quarter, including a modest positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
AWS Strength
Amazon is the leader in the global cloud infrastructure market with a 30% share, and AWS will continue to benefit from the transition of more IT work from on-premises infrastructure to cloud-based systems. Currently, an estimated 85% to 90% of IT spending goes to on-premises systems, but that mix is set to shift as the adoption of AI accelerates. AWS is also well positioned to capitalize on the increasing shift of enterprise AI spending from model training to inference workloads -- the real-time deployment of AI models. Eventually, inference is expected to account for nearly 80% to 90% of total AI costs as pilot projects advance into commercial use.
Generative AI inference is also expected to become a standard service, similar to computing, storage, or databases. We can expect that companies will prefer to run these workloads in the same cloud regions as their other applications and enterprise data. Since there are more applications running on AWS than anywhere else, and vast amounts of enterprise data are stored there, it could become the preferred cloud computing platform for inference workloads.
AWS is also pushing down its AI costs. Management claims that its custom Trainium2 chip delivers approximately 30% to 40% better price performance for inference than other chipmakers' GPUs. Anthropic is training its next Claude models on Trainium2, and Amazon Bedrock uses it for inference. The company is also working on the third iteration of the Trainium chip, which is expected to be even more effective for computing and inference workloads. Based on all that, the price-performance edge could become a long-term differentiator for AWS.
AWS clocked an impressive annualized revenue run rate of $123 billion as of the end of the second quarter. The cloud computing business also had an incredible backlog of $195 billion, up 25% year over year, giving it significant visibility into its future revenues. Additionally, management expects demand to keep outpacing available capacity. These conditions are expected to improve in the next several quarters.
Advertising business
Amazon's advertising offerings, spanning its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch, Fire TV, and live sports, help advertisers reach an audience of more than 300 million people in the U.S.
In June, Amazon partnered with Roku to give advertisers using the Amazon demand-side platform access to over 80 million connected TV households in the U.S. Amazon has also integrated its demand-side platform with Disney's real-time ad exchange, thereby giving advertisers direct programmatic access to premium ad inventory on platforms such as Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu. With access to customers' identity, Amazon's shopping signals, and premium streaming inventory, advertisers will be better able to effectively target the audiences they're aiming for. This, in turn, is expected to boost the advertising business in the coming quarters.
Improving retail margins
Amazon is focusing on improving its retail margins, too. It reorganized its U.S. logistics network around a regional structure, placing inventory closer to customers, increasing direct lanes, and enhancing product consolidation. All of this cut miles and human touches out of the process, speeding delivery and lowering costs. Combined with large-scale automation and robotics, including its DeepFleet AI system, the retail business is on a path to higher margins
How will Amazon become a $5 trillion company?
Amazon trades today at a cheap valuation of just 3.7 times sales. To become a $5 trillion company, it would not need to expand its valuation multiples to unsustainable levels.
If AWS continues to grow revenues at a low-to-mid-teens percentage as its capacity increases and inference workloads ramp up, advertising grows at a rate in the high-teens to 20% due to robust connected TV partnerships, and retail margins improve thanks to the benefits of the regional network and automation, Amazon will have a potent revenue mix and enhanced margins. While AWS and the advertising business will boost profitability, the retail segment will help reduce the company's cost to serve customers -- translating into higher profit margins, robust cash flows, and better visibility. That setup is far stronger than Amazon enjoyed when its valuation peaked at around 4.6 times sales earlier in the decade. Back then, its advertising business was smaller, its AI opportunity was limited, and its logistics were far less efficient.
Now, we can expect the company to be trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 5 to 7 by 2030, reflecting the blended effect of higher multiples for its cloud computing and advertising businesses, and lower multiples attributed to the slower growth of its retail business. The company can trade at even higher multiples if it continues its leadership in AI inference.
Analysts expect Amazon's revenues will be nearly $1.15 trillion in 2030. Assuming that P/S multiple expands to even 5, then we can expect Amazon's market capitalization to be almost $5.75 trillion by 2030 -- well above the $5 trillion mark."

If approved by the plan commission, it would rezone about 244 acres of land from agricultural, rural residential and low-density residential to light industrial.
“Most parcels within the proposed area are currently vacant and are used for growing agricultural crops,” according to the Plan Commission report. “One parcel currently has an existing home and is occupied. This resident granted the applicant authority to request to reclassify the land use and zoning district of their property.”
For the village’s part, if approved, it would have to extend public sanitary sewer and water facilities to the area, construct “necessary storm water facilities,” amend the village’s water and sewer utility district boundaries, amend the village’s sanitary sewer service area, road extensions and/or vacations.
The developer would also reimburse the village for costs related to the data center development.
The applicant has until Dec. 31, 2035, to comply with the conditions, otherwise the rezoning will become null and void.
Village President Tom Weatherston has stated offers have been accepted on the land and those purchases are contingent on the land being rezoned.
If the plan commission votes to approve the rezone, the item then goes before the fully village board to be voted on at the Oct. 14 meeting.
Specific details on what exactly will be built has not been released. However, preliminary plans included in meeting packet include three buildings, a power station, several stormwater retention ponds and transmission line corridors.
The exact plans could evolve over time as Microsoft assesses the usage for the property.
Microsoft is planning to build a backup data center to support its facilities in Mount Pleasant.
The company is nearing completion of its first data center in Mount Pleasant, scheduled to be fully online by mid-2026.
On Sept. 18 Microsoft announced a $4 billion expansion of its campus in Mount Pleasant to build another data center.
The company plans for that data center to be online in 2028.

Finding His Path
Instead of continuing college, Palmer took temporary jobs at a FedEx warehouse and a factory in Virginia. ""I had a general interest in working with my hands, fixing and making things, as well as a basic understanding of electrical theory from my time in AP Physics class,"" he said. He eventually began an apprenticeship with a contractor in Charlotte, North Carolina, starting at $15 per hour.
In January 2024, after passing his licensing exam at 21, he launched Palmer Electrical. By the end of that year, he grossed nearly $90,000, according to documents reviewed by Fortune. So far in 2025, he has already surpassed that figure.
The New Ambition: Trades Over Tuition
""College is just a vehicle for getting training and skills for whatever career you want, and that might take you a year, it could take you six weeks, it could take you four years,"" Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education at Mesa Public Schools in Arizona, told Fortune. She said that more students are questioning debt-heavy college pathways and exploring skilled trades like electrical work, which are in high demand.

Loria added that her district has rolled out academy models that blend college prep with career training, offering students multiple routes into the workforce. Social media has also shifted expectations, she told Fortune, as young people now want clear reasons for pursuing education beyond high school. And in Arizona, she noted electricians are especially sought after as data-center projects from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) are fueling a surge in need for skilled workers.
The interest in skilled trades is showing up in national data, too. Jobber's 2025 Blue Collar Report found that only 16% of Gen Z parents believe a degree guarantees long-term job security, even as three-quarters of Gen Z still plan to pursue college. Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects employment of electricians to grow 9% from 2024 to 2034, far above the 4% average across occupations."

Welcome to Yahoo Finance Sports Report, a unique look at the business of sports brought to you by Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports. I'm your host, Joe Pompeiano, and I'm here to coach you through the financial game. Let's huddle up and get right into it.We are kicking off this week with POM's Playbook where I take a look at some of the biggest headlines in sports that you and your portfolio need to know. First up in today's playbook, we have some sports betting news. Earlier this week, Swiss gaming company Allen reached an agreement to buy a majority stake in Pris in a deal that values the daily fantasy sports platform at $2.5 billion. But not to be outdone, Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin made his own headlines later in the week.During an interview on CNBC, Rubin said that he expects sports betting to account for over 40% of the company's profits by 2027. For those keeping score at home, that means Ruben believes Phanatic's gaming division will be generating hundreds of millions of dollars in profit within 5 years. Next up is MLB announcing this week that the league will use its new automated ball strike challenge system throughout the entire 2026 regular season.MLB has been testing its robot umpire system for balls and strikes for the last few years in the minor leagues and even during the All-Star game, but now it will be used during the regular season. Here's how it will work. Each team will get 2 challenges and can keep them if they're successful. These challenges can only be initiated by a pitcher, a catcher, or a batter, and the request must come right after the pitch. If a game goes into extra innings, each team would then be awarded one additional challenge.Next up in today's playbook is news that the New York Liberty have parted ways with head coach Sandy Bronello. The Liberty had a disappointing first round exit in this year's WNBA playoffs, but this firing still came as a shock to a lot of people because Brondello led the Liberty to the team's first WNBA title in franchise history just last year. Brondello will now leave New York with a 107-53 record across four seasons, while the Liberty now search for a new head coach.And for the last topic for today's playbook is news from Forbes that Roger Federer has officially reached billionaire status. That makes Federer one of just 7 athletes in history to have reached a 3 time low. Joining Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Junior Bridgeman, Tiger Woods, and Neon Tiaak. Most of Federer's net worth was generated through sponsorship deals with companies like Nike, Rolex, Mercedes-Benz, and.as well as a minority stake in the publicly traded Swiss shoe and apparel brand, which is valued at $375 million today. But to learn more about how Federer structured these deals, I recently interviewed his agent of 20 years, Tony Godsick. Here's a clip from our conversation where Tony explains why Roger left Nike and how that ultimately led him to sign deals with Uniqlo and On worth more than $600 million today. One of the things that I have to ask you about just personally, because, uh, it feels like it comes up just all the time.is when Roger left Nike. It's become just like this sort of iconic story in sports of uh just how you guys transition from leaving a huge brand like Nike, who obviously sponsors a lot of athletes and was with him and you for a long period of time. You go with Uniqlo, um, and obviously on running as well. What was the thought process behind leaving Nike, but also the opportunity to sort of expand relationships with apparel, but also footwear as well?
Yeah.Look, I actually don't think he left Nike. Yeah, um, I think it probably in a way, um, Nike sort of left him. I mean, uh, Roger had an amazing relationship for 24 years, I think, with Nike. Um, his brand wouldn't be where it is today if it wasn't for Nike. I mean, Nike signed him when he was very young. Um, he did, he redid some deals himself when he didn't have an agent.Um, but they put him in great gear, obviously from a performance standpoint, they, they got him a shoe that that worked, um, but they really were there to sort of help grow his brand globally, so it was great. And you know, his, we did long term deals and when his deal in 2018.Uh, in 2017, we started working on how do we get a renewal, and, and remember, he hadn't won a Grand Slam for 4 years. Yeah. And so I think Nike was trying to figure out what do we do with a 36 year old soon to be retired, probably be retired. Well,
and the onething I'll add to this too, and correct me if I'm wrong, but these companies typically have sort of like a formula, right, of like, we're going to spend X amount on sponsorships relative to our total revenue.And Rogers obviously at the top of that category. So if you do a deal with him, it sort of limits what you can do elsewhere, right?
But that's where I was unsuccessful in trying to shake them, saying, don't put him into that sort of formula. He's different, because you guys have had 24 years toUnderstand that he's different, you know, he gives so much more time than it's contracted. He actually, when you talk about designing shoes and designing clothes, he's actually with their designers designing the shoes, designing the clo I cannot tell you how many meetings we were in, fun meetings with Tinker Hatfield, just going through shoes and designing with this whole kitchen. I mean, it was amazing, so fun. Yeah, I mean, Tinker is a legend.And um so it was great, but so they had to figure out they owned his logo or actually he owned the logo, um but they had a period to hold on to it post termination for a period of time. Um, so I think they've figured out, like, if you think he's worth more, um, great, go see if you can find it and if not, you know, we're here. And so, you know, I started talking in 2017, but then he went on and won the Australian Open in 2017, so I was like, OK, this is pretty good, you know, guy's getting a little bit older, but it helps and it was a great match against Rafa.Then he goes to Wimbledon, he wins Wimbledon. That's pretty helpful, you know, you think all of a sudden you're giving me the ammunition to get another extension with a brand that he, he really deeply cared about, and then he goes and wins the Australian Open in 2018 January, and the contract's gonna shortly expire, and I just, I couldn't believe that. I couldn't quite.I have this, and I, I don't think I'll ever show up, but I had this incredible presentation we put together on why Nike should keep Roger. Like I was, you know, he'd already, he was the most Grand Slams in history, certainly one of the nicest, well behaved athletes, and I was putting a proposal together about why they should keep him.Anyway, I was trying to at that point with them also try to convince them that Roger has a lot of lifestyle, um, ambition, lifestyle clothing, and, um, you know, and I told him we should go after the Stan Smith.You know, silhouette, you know, we can do this. Roger is credible in fashion, obviously his great relationship with Anna Wintour. He knows every major global designer is still going to be incredibly famous when he retires. I thought so. I mean, I understand. I mean, the one thing to defend Nike is they have a huge, huge, um, you know, portfolio of athletes. Yeah. And so you maybe have to put a process in place and what do you do? But I just was not successful in convincing them.Roger's different guys, trust me, because not only on the court is he wonderful, but off the court, he can do things that others either don't want to do, don't like to do, or can't pull it off. And so anyway, it, uh, the contract ended and um I went out and canvassed the market and was able to get this incredible opportunity to go sit in Tokyo for 30 minutes with mystery and I, um, and just explain to him the situation and what the opportunity was and.Um, he really cared for Roger. He understood that the platform of tennis was great for life wear, and that no matter how long Roger played, if it was for a minute, a day, um, or a year or 3 years, that they could do something with them to help grow their brand globally, um, and so that happened and Nike had the right to match and they chose not to, which is totally fine.Um, but then they're left to void. We didn't have a shoe deal. And, um, and so there were were discussions with Nike to try to get a shoe deal, which I wasn't successful in doing either, we felt too hard,
too hard
of a
time here because the deals you ended up with were, were obviously,
sure, but if you just take away, extrapolate just the money and the deals and the equity and the opportunity, it's, there was an opportunity for him to stay uh longer with the company that he had a great relationship with. And sometimes all this stuff happened for a reason. Now, in the end of the day, um,You know, it all worked out really well and so we took advantage of the opportunity, and I don't think if Roger wasn't so successful on and off the court and he was such a gentleman and so collaborative and all that stuff, we probably wouldn't be able to have gotten a UNIQLO deal for that long period of time.And then, you know, the on situation was completely different because I was afforded the opportunity to invest in the company in 2016. So I got a chance to know these guys and they would always ask, like, could we ever do something with Roger? And I would laugh at them and be like, he's always going to be with Nike guys, you know, but let's stay in touch and, and, and stuff. And so in 2018 when this Uniqlo thing went down, uh, I had a dinner with them and I said to them, hey, ask the question. They didn't want to. I said, oh come on, ask the question.And I said, yes, you won't believe this. You, you, there is an opportunity. And so they're like, wow, you know, I don't know if we can, you know, we're we're not Nike. I don't know if we can, we can pay. And I said, don't worry about cash. You know, Roger's done tons of these deals for the last 20+ years. Let's try to figure something out, which is a win-win for you guys, for him, get him some equity, let him invest, um, and, and let's help you build a lifestyle shoe. Um, we can call it. I remember saying I'd love to call it Roger.And they're like, no, the Roger. I said, OK, that's better, that's good. So, uh, so they went off and COVID helped too, because Roger had an injury, he wasn't playing, and it gave them sort of a 14 month period to actually design a tennis shoe. Otherwise, I'm not sure it would have worked because Roger didn't want to switch from the Nike shoe. Yeah. Uh, you know, they, he had been in that last for a long time, um, he didn't want his, you know, it would be crazy.To put on a different shoe at the end of your career and hurt, you know, have your career end because you put on a different shoe and the last was different, you hurt your foot. So he really was very methodical, and that's where Olivier Bernard, the, the founder of On, um, was amazing because he was the one that was in the weeds with Roger designing the tennis sneaker, so it was athlete to athlete, so they speak a different language and Roger because of.The incredible interaction with Tinker and other really talented designers at Nike. He was actually a sneakerhead, so he could speak the language and especially with Olivier, who was a triathlete, you know, world champion and stuff, and so they went off and spent, I think there were 13 different shoes that they made and they finally found one. So when Roger was able to come back, he was able to go into that shoe and uhThe rest is history.
All right, now that we've covered the biggest stories in sports happening right now, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, we've got Microsoft's Monica Robbins joining the show to discuss how the tech giant is helping our favorite sports leagues.Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Sports Report. I'm your host Joe Pompeano. We've made it to the one on one, a conversation where I get to break down news and sports with the key player in the industry. This week we're speaking with Monica Robbins. Welcome to the show, Monica. Thank you so much for joining us today. I want to start with the NFL. I'd like for you to tell us a little.More about your partnership with the NFL, but then more specifically, uh, one of the new things that some fans might have caught this year is that the tablets on the sideline are new, the computers that the coaches are using during the game. It is a a sideline viewing system. So maybe just explain sort of how you guys started working with the NFL and how that has evolved up until today.
Sure, so great to be here. Um, we've definitely had a long standing partnership with the NFL, and if you can believe it started, uh, almost a decade ago, and it was around trying to transform the sideline process, where, which was super, super, um, slow, to be honest with you. They had thermal printers that were printing out every single play on the sideline, and then somebody had to put that into a binder and rush it down the field to get it into the coach's hands.And so what we set out to do with the sideline viewing system, as you talked about, is to try to bring that information, that down and those insights into their hands in real time. So when you have just 40 seconds between a play, you can actually have the information you need to adjust your strategy before you head on to head out onto the field. So that that's what the partnership was really about originally.And so what we're bringing to it now is bringing AI into both that game day process I talked about, but even the whole road and journey to Game day. So now those devices are Microsoft Surface Co-Pilot Plus PCs and we have AI filterry that's allowing you to look through different types of plays, the outcomes of the plays, and really get to the information faster than ever before.
Yeah, so it sounds like to me at some point, uh, maybe today it's just about gathering data as quickly as possible to relay that information on the sideline between coaches and players, but it sounds like at some point, potentially coaches might be using this to uh analyze coverages and other things like that through AI rather than doing it themselves.
When it comes to AI, it's always about enhancing what they're already doing, right? So it is about making sure that we're developing tools that what coaches are already doing, what players are already doing. They're just having new resources, new information that help them do it better than before. So I think there's going to be a continuedEvolution to what the AI is going to be doing on the sideline, and the way we come up with exactly what that is going to be, it's direct feedback from those individuals we're going to be using it. What is it that they need? What is it going to bring them the greatest value on the field, or even, you know, training before they get to the field.
Yeah, and just so the audience knows here, I think you guys distributed 2500 of these, uh these tablets, these computers to NFL teams this year. So you do the math. 32 teams divided by 21, 2500 is uh quite a lot per team, and they're obviously putting them to good use. But I know you guys are also putting together this game day operations dashboard. Maybe tell us a little bit more about that and what that's going to do for teams.
Um, well, first of all, I love that you brought in the number because you're exactly right, and I've, I've enjoyed watching how that request for more devices has grown year over year. I think you started early on with maybe a handful of players or coaches actually using them during the game to now where you are and you're hard pressed to to watch a game and not see them being used on the sideline. Um, but I love the.Analyst scenario as well, because it's something you don't get to see when you watch game day as often. You know, at the top of the stadium, there are these data analysts in the coach's booth that are an incredible resource to the coaching staff. And so what they were doing just two seasons ago was using pen and paper to count snaps or to, you know, jot down notes andto get insights for those coaches that are on the field. And so what we have with the data analyst Dashboard is it's a new solution using Excel, um, using copilot that is bringing all of that data now into a single environment. It's loading in in real time, and then they can actually add their filters, ask the questions. So I always love a great example of how they would use it is, um,Maybe you have a running back that's coming off of an injury, right? And you want to make sure they're they're playing this game and you want to keep them able to play the next game. So what a coach might call up to the data analyst is to say, hey, how many snaps is my has my running back been playing or how many uh rushing plays that they've been involved with so that we can manage their load and, you know, make sure they're they're ready for the next game day. So that type of information being able to sort through, get it fast, and be able to answer that question on the field is critical.
Yeah, it seems so small and simple because really you're eliminating maybe a few seconds here or there depending on the data, but it also eliminates all the time required to store that data, right? No one has to, you know, log every snap, see if they're on the field. The data just tells you right there in the dashboard, which is great. Tell me more about some of the things that you guys are working on now. One of the questions I always love to ask is like, is there anything that you guys are working on now that's maybe 1 year, 23 years out that uh will or hopefully eventually get implemented that you think would be uh additive to this process?
Oh, where do I start? There's a lot that is, uh, in discussion and that we're exploring because honestly, the possibilities are endless. But maybe what I'd highlight is some of what we're doing at the club level as well. So oftentime we look at the league level, but there's some really interesting projects happening at the club club level. Um, it really goes to everything from their scouting processes so that they can develop and identify talent early, uh, make sure they're going to be the right fit for what they're needing on their teams all the way through to the.Training plans and making sure that they are, you know, managing load and their training for their players to keep them at their top performance levels, and usually taking a lot of what they're learning and seeing on the field and bringing that into the practice and using the tools to be able to, uh, review that quicker and bring the data that comes along with it into a more digestible way that they can get meaningful insights. So there's definitely a lot there, but I would probably also addUm, there's a lot that happens off the field too and outside of football operations. So, you know, everything from how they engage with their fans and how they, um, you know, uh, get more, more people to head to the game on game day to to watch all the excitement. There's a lot of the business operations behind sports, which is another area we focus on with these clubs.
Yeah, and I assume most people think of Microsoft as this big technology company, which Microsoft is, of course, but I'd love to hear from your position as the director of sports partnerships, just how you guys think about sports in general and how that sort of fits into the brand.
So sports are something that people just have this incredible passion for, right? It is just something that brings this vibrancy and energy, but it's still a business. Whether you're a sports property or you're a uh a club or team, whatever it might be, there's still a business. And so there's a lot of uh synergies between the scenarios and things that we actually do with these sports organizations that carry over to you, you name the industry, you know, manufacturing, finance, health, whatever.Might be the scenarios are still similar. You know, maybe in sports you're talking about fan bases and how to better understand your fans and deliver more personalized experiences, but maybe in another industry, it's just your customers and how are you using AI to better understand your customers and deliver more, you know, personalized opportunities and experiences for them. So for us, sports is, is definitely an exciting avenue, but it's one where we can showcase the broader potential across industries.
Yeah, I know you talked a little bit bit about uh how AI could eventually help and is helping some of these other roles outside of just the coaching staff and other people like that, whether it's game day, ticket sales, whatever it might be.But I wonder if we'll eventually get to a point, and it sounds like maybe we will, where teams will be using, uh, you know, AI within Microsoft and specifically more AI agents to either, uh, maybe reduce headcount, but certainly get more efficient around uh some of the football related stuff too, right? Player scouting, salary cap management, whether that means, you know, just giving suggestions or constantly analyzing things and doing the work that maybe would take 1 or 2 or 3 other individuals. Do you think that's something that will eventually be coming downstream?
Definitely part of a lot of our conversations with their clubs is around how do we look at the different initiatives and activities that individuals across the organizations are doing, and how can we actually leverage AI and agents to empower and make what they're doing more efficient, moreEffective or whatever it might be. So it's a lot of it is leveraging um their own data or a lot of the stuff that they're already doing, and how can we accelerate it. So I do think it's going to be very, very common across the sports landscape as as it is starting to become across all industries.
How many people within Microsoft are working on sports right now?
Oh, I couldn't answer. That's a great question. I, I like
hundreds orlike dozens.
You know, it depends on what capacity. I would actually say there's a lot, because if you think about it, there's, you know, the, the partnerships that we have that people are aware of, but we also have incredible customers across the sports landscape that have teams that are day in and day out working with them to find those.Innovative scenarios and some of that agent work that you just talked about or how to find and integrate AI into their into their business operations. So there is, there's gonna be a lot that touch sports in some way, shape, or form, uh, throughout their their day jobs.
Amazing. I asked because it seems like you guys are working with not only the NFL but a bunch of other leagues and of course teams as well. So it's an exciting time to be in tech and sports for sure. So thank you so much for joining us today, Monica.
Pleasure. Thanks for having me.
The clock is one down here, but we have just enough time for some final buzz. So, let's talk about the Ryder Cup. This weekend, the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black isn't just a golf tournament. It's one of the biggest moneymakers in sports. With 250,000 fans pouring into Long Island, the PJ of America will generate more than $125 million from ticket sales alone, but that's just the start.The Long Island Railroad is pocketing an estimated $20 million by selling $175 commuter passes. Luxury Hospitality Company on location has already sold out of its $10,000 metro tickets, which come with a black car service from the city. And once you add in hotels, restaurants, car services, and state taxes, the Ryder Cup becomes an economic engine for dozens of New York businesses.And then there's the tickets themselves. At $750 for a single day pass, this year's Ryder Cup is officially the most expensive in history. Double the previous record and on par with tier one sporting events like the Super Bowl or Game 7 of the NBA Finals. Fans will easily spend close to $1000 per day after accounting for food, merchandise, and travel. And out of counters, their tab could reach $5000. But rather than just complaining about the high ticket prices, it's essential.Understand how the PGA actually came up with this number. First, the PGA of America hired consultants to study local demand. Think ticket pricing charts for the Yankees, Mets, Giants, and Jets. And instead of leaving resalers with a huge margin, the PGA of America prices tickets closer to the secondary market value, capturing additional revenue for its sale, while also reducing the number of scalpers. The financial impact of this decision is massive. Ticket sales alone net 10.$30 million. Hospitality might add another $65 million. NBC is paying $55 million for broadcast rights. Merchandise will tack on millions more. And all told, the 2025 Ryder Cup is expected to generate over $200 million in revenue. That makes it not just golf's biggest event, but a true tier one global spectacle. Fans bring the energy, the PJ cashes the checks, and this weekend, Bethpage Black becomes the center of the sports business universe.We're all out of time, so it's officially game over for this week.

Yahoo Finance Sports Report is developed and produced by Lauren Pokedoff.
sounds like to me at some point, uh maybe today it's just about gathering data as quickly as possible to relay that information on the sideline between coaches and players. But it sounds like at some point, potentially coaches might be using this to uh analyze coverages and other things like that through AI rather than doing it themselves.
When it comes to AI, it's always about enhancing what they're already doing, right? So it is about making sure that we're developing tools that what coaches are already doing, what players are already doing. They're just having new resources, new information that help them do it better than before. So I think there's going to be a continued evolution to what the AI is going to be doing on the sideline and the way we come up with exactly what that is going to be, it's direct feedback from those individuals who are going to be using it. What is it that they need? What is it going to bring them the greatest value on the field or even, you know, training before they get to the field?
Yeah, and just so the audience knows here, I think you guys distributed 2,500 of these, uh these tablets, these computers to NFL teams this year. So, you do the math, 32 teams divided by 21 2,500 is uh quite a lot per team and they're obviously putting them to good use. But I know you guys are also putting together this uh game day operations dashboard. Maybe tell us a little bit more about that and what that's going to do for teams.
Uh well, first of all, I love that you brought in the number because you're exactly right. and I've I've enjoyed watching how that request for more devices has grown year over year. I think you started early on with maybe a handful of players or coaches actually using them during a game to now where you are and you're hard pressed to to watch a game and not see them being used on the sideline. Um but I love the data analyst scenario as well because it's something you don't get to see when you watch game days often. You know, at the top of the stadium, there are these data analysts in the coaches booth that are an incredible resource to the coaching staff. And so what they were doing just two seasons ago was using pen and paper to count snaps or to, you know, jot down notes and try to get insights for those coaches that are on the field. And so what we have with the data analyst dashboard is it's a new solution, uh using Excel, um using co-pilot that is bringing all of that data now into a single environment. It's loading in in real time and then they can actually add their filters, ask the questions. So I always love a great example of how they would use it is, um, maybe you have a running back that's coming off with an injury, right? And you want to make sure they're they're playing this game but you want to keep them able to play the next game. So what a coach might call up to the data analyst is to say, hey, how many snaps does my, has my running back been playing or how many uh rushing plays have they've been involved with so that we can manage their load and you know, make sure they're they're ready for the next game day. So that type of information being able to sort through, get it fast and be able to answer that question on the field is critical."

Michigan has gotten one step closer to adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset.
House Bill 4087 finally made progress last week after stalling for seven months. Lawmakers moved the bill to a second reading and referred it to the Government Operations committee.
The bill, introduced by Republican state Reps. Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson in February, would permit the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of the state’s general fund and countercyclical budget and economic stabilization fund in Bitcoin and possibly other cryptocurrencies.

According to the bill, the state treasurer may also lend these assets to increase yield, provided doing so does not increase financial risk to the state.
After last week's progress, the bill has completed 25% of the roadmap to becoming law, according to open access legislative database LegiScan. Bitcoin Laws, a platform tracking Bitcoin-related legislation across the U.S., estimates that the bill still has five hurdles to cross before becoming law, including two committee readings and votes in the state House and Senate.
If lawmakers pass the bill, it will go to the desk of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has yet to express an opinion on the bill.

So far, Arizona, New Hampshire and Texas are the only U.S. states that have enacted Bitcoin reserve laws. Texas said in June that it had allocated $10 million to fund its reserve.
Beyond Michigan, Massachusetts and Ohio continue to consider strategic Bitcoin reserve bills, though neither has advanced since early this year. Similar legislation has failed to pass in 35 other states, according to Bitcoin Laws.
While Michigan state lawmakers are still considering HB 4087, the state's pension fund, The Michigan Office of Retirement Services, is expanding its exposure to Bitcoin. The fund reported a $10 million position in Ark Invest‘s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (CBOE: ARKB) in Q2. The filing showed the organization grew its share holdings in the ETF by 200% within the quarter.

The statewide push to adopt Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aligns with President Donald Trump‘s cryptocurrency agenda. Trump in March issued an executive order establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve from seized assets following through on a promise made on the campaign trail. The order also directed the secretaries of Commerce and the Treasury to pursue ""budget-neutral"" strategies to add to the reserve."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -An Amazon vice president helping to oversee one of the company's highest profile projects, artificial general intelligence, is stepping down on Friday, the online retailer confirmed after a Reuters inquiry.
Karthik Ramakrishnan, a 13-year veteran of Amazon, is stepping down, according to internal communications reviewed by Reuters. It could not be learned if he had another job lined up and Ramakrishnan did not respond to a request for comment.
Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is technology being developed that researchers believe could one day equal or even outperform human-level intelligence. AGI, if perfected, could help to further automate work done today by humans, potentially upending fields as diverse as warfare, healthcare and stock trading.
Ramakrishnan worked on the first iteration of Amazon's Alexa voice assistant and the associated Echo devices. He began his career at Netscape before moving to Tellme Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn profile.
His departure is among several higher profile ones in recent months, including Vasi Philomin, a vice president guiding generative AI development; and Jon Jones, who led the AWS global startups and venture capital business.
Amazon is working to bolster its reputation for developing AI software and services as rivals like OpenAI and Google have captured market share. It has invested around $8 billion in startup Anthropic and uses its Claude AI model in products like Alexa and an internal chatbot known as Cedric.
On Thursday at an internal all-hands meeting, AWS chief Matt Garman pressed employees to meet timelines for releasing products, saying Amazon can ""lose some of that buzz"" when customers have to wait to try out new services, Reuters reported.

Nearly 80% of consumer usage for Claude comes from outside the United States, with per-person usage in countries like South Korea, Australia and Singapore outpacing that of America, the company said.
Anthropic, valued at $183 billion and backed by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), has distinguished itself, in part, by building AI models that excel at coding.
Its Claude large language models are widely regarded as one of the most powerful frontier models on the market, and this has helped grow the company's global business customer base from under 1,000 to more than 300,000 in two years.
The company's run-rate revenue had grown to more than $5 billion by August from about $1 billion at the beginning of the year.
As international demand drives the company's momentum, Anthropic plans to hire for more than 100 new positions across Dublin, London and Zurich.
The company also plans to open its first Asian office in Tokyo, besides additional office locations in Europe.
The global expansion is led by Chris Ciauri, who recently joined as managing director of International following Paul Smith's appointment as chief commercial officer.
""The global demand for Claude is extraordinary—from financial services in London to manufacturing in Tokyo, enterprises are trusting Claude to power their mission-critical operations,"" Ciauri said.
Earlier this week, Microsoft (MSFT) signed a deal with Anthropic to integrate Claude models into its Copilot assistant, marking a shift for the generative AI chatbot that has primarily used OpenAI.

“Sometimes, though, you have a winner right in front of your face and you don’t realize it. When I was at NVIDIA’s big GTC conference… I was checking out the booth of all those companies that were working with Nvidia installing product into the data centers… At the end of the hall in what seemed to me to be a pretty empty booth… this company, Nebius, is a data center builder like CoreWeave. I felt bad for them, like no one was paying any attention to them, so I asked what they did. I sauntered it over there. They filled me in. They were going to be a part of the power solution. I thanked them. Never really thought about it again until yesterday when the company won a $17 billion contract to build a data center for Microsoft in Vineland, New Jersey… Sure enough, Nebius, which had been creeping up, vaulted from $64 to nearly $96 today in a colossal move. Nebius, it turns out, used to be a part of Yandex, a controversial Russian story. Spun out from Yandex, Nebius is controversial no more. It’s just electric, literally.”

Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong has set an ambitious target for the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange: replacing consumer banks.
""Ultimately, we want to be a bank replacement for people,"" Armstrong told Fox Business last week. ""We want to be their primary financial account.""
Armstrong said Coinbase and the cryptocurrency industry in general could offer more efficient financial services than traditional banks.

""It kind of boggles my mind, like, why are we paying 2 to 3% every time we swipe our credit card?"" he told Fox Business. ""It should not cost 2 to 3% every time you swipe your credit card. It’s just some just some bits of data flowing over the internet. It should be free or close to it. And so that’s just one example of many things that crypto can do to update the financial system.""
Armstrong said Coinbase intended to become a ""super app"" to achieve its goals. The term refers to a company that offers a broad range of financial services on a single platform. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins has popularized the term in recent months, arguing that so-called super apps should be able to operate with a single license.
""We can offer better financial service products across the board, not just on trading,"" Armstrong told Fox Business.

Coinbase also needs to broaden its services to maintain its lead over competitors like Gemini (NASDAQ: GEMI), Armstrong said. He added that customers were likely to use Coinbase’s services because they held their assets on the exchange, noting that the exchange held more cryptocurrencies than any other company.
Armstrong’s remarks come as tensions appear to be rising between legacy financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges over stablecoin adoption. Banking groups have lobbied against exchanges offering interest and rewards to stablecoin holders, citing deposit flight risks.
Armstrong last week slammed these lobbying efforts as attempts to block competition. He compared stablecoin interest from exchanges to airline miles and credit card rewards, noting that every company should be allowed to have reward programs."

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s shares have gained 21% year-to-date, with media reports attributing the rise to a turnaround in the firm’s software business and the Azure cloud computing division. Cramer’s previous comments about the firm have wondered whether too much of the market was concentrated in its and NVIDIA’s shares. This time, he discussed a note from Ben Reitzes at Melius Research. The note outlined that the shares had been sold unfairly and the stock could gain momentum over the coming months. Some of the reasons behind Reitzes’ optimism include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s cloud computing business, AI agents, and partnership with OpenAI. Here is what Cramer said about the note:
Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com
“I want to talk about Microsoft for a second. There’s this fellow Ben Retizes at Melius, he’s been very good. He’s been actually dead right. And he’s saying it’s time for, believe it or not, a catch up trade for Microsoft, which is just kind of, you know, in a lull. But this is itself I think is doing extraordinarily well. Talking about how Copilot’s gonna be able to be revealed as a smashing success. I also think, things are a little clouded by AI, by OpenAI, we don’t know.”

When it comes to US equities, the opposite happened. Foreign purchases rose to a record in the second quarter, according to Federal Reserve Board data. Demand has been so brisk that stocks now make up nearly 32% of foreigners allocations to US assets — breaking a record that’s been in place since 1968.
While data show that foreigners have scaled back on travel to the US along with some purchases of US-made products, the American stock market has proven too enticing to quit. Part of that owes to the dominance of firms chasing riches in artificial intelligence, which has swelled the share prices of Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., among others. And while they have been buying stocks, foreign investors have sent the dollar sharply lower, perhaps hedging exposure to the US.
“While tariffs have led many foreign consumers to boycott US products, US equities remained in high demand,” said Rob Anderson, US sector strategist at Ned Davis Research. Canadians, for example, have been buying US stocks while shunning American products.
Foreigners plowed $290.7 billion into the US stock market in the three months ended June 30, accord to the Fed data. Treasury International Capital (TIC) data showed that as of July, foreign holdings of US equities are on pace to rise by $2.8 trillion this year, said Elyas Galou, director of global investment strategy at Bank of America.
Foreign buyers hold some $18 trillion in US stocks, about 30% of the nearly $60 trillion market, the most in data going back to 1945, according to Fed data cited by Bank of America. The dollar value of their holdings has obviously appreciated with asset prices, though the percentage of the total has climbed.
“International investors are still buying US equities at a very strong pace,” Galou said.
While returns have been solid in 2025, at the index level, the purchases haven’t been as lucrative as they would have been if executed in other major stock markets. The S&P 500 has underperformed equity benchmarks in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and China, both in local currency and in US dollar terms."

Since then, the biggest tech companies in the world have only grown bigger and wielded even more influence over the stock market.
Apple touched a $3 trillion market cap in early 2022 just ahead of the market downturn. It has since been joined (and surpassed) in the $3 trillion club by Microsoft and Nvidia.
The newer members have seen their fortunes rise on the back of growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia designs leading-edge graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for AI training and inference. Microsoft is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, outfitting its huge data centers with GPU servers and renting capacity to AI developers, including generative AI leader OpenAI.
This month, another AI stock joined the $3 trillion club, but it could easily climb even higher over the next few years. Here's what investors need to know.
Say hello to the newest member of the $3 trillion club
On Sept. 15, Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) entered the $3 trillion club after its shares received a boost from news about a friendly court ruling.
After the courts ruled that Alphabet violated antitrust law with its Google search engine and its stranglehold over the search advertising market, the company faced potential remedies that could have significantly hurt its earnings and operations. Some speculated that it would have to divest its Chrome web browser or Android operating system. Others thought the court might bar it from making revenue-sharing deals with other web browser owners that make it the default search engine.
But when the judge made his remedies ruling earlier this month, it was far more lenient: no required divestitures, and Alphabet could continue making deals as a default search engine as long as it didn't require exclusivity.
Not only was the ruling a boon for Alphabet's stock, it also meant Apple could hold on to a key component of its services business. Alphabet's biggest contract is with Apple, which makes Google the default search engine across its billions of devices (where legal). That nets Apple $20 billion per year in fees, which practically all goes toward its bottom line.
More importantly, the ruling lifts a huge overhang for the stock prices of both companies. And while Alphabet shares have already climbed substantially higher, they could continue climbing from here due to multiple factors.
What could drive the company to a $4 trillion market cap?
Alphabet's stock was weighed down by the potential remedies it faced, but that's not the only thing impeding the stock. Many fear that growing competition from AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Perplexity will eat into Google's market share. In fact, that was one of the main reasons the judge didn't come down harder on Alphabet.
But the impact of those search alternatives has yet to show up in Alphabet's financial results. Its Google search revenue accelerated last quarter, growing 12% year over year. And with AI features like its Overviews, Circle to Search, and Google Lens driving increased traffic and monetizing at high rates, that trend could continue as the company expands those features.
On top of that, AI is driving considerable growth for Alphabet's cloud computing business. It surpassed a $50 billion run rate in the second quarter, and its operating margin expanded to 21%. Operating margin could expand as Alphabet scales up its operations. Amazon, for example, has an operating margin for its cloud computing business of 37% over the last 12 months.
Alphabet's Other Bets could provide another catalyst for the stock. Specifically, its Waymo self-driving car business has made significant progress in expanding operations over the last two years, and its progress could accelerate over the next few years. It recently announced plans to enter Nashville, its 12th major market, and is testing its service in six other markets, including New York and Tokyo.
But here's what could be the biggest factor driving Alphabet to $4 trillion: multiple expansion. Even after the price appreciation that pushed the company's value above $3 trillion, the stock currently trades for just 25.7 times forward earnings estimates. Meanwhile, the other members of the $3 trillion club all trade for an average earnings multiple above 35.
If Alphabet's multiple expands to just 29 times forward earnings by the end of next year, the company will be worth well over $4 trillion based on current estimates for 2027 earnings."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-26T08:05:00,This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giant Could Increase Its $10 Billion Business 14-Fold in 5 Years,But it doesn't come without some significant risks for investors.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e49e4bfde21dff9133ab40a12487b95a3ac0ae305ee889dae635dd4027961b76,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/artificial-intelligence-ai-giant-increase-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/artificial-intelligence-ai-giant-increase-stock/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/artificial-intelligence-ai-giant-increase-stock/,fool.com,200,,"Global spending on artificial intelligence (AI) is set to reach $1.5 trillion this year, according to estimates from Gartner. Even with the huge amount businesses and tech companies are already spending, that number is forecast to climb even further well into the future. The analysts at Gartner expect total spending to hit $2 trillion in 2026. Many analysts see total spending climbing through the end of the decade in order to take advantage of the massive opportunity and promises of generative AI.
One company managed to build a massive $10 billion business out of demand for artificial intelligence compute in just a few years, and it expects to capture a significant amount of market share over the next few years. In fact, management said it expects that $10 billion in annual sales to grow to $144 billion in sales within five years. And it has the contracts to back it up.
The massive opportunity ahead
A handful of companies are rapidly building out data centers and leasing space and equipment in order to meet the demand of tech companies training and using large language models. Some contracts from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, two leading LLM developers, are worth tens of billions of dollars per year. And the biggest cloud computing platforms -- owned by Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), and Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) -- are unable to keep up with the growing demand.
As AI companies look to diversify their compute providers, Oracle (ORCL 1.45%) has emerged as a strong alternative with excellent networking capabilities and competitive pricing. However, its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is lacking in scale relative to the three market leaders. That didn't stop OpenAI from committing $300 billion to Oracle's cloud business over five years starting in 2027.
As a result, Oracle reported a huge increase in its backlog of remaining performance obligations. The amount stood at $455 billion as of the end of the company's first quarter, up from $137 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. While $300 billion of that is tied to OpenAI, Oracle added another $18 billion in contracts on top of that.
And management expects to sign additional contracts in the near future. It said OCI's remaining performance obligations will likely exceed $500 billion by the end of the current quarter.
If management succeeds in growing OCI from $10 billion to $144 billion over the next five years, it'll end the decade with a cloud business similar in size to Alphabet's, based on current growth rates. If it can manage to earn similar operating margins as the three big providers today (20% to 37%), it could produce a huge boost to its existing earnings.
While management notes it already has the backlog to support its revenue outlook, it's important to consider the significant risks that come with investing in Oracle stock right now.
The future is not guaranteed
Oracle burned $5.9 billion in cash over the past 12 months as it expanded OCI capacity. It took on $27 billion worth of debt over the past year, and it now holds $111 billion of debt on its balance sheet. It'll have to take on more debt and burn more cash to build out the capacity needed to meet demand for its cloud computing business.
To put things in perspective, Microsoft is committing to $30 billion in capital expenditures for the current quarter, and it'll likely maintain that pace throughout the year. Amazon expects to spend over $100 billion in 2025, mostly on additional compute capacity. Alphabet updated its target spend to $85 billion for the year, as demand for its cloud infrastructure continues to outstrip supply.
They all have significant backlogs, but none is as big as Oracle's is now. Oracle plans to spend $35 billion this year, with OCI revenue of $18 billion.
Meanwhile, its three biggest competitors are producing strong positive free cash flow thanks to the fact that they already have large, established cloud businesses and massive businesses outside of cloud computing. Oracle's legacy software business doesn't generate nearly enough cash to keep up with the demand for AI compute.
But it's not just the financing risk Oracle faces. It also takes on the risk of a long-term contract with OpenAI. The generative AI leader has committed to spending $30 billion on Oracle's compute starting in 2027 and ramping up from there. But the company itself is only bringing in $13 billion in revenue this year, according to its CFO's outlook. It's also committed to spending $10 billion with Broadcom, not to mention its existing cloud computing deals with Microsoft and Alphabet.
It's also unclear how profitable the OpenAI deal will be if it comes to full fruition. Oracle must have offered very attractive pricing relative to its larger competitors to attract such a big commitment. That could result in a significantly worse margin profile relative to Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet.
Nonetheless, shares of Oracle have now skyrocketed in price, reaching a forward PE ratio of 45 based on estimates for fiscal 2026. That's far higher than its larger cloud competitors, making the stock a much riskier investment. If Oracle can execute, build the capacity it needs, and OpenAI holds up its end of the deal, it could be a huge winner over the next five years. But the other three cloud computing providers' stocks look like much better values with much less risk right now."

Elon Musk is ramping up hiring for Macrohard, his newly announced AI software venture, through which he plans to create simulations of software companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT).
Musk Pitches Macrohard As AI-Only Software Company
Musk unveiled Macrohard last month, describing it as a ""purely AI software company"" with a ""tongue-in-cheek name.""
On Wednesday, xAI co-founder Yuhuai Wu took to X, formerly Twitter, and said that they are assembling a team to develop computer control agents.
These agents will be integrated into Macrohard as well as Grok 5.
Musk also shared the job listing, saying, ""Help build Macrohard, the AI software company!""
Elon Musk's Macrohard Trademark Targets AI, Gaming And Software
A U.S. trademark filing for Macrohard, submitted by xAI on Aug. 1, covers a wide range of AI applications, including text and speech generation, as well as video game design and coding.
The launch of Macrohard marks the newest venture in Musk's expanding business empire, which already spans Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), xAI, X Corp, The Boring Company, SpaceX and Neuralink.
xAI Eyes AGI With Grok, Expands AI Integration In Tesla Vehicles Globally
Earlier this month, Musk said that he believes xAI could achieve Artificial General Intelligence with the upcoming Grok 5 model.
AGI refers to an AI system capable of performing tasks at or above human intelligence across a wide range of domains, including reasoning and problem-solving.
Reaching AGI is a major goal for AI companies worldwide.
Currently, Grok AI integration is available in Tesla vehicles in the U.S. equipped with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) chips.
Tesla also reportedly plans to roll out DeepSeek AI in Chinese vehicles, developed in collaboration with ByteDance's Dubao AI, to handle in-car AI interactions.
Musk and Gates Clash Over Tesla, Philanthropy And Billionaire Roles
Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the world's most prominent billionaires, have experienced tensions over Tesla and broader philanthropic issues.
Gates, in an interview with Walter Isaacson, author of Musk's 2023 biography, acknowledged that Musk reacted strongly when he learned Gates had shorted Tesla stock.
The former Microsoft CEO described Musk's response as ""super mean."" Gates confirmed he had maintained a short position in Tesla.
The disagreement briefly drew public attention when Musk shared a meme mocking Gates. By 2025, the tension had evolved into a wider ideological disagreement, with both billionaires publicly expressing differing views on foreign aid, philanthropy and the responsibilities of wealthy individuals.
OpenAI And Musk Face Legal Battle Over App Store Competition
Musk and Microsoft-backed OpenAI are also engaged in a high-profile legal and business dispute. The conflict escalated after OpenAI, co-founded by Musk in 2015 as a nonprofit, transitioned toward a for-profit model.
Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, alleging breaches of nonprofit commitments.
OpenAI responded, claiming Musk conducted a campaign of harassment to hinder its operations.
The dispute widened when Musk's companies, X and xAI, sued Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and OpenAI over claims of unfair advantages for ChatGPT in the App Store.
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
SoFi gives membersaccess to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.
Range Wealth Management
Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
American Hartford Gold
For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides asimple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets."

On September 23, the company announced that it has successfully tested a new microfluidic cooling system that can remove heat up to three times better than cold plates currently used in data centers.
Microfluidics is an approach that allows bringing the liquid coolant directly inside the silicon, where the heat is. Tiny channels are etched on the back of the silicon chip, forming grooves that allow the cooling liquid to flow over the surface and remove heat more effectively.
The team at Microsoft also leveraged artificial intelligence to map unique heat signatures on the chip so that the coolant can be directed with precision. Based on the lab-scale tests, microfluidics performed up to three times better than cold plates based on workloads and configurations involved.
Moreover, it managed to reduce the maximum temperature rise of the silicon inside a GPU by 65 percent. However, this is dependent on the type of chip, the company noted. The advanced cooling technology is anticipated to improve power usage effectiveness and reduce operational costs.
“Microfluidics would allow for more power-dense designs that will enable more features that customers care about and give better performance in a smaller amount of space.” -Judy Priest, corporate vice president and chief technical officer of Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft.
Looking ahead, the company continues to investigate how microfluidic cooling can be fused into future generations of its first-party chips. Microsoft will also continue collaborating with fabrication and silicon partners to bring microfluidics into production across its datacenters.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides AI-powered cloud, productivity, and business solutions, focusing on efficiency, security, and AI advancements.

The first U.S. cryptocurrency index exchange-traded fund has gone live for trading.
""We are ushering in the age of crypto index investing,"" Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg told CNBC last week as the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (NYSE: GDLC) finally went live for trading.
The fund, also known as the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF, provides investors with exposure to the top five largest and most liquid cryptocurrency assets, as measured by the CoinDesk 5 Index. Bitcoin accounts for 72.43% of the fund's weighting, while Ethereum accounts for 16.95%. XRP, Solana and Cardano represent 5.6%, 4.01% and 1.02% of the fund’s allocation, respectively, according to Grayscale’s website. Grayscale claims that the fund covers 90% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.

Grayscale has committed to rebalancing the fund quarterly to keep its alignment with the CoinDesk 5 Index.
The fund saw a respectable $22 million in trading volume on its first day of trading, according to Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, as analysts have expressed high hopes for cryptocurrency index funds.
""I think basket/index crypto ETPs are going to be the third or possibly second largest category of crypto ETPs after only Bitcoin ETPs over a long enough time frame,"" Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst James Seyffart said last week.
GDLC existed as a private over-the-counter fund before receiving approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission last week to convert to an ETF. The SEC initially approved the conversion in July, but stayed its decision at the same time.

Making sense of the forces driving global markets
By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist
World stocks posted their biggest fall in more than three weeks and the dollar rose on Thursday, as surprisingly strong U.S. growth figures cast doubt on how aggressive the Federal Reserve's interest rate-cutting cycle will be.
In my column today I look at the reasons why the Fed may one day consider replacing its current 2% inflation target with an inflation range. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic likes the idea. Will other Fed officials be so keen?
If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.

Today's Talking Points:
* Back and froth
Investors calling the bursting of the AI/tech bubble and the equity market top in recent months have been burned badly. And often. So why should this current wobble be any different?
There may be no obvious reason or catalyst. The risks are well-known by now - stretched valuations, positioning, concentration, and faith in AI's productivity-enhancing powers. And the Fed is cutting rates now, so that's more fuel for the rally, right? Perhaps. Or perhaps it marks the contrarian top.
* Crypto blues
After rebounding some 65% from its April lows, bitcoin seems to have hit a ceiling. The world's biggest cryptocurrency has mostly flatlined over the last three months, a period in which it has reached its record high around $124,000."

Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) is streamlining how companies buy and use its AI tools.
The tech giant said it has merged its separate marketplaces one aimed at developers on Azure and another for AI-powered workplace apps into a single store called Microsoft Marketplace. The new platform launched in the U.S. and will roll out globally in the coming months.
Businesses will now be able to browse apps, AI agents, and developer tools in one place, pay for them through existing Microsoft accounts, and plug them directly into products like Office and Teams.
Unlike Apple's App Store, Microsoft won't take a commission on sales. Instead, it charges a publishing fee and earns money from the cloud services developers rely on to run their apps. Every app will also go through a security review to ensure companies keep control of their data.
Microsoft is trying to lock in business demand for AI by making its ecosystem easier to use. For investors, it shows how Microsoft is making money from AI without having to sell apps to consumers."

He was not surprised. But he was dismayed.
“I can’t afford to pay $100,000,” Awadallah told TechCrunch. He’s hired one employee on an H-1B, and while the new fee only applies to new applications, he believes it’s too high for many startups and will price them out of hiring internationally.
The H-1B visa was created to allow companies to hire skilled talent from a worldwide market for such occupations as IT and engineering. On Friday, Trump announced that the fee hike, typically paid by the employer, would increase from $2,000-$5,000 to $100,000 per application, a change that will especially be felt with the new batch of visas available in March.
Immigration is a key issue for President Trump, who, even dating back to his 2016 campaign run, accused companies of using the H-1B to take jobs from U.S. citizens.
Critics of the fee hike note that this visa helped bring in people who have gone on to start or run multibillion-dollar companies. Former holders include Google’s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and Elon Musk. The visa has been more accessible than the O-1 visa for extraordinary ability, and quicker to obtain than a green card.
“The impact will be severe on the competitiveness and innovation of smaller startups compared to the hyperscales, the big businesses,” Awadallah said. While Big Tech can more easily afford such fees, he feels that startups will miss out. Pricing startups out, he said, “will impact innovation in very, very negative ways longer term.”
Could cost the tech industry $5.5 billion a year
More than 700,000 people live in the U.S. on an H-1B, and they’ve brought with them more than 500,000 dependents, such as spouses (who are permitted to work under this visa) and children, according to the immigration and criminal justice advocacy group fwd.us. Indian nationals are the largest recipients of the visa, followed by China and the rest of the world, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Only 85,000 new people a year can receive the visa (20,000 of them must have just graduated from a U.S. university), and demand outstrips availability, so H-1Bs are allocated at random, in a lottery held in March. Tech companies have lobbied for years for an increase in annual H-1B limits.
Critics allege that these companies are using H-1B holders to replace U.S. workers with lower-paid employees from overseas. Others say it exploits foreign workers, as the visa is tied to the employer, so workers can’t easily switch jobs and they face deportation if they lose their jobs."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Cisco on Thursday announced a new software tool aimed at weaving together quantum computers from various makers into a single cloud, making it easier to develop useful applications.
Major tech firms such as Microsoft , IBM and Google are investing in building out their own quantum computers, which use properties of quantum physics to solve difficult computing problems faster than classical machines. Cisco, a major provider of networking gear for those classical machines, has taken a different track, aiming to create a new category of networking chips to connect quantum machines together.
In addition to quantum networking chips, Cisco is also working on the software that will be needed to connect quantum machines together. The tool announced on Thursday, which Cisco said it would make available for download next week, aims to analyze a quantum computing problem and then split it up across different machines - including machines that use fundamentally different approaches to achieving quantum computing.
Large tech companies and startups are still in heated competition around which kind of quantum computer will work best, but Cisco is aiming to take problems that software developers want to solve and break those problems up and assign them to whichever kind of computer might be best for that piece of the problem.
""You as the customer, as the quantum algorithm developer, should not worry about the kinds of technology that exist,"" Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president of Cisco's Outshift innovation incubator, told Reuters. ""We will handle that complexity.""

Ford Motor Co. is tapping a new leader of labor affairs who brings labor and legal experience from The Boeing Co., Microsoft and Dow Jones to the job.
On Thursday, Sept. 25, Ford appointed Mike Fitzsimmons to be the company's vice president of Global Labor, succeeding Kevin Legel, who worked at Ford for 32 years before his retirement, spending the last six years atop labor affairs at the company.
Fitzsimmons has worked in labor relations and employment law for more than two decades, according to Ford. He recently managed new contracts with 60,000 union-represented employees at Boeing.
Fitzsimmons' new title, vice president of global labor, differs slightly from his predecessor, Legel, who served as vice president of labor affairs at Ford.
A spokesperson at Ford said the change in title will not impact Fitzsimmons' role leading Ford labor relations.
Ford Chief People and Employee Experience Officer Jen Waldo said in a news release that the company is ""pleased to welcome Mike to our team and look forward to having his deep knowledge of labor relations at Ford.”
Fitzsimmons will be tasked with managing the United Auto Workers' next contract, which is set to expire in 2028 in tandem with the union's contracts at crosstown rivals Stellantis and General Motors.
UAW President Shawn Fain recently promised that the UAW would fight for pensions and retirement health care for all members of the union — benefits that were sacrificed at automakers during the Great Recession.

Unlike pure-play AI developers, Microsoft operates a sprawling business involving traditional software, cloud services, and even hardware. But underneath it all is an AI presence that's only going to grow.
Aiming squarely at AI
In Microsoft's conference call discussing its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 results at the end of July, CEO Satya Nadella and his fellow top executives mentioned AI no less than 37 times.
The technology is obviously top of mind to Microsoft from the C-suite on down, and it's plowing gobs of capital into its development. It's a major investor in OpenAI, the developer of arguably the most well-known AI tool (ChatGPT).
In what's surely not a coincidence, it's also a frequent user of OpenAI's technology. In varied ways, it's integrating this into a range of products, most notably Copilot, the ""digital assistant"" easily accessible by Windows and Office 365 users. Other products and services, such as the Bing search engine, Edge browser, and the GitHub developer platform, have also received AI spruce-ups.
One business of many
The great advantage of being an AI company packed into a sprawling tech powerhouse active in many revenue-generating segments (software, video games, cloud computing, etc.) is that there isn't a compelling need for the AI operations to be profitable (in contrast to a pure-play AI business). At least, not for some time yet.
Plus, Microsoft is a cash-generating giant as it has been throughout its history. It can devote large chunks of capital to continued AI integration, and it more than has the human and operational resources to get the job done. The company might not be considered a ""proper"" AI stock, but it's sure plunging deep into the technology, and it's a smart (if a bit sideways) buy on the tech's future."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump expects most of the nation's coal-fired power plants to delay retirement to help deliver the vast amount of electricity needed to fuel artificial intelligence, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters on Thursday.
Keeping those often half-century-old coal plants running is part of a broader strategy to increase the country's power output that will also include boosting nuclear energy and allowing backup power plants to operate around the clock.
The administration has made expanding energy production a top priority while rejecting concerns about climate change, which Trump told the United Nations this week amounted to a global ""con job.""
""Energy sobriety has returned to Washington, D.C. Our focus is on Americans and the price of utility and avoiding blackouts,"" Wright said at a Reuters Newsmaker event. ""We've got to stop existing firm capacity from retirement.""
The government had been in discussions with many utilities nationwide and expects the majority of the several dozen U.S. coal plants nearing retirement to delay closure, he said.
""I would say the majority of that coal capacity will stay online,"" he added.
The administration is also prepared to use its emergency powers to extend the life of coal-fired plants, he said.
Last month, Wright extended his emergency order to keep a Michigan coal plant running, even though the plant's operator had been planning to shut permanently for economic reasons.
The Energy Department also ordered a gas and oil-fired power plant, slated for retirement in Pennsylvania, to continue operating.
Wright said more plants should expect similar orders, which fall under grid stability provisions in the Federal Power Act.
""Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, that's not the only one,"" Wright said.
Wright said the U.S. would also aim to get more out of the existing grid by running backup generators and standby power plants continuously, rather than just when electricity demand surges.
The White House is also seeking to boost nuclear energy, including through regulatory reforms to speed permitting and by hosting new nuclear technologies through the Department of Energy.
""We need that industry as another source of energy, and so we're going to give temporary nudges to get it started,"" Wright said.
Currently, two shut U.S. nuclear power plants - including one on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania - are in the unprecedented process of being restarted. Three Mile Island, dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center, would deliver electricity for Microsoft data centers."

The world’s largest software maker has faced protests by employees and media scrutiny over concerns that its software is being used to harm civilians in the war in Gaza. Microsoft said it found some evidence of reporting from the Guardian newspaper that data related to mass surveillance was being stored on Microsoft cloud servers.
The newspaper and other news organizations reported that Israel’s military intercepted millions of Palestinian mobile phone calls, stored them on Microsoft servers and used the data to select bombing targets in Gaza.
The Israel Ministry of Defense has been informed “of Microsoft’s decision to cease and disable specified IMOD subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said Thursday in a blog post. The company’s rules bar customers from using its products for mass surveillance of civilians, he added.
Microsoft employees and outside activists have been protesting Microsoft’s work with Israel’s military for nearly a year. In August, several protesters occupied Smith’s office and were arrested.
A full review of Microsoft’s work with Israel is ongoing, Smith wrote in the blog. “This does not impact the important work that Microsoft continues to do to protect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East.”

Pure is also aligning with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) to address the high resource demands of AI inference. Its Key Value Accelerator, a caching solution designed for multi-GPU environments, will integrate with NVIDIA Dynamo to cut latency, improve scalability, and reduce infrastructure costs.
""Integrating Pure Storage's Key Value Accelerator with NVIDIA Dynamo will deliver an out-of-the-box path to faster and more scalable inference,"" said Dion Harris, senior director for HPC, cloud and AI infrastructure at NVIDIA.
Additional updates include Purity Deep Reduce, a data reduction engine slated for fiscal 2027 that uses pattern recognition to increase efficiency, and new FlashArray systems, including the FlashArray//XL 190, FlashArray//X R5, and FlashArray//C R5.
""In today's AI era, access to data is everything,"" said Rob Lee, Pure Storage's chief technology officer. ""Managing your data, not just storing it, is the new foundation for AI-readiness from cloud to core to edge."""

That's according to Charles Schwab (SCHW) CEO Rick Wurster, who repeated the adage ""it's about time in the market, as opposed to timing the market"" on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.
Wurster explained that clients often call asking if now is the moment to cash out after the market's relentless climb. In most cases, he pushes back on the urge to jump in and out of stocks.
""The hard part about timing the market is you've got to be right twice,"" he said. ""You've got to get out at the right time, and then you've got to be able to get back in at the right time, and that's very hard to do.""
The market's massive rally has been driven by a handful of Big Tech names known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" Strong earnings, hefty cash flows, and surging demand for artificial intelligence have propelled Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) to record valuations, helping push indexes to new highs.
As of Wednesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up nearly 13% year to date, while the Nasdaq (^IXIC) has gained over 16%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) has lagged slightly, rising above 8% over the same period.
""Their fundamentals have been so strong,"" Wurster said. ""There's real robustness to their businesses. So I think that's been fueling the market higher, and our clients love it.""
He added that Schwab's investors are also more active than in recent years. ""Our clients are really engaged,"" Wurster noted, with trading up 30% compared to last year. Margin balances are at an ""all-time high,"" he said, and more customers are using options to ride the rally.
That enthusiasm, however, comes with caution.
""I would describe our clients as happy because their balances have never been higher, but a little bit nervous about the elevation of the market,"" Wurster said, describing his recent visits to 15 Schwab branches across the country.

Also on investors' minds are the Federal Reserve's next moves, including forthcoming rate cuts. In part, that may be why markets are continuing to hit new highs, Wurster added.
That nervousness isn't misplaced. RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas previously told Yahoo Finance that the market's rally has been unusually concentrated, or what he described as ""frothy,"" with just a few megacap stocks accounting for much of the gains. If those leaders stumble, the broader indexes could quickly give back ground."

The company's stock fell 5% in premarket trading before quickly rebounding to gain more than 1% in the first hour after the opening bell Thursday morning. The deal brings the value of the companies' joint agreements to $22.4 billion.
Livingston, N.J.-based CoreWeave provides cloud computing infrastructure specifically designed for tasks requiring massive amounts of GPU processing power, like training machine learning and AI models.
This deal promises OpenAI additional computing power needed to train and operate its AI models on top of what CoreWeave already provides the AI giant. The two companies signed an initial agreement for computing power last March for $11.9 billion, then added a $4 billion agreement in May.
“We are proud to expand our relationship with OpenAI, a company consistently at the forefront of advancing artificial intelligence,” CoreWeave co-founder, chair, and CEO Michael Intrator said.
The news comes after OpenAI announced on Tuesday that its Stargate AI data center and cloud computing site in Abilene, Texas, will open three new sites with partner company Oracle (ORCL) in a deal worth $300 billion.
The AI giant said Stargate aims to secure 10 gigawatts of capacity for the site, worth $500 billion, by the end of the year. Nvidia (NVDA), which has signed multibillion-dollar computing purchase agreements with CoreWeave, just minted a new deal with OpenAI in which OpenAI will build at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers with Nvidia, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI.
CoreWeave shares, meanwhile, are up 230% since its IPO in March. The company has been aggressive in dealmaking, inking agreements with OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and IBM (IBM). Wall Street analysts have largely been bullish on the company.
But skeptics see potential issues, especially in the CoreWeave's concentration of customers.
""Chances were already high that CoreWeave would be involved in the NVDA/OAI collaboration, given their experience as an infrastructure partner to both OpenAI and NVDA, who are also CRWV's core clients,"" Hedgeye Risk Management wrote in a research note published Thursday morning after the deal announcement.
""Enormous customer concentration is coming, as we think NVDA and OAI will be CRWV's only core customers by the end of 2027.""
CoreWeave's most recent earnings report showed that Microsoft accounted for 70% of the company's revenue for the quarter."

NEW YORK, September 25, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Prelude Security, the next generation endpoint protection platform, today announced an additional $16 million investment led by Brightmind Partners, with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital and Insight Partners, bringing total funding to $45 million. Prelude will use the capital to commercialize runtime memory protection—technology that can detect and stop malicious code at execution—and to expand platform support and customer deployment.
Today’s security teams face an escalating challenge: approximately 75% of advanced cyberattacks now operate exclusively in-memory. These attacks evade traditional file and behavior-based detection methods highlighting the gap in today’s suite of endpoint security platforms. Prelude’s announcement of runtime memory protection fundamentally restructures endpoint protection by leveraging novel, hardware-level telemetry to detect out-of-context code execution, entirely in user mode. This aligns closely with Microsoft’s Windows Resiliency Initiative.
""As we’ve worked with existing customers to monitor and validate their existing endpoint defenses, we've seen first-hand how attackers increasingly live in-memory and evade traditional EDR platforms,"" said Spencer Thompson, CEO of Prelude Security. ""This investment enables us to expand and commercialize our ability to detect adversaries at the moment it matters—execution.""
Prelude’s existing monitoring and validation capabilities help customers ensure the coverage and configuration of endpoint security tools like EDR and antivirus to strengthen resilience against commodity malware. Building off these capabilities, Prelude’s introduction of runtime memory protection via a user mode agent provides an innovative, robust layer of defense against the methods of a modern attacker to augment existing defenses.
These attackers increasingly exploit memory-resident techniques, process injection, and ""living-off-the-land"" tactics to bypass current endpoint security tools. Prelude’s capabilities focus on what attackers must do—execute code—making it possible to stop ransomware and hands-on-keyboard activity faster than current defensive tools.
""The shift to in-memory attacks represents a fundamental evolution in the threat landscape that traditional endpoint solutions simply weren't architected to address,"" said Stephen Ward, general partner at Brightmind Partners. ""Prelude's hardware-level telemetry approach tackles the core problem—attackers must execute code, and that's exactly where this technology intercepts them. This isn't incremental innovation; it's an architectural leap in endpoint security and we believe it’s time for the next generation of endpoint protection and we think this is the team to build it."""

NBIS, an artificial intelligence (AI) cloud infrastructure provider, is capitalizing on the surge in global demand for AI computing power. The Amsterdam-based company has reported robust growth in its AI-focused cloud services, fueled by rising adoption across industries and increasing reliance on high-performance infrastructure to train and deploy advanced AI models.
So far in 2025, demand for AI infrastructure has surged, driven by the rapid adoption of generative AI, machine learning and high-performance computing applications. AI cloud infrastructure revenues grew more than nine times year over year in the second quarter of 2025, driven by demand for copper GPUs and near-peak GPU utilization.
NBIS’ revenues soared 625% year over year to $105.1 million in the second quarter. The increase in sales was primarily driven by strong performance in the company’s core business and excellent execution by the TripleTen team. Nebius’ core business is an AI cloud platform designed for intensive workloads, powered by in-house developed software and hardware with R&D hubs across Europe, North America and Israel.
Apart from this, the company has upgraded its cloud software to support growing capacity and large-scale clusters, expanded its customer base with major tech firms like Cloudflare, Prosus and Shopify, and maintained its lead as the go-to cloud provider for native AI startups. AI compute demand is growing fast, and the company is expanding capacity to drive growth in 2026 and beyond.
Nebius continues to see strong momentum in its business, with demand for AI compute remaining exceptionally high. The company updated its full-year outlook. It raised its guidance for annualized run rate (ARR) revenues from the previous range of $750 million to $1 billion to a new band of $900 million to $1.1 billion. For core business revenues, the company is maintaining its guidance of $400 million to $600 million.
Recently, Nebius signed a five-year, $17.4 billion AI infrastructure deal with Microsoft to supply dedicated GPU capacity from its new Vineland, NJ, data center, with rollout in 2025–2026. The contract could expand to $19.4 billion with added capacity. Nebius expects more such multi-faceted deals ahead, strengthening its position in the rapidly growing AI cloud market. These deals are expected to drive revenue growth.
However, stiff competition and broader macroeconomic uncertainties could pose challenges to NBIS’ growth trajectory. Nebius competes with technology giants like Microsoft Corporation MSFT and CoreWeave, Inc. CRWV."

BOSTON, September 25, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Zoovu, the AI search and product discovery platform, today announced enhanced capabilities and increased availability of Zoe, its generative-AI shopping assistant designed for optimizing ecommerce sales. This generative enterprise technology is built from Zoovu’s years of experience successfully managing more than 4 million AI-assisted shopping interactions worldwide.
Unlike generic chatbots that sit off to the side, Zoe is composable, modular, and natively integrated into an entire shopping journey. This approach is improving buyer conversions as shoppers gain purchase decision confidence with a conversational product expert available at every step, including on product detail pages (PDPs) and in search results, category pages, and self-service customer portals.
Zoe has already been successfully deployed by nearly 50 global brands and retailers including Microsoft, Staples, Bosch, and the Euronics group and is now generally available.
""We’ve been able to deliver more innovative customer experiences for our shoppers and help make our teams more efficient and informed,"" said Jim Berndelis, General Manager Merchandise, Officeworks. ""With Zoovu’s generative AI experiences, we’ve significantly improved how we connect customers to the best device for them.""
Most ecommerce sites still solely rely on keyword search, static PDPs, and basic chatbots, yet shoppers increasingly expect interactive, conversational buying experiences. A 2025 Capgemini study found 58% of shoppers use GenAI tools to research products. Brands and retailers that cannot keep up with consumer expectations risk losing customers to more agile competitors.
Zoe now solves this with conversational GenAI experiences that live where decisions happen. It answers accurately with citations, explains ""why this product,"" compares options, and personalizes guidance to a shopper’s intent and expertise -- without them needing to turn to another site for guidance.
Fixing GenAI’s biggest ecommerce flaw: data quality
At the core of Zoe’s accuracy and intelligence is Zoovu’s AI-ready data approach. The platform ingests and unifies product data from ERP, PIM, ecommerce platforms, CPQ, and knowledge sources (PDFs, manuals, spec sheets, blogs, websites), then enriches, harmonizes, and structures that information so Zoe can reason reliably at scale -- delivering grounded, transparent answers, with brand-voice controls and governance built in."

Nscale, which is at the centre of Sir Keir Starmer’s plans to become an artificial intelligence hub, has secured $1.1bn from investors including Nvidia, Nokia and the Norwegian investment giant Aker.
The company was only founded in May last year and has not yet constructed a site, although it is scheduled to build a data centre in Essex with Microsoft which has been described as Britain’s largest AI supercomputer.
It is also planning to build a series of “Stargate” AI hubs with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, beginning with a data centre in Newcastle upon Tyne.
The deal makes Nscale, which spun out of an Australian cryptocurrency mining operation, one of Britain’s most valuable AI companies. Aker said it was paying $285m for a 9.3pc stake, suggesting the company is worth around $3bn.
Nscale was founded by Australian Josh Payne, 31, who previously ran Arkon Energy, a Bitcoin mining company.
It remains largely owned by Arkon, according to filings at Companies House.
Cryptocurrency mining requires high-powered IT systems. The company has converted some of its crypto mining operations in Norway to data centre infrastructure. It says it has a “seasoned leadership team that has built over 50 data centres”.
The company now plans to spend billions buying AI chips from Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, to build a global network of data centres.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said last week that he planned to invest £500m in the company, although it is unclear how much of this was in the funding round announced on Thursday.
Mr Huang last week gave Mr Payne a bottle of Johnnie Walker whisky, predicting that the company would go from revenues of “zero to $50bn”.
“I’ll go on record as to say I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to him,” Mr Huang said.
Excitement about AI has led to an explosion of funding for infrastructure, including a $100bn Nvidia investment in OpenAI this week.
However, it has raised concerns about a bubble due to the “circular” nature of deals in which companies invest in their own customers in a way that ultimately sees money flow back to the investors.
Mr Payne said on Thursday: “This [funding] allows Nscale to provide our customers access to scarce, and highly sought after, compute capacity and rapidly accelerate the build-out of secure, compliant and energy-efficient AI infrastructure.
“Europe needs a Hyperscaler, and Nscale is rising to the challenge.”
Kanishka Narayan, the technology minister, said: “The success of UK-founded companies like Nscale shows how our country can be at the cutting edge of AI."

The brokerage raised its price target on CrowdStrike to $600.
The brokerage said CrowdStrike is “more competitively entrenched than ever in core endpoint security” and could take share from rivals as contracts come up for renewal.
It expects annual recurring revenue growth could reaccelerate to 25% to 30% in fiscal 2027, making the company one of the fastest-growing names in software.
CrowdStrike, the No. 2 vendor in modern endpoint security with a 16.8% market share in 2024, trails Microsoft but is viewed as a prime beneficiary of contract renewals over the next three years, according to IDC data cited in the note.
Customers interviewed by Scotiabank described shifting workloads from rivals and expanding spending across CrowdStrike’s modules, including cloud security, vulnerability assessment and its LogScale SIEM.
The firm said discounts offered in 2024 and 2025 helped retention after the Falcon outage, and many customers are unlikely to abandon those tools at renewal.
A corporate services company CISO told analysts their spend rose about 15% to $2 million after consolidating onto CrowdStrike, while a large IT company executive said, “CrowdStrike remains our preferred endpoint security provider, commanding the largest share of our spend.”
Scotiabank noted management reaffirmed medium-term operating margin targets of 30% and free cash flow margin of 36%, easing concerns over lawsuits and regulatory probes tied to the 2024 incident.
Product announcements at last week’s Fal.Con conference, including new AI-driven security tools, were also flagged as potential growth drivers into 2026 and beyond.

The competition requested proposals from companies across three themes: Next-Generation Data Center Technologies, Sector Coupling Technologies and Business Models, and Backup Power and Renewable Energy Storage. More than seventy companies applied, and AirJouleTM was ultimately chosen as one of three winners. AirJouleTM was the only winner focused on water usage in data centers, reflecting the unique potential of its platform to address water sustainability in mission-critical facilities.
As a winner, AirJoule Technologies has been invited to join the Net Zero Innovation Hub in early 2026 and to work with the group’s partners (Google, Microsoft, Data4, Vertiv, Schneider Electric, and Danfoss) to demonstrate AirJouleTM’s ability to utilize waste heat from data centers to produce pure water at a data center test facility. The results from this demonstration project will be used to inform further policy recommendations and net-zero reference designs for data centers.
“The Net Zero Start-Up Hub is designed to de-risk and accelerate breakthrough solutions. By supporting these winners and selected companies, we are helping them move from pilot to scalable deployment,” said Alberto Ravagni, CEO of the Net Zero Innovation Hub.
AirJouleTM’s selection as a winner of the Net Zero Innovation Hub competition underscores the growing importance of improving water sustainability in data center operations. Data centers use millions of gallons of water per day in their cooling systems, placing enormous stress on local watersheds. AirJouleTM’s technology platform can utilize waste heat from data centers to cost-effectively access the abundant water resources available in the atmosphere. Water harvested by AirJouleTM can be used for evaporative cooling, to replenish line losses in closed loop systems, or for local water replenishment programs."

This $7 Trillion Clue May Reveal The Truth.,"Many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are trading at lofty valuations, causing some investors to worry that a bubble is about to burst.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=470cbf28d61e8ef2b3ba73a991c3d2000e32b3b1ff72cf03e5172372a84adf22,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/are-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-in-a-bubble/,fool.com,200,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution fueled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to repeated all-time highs in recent years.
Much of this momentum can be traced to a small basket of companies. Relentless demand for AI vaulted Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing into the trillion-dollar club. Established giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla have each enjoyed a new wave of investor enthusiasm.
Yet with valuations stretched to historic levels, some investors may worry that the AI trade is drifting toward bubble territory. A new report from consultant firm McKinsey & Company, however, offers a different perspective: a $7 trillion clue that could reshape how skeptics view the future of AI.
Data center capacity is just getting started
According to McKinsey's forecast, global data center capacity is set to nearly triple by 2030 -- climbing from 82 gigawatts today to 219 gigawatts at the start of the next decade.
Crucially, roughly 70% of this growth will be driven by AI workloads, while the remainder will be tied to traditional cloud and information technology (IT) applications.
In total, McKinsey projects that capital expenditures to fund this infrastructure expansion could approach $7 trillion over the next five years.
Why do these trends matter for AI valuations?
During the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco traded at peak price-to-sales (P/S) multiples between 30 and 40. Today, skeptics contend that some AI leaders are exhibiting similar signs of excess -- with some trading at elevated P/S and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios relative to historic norms. Tesla and Palantir Technologies, in particular, stand out with valuations that may be stretched to unsustainable levels.
But the comparison to the dot-com era overlooks some critical differences. At the height of internet euphoria, many technology darlings had minimal sales traction, persistent cash burn, and valuations built on metrics such as clicks and user growth.
By contrast, AI already enjoys enterprise-grade adoption across industries ranging from cybersecurity and pharmaceutical research to autonomous systems, retail, and robotics.
What's more, McKinsey's data indicates that companies can count on continued cash flow as data center spending continues.
Put simply, as AI infrastructure continues to increase rapidly, the revenue and profits generated by companies powering this accelerated transformation are likely to translate into sustained premium valuations over time.
$7 trillion of opportunity suggests long-term upside
History's prior bubbles were primarily supported by hope, which can be fleeting. However, continuous spending on chips, servers, networking gear, and efficient energy systems is converging on the next generation of products and services that can be measured and benchmarked against financial growth.
Far from signaling a bubble, the upcoming $7 trillion investment marks the first wave of an infrastructure supercycle reshaping entire economies. In other words, this is the foundation for the next technology roadmap.
For investors, the takeaway is clear: Volatility is inevitable, but structural demand from AI is locked in. Semiconductor designers and manufacturers, cloud hyperscalers, and energy innovators sit at the center of this demand -- positioned to capture powerful secular tailwinds over the coming years.
Viewed in this context, today's investments represent early entries into a historic growth narrative that continues to expand. For long-term investors, megacap AI stocks remain some of the most compelling buy-and-hold opportunities in the modern AI infrastructure boom."

The decline came even after the Federal Reserve implemented an interest rate cut last week for the first time this year.
Also, inflation continues to be high and the Federal Reserve has not ruled out tougher times ahead. Given this situation, an astute investor would prefer to keep a close watch on dividend-paying stocks. These stocks, supported by solid business models and a track record of consistent performance, often withstand market fluctuations more effectively.
They provide a reliable income stream while helping to mitigate the risk of sudden price drops. Historically, companies that pay dividends have also outperformed non-dividend stocks during periods of market turbulence. Three such stocks are InterDigital, Inc. IDCC, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM and Microsoft Corporation MSFT.
Volatility Returns to Wall Street
Major indexes closed lower for the second consecutive session on Wednesday, with the Dow closing 0.4% lower, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were each down 0.3%. The decline comes days after all three major indexes registered record closing highs.
Stocks initially rallied after the Federal Reserve announced a quarter basis point rate cut last week and hinted at two more 25-basis-point rate cuts later this year. However, the Federal Reserve cautioned that the rate cut came as a weak jobs report hinted at a shrinking labor market.
On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell once again warned that the economy could weaken further and the central bank needs to balance inflation worries amid a shrinking labor market before deciding on the next rate cut.
This has reignited fears of a slowing economy, leading to massive selloffs over the past two sessions. The ongoing sentiment could keep markets volatile for a longer period.

One company benefiting from this is Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%).
Shares of the AI infrastructure provider are up over 250% in 2025 through the week ended Sept. 19. The stock's astounding growth was fueled by the company's success capturing customer demand for AI computing power.
But with the stock hovering around a 52-week-high, is now the right time to pick up shares?
Examining Nebius Group's success
Nebius Group was born out of Yandex, the Russian search engine and tech company. It severed all ties with Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Now, Nebius primarily specializes in high-performance cloud computing infrastructure for AI systems.
Its portfolio also includes subsidiaries Avride, which develops autonomous vehicles and robotics, and TripleTen, an education tech business. Nebius doesn't break out financials for these segments, so there's no visibility into their overall impact on the company.
Nebius timed its strategic focus on AI perfectly to capitalize on the technology industry's insatiable demand for more computing muscle. This led to the company's second-quarter sales expanding a whopping 625% year over year to $105.1 million.
According to Nebius founder and CEO Arkady Volozh, ""We expect the fundamental trends in our space to continue to drive growth for years to come."" He's not the only one to believe this will happen.
Over a year ago, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted the necessity of AI-specific infrastructure, such as that provided by Nebius. He dubbed them ""AI factories"" in a new industrial revolution where the output is inference, a term describing an AI's ability to analyze and draw conclusions from data.
Underscoring the significant need for computing capacity, Microsoft contracted with Nebius in September as part of a multi-year agreement worth billions of dollars. The deal should boost Nebius revenue once it begins later this year.
Nebius Group's downsides
To meet rising AI demand, Nebius is rushing to expand capacity and construct more data centers. Supporting the build-out of AI infrastructure is not cheap, however. Nebius spent $91.5 million in Q2 capital expenditures, a 49% year-over-year increase. It also accumulated nearly $1 billion in debt on its Q2 balance sheet, up from just $6.1 million at the end of 2024.
Adding to this, the company's Q2 expenses rose to $216.3 million from $126.7 million in the prior year. As a result, Nebius isn't a profitable business, posting an operating loss of $111.2 million in the second quarter. However, it ended the period with net income of $584.4 million due to gains from its securities investments.
To help fund its growth plan, Nebius executed an equity offering that contributed to the company amassing $4.2 billion in gross proceeds as of Sept. 15. This allows Nebius to expand operations as it continues to ramp up revenue.
To buy or not to buy Nebius Group stock?
The revenue potential from Nebius' infrastructure operations could be substantial as the AI industry grows. Forecasts estimate the AI market will expand from $244 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion by 2031. This rapid growth will provide a tailwind to the company's business.
Yet while Nebius shows promise as an investment opportunity, especially after securing Microsoft as a customer, its share price valuation is also a factor in deciding whether to buy the stock now. So let's look at its stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.
This metric indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of revenue generated over the past 12 months. We'll compare it to CoreWeave, a competitor in the AI infrastructure space that went public earlier this year, and also boasts Microsoft as a client.
Based on its P/S multiple, the chart reveals Nebius shares are expensive compared to CoreWeave. In addition, the anticipated sales growth from Nebius' deal with Microsoft appears to be priced into the stock already.
Nebius could be a compelling AI investment, but despite the $4.2 billion in funding it achieved this month, its lofty share price valuation and growing debt make it a bit of a gamble at this point. Therefore, only investors with a high risk tolerance should consider an investment in Nebius, and ideally, after the stock price drops."

SAN FRANCISCO -Corintis, a Swiss startup promising more rapid liquid chip-cooling technology, has raised $24 million and added Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to its board as artificial intelligence fuels demand for better heat management tools for semiconductors.
Tests by Microsoft, a Corintis customer, have shown the Lausanne-based startup's system, which runs liquid through tiny channels etched on the chips to draw off heat, is up to three times more efficient than standard methods.
Corintis was valued at around $400 million after the Series A funding round, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
Demand is rising for new cooling methods as AI chips made by companies such as Nvidia consume unprecedented amounts of power, straining traditional systems that rely on pumping cold air through data centers. The heat results in slower chips and adds pressure on already stressed power grids.
While most liquid cooling only pulls heat from the chip’s surface and leaves hot spots, Corintis says its technology channels liquid inside the chip itself to cool more efficiently and reduce power and water use.
The company uses software to automate the design of cooling systems and manufactures its cold plates - metal blocks that sit on top of chips and transfer heat into circulating liquid - in Europe. The tech can be used as a drop-in upgrade for existing liquid cooling systems or be built directly into chips.
""Right now we are able to produce around 100,000 cold plates per year. Next year we are ramping up to around 1 million cold plates per year,"" co-founder and CEO Remco van Erp told Reuters.
Remco founded the startup, spun off from Lausanne's Federal Institute of Technology, in 2022 with two others, including Chief Operating Officer Sam Harrison.
The company's Series A funding round was led by venture capital firm BlueYard Capital and joined by Founderful, Acequia Capital, Celsius Industries and XTX Ventures, among others. It took the total funds raised so far to $33.4 million, including a pre-seed round.
Corintis said Tan, also the chairman of venture capital firm Walden International, became a board member before his appointment as Intel CEO in March. Geoff Lyon, founder and former CEO of liquid-cooling firm CoolIT, also joined the board, it added.
Corintis will use the new funds to expand its team to 70 by year-end from 55 currently, scale up manufacturing and open offices in the U.S., where many of its customers are based.

Growing Up In A High-Profile Family
Wilson was born to Musk and fantasy novelist Justine Wilson. After their divorce, she attended several schools, including Crossroads in Santa Monica, where she graduated in the same class as actress Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter, Apple Martin. She described the environment as ""exactly what you'd expect of a private high school filled with nepo babies,"" saying she felt like an outsider.
Her relationship with Musk deteriorated after she came out as transgender at 16. In 2022, she petitioned a judge in Los Angeles County Superior Court to change her name and gender, writing in the filing, ""I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.""
Public Rift And Media Attention
The rift became public when Musk commented on her transition in interviews. In an interview with psychologist Jordan Peterson in July 2024, Musk said his daughter had been ""killed by the woke mind virus.""

Wilson responded on a Threads post later that month writing: ""Last time I checked I am, indeed, not dead."" She later told NBC News that her father was ""quick to anger,"" ""uncaring,"" and ""narcissistic.""
Author Walter Isaacson, in his 2023 biography of Musk, detailed how the strained relationship shaped some of the billionaire's public stances. Meanwhile, Wilson told New York magazine she gets a lot of hate in her direct messages, including ""disgusting, unhinged things"" about her body.
Choosing Independence And New Goals
Despite the scrutiny, Wilson has taken steps to distance herself from her father's reputation. According to New York magazine, she enrolled in colleges in Quebec and Tokyo, pursuing language studies before returning to Los Angeles."

The update marks a shift for Microsoft, which has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI and leaned heavily on its technology across Bing, Windows and other products. Adding Anthropic shows the company is hedging its bets as demand for generative AI accelerates.
Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI executives in 2021, was recently valued at $183 billion after raising $13 billion from investors including Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. Its Claude models are designed to handle reasoning-heavy tasks and run on Amazon and Google cloud infrastructure.
Microsoft executives said more Anthropic features will be added to Copilot over time. As the corporation grows its own AI portfolio, it is also evaluating an in-house model called MAI-1.

Another policy that lands hardest on the people least able to absorb it: entrepreneurs and small businesses. Last week, the President issued a proclamation requiring a $100,000 payment for each new H-1B visa petition. The intent is to protect American jobs. That’s a worthy goal, but if you subtract out politics and look at this from the ground level, the effect is devastating for smaller, fast-growing companies outside of major metro areas.
For Apple, Microsoft, or Google, $100,000 is peanuts. These companies already pay engineers $200,000 or $300,000 a year. Adding another $100,000 to bring on a skilled worker doesn’t move the needle for them. But if you’re running a small technology company in a city like Raleigh, Austin, Atlanta, or Denver, it’s a completely different story. The average salary for a software engineer in these places is closer to $130,000 to $150,000. Adding another $100,000 is like doubling the cost of an engineer. For a startup, that makes the H-1B untenable. It’s crippling. It’s the difference between hiring and not hiring.
I’ve lived this so I can say with certainty that for smaller, entrepreneurial ventures, every dollar matters. One new tax, one new rule, one new fee could knock these smaller companies out. That’s the daily reality for small business owners all over the country.
This is why the H-1B proclamation will have unintended consequences. It doesn’t just make life harder for entrepreneurs. It tilts the playing field further in favor of the biggest companies. They can keep hiring. They can keep attracting the best global talent.
And the irony is that small businesses are the real job creators. They are where new ideas come from. More than 60% of new jobs are created by small businesses, not large ones. They are the ones taking risks, building teams and creating opportunities in communities outside Silicon Valley. Here’s yet another example of a policy written as if the entire economy looks like San Francisco. It doesn’t.
There’s a simple fix here. Scale the fee based on company size or revenue. Let large companies pay the full amount. Let smaller companies pay less. That way, you discourage abuse of the visa system without shutting small businesses out of the talent pool. Because, at the end of the day, we want policies that protect American jobs, yes. But we also want policies that protect American entrepreneurs and American innovation, our most important strategic asset over the past 250 years.
If we keep building walls that only the biggest can climb, we’ll get an economy dominated by a few giants. Less competition leads to less innovation. Entrepreneurs deserve better. And, if we want the next generation of great American companies to come not just from Silicon Valley but from Raleigh, Atlanta, or Austin, we don’t need even more policies that crush them before they even get off the ground."

DIGITIMES forecasts that beginning in 2026, the supply chain will enter a new ""decentralized"" phase shaped by three forces: the expansion of custom ASICs, diversification of advanced packaging, and intensifying competition in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) pricing.
ASICs gain ground on GPUs
Cloud service providers are accelerating in-house ASIC development to gain tighter control over performance and costs. DIGITIMES projects that between 2025 and 2029, the compound annual growth rate for high-end cloud ASICs will reach 21%, far outpacing GPUs at 7%.
Google and Amazon, both leading adopters, are pursuing vertical integration and platform strategies that convert compute resources into cost advantages for customers. Meta and Microsoft, after years of ASIC research, are also scaling deployments. While GPUs remain indispensable for training workloads, custom ASICs are steadily eroding their market share.
Packaging moves beyond TSMC
In advanced packaging, the non-TSMC ecosystem is rapidly gaining traction. By the fourth quarter of 2026, non-TSMC suppliers are projected to account for 31% of global CoWoS-class capacity, up from 26% in late 2024.
ASE, Amkor, and SJSemi are emerging with distinct competitive angles: cost and scale, the US-based manufacturing, and China's domestic demand, respectively. Intel is also pushing its EMIB technology, embedding silicon bridges in substrates to reduce costs and strengthen its ""made in America"" position. The result is a clear shift: high-end AI chips will no longer depend overwhelmingly on TSMC's packaging lines.
Memory costs surge with HBM4
On the memory side, cloud accelerators will begin adopting HBM4 in 2026. DIGITIMES estimates that average selling prices for HBM4 will be roughly 53% higher than HBM3E, pushing memory's share of total bill-of-materials costs above 50% for top-tier accelerators. Samsung is betting on advanced process technology and aggressive price cuts to win NVIDIA orders, directly challenging SK hynix's long-standing dominance, while Micron continues steady capacity expansion.
Three emerging opportunities
DIGITIMES highlights three major opportunities in this shifting landscape:

If you've ever felt uneasy asking about pay early in the hiring process, a recent Reddit post captured why that discomfort still exists.
In a thread titled ""CEO says asking for salary is a red flag. Interview makes a LinkedIn post that goes viral"" on r/recruitinghell, a user shared screenshots from LinkedIn showing a candidate's exchange with a hiring contact. The job seeker replied to an outreach message with a simple question: ""Can you please let me know the salary range for this role?""
The reply came back in a single block of text. ""Base is up to $135k with bonus potential, 401K, full benefits, equity consideration. Range is dependent upon validated candidates with proven track records. Asking that as a first question though is a red flag for me. So disregard invitation for call. It's a fair question but lacks good judgment an introduction first.""

On LinkedIn, the candidate wrote, ""Since when did asking for a salary range become a red flag? Raise your hand if you're utterly floored by the current circus that is the employment market. Feedback welcomed (not that anyone asked). Hey LinkedIn, how about making salary ranges mandatory on job postings? Or is transparency still on backorder.""
Reddit commenters quickly reacted to the exchange. One wrote, ""That's like me saying, ‘Come help me mow my lawn and I will compensate you in some undisclosed way...I promise.'"" Another added, ""I ask [about pay] in the first message they send me. If I don't get an answer, I reclaim the rest of my time.""
Others focused on the imbalance this kind of response creates in the hiring process. One comment read, ""It's an unethical way of establishing an asymmetry of information that advantages the employer over the applicant."" Another said, ""0% chance I'll do more than a phone screen without a salary number. I'm probably not even doing a phone screen.""

The White House’s announcement Sept. 19 of a $100,000 fee sparked panic among employers and workers, particularly in the tech sector, which uses it to bring in trained engineers and programmers. A separate proposal released Tuesday would overhaul the annual lottery for H-1B visas, giving applicants with higher-paying job offers a better chance of being chosen.

Together, the changes amount to one of the most sweeping shifts for a program that’s long served as a pipeline for global talent to the US.
The initial frenzy has eased after officials clarified the fee wouldn’t apply to existing visa holders or renewals. But unease persists ahead of the 2026 lottery, even with a White House proposal for a national-interest exception that could cover doctors and certain other workers.
For businesses, one advantage of the wait-and-see approach is to avoid drawing the ire of the Trump administration, said Kathryn Wylde, chief executive officer of the Partnership for New York City.
“The president has the business community spooked with regard to any public criticism of his policies,” she said. The concern isn’t just the price tag, she added. “It’s the whole question of, ‘Is America withdrawing from the global economy?’”
Behind the scenes, companies including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have advised current H-1B holders and employees with pending petitions to return to the US immediately and avoid foreign travel.
The $100,000 fee, which took effect Sept. 21, and the new wage-based visa selection process are likely to face legal challenges. If the fee survives, it’s likely to reallocate visas toward higher-wage positions in sectors such as technology, finance and health care, while pushing out lower-wage positions in areas like education, Bloomberg Economics said in a report.
“Immigration has always been and will continue to be a very politically charged topic,” said Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business. “Wading into these waters carries incredible reputational risk, which is why companies don’t do it.”"

Stock charts seem like they are on a preset course currently to the upside. The question, are we witnessing a real-time stock market bubble and Victoria, you mentioned bubble.
So I'm coming back to you uh on the topic of that one. Are we in one?
You know, when we think of a bubble, Brian, we think of stock prices going up really quickly, which we've seen, with some speculative, um, news around it. Yes, we've seen that in AI. We've seen that herd mentality. Those are all things you typically see in a bubble. But what we haven't seen is that detachment from fundamentals. Earnings are still supportive as we talked about earlier of these companies. You talked about the valuation on Nvidia, 28 times, that is not extremely expensive. Free cash flow is there. So I'm going to say we're not in a bubble until we start to see those fundamentals separate, um, and we're just not there yet.
I wish I had a sound effect, Victoria, because that is the point of the morning. Very good point, pushing back on these bubble concerns. Inez, Inez, I know you're going to come here and and tell me, uh, you're going to say the market's at a top, right?
Uh, look, this is the most hated V-shape, uh, rally since, uh, April. Remember that? Um, so, uh, the street still is expecting, uh, for stocks to, uh, turn higher from here. And that's partly because of the Fed easing that's expected. So bubble or not, everybody is talking about, hey, we seem like we're in a bubble, but yet you still are seeing stocks near all-time highs.
Uh, Brooke, not exactly your job to make, uh, stock market predictions, but, uh, look, I mean, this is, it's feeling a little bubbly. I mean, I, I see where you are at the Nasdaq. I mean, a lot of these IPOs have come out, have been incredibly well-received, valuations to the moon. We were just talking about Tether. It's an interesting time, uh, going into the end of the year.
Yeah, Core Weve, another big winner of the IPO market this year. But I'm going to I'm going to reverse the script here because what we've been hearing from so many guests on Yahoo Finance is not necessarily a bubble risk, but really alluding to what they're calling a meltup. Really stocks sort of getting this momentum, lots of cash still on the sidelines. We had a guest on yesterday morning who actually said that there is $26 trillion of money market and savings on the sideline right now. Just investors waiting to perhaps jump in, holding that tight based upon what they're seeing with interest rates. And so like we've gotten in so many calls from Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs of their S&P 500 uh targets like Inez had mentioned of getting higher and higher. Even just this week, Goldman Sachs on Monday putting out that target. And so I'm going to reverse the script here and say maybe we're seeing a bit of a melt up. That's what many of our guests are telling us right now."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Infrastructure Software revenues jumped 17% year over year to $6.8 billion and accounted for 43% of revenues. Segment gross margin expanded 300 basis points to 93% in the reported quarter. Infrastructure Software operating margin increased from 67% in the year-ago quarter to 77% in the reported quarter, driven by the completion of the VMware integration.
The launch of VMware Cloud Foundation version 9.0 is expected to drive top-line growth over the long term. VCF 9.0 helps enterprises run any application workload, including AI workloads, on virtual machines and on modern containers, making it a real alternative to public cloud. Broadcom has been successful in shifting more than 90% of the top 10,000 accounts from vSphere to the entire vSphere Cloud Foundation virtualization stack.
Broadcom now expects fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 Infrastructure Software revenues to be $6.7 billion, indicating 15% year-over-year growth. AI, along with VMware, is expected to drive top-line growth. AVGO now expects fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 AI revenues to jump 66% year over year to $6.2 billion. Semiconductor revenues are anticipated to grow 30% year over year to $10.7 billion.
Per our model, Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to increase 15.2% year over year to $6.71 billion. Semiconductor sales are pegged at $10.72 billion, indicating 30.3% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.
AVGO Faces Tough Competition
Broadcom is facing stiff competition from Microsoft MSFT and Cisco Systems CSCO in the Infrastructure Software domain.
Microsoft expects Azure growth of 37% for first-quarter fiscal 2026. Microsoft's comprehensive AI strategy spans from Azure’s infrastructure to productivity tools like Copilot, which is being integrated across Microsoft 365, Windows 11 and enterprise applications, creating multiple revenue streams and reducing dependence on any single product.
Cisco has been integrating AI into its product portfolios across networking, security, collaboration and observability. Strong demand for Cisco’s products in developing AI infrastructure has been a game-changer for the company. In fiscal 2025, the company received AI infrastructure orders from web-scale customers in excess of $2 billion.
AVGO’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates
Broadcom shares have appreciated 46.2% year to date, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 22.6%."

They're spending too much money with, you know, so it seems like we're in another one of those waning or at least questioning phases. Is that fair to say? And and do you think it's valid to question the whole uh, structure of the thing?
Well, I definitely think it's valid to question uh the overall structure and the phenomenon that's taking place. Um, you know, we're we're drawing a lot of similarities between what's happening now and of course, .com. That's not necessarily a new reference. Um but the thing I think is particularly interesting, right? Is just the timing of of market bubbles and what what's what brings them to a halt, I suppose, right?
You know, .com era, the only thing that really popped or burst that bubble was the Fed raising interest rates, right? And and um, kind of that led to, you know, the epic crash, but for years there were commentators and professionals and analysts from 1995 all the way to 2000 that were pounding the table saying, we're in a bubble, we're in a bubble. And they were right.
But if you got short in 1995, you know, you weren't, you didn't exist by the 1999 and you missed out on 40% plus equity market returns for for years to come. And so that's the interesting thing I think that's taking place now is I definitely think we are in a bubble.
Uh, and so, you know, what do you do at this stage, right? Because we just cut interest rates and we're looking at cutting more and there's fiscal spending coming down the pipe.
Right. So there's nothing externally necessarily that would burst the bubble.
If anything, I feel like we're about to pour some gasoline on the fire. And um and so that's what gives us a little bit of pause because I definitely think the the left tail scenario, the the risk to the downside is immense because by any measure of valuations are very stretched. We're seeing all sorts of these circular deals that we saw in 1998, 1999 with some of the same players as we're seeing today. Um,
and yet it's very difficult for me to actually get bearish right now because there are so many positive catalysts as it relates to uh you kind of pushing this sentiment towards more uh extreme levels."

finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-24T12:15:00,Where Will Nebius Be in 1 Year?,The AI cloud stock has taken the market by storm. What comes next?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6a425eb0990851b1311edd9ccefc1599ab2bb8de197f8b4cabbf87dac3400e8c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/24/where-will-nebius-be-in-1-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/24/where-will-nebius-be-in-1-year/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/24/where-will-nebius-be-in-1-year/,fool.com,200,,"Nebius (NBIS -1.73%) has been one of the most explosive stocks on the market this year. The artificial intelligence (AI) cloud infrastructure, or neocloud, company evolved out of the Russian tech company Yandex, which was delisted from the Nasdaq after Russia invaded Ukraine. The company sold off its Russian assets and rebranded as Nebius, based in Amsterdam.
Now, Nebius is one of the fastest-growing stocks on the market. In the second quarter, revenue jumped 625% to $105.1 million, and the stock is up a whopping 424% this year, outpacing virtually every other AI stock on the market.
Nebius surged by nearly 50% in one session after it announced a blockbuster deal with Microsoft. The tech giant signed a contract for $17.4 billion in GPU services through 2031. This shows that despite the company's relatively low revenue, it's bringing in billions in contract commitments. Nebius' larger peer, CoreWeave, is also delivering massive growth, with its revenue up 207% in the second quarter to $1.21 billion.
Why the neocloud is growing so fast
The so-called hyperscalers -- the big cloud computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, along with Meta Platforms -- are expected to spend roughly $300 billion on capital expenditures, with much of that going to data centers to meet demand for AI computing power.
Nebius and CoreWeave are much smaller than the hyperscalers, so by dollar value, they are growing more slowly. Still, demand for AI cloud servers is so strong that it is propelling these companies' revenue up triple digits, and prompting Microsoft to commit $17.4 billion to Nebius.
As long as AI demand remains strong, we're likely to see outsized growth from Nebius and CoreWeave continue this year.
But it's a risky model
The neocloud companies need to spend on capex to build data centers and fill them with GPUs. In order to fund that spending, it has to take on debt.
Nebius had $1 billion in debt at the end of the second quarter against $1.7 billion in cash, and it will need to borrow more money to fund its expansion and to make up for losses. Because of that business model, Nebius is also losing a lot of money. The company reported an operating loss of $111.2 million in the second quarter, more than it brought in for revenue.
By comparison, the larger CoreWeave now has $11 billion in debt and is on track to pay more than $1 billion in interest expense this year, though Nebius may be on a better trajectory.
What Nebius will look like in a year
More than most AI stocks, Nebius and CoreWeave seem like avatars for the broader AI boom. Their performance is likely to track with broader interest and demand for AI computing power.
Based on the recent momentum, there looks to be plenty of runway left in the AI boom, meaning there's a good chance Nebius will be higher in a year, and it could be significantly higher if it can secure more deals like the one with Microsoft.
However, Nebius remains a high-risk stock, and it's likely to take a dive if the AI narrative wanes. There are a number of reasons that could happen, whether it's economic weakness, a slowdown in AI capex spending, disappointing software sales, or disillusionment with AI products.
For now, the momentum is on Nebius' side, but the stock fell more than 50% earlier this year, one sign of how quickly the narrative can change. There's a wide range of potential outcomes for Nebius over the next year, but based on the level of demand it's seeing, it should find success."

If you’ve been trying to make sense of Constellation Energy (CEG), you’re not alone. The stock is catching new interest after the company fast-tracked its plans to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center, formerly Three Mile Island Unit 1, with the backing of a massive 20-year power deal from Microsoft. High-profile partnerships like this, combined with Constellation’s aggressive push to boost capacity and reliability across its nuclear fleet, are putting a spotlight on its unique position as America’s leading provider of emissions-free baseload power at a time when energy demand and weather volatility are surging.
The company’s momentum has been building steadily. Over the past year, Constellation’s shares are up 34%, with a nearly 39% jump year-to-date. This upward move comes amid a flurry of new supply agreements and operational gains. Most notably, all 21 of its nuclear reactors ran at nearly full strength during the hottest summer on record. As the company commits more capital to expanding clean power capacity and finalizes its planned Calpine acquisition, the stock seems to be reflecting investor confidence in its ability to deliver stable, long-term growth.
But here’s the big question: with such a strong run behind it and so much optimism baked in, is Constellation Energy undervalued, or has the market already priced in years of future growth?
Most Popular Narrative: 5.2% Undervalued
According to the most widely followed narrative, Constellation Energy is seen as moderately undervalued by about 5%, reflecting optimism around its earnings growth, strong demand, and future capacity expansions.
Bipartisan political support for nuclear energy, exemplified by recent federal legislation and executive orders, has expanded and extended nuclear production tax credits (PTC) and zero-emission credits (ZEC). These measures secure protected, higher-margin cash flows and increase earnings visibility for at least the next decade.
Curious about what justifies this bullish view? There's a pivotal factor behind the high valuation that most miss: bold earnings growth and future profit margins that rival some tech giants. Want to see which industry-shaking assumptions deliver this robust fair value? Find out what's fueling the forecast and discover the surprising drivers the narrative is betting on.
Result: Fair Value of $355.25 (UNDERVALUED)
Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.
However, regulatory uncertainty and the aging nuclear fleet could challenge Constellation's outlook. This may make long-term revenue growth less predictable than many expect."

With new support for the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) from the OpenID Foundation, Seraphic enables continuous security signal exchange across leading identity providers (IdPs), SIEM/SOAR platforms, and Zero Trust infrastructure, covering the most critical identity-driven use cases. By leveraging SSF and its Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP), Seraphic can ingest and respond to standardized identity and security signals from participating vendors, instantly enforcing policy at the browser.
Compromised identities are the root cause of most breaches. This capability positions Seraphic as a critical enforcement point for modern identity security strategies. When identity platforms such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, CrowdStrike, or Google Identity detect risk, Seraphic prevents, detects, and responds to threats by restricting downloads, blocking the integration of suspicious non-human identities (NHI), redacting sensitive data, or terminating risky sessions across all devices and users, on any browser.
""The browser is where identity is most often exploited,"" said Alon Levin, VP of Product at Seraphic. ""By integrating with SSF, Seraphic becomes an adaptive security layer that enforces identity-driven policies the moment risk is detected, closing one of the most common gaps in enterprise security.""
Identity-Driven Use Cases with Seraphic + SSF:
-
Risk-Adaptive Browser Controls: Automatically adjust permissions when risk scores change in IdPs.
-
Session Continuity Enforcement: End or re-authenticate sessions if trust degrades mid-session.
-
Threat Correlation & Response: Combine identity and browser activity with signals from platforms like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Zscaler.
-
SaaS Posture-Driven Access: Enforce browser restrictions based on SaaS configuration or compliance signals.

Analysts led by Ken Gawrelski said the recent wave of compute contracts, including nearly $320 billion tied to OpenAI, shows “the cloud market opportunity [is] much larger than forecast.”
They now project the industry will expand to $873 billion by 2029, up from $230 billion in 2024, representing a 31% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
While Oracle and new entrants such as CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) are expected to gain share, analysts argued that the overall market expansion leaves more revenue for incumbents. Wells Fargo estimates Oracle’s share could rise to 15% by 2029 from 4% in 2024.”
The bank’s upgrade of Amazon comes as Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) share losses are seen peaking in 2025 before stabilizing, aided by Project Rainier, a new data center campus for Anthropic in Indiana.
Phase one is set to come online in January 2026 and could contribute about $14 billion in annual AWS revenue at full capacity.
Wells Fargo lifted its 2026 AWS revenue growth estimate to 22% year-on-year, compared with consensus of 18%. It also raised its price target on Amazon to $280 from $245.
Google Cloud was also highlighted for showing momentum, supported by growing TPU adoption and its Gemini AI platform.
Wells Fargo raised its 2027 and 2028 GCP revenue estimates by 3% and 6%, respectively. The analysts said that “Gemini’s success, recently topping iOS app store rankings, serves as a strong reference point for TPUs”.
For Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the team cited large third-party compute deals worth more than $25 billion as evidence of persistent demand and supply shortages.
They raised 2026 and 2027 Azure revenue forecasts by 1% and 3%, highlighting new capacity from partners such as Nebius and Nscale beginning in late 2025.
Overall, while competitive shifts remain important, “stronger cloud market growth will result in more revenue dollars for all participants,” the analysts said.

One AI stock that has done extremely well is Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%), which owns and operates data centers specifically tailored for running large language models (LLM) that power AI applications. Nebius' stock joined the Nasdaq in October last year and is up roughly 465% since. After such a big run, is Nebius still a buy?
Business is really starting to hum
Nebius has a complex history. The assets that comprise the company today used to be owned by the Russian search giant Yandex, but when Russia invaded Ukraine, the U.S. placed a lot of sanctions and regulatory actions that required Russian companies to delist from U.S. exchanges. In 2024, a group of assets was split off from Yandex to form Nebius in a $5.4 billion deal. These assets included the core cloud data center business, data labeling, self-driving vehicles, and an education technology business.
Nebius, which is now based in Amsterdam, then rejoined the Nasdaq last October and raised a $700 million round of financing led by several major venture capital firms and Nvidia, which is a key partner of the firm. Nebius has six locations with data center space, including its own data center in Finland, a new facility in New Jersey that will soon be live, and colocations in Missouri, the United Kingdom, Iceland, and France. These data centers are equipped with clusters of the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia, which are then available to companies looking to run AI applications.
While there are competitors in this space, Nebius also offers tools that help developers build AI models and that better train and enhance large language models. Nebius' balance sheet is also strong with moderate levels of debt and the company uses a more conservative depreciation length of four years on its GPUs.
In the second quarter of 2025, Nebius reported $105 million of revenue, up 625% year over year, although the company's adjusted net loss climbed to $91.5 million, up from an adjusted loss of $61.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. Management also raised the company's guidance to an annual revenue run-rate of $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of this year.
However, everything changed recently when Nebius announced a multi-year deal with Microsoft, which will likely start in 2026 and last through 2031. The deal is worth $17.4 billion, but has the potential to be worth as much as $19.4 billion. On the news, Nebius' stock soared 50%. Furthermore, CEO Arkady Volozh said in a statement that he thinks there are more deals to come.
Is the stock a buy?
Assuming Nebius' deal with Microsoft is for six years for $17.4 billion implies annual revenue of $2.9 billion, which would bring the company close to a $4 billion annual run rate when you add in Nebius' initial expected revenue run rate by year end. With the company trading at a roughly $24.5 billion market cap, that means the stock trades at roughly 6 times revenue. That's not necessarily cheap, but it's by no means expensive among high-flying AI stocks.
It's also good news to see Volozh hinting at other deals, and Nebius also owns other assets that could eventually be of value. I also like the fact that Nebius has a strong balance sheet, and seems to be conservative in its depreciation of GPUs. For all of these reasons, I think the stock is a buy. However, after such a big run, I would recommend dollar-cost averaging."

According to a report by Catherine Bolgar on Microsoft’s official website, this innovation, called in-chip microfluidic cooling, can remove heat up to three times more efficiently than the commonly used cold plates.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
The new system addresses the issue of heat generated by AI chips, which has been increasing with each new generation of technology.
The cooling system uses microfluidics, a method that directs liquid coolant directly into the silicon chip. This is achieved by etching minuscule channels on the back of the chip, allowing for effective heat removal.
Bolgar wrote that the research team used AI to identify unique heat signatures within a chip to direct the coolant more precisely. Microsoft claims this approach could enhance efficiency and sustainability for future AI chip designs.
During lab-scale tests simulating a Teams meeting, microfluidics reduced the maximum temperature rise inside a GPU by 65% and improved power usage effectiveness.

By GlobalDataSashi Majety, senior technical programme manager for cloud operations and innovation at Microsoft, highlighted the necessity of moving beyond traditional cold plate technology within five years to keep pace with evolving AI chip designs.
According to Microsoft, creating effective microfluidic systems presents significant engineering challenges. The dimensions of these cooling channels are comparable to human hair, requiring precise design and manufacturing processes.
Microsoft corporate vice president and cloud operations and innovation chief technical officer Judy Priest said: “Microfluidics would allow for more power-dense designs that will enable more features that customers care about and give better performance in a smaller amount of space.
“But we needed to prove the technology and the design worked, and then the very next thing I wanted to do was test reliability.”
Microsoft worked with Swiss startup Corintis to use AI in developing a bio-inspired channel design, resembling natural structures like leaf veins.
Over the past year, Microsoft produced four iterations of the design as part of its prototyping efforts. The process involved creating a leak-proof package for the chips, finding optimal coolant formulas, testing various etching methods, and establishing a manufacturing process.
The company plans to further explore integrating microfluidic cooling into future generations of its chips and collaborate with partners for broader implementation across its data centres.
Recently, Microsoft unveiled plans to invest $4bn over the next three years to build a second AI data centre in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. This brings the company’s total investment in the state to more than $7bn."

The computer chip company is now the largest stock in the world by market capitalization, quickly joining the $3 trillion club along with Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Investors are betting with their wallets that the rising demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power will drive huge earnings growth for the likes of Nvidia.
They are forgetting one company that will be an underrated beneficiary of AI growth: Amazon (AMZN -0.45%). The company has a cloud and computer chip deal with start-up Anthropic, as well as numerous ways to benefit from AI in its media business.
At a market cap of $2.5 trillion today, I think it is an easy hurdle for Amazon to surpass a $3 trillion market cap by sometime in 2026, if not by the end of this year.
Here's why.
AWS and Anthropic
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the original cloud computing juggernaut. In the age of AI, the market is feeling like it is left behind. Alphabet has its own AI infrastructure to build with Google Cloud, while Microsoft won a huge partnership with OpenAI to drive growth for its cloud business. Now, even Oracle is winning contracts from OpenAI in a reported $300 billion deal.
While it would have been nice to see AWS win some of these deals, the division is much more focused on generating positive return on investment than other players, which is likely why Oracle won the recent deal from OpenAI.
Anthropic is AWS' bet as an AI partner, and it is currently flying under the radar. Anthropic is an AI software provider focused on the enterprise and coding markets. Its revenue is exploding higher, growing from annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 billion at the start of this year to $5 billion as of its latest update. AWS is Anthropic's key cloud partner, where it plans to spend billions of dollars to train and run its AI systems. The partnership is so deep that Anthropic is now working with Amazon to build custom computer chips to compete with Nvidia.
Revenue at AWS grew 17% year over year last quarter to an ARR topping $123 billion, although it is growing slower than competition like Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. However, with Anthropic hitting a growth inflection, AWS' revenue should start to accelerate in the coming quarters. With fat operating margins of 37% over the last 12 months, AWS can be a strong contributor to Amazon's consolidated earnings growth through the next few years.
Bringing AI to e-commerce
Not only will AWS earnings benefit from AI, so too will Amazon's e-commerce and media business. Specifically, it will help with its fast-growing advertising segment. Advertising revenue is currently growing 22% year over year and likely has fantastic profit margins.
This week, Amazon released a new agentic AI tool for building advertisements. In the creative studio, even small businesses can now build robust advertisements that will go on the Amazon marketplace, Prime Video, and other Amazon partner platforms. This will greatly expand the addressable market for Amazon's advertising services. With so many small businesses around the world selling on the platform, Amazon is the perfect advertising platform that can connect sellers to willing buyers of its products.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Amazon can deploy AI for robotics, delivery systems, and customer search to improve the value proposition and efficiency of its e-commerce ecosystem. Altogether, it should help retail expand its profitability, which still has a lot of room to grow with just 7.5% profit margins over the last 12 months.
Why Amazon will join the $3 trillion club
Amazon's market cap will surpass $3 trillion shortly because of the huge potential for earnings growth in the next few quarters. The company's EBIT -- earnings before interest income and taxes -- shot up to $77 billion in the last 12 months on margin expansion. As revenue growth at AWS accelerates and margins keep expanding in North American retail due to advertising, investors should see trailing-12-month EBIT cross $100 billion at some point in 2026.
For a high-quality business like Amazon, a multiple of 30 times its trailing EBIT is entirely reasonable. It actually trades at a higher multiple than that right now. Thirty times EBIT on $100 billion in earnings is a $3 trillion market cap. That is the math behind my Amazon prediction, and why I think it is now the best AI stock to add to your portfolio today."

Caledonia residents learned that Microsoft is the company behind ""Project Nova,"" a proposed data center support project for the village.
Microsoft told village officials Sept. 23 that it intends to build facilities on 244 acres of land to support its far larger data center operation in Mount Pleasant.
Before its effort in Caledonia was made public, Microsoft announced a second $4 billion data center on Sept. 18 to go with its first data center which is planned to be fully built in 2026.
However unlike the property in Mount Pleasant, Microsoft would need to land to be rezoned, which is where the Caledonia officials come in.
""Offers have been accepted on land so that's not a problem,"" Caledonia Village President Tom Weatherston said in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""That zone change if approved – if approved – reverses back if Microsoft doesn't do anything in the next few years.""
Weatherston said most of the property is owned by We Energies and the rest of the land is owned by small farmers but he didn't know the specific use.
""Knowing Caledonia, probably horses,"" Weatherston said.
In a statement Microsoft said:
""This week, as we introduce ourselves to neighbors in Caledonia, we look forward to working together to build a project that reflects the values and priorities important here – including those related to the character of the community and the environment.""
The company went on to say it plans to work with We Energies on a proposed rate plan to pay more for its energy usage and it emphasized its construction of a 250-megawatt solar plant in Portage County.
""Locally, Microsoft continues to expand partnerships that create direct connection with those who could benefit – including with the United Way of Racine County and Gateway Technical College for digital skills training, and Root Pike WIN and the Ecojustice Center on environmental sustainability. ""
Project will be considered by Plan Commission, Village Board
If the project moves forward and is approved, and Microsoft builds on it as intended, Weatherston said it would make the company ""the largest taxpayer in the village.""
""Microsoft is a very environmentally friendly company and they tend to work very closely with the towns and villages. I see a lot of upside if this gets approved,"" Weatherston said.
Laura Million, deputy director of Racine County Economic Development Corp., said Microsoft is seeking approval from the village to begin to design and build on the land.
“So the rezone portion of this is what’s most important to them at this point in time,"" Million said. ""Until (Microsoft) gets into the details of planning the site, we won’t have a clear understanding of what kind of investment is going to be there.”
And unlike the development in Mount Pleasant, there is no tax incremental finance district associated with this project which could mean more revenue for the village.
While residents may have not enjoyed the secrecy that came with this development, Million said Microsoft is being cautious.
“They want to be a good community partner, that’s why they’re coming out at this point in time,” Million said. “It’s an opportunity for Microsoft to address residents, concerns, and there will be even more information next week at the public hearing at the Plan Commission.”
On Sept. 24, residents can ask questions of village and company officials at an informational session at 5 p.m. at Caledonia Village Hall 5043 Chester Ln.
The Plan Commission is scheduled to meet on Sept. 29 to discuss and vote on the rezone of the project. If it is approved it goes to the Village Board on Oct. 14.
'It's not a stand alone project'
At the Sept. 9 village board meeting, several residents spoke against the prospect of a data center before it was publicly known the company was going to be Microsoft.
Weatherston said he's been urging Microsoft to be more public with its plans for the village.
""In the absence of the truth people make up their own story,"" Weatherston said.
Dale Kooyenga, president and CED of Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, said this development is “part of a Microsoft integrated strategy across the region.”
“It’s not a stand-alone project. This has been given tremendous throught,” Kooyenga said adding the amount of water Microsoft is planning to use is not as large as some in the community think.
Environmental and labor groups have urged Microsoft to be transparent with its projects in Wisconsin. Kooyenga said it can be difficult for companies to be completely transparent as plans evolve.
“There is no industry that’s moving as fast and as dynamically as the data center industry and powering AI,” Kooyenga said. “You always have to manage this delicate balance between transparency and between good information.”

In Abilene, Texas—in the heart of what locals call the Big Country, long defined by ranching, farming, shale oil exploration, and now dotted with wind turbines—OpenAI and Oracle staged a carefully crafted media showcase on Tuesday to talk about the latest boom underway. Throngs of journalists from across the country were escorted by police to a half-completed 800-acre data center complex, guided through halls packed with tens of thousands of state-of-the-art Nvidia GPUs, and greeted by the company CEOs and by policymakers including Texas Senator Ted Cruz.
The event was a victory lap of sorts, as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle’s new co-CEO Clay Magouryk pushed back against critics who have questioned the progress of their high-profile and ambitious “Stargate” AI infrastructure project.
At Tuesday’s event, the two companies, joined by Japan’s SoftBank, announced a big step forward for Stargate, touting an expansion of the Abilene site, as well as plans to build five massive, new data center complexes across the U.S. over the next several years. Altogether, the initiative calls for hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in a project of a mind-boggling scale. In Abilene alone, a crew of 6,400 workers have already moved massive amounts of soil to flatten the hills, and laid down enough fiber optic cable to wrap the Earth 16 times.
“We cannot fall behind in the need to put the infrastructure together to make this revolution happen,” OpenAI’s Altman said during a Q&A with reporters. “What you saw today is just like a small fraction of what this site will eventually be, and this site is just a small fraction or building, and all of that will still not be enough to serve even the demand of ChatGPT,” he said, referring to OpenAI’s flagship AI product.
The buildout attests to the towering expectations surrounding AI, as tech companies like OpenAI, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta race to put in place the infrastructure necessary to power their latest large language models. In July, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would spend hundreds of billions of dollars building a network of data centers with names like Prometheus and Hyperion to create “superintelligence.”
Abilene, as well as the newly-announced data centers, are all part of the Stargate project, a half-trillion-dollar joint initiative that OpenAI unveiled in January that aims to create a nationwide backbone for training its ever-larger AI models. Stargate has been touted as a public–private partnership with the Trump administration—part of a bid to keep AI compute infrastructure in the U.S. and push projects past regulatory hurdles."

ABILENE, Texas (Reuters) -OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank on Tuesday announced plans for five new artificial intelligence data centers in the United States to build out their ambitious Stargate project.
U.S. President Donald Trump in January hosted top tech CEOs to launch Stargate, a private-sector initiative that plans to spend up to $500 billion to build AI infrastructure.
AI is a priority for Trump and tech companies that are pouring billions into building the computers that are necessary to power the technology.
ChatGPT-maker OpenAI said on Tuesday it will open three new sites with Oracle in Shackelford County, Texas, Dona Ana County, New Mexico and an undisclosed site in the Midwest. Two more data center sites will be built in Lordstown, Ohio and Milam County, Texas by OpenAI, Japan's SoftBank and a SoftBank affiliate.
The new sites, the Oracle-OpenAI site expansion in Abilene, Texas, and the ongoing projects with CoreWeave will bring Stargate's total data center capacity to nearly 7 gigawatts and more than $400 billion in investment over the next three years, OpenAI said.
The $500 billion project was intended to generate 10 gigawatts in total data center capacity.
""AI can only fulfill its promise if we build the compute to power it,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.
The Tuesday's announcement, expected to create 25,000 onsite jobs, follows Nvidia saying on Monday that it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply data center chips.
OpenAI and partners plan to use debt financing to lease chips for the Stargate project, people familiar with the matter said.
OpenAI and its backer Microsoft are among the tech giants pouring billions into data centers to power generative AI services such as ChatGPT and Copilot.
AI's role in sensitive sectors such as defense and China's push to catch up have made the nascent technology a top priority for Trump.

Nvidia on Monday said it will invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI to help the ChatGPT maker support a massive build-out of data centers equipped with Nvidia’s chips — a deal that some analysts say raises questions about whether Nvidia is investing heavily to prop up the market and keep companies spending on its products.
“The action will clearly fuel ‘circular’ concerns,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor note after the deal was announced.
Those concerns have followed Nvidia, to varying degrees, for much of the AI boom. The chipmaker participated in more than 50 different venture investment deals for AI companies in 2024, and is on pace to top that number this year, according to data from PitchBook. Some of these companies, which include AI model makers and cloud providers, then use that capital to buy Nvidia’s expensive graphics processing units.
But the size of the OpenAI investment “appears to dwarf all the others,” Rasgon said. The deal will “likely fuel these worries much hotter than what we have seen previously, and (perhaps justifiably) raise concerns over the rationale behind the action,” Rasgon wrote. Nvidia has said the investment in OpenAI will not be used for any “direct purchases” of Nvidia products, Rasgon added.
Nvidia and OpenAI said Monday that some details of the agreement are still being hammered out. But OpenAI plans to lease rather than buy the AI processors from Nvidia, according to executives involved in the effort. They also said it’s difficult to predict the rate at which AI chips depreciate.
Other large tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., have also made strategic investments in top AI startups intended to drive business to their cloud computing offerings. But Nvidia occupies a unique spot in the AI ecosystem by dominating the market for advanced chips that are essential for training cutting-edge AI models. As a result, the company has arguably been the single biggest beneficiary of the AI fervor to date."

Canada had no such caps.
The software maker, a longtime proponent of making more visas available for skilled foreigners because of a talent shortage stateside, said at the time that the Vancouver facility would “allow the company to continue to recruit and retain highly skilled people affected by the immigration issues in the U.S.” Seven years later, during another round of tightening of the H-1B program, Microsoft added an engineering hub in Vancouver, while other U.S. tech giants including Amazon, Facebook, and Salesforce opened facilities in the Pacific Coast city.
That’s why many are predicting that the $100,000 fees on new H-1B applications announced last week by U.S. President Donald Trump could have the unintended consequence of sending more tech jobs to Canada. It could also be a windfall for other countries, such as India and China, with more of their skilled highly workers staying or returning home instead of working in the U.S. after graduation. Indian and Chinese nationals make up 85% of H-1B visa recipients, according to an analysis by Pew Research—and many are opting for jobs at home.
“Cities like Vancouver or Toronto will thrive instead of American cities,” Garry Tan, CEO of prominent San Francisco startup incubator Y Combinator, wrote earlier this week in a now deleted X post, according to Bloomberg.
And Royal Bank of Canada CEO Dave McKay told Bloomberg on Tuesday that the new H-1B rule “is going to help Canada retain some of those great students we brought in” instead of losing them to Silicon Valley—and make it easier to recruit others.
The H-1B visa program is used primarily by the tech sector, as well as financial institutions and consulting. According to the U.S. government, the biggest users of H1-B visas are Amazon, the India-based tech giant Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple Inc. Non-tech companies that hire many H-1B workers include J.P. Morgan Chase and Walmart Inc.
The visas are exceedingly difficult to obtain: Each year, companies must file petitions to the U.S. government on behalf of prospective employees by March, for a lottery held in April, with just 65,000 visas available. (There are another 20,000 for U.S. master’s graduates.) In 2025, over 470,000 applications were submitted. While other visas exist, such as the “O” visa for outstanding skills, many are just as hard, or even harder, to get."

Shares of data center products and services company Vertiv (NYSE:VRT) fell 6.2% in the afternoon session after Microsoft announced it had successfully tested a new microfluidic cooling system for data center chips, posing a potential competitive threat.
The new technology brought liquid coolant directly inside silicon chips through tiny etched channels, removing heat up to three times more efficiently than advanced cooling methods currently in use.
As a major provider of thermal management solutions for the expanding AI infrastructure market, Vertiv's stock came under pressure because Microsoft's technology could disrupt the market if it gained widespread adoption. Microsoft also said it would work with partners to bring the microfluidics into production across its data centers. The market reaction mirrored a similar event from a few months prior when Vertiv shares also sold off after Amazon revealed its own custom liquid cooling system.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Vertiv’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 41 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 3.4% as investors scooped up equities, shaking off the initial concerns inferred from the Fed's dot plot, with tech stocks leading the charge.
As a reminder, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points yesterday and signaled that more reductions could come before year-end and beyond. Initially when the cut was announced and Fed Chair Powell held his press conference, there was a pullback in the market as the Fed's ""dot plot"" revealed that only one cut was likely for 2026. This was below the three cuts that had been priced into the markets. This was the first interest rate cut of 2025, a move investors had widely anticipated. In response to the decision, stocks rose significantly, positioning major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to open at record levels.
The Fed's decision was influenced by signs of a weakening labor market. Lower interest rates are generally seen as positive for stocks because they reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make fixed-income investments like bonds less attractive by comparison, driving capital into the equity market. While Fed Chair Powell noted the path forward has risks, the prospect of looser monetary policy has fueled optimism on Wall Street."

Formerly of GitHub and Microsoft, he’s now responsible for tools like Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist, nudging developers into the new world of agentic programming.
His team released new third-party research on Tuesday showing how developers actually use AI tools — and how much progress is left to make. I sat down with Salva to talk about the report and his personal experience with AI coding tools.
This interview was edited for length and clarity.
Every year, Google does a survey of developer trends — but this year’s report really focuses on AI tools, and specifically how agentic developers are willing to get in their approach to programming. Was there anything in the research that surprised you?
One of the really interesting findings was the median date when developers started using AI tools. They found it was April 2024, which corresponds fairly neatly to Claude 3 coming out and Gemini 2.5 coming out. This is really the dawn of the reasoning or thinking models, and around that same time, we got much better at tool-calling.
For coding tasks, you really need to be able to leverage external information in order to problem solve, so it may need to grep, it may need to compile the code. If the code compiles it may want to run that unit test, and that integration test. I think that tool-calling really is the important piece that gave models the ability to self-correct as they move along.
How are you using AI coding tools personally?
Most of my coding these days is for hobby projects, and I spend most of my time using command line-based tools. So that includes Gemini CLI. Then there’s a little bit of Claude Code, little bit of Codex in there. And you don’t ever really use a terminal-based tool by itself, so I’m really heterogeneous around the IDEs that I use. I use Zed. I use VS code. I use Cursor. I use Windsurf, all of them, because I’m interested in just seeing how the world works and how the industry is evolving.
On the professional side, product managers tend to live in documents, so the first thing is using AI to help me write the specification and requirements docs.
I’m curious how that works. You’re using Gemini CLI to build Gemini CLI, but I would imagine it doesn’t just run itself.
A development task will usually start as an issue, maybe it’s a GitHub issue that someone’s dropped with a bug. Often, if I’m really being honest, it’s a fairly under-specified issue. So I’ll use Gemini CLI in order to create a more robust requirement doc in Markdown. That will usually create probably about 100 lines of fairly technical, but also outcome-driven specification. Then I will use Gemini CLI to write the code based on that specification and the general preferences in the team documents."

SINGAPORE, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ELD Asset Management positions Oracle Corporation’s latest numbers as a defining moment in the AI infrastructure cycle, with the enterprise group’s cloud engines gathering force while capital requirements climb. For Q1 FY2026, the quarter ended August 2025, total cloud revenue advances 27% year on year to $8.11 billion and cloud infrastructure revenue rises 54% to $3.72 billion, presenting momentum that institutional allocators can calibrate against near-term cost pressures.
Oracle’s multi-cloud database services tied to Amazon, Google and Microsoft expand 1,529% in Q1 FY2026, reinforcing the strategy of placing workloads alongside customers’ preferred platforms. Group revenue increases 12% in USD terms to $16.78 billion for the quarter, although non-GAAP earnings per share register $1.65, a shortfall of $0.01 relative to consensus. GAAP earnings per share stand at $1.13, with net income of $3.30 billion as operating expenses reach $7.03 billion.
The forward book intensifies. Remaining performance obligations are now disclosed at approximately $455 billion for Q1 FY2026, signalling contracted revenue to be recognised across coming periods. Capital expenditure accelerates to $9.57 billion in the quarter, nearly four times the $2.58 billion invested in the comparable quarter a year earlier, underlining the build-out required to meet AI workloads. Jason Harrison, Senior Vice President at ELD Asset Management, notes that “the substantial contract backlog provides revenue visibility, though execution capabilities will determine long-term returns on these significant investments.”
Contract concentration is central to the investment debate. Market intelligence highlights a multi-year agreement with OpenAI estimated at about $300 billion across five years commencing in 2027, anchoring demand for compute capacity. The scale enhances strategic clarity while introducing dependency on a single counterparty’s technology roadmap and funding cadence. Harrison comments that “fulfilling large, dated commitments requires disciplined cash allocation before revenue recognition, so portfolio sizing should reflect both the growth optionality and the liquidity profile.”
Valuation signals reflect the AI trade’s breadth. In September 2025, a single-day share price rise of 36% lifts Oracle’s market capitalisation intraday to roughly $1.25 trillion, later settling near $1.01 trillion as trading consolidates. The forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 45.3 sits well above peers such as Amazon near 31.3 and Microsoft near 31 for 2025 year-to-date. Across the index, AI-centric leaders account for close to 30% of S&P 500 weight in 2025 year-to-date, with research houses attributing roughly half of the index’s 11% gain this year to the theme and identifying an “AI premium” of about 14.2% on valuations. The broader narrative includes the transformation of champions such as Nvidia, whose capitalisation has approached roughly $4.51 trillion in 2025, underscoring the market’s willingness to capitalise infrastructure winners."

Paul Atkins outlines regulatory changes to allow retail investors access to previously restricted private funds
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Paul Atkins said Tuesday that the Trump administration’s plan to open 401(k) retirement accounts to private market investments would give ordinary Americans safe access to opportunities that are currently restricted.
Atkins said that the SEC will work with the Labor Department to broaden access to investments in private funds for ordinary investors who currently wouldn't meet regulatory thresholds that would provide them access.
""Individual investors need to be diversified and the private markets have developed so much because there's a lot of capital available in the private markets,"" Atkins said Tuesday on FOX Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria.""
""And frankly, it's uncool to be a public company, or it has become so, and I want to make IPOs great again,"" Atkins said. ""Thirty or so years ago, when I was a young lawyer starting out in New York, companies like Apple and Microsoft – they had to go public to get capital to build their companies and new products.""

""Today it's [the] opposite. Companies can stay private longer, and there being so many issues in the public markets between litigation and the short-termism that we were talking about before, the weight of the regulatory apparatus on reporting and that sort of thing, compliance,"" Atkins said.
""Then finally, the weaponization of corporate governance, so those issues have really decreased the attractiveness of being a public company,"" he said. ""We aim to make that better again.""
Currently, investments in private companies are limited to people who satisfy the ""accredited investor"" threshold. The rule aims to protect unsophisticated investors from financial risks associated with investments in private companies, which can be illiquid and aren't subject to public financial reporting requirements.
SENATE CONFIRMS TRUMP'S SEC CHAIR PICK PAUL ATKINS
The rule stipulates that qualified accredited investors must have a net worth over $1 million excluding their primary residence, or income over $200,000 individually (or $300,000 as a couple) in each of the past two years, with the reasonable expectation of the same in the current year.
It also includes professional criteria to satisfy the rule, including investment professionals with Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82 licenses, executives of the company selling the security, or family clients of family offices and knowledgeable employees of a private fund they want to invest in.
Atkins explained that private market investments can help investors diversify their portfolios as public markets become more concentrated, noting the rise of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that have driven much of the market's gains in recent years.
LABOR SECRETARY UNVEILS UNPRECEDENTED PLAN TO SLASH 63 'OUTDATED AND BURDENSOME' RULES
""We only have half the number of public companies as we had 30 years ago, and if you look at the S&P 500 it's rather top-heavy with respect to the 'Magnificent Seven,'"" Atkins said. ""What industry are they in? IT basically, technology, and we saw what has happened in the past when the market gets too concentrated.""
The SEC chairman noted that work remains to be done in putting up regulatory guardrails for opening private market investments to retail investors before they will be available as options in their retirement plans or other investment accounts.
""The key word here is diversification, and so we have to put in guardrails for retail investors to have exposure to these sorts of investments because they can be illiquid, the valuations can be off,"" Atkins said. ""There are a whole host of things – where the retail investor fits in the capital stack of the company, and then finally what the liquidity is of the investment.""

""We have to put guardrails around them, have 'most favored nation status' for those sorts of investments. Their advisors will obviously have fiduciary duty and that sort of thing. So we'll put the protections in to make sure that we guard against bad outcomes to the extent that we can,"" Atkins said."

George Clooney made quite a splash when he purchased a mansion on the shores of Italy's Lake Como for $10 million in 2002. Lake Como real estate values have exploded since then, and Clooney's compound is now worth an estimated $100 million, according to Harper's Bazaar.
Clooney's Villa Oleandra estate sits right on the shore in the village of Laglio. It was built in the 18th century and was previously owned by the Heinz family. Clooney undertook an extensive renovation of the 25-room mansion and purchased adjacent properties to create a unified compound, Tatler reported.

He also began hosting various celebrities and A-listers at Villa Oleandra. It was during one of those dinners that Clooney met his wife, Amal, in 2013, according to the Hollywood Reporter. ""I thought she was beautiful, and I thought she was funny and obviously smart,"" he said. They hit it off and married in 2017.
Although he only spends a few months a year here with his wife and their two children, Clooney's presence is widely felt throughout Laglio. Tatler reports that Clooney and his wife are known to host a variety of A-listers during their Italian vacations. The likes of Laura Dern, Jim Broadbent, and Riley Keogh have all been spotted at Villa Oleandra through the years.
The Clooneys were recently seen boarding a small boat at Villa Oleandra's private dock and jetting over to the famous Villa d'Este for lunch, according to Harper’s Bazaar. This exclusive hotel is an old favorite of the jet set that has hosted luminaries like Elizabeth Taylor and Alfred Hitchcock, according to Forbes. Hopping on boats at private docks and floating along the shores of Lake Como is all part of Lake Como's intrinsic charm.

The Clooneys certainly enjoy the Lake Como lifestyle, and their presence has raised the area's international visibility, but it's not just A-list celebrities moving to Lake Como. Italy has a flat-tax visa program that allows high-net-worth individuals to pay a flat tax of €100,000 ($85,000) on all their international earnings, regardless of the source.This program has brought in a flood of new investors, and many are buying in Lake Como, according to The Guardian."

Last week, LinkedIn announced an update to its Terms of Service in order to cover expanded use of user data for its AI tools, as well as an expansion of the member data that it shares with Microsoft for Microsoft’s own ad targeting and promotions.
Essentially, LinkedIn will now share your profile and activity data with Microsoft, in order to enable Microsoft to better target its own promotions based on the same.
And LinkedIn will now also be better enabled to utilize the opposite as well.
LinkedIn’s added a related explainer in its overview of how businesses can use third party data to target ads on LinkedIn which explains how LinkedIn advertisers will now also be able to reach users based on data insights from Microsoft.
As per LinkedIn:
“Outside of the Designated Countries, the U.K., and California, LinkedIn also receives data from its affiliate, Microsoft, about activity on their and their advertisers’ sites and apps, including through use of technology similar to the LinkedIn Insight Tag. LinkedIn can use this information to improve its ability to reach an advertiser’s target audience as well as to improve ad performance and provide aggregate reports about advertising campaign performance to advertisers.”
So basically, LinkedIn is now integrating more data from Microsoft, via Microsoft’s own performance and data tracking measures, in order to provide expanded targeting options and insight for your campaigns.
Which could be valuable. Microsoft has its own Universal Event Tag (UET) for ad performance tracking, which records what customers do on various websites, and shares that information back to Microsoft. That enables Microsoft to track conversion activity and other behavioral data, which LinkedIn will seemingly now be able to incorporate into its own ad offering.
Microsoft also has additional ad engagement and data tracking measures that will feed more data into LinkedIn, which could facilitate expanded opportunities for your campaigns.
It’s more data, and more data is always better, and it may end up being a helpful addition in your process."

(NYSE: VRT) shares fell 7% Tuesday after Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced the successful testing of a new microfluidic cooling system for data center chips that could potentially disrupt the thermal management market.
Microsoft’s new cooling technology removes heat up to three times more efficiently than cold plates, an advanced cooling method currently used in data centers. The system uses microfluidics to bring liquid coolant directly inside silicon chips through tiny etched channels, addressing the growing challenge of heat management in power-intensive AI applications.
The announcement represents a potential competitive threat to Vertiv, which specializes in critical digital infrastructure solutions including cooling systems for data centers. As a major provider of thermal management technologies for the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market, Vertiv could face pressure if Microsoft’s technology gains widespread adoption.
Microsoft’s lab tests showed their microfluidic solution reduced the maximum temperature rise inside a GPU by 65%, though results vary by chip type. The technology also promises to improve power usage effectiveness and reduce operational costs - key selling points for data center operators.
The tech giant indicated it plans to investigate incorporating microfluidic cooling into future generations of its first-party chips and will work with fabrication and silicon partners to bring the technology into production across its data centers.

One is for the supply of steel with near-zero emissions to be used in Microsoft's datacenters. In addition to the agreement for physical green steel, the companies have also entered into an agreement for the purchase of environmental attribute certificates tied to production from Stegra's manufacturing facility in Boden, Sweden. This agreement is the first-of-its-kind in the steel industry designed to help drive global demand for green steel.
After investing in Stegra in 2023 through its Climate Innovation Fund, Microsoft is now also entering into a supply agreement for near-zero emission steel, as well as an agreement for environmental attribute certificates (EACs). These agreements align with Microsoft's focus on building markets for low-carbon construction materials, which in turn supports the company's ambition to become carbon negative by 2030.
The largest part of Microsoft's carbon emissions are what's considered ""scope 3"" or indirect emissions. The rise in those scope 3 emissions in part comes from the construction of more datacenters and the associated embodied carbon in building materials and technology hardware. The challenges that Microsoft faces are in part unique to their position as a leading cloud supplier that is expanding its datacenter footprint. But even more, Microsoft reflects the challenges that the world must overcome to develop and use greener concrete, steel, fuel, and chips.
The supply agreement will see Stegra deliver steel with up to 95% lower emissions than conventional steelmaking, from its flagship plant currently under construction in Boden, to be used by Microsoft's datacenter equipment suppliers.
""Sustainable change calls for unconventional partnerships. We are now teaming up with a market leader in Microsoft, to demonstrate how we can work together to accelerate change in the steel industry,"" says Stegra's CEO, Henrik Henriksson.
""Integrating near-zero emission steel into our datacenter construction is a critical advancement in reducing embodied carbon at scale,"" says Jennifer Weitzel, Corporate Vice President of Engineering, Construction and Procurement, Microsoft. ""This collaboration with Stegra enables us to decarbonize our infrastructure, while maintaining the performance and reliability standards required for hyperscale environments.""
Microsoft is not a direct buyer of materials such as steel. It will work with its suppliers to receive the coils from Stegra and process the green steel into components designated for use by Microsoft's datacenter equipment suppliers."

“That caught everyone off guard,” Dimon said in a television interview with India’s CNBC-TV18. “We had a lot of phone calls over the weekend — what does this mean?”
""We'll be engaging with stakeholders and policymakers,"" Dimon said in a separate interview with the Times of India newspaper.
Dimon, who has previously expressed support for the Trump administration’s move to secure the US southern border, said he believes in “merit-based immigration” and wants to “engage with the government on the issue.”
“I believe in merit-based immigration, and as a matter of fact, I would beg the president, he has accomplished border control — that's great. I think all nations want real border control. It helps make a nation. But after that, we should have good immigration,” said Dimon during the television interview.
The H-1B visa was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. This immigration card allows US employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for jobs that require a bachelor's degree or higher.
Unveiled and signed Friday afternoon in the Oval Office, the Trump administration’s new executive order mandates a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas and impacts an estimated 730,000 holders.
US businesses that sponsor skilled foreign workers had a roller-coaster weekend trying to understand how they would be impacted by the proclamation.
The government altered its messaging on the order over the weekend when Trump's team offered an apparent 180-degree turn on key specifics, such as whether this fee will be annual and whether it will ever be paid by existing visa holders.
Within the US financial sector, no company sponsored more H-1B visas last year than JPMorgan Chase. In 2024, the company ranked as the eighth-largest corporate sponsor along with tech giants Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and retail giant Walmart (WMT), according to US government data.
""For us, visas matter because we move people around globally — experts who get promoted to new jobs in different markets,"" Dimon told the Times of India newspaper.
“Hopefully,” Dimon said, he or his company will engage with the government on the issue. Dimon added that, before taking office, Trump did say publicly that he wanted “more merit-based immigration.”"

The White House announced Friday that Trump had signed a proclamation requiring employers to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. In response, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reportedly emailed their employees telling those with H-1B visas to stay in the United States and avoid foreign travel for now — and if they’re already traveling, to try to return before the proclamation takes effect at 12:01am Eastern on Sunday.
Business Insider published the memos from Amazon and Microsoft, while Sources published a similar memo from Google. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to Amazon and Google.
According to government data, Amazon employees have received the most H-1B visas so far this fiscal year, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, then Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, with Google ranked sixth.
Meanwhile, a White House official told Axios that the fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing H-1B holders or renewals. And White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that “H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation.”

It recently topped 6,600 as of the end of Monday's close, marking its latest record. The growth has been strong, even despite economic uncertainty this year.
But a lot depends on how well the growth prospects for artificial intelligence (AI) continue to be, as companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and other tech giants make up sizable positions in the S&P 500 and have been thriving due to enhanced opportunities as a result of AI. For some investors, that can make investing in the S&P 500 a less-than-ideal situation given this heavy exposure.
An alternative option may be trying to track not simply the S&P 500 but the broader stock market as a whole, giving investors a more diversified investment. The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI 0.42%) attempts to accomplish this. Could it be a better investment moving forward than simply mirroring the S&P 500 through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 0.38%)?
Historically, the returns haven't been all that different
Over the past five years, when including reinvested dividends, the total returns of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF have been 109% (as of Sept. 15). By comparison, investing in the Vanguard fund has yielded a total return of 103%. To put that in terms of dollars, a $10,000 investment would have grown to approximately $20,900 by tracking the S&P 500 and to $20,300 if you'd invested in the Vanguard fund.
In theory, it shouldn't be a surprising conclusion given that the S&P 500, which tracks the leading 500 companies on U.S. markets, will be a good indicator of how the overall market is doing. If the index is performing well, other stocks are likely to follow. But by investing in the best stocks, it's likely to do better amid favorable market conditions.
However, what if that isn't the case, and you're worried about high-priced stocks that could weigh on the S&P 500 and limit its returns in the near future?
Is tracking the S&P 500 still the better option if you're bracing for a slowdown in the market?
The last prolonged crash in the market took place back in 2022. At the time, inflation was getting out of control and companies that had scaled too aggressively due to strong pandemic-fueled demand realized they needed to cut back, and job cuts followed. That year, the S&P 500 tanked and the SPDR ETF's total returns were -18.2%. But the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund didn't fare any better. In fact, its total returns were -19.5%.
The Vanguard fund has a position in more than 3,500 stocks, which is far more than the 500 that the SPDR ETF tracks. But due to the significant market caps of leading tech companies, they are still going to be the driving force in how both ETFs perform. The top three stocks in the Total Stock Market ETF are Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. Together, they combine for 18.1% of its entire portfolio. By comparison, those three stocks, which are also the largest holding in the SPDR ETF, combine for 20.8% of its portfolio.
While there is a bit less exposure to those stocks in the Vanguard fund, it's not a drastic difference. The Total Stock Market fund has a position in a lot of stocks, but the vast majority are incredibly small. After the first 200 stocks, you're looking at stocks that account for less than 0.1% of its entire portfolio. And the 500th largest position in the ETF accounts for just 0.02%.
While it may be tempting to assume that with an ETF that tracks the entire stock market you're going to get a safer and more diversified investment than the S&P 500, that's not necessarily the case.
How can investors reduce their risk in the market?
The S&P 500 index is a gauge for how the overall market is doing, and thus, trying to simply track more stocks such as through the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF may not be a better option, or even a safer one.
If your goal is to minimize your exposure to tech stocks and have a safer mix of stocks than what the SPDR S&P 500 ETF offers, you may want to consider ETFs with specific goals in mind. The Vanguard Value Index Fund focuses on value stocks, and the Invesco S&P 500 Revenue ETF tracks the S&P 500 but weighs the stocks based on revenue rather than market capitalization. These are just a couple of examples of the ways you can potentially reduce your portfolio's risk if you're concerned about high valuations."

Companies are rushing to ensure thousands of employees around the globe do not trigger hefty new immigration fees after Washington announced sweeping changes to the H-1B foreign worker visa relied on by US tech groups.
US President Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 application fee for the visa, but did not clarify whether the change would apply to existing H-1B holders.
Companies including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) issued emergency guidance to employees, urging H-1B holders not to leave the country until the new rules were clarified. They also asked staff currently overseas to return to the US before the measures came into force on Sunday.
The two technology giants had more than 15,000 H-1B visas approved in the most recent fiscal year, according to the US Department of Homeland Security.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.
JPMorgan (JPM), the largest US bank by assets, also advised its staff on H-1B visas not to travel outside the US for now, according to a person familiar with the matter. JPMorgan declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a memo to employees holding the visas that they should be “exercising caution around international travel”.
Fragomen, an immigration law firm that processes many H-1B visas, advised its clients with approved H-1B petitions or visas to return to the US by Sunday.
The White House on Saturday sought to clarify the scope of the changes amid the confusion.
Press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that the one-off fee would apply only to new applicants, not current H-1B holders or those renewing their visa. She added that the new fees would only kick-in in the next cycle.
“Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter,” she wrote on X.
“H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would.”
Her comments appeared to differ from those offered by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday, who said the fee would be applied annually.
The director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services Joseph Edlow wrote to staff on Saturday ordering immigration officers to “ensure that their decisions are consistent” with the clarified terms.
A White House spokesperson said the move aimed to encourage companies to hire American workers and give certainty to those hiring foreigners.
About 400,000 H-1B applications were approved last year, the majority people renewing their visas.
Silicon Valley relies heavily on H-1B visas to hire engineers, scientists and coders from overseas. The non-immigrant visa is also widely used by specialist industries, including accountancy firms and healthcare companies."

AT&T Investment Narrative Recap
AT&T’s investment case centers on belief in its ability to drive revenue and cash flow through expansion of fiber and 5G connectivity, while managing competition and capital intensity. The recent US$5.0 billion and €2.25 billion fixed-income offerings, combined with its digital partnership with Gigs, may provide new capital and distribution channels but do not materially alter the central short-term catalyst: subscriber growth in Mobility. The greatest near-term risk remains sustained wireless churn and competitive pricing pressure.
Among recent developments, AT&T’s collaboration with Gigs, enabling financial and technology apps like Klarna to offer embedded, AT&T-powered phone plans, aligns closely with the hope for digital-driven subscriber gains. This move underscores the emphasis on new customer acquisition pathways to counteract churn and market saturation, which remain pivotal to outcomes for Mobility division growth.

These moves come as Asana’s share price has seen both ups and downs recently. The stock advanced roughly 8% over the past three months, but year-to-date performance remains down by nearly 28%. The past year has been more positive, with a 19% gain, which might indicate some renewed confidence in the company’s direction. Still, the mix of leadership changes, big office decisions, and related writedowns paints a picture of a business that’s adjusting on several fronts. This is a dynamic that can catch the market’s eye, for good or ill.
The question now is whether Asana’s recent share price reflects these leadership and operational shifts, or if there is more value left for investors to uncover. Is this a buying opportunity, or are markets already anticipating future growth?
Most Popular Narrative: 13% Undervalued
According to the most followed narrative, Asana appears to be trading at a notable discount to its calculated fair value, suggesting an opportunity for investors seeking value in the software sector.
Asana's integration of AI into structured workflow automation (AI Studio, smart workflows, and upcoming AI Teammates) is unlocking new, highly valued enterprise use cases that increase platform stickiness, boost customer expansion and drive higher ARPU, supporting accelerated mid to long-term revenue growth.
Curious what’s behind this bullish narrative? The secret sauce is in bold revenue and profit projections that defy the company’s current losses. A future valuation multiple that rivals some of the software industry’s biggest names is also a key factor.

However, investors don't need to invest in one or the other; some of the quantum computing pure plays are dabbling in both spaces. This could open up a huge investment opportunity over the next few years and deliver shareholders market-crushing returns.
The standard they'll be judged by is whether they can outperform traditional big tech companies, as they have long led the market to new heights. Additionally, some of them, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), are also competing in the quantum computing arms race alongside the AI buildout.
I've got three stocks that fit the bill that could outperform traditional tech companies, with one of them potentially coming as a surprise.
IonQ and D-Wave Quantum
IONQ (IONQ -5.85%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 3.99%) are two of my favorite quantum computing pure plays to follow. Each is taking a unique approach to the quantum computing industry, potentially giving them a leg up if their novel solutions work.
IonQ utilizes a trapped-ion approach, which has a few key advantages over the more popular superconducting approach. Instead of needing to cool a particle to nearly absolute zero, a trapped-ion computer can perform its tasks at room temperature. This reduces input costs, making it easier to deploy. Additionally, a trapped ion calculation is far more accurate than a superconducting one at this time. IonQ holds multiple world records for the most accurate quantum computers, and this could make it a top pick by potential clients.
D-Wave Quantum uses a quantum annealing approach, which isn't intended for broad use like a trapped ion or superconducting quantum computer might be. Instead, it works by finding the lowest energy state in a system, which represents the optimal solution. This makes it ideal for tasks like statistics or logistics networks, which represent a massive use case for quantum computing.
Each company is also looking at deploying its solutions for AI. IonQ's researchers have utilized several existing large language models and improved them by incorporating quantum computing. This cut down on energy cost and provided better-performing models. D-Wave Quantum is also involved with integrating quantum computing applications with AI, specifically focusing on applications where pre-trained AI could assist businesses and researchers.
Both companies are approaching integration with quantum computing in a hybrid approach, which involves using quantum computers to enhance what traditional computers are already doing. Currently, the king of traditional AI computing is Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), and it's also dabbling in the AI realm.
Nvidia
Nvidia isn't developing a quantum processing unit to replace its graphics processing units (GPUs). Instead, it's evolving its popular CUDA software to include quantum computing plug-ins, morphing the platform into CUDA-Q.
This is a smart approach by Nvidia, as it allows it to continue focusing on the AI arms race while capturing the upside of quantum computing. This approach will ensure that Nvidia's GPUs are needed in a hybrid computing application, which will continue to be the vast majority of use cases that deploy quantum computing.
While some may argue that Nvidia could be classified as a ""traditional"" tech company, I don't think it falls under this classification, as it's only a computing hardware provider that just happens to be the largest company in the world due to extreme demand. Nvidia is making a ton of money from its GPU sales to traditional big tech companies, and I think it's well-positioned to outperform in the current environment as well as in the future, when quantum computing potentially becomes a commercially viable technology."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-21T10:30:00,Billionaire Bill Gates Has 68% of His Foundation's $48 billion Portfolio Invested in 3 Remarkable Stocks,The Microsoft founder plans to give away virtually all of his wealth by 2045.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8a61dba15dcbc52bf3f7510cf1aed44da9113000e3cc83a5b30c5d87d6e4eb85,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/billionaire-bill-gates-has-68-of-his-foundations-4/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/billionaire-bill-gates-has-68-of-his-foundations-4/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/billionaire-bill-gates-has-68-of-his-foundations-4/,fool.com,200,,"In 1999, Bill Gates became the first person ever to reach centibillionaire status. That's a net worth of $100 billion. The rising value of Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) stock in the late 1990s ballooned his wealth well beyond that of anyone else in the world. In fact, it would be another 18 years until another tech company founder joined Gates in the club.
Today, though, Gates isn't worth much more than he was in 1999 despite the fact that Microsoft's market value climbed almost eightfold from its April 1999 level. That's because he's given much of his wealth away to the Gates Foundation, a nonprofit that supports public health, gender equality, economic development, and education around the world. He plans to contribute practically all of his remaining wealth to the foundation before it winds down operations in 2045.
Funding the efforts and research that go into supporting those causes is a trust with a portfolio of publicly traded equities worth about $48 billion as of this writing. And more than two-thirds of that portfolio is invested in just three remarkable stocks.
1. Microsoft (28% of assets)
The primary way Gates funds the foundation is with donations of his shares of Microsoft, the company he founded 50 years ago. In 2022, he donated $5 billion on top of a $15 billion pledge made in 2021. As of the end of June, the foundation's trust fund held 26,191,207 shares of Microsoft stock, according to its Form 13F filing with the SEC. That's worth about $13.4 billion as of this writing.
While the Gates Foundation sold some shares of Microsoft to fund its grants, that position remains the trust's largest holding. That's in part due to the strong performance of the stock over the last few years.
Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of artificial intelligence spending in recent years. Its cloud computing segment, Azure, is now a $75 billion business, and it grew 39% year over year in the company's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter. That growth should continue, as management notes it remains supply constrained.
Indeed, Microsoft sports a massive backlog of remaining performance obligations for its cloud business. While that figure includes its cloud-based enterprise software solution, Microsoft 365, growing demand from AI developers for computational power has been the segment's key growth driver. But the enterprise software business remains a key component of the business, too, providing huge amounts of cash flow and stable demand, and supporting Microsoft's massive investments in new data centers. The company plans to spend a record $30 billion in capital expenditures this quarter alone.
Microsoft currently sports a forward P/E ratio of 33. That's a premium price, to be sure, but its consistent growth and position among AI stocks make it well worth that premium.
2. Berkshire Hathaway (25%)
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.07%) (BRK.B 0.05%) has been a longtime holding of the Gates Foundation trust fund due to many years of contributions from CEO Warren Buffett. Buffett, a longtime friend of Gates, donates a sizable number of shares to the foundation each year, but those donations come with the stipulation that it disburses an amount equal to the value of his donations plus 5% of its existing assets. Buffett has decided to discontinue his annual donation upon his death.
With plans to spend $200 billion over the next 20 years, the Gates Foundation should have no problem meeting Buffett's requirements. Even with the requirements in place, the trust has built up a sizable position in the stock. It held 24,123,684 shares as of the end of June, a stake worth $11.8 billion today.
Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have declined in value since May, when Buffett announced that he's retiring as CEO effective Jan. 1. It seems that investors aren't willing to pay as much of a premium for the stock if Buffett's no longer going to be in charge of the investment decisions at the conglomerate.
But Berkshire's operating results have been strong. Its operating earnings came in above expectations last quarter, and were even stronger if you discount the impact of foreign exchange rates. However, the combination of growing operating cash flows, interest income, and the reduction of some positions in the portfolio has left a massive stockpile of cash on Berkshire's balance sheet as Buffett and his team wait for good opportunities to invest that money.
Berkshire now trades at a price-to-book ratio of just under 1.6. Buffett last had the company repurchase its own shares when the ratio was closer to 1.5, so investors may want to wait for the stock to come down to that level before picking up shares.
3. Waste Management (15%)
Waste Management (WM -1.99%) has been a longtime buy-and-hold investment for the Gates Foundation trust, which rarely sells the company's shares. In fact, the only quarterly decline in the trust's WM share count came last summer, when it sold a small portion of its holding. It still owns 32,234,344 shares, worth a total of about $7 billion as of this writing.
Waste Management is emblematic of an investing style Gates picked up in part from Buffett and that he has directed his investment team to follow: it's a boring business with a wide competitive moat.
Regulatory hurdles make it practically impossible to open new landfills in many parts of the U.S., which makes the more than 250 landfills that Waste Management already owns and operates extremely valuable assets that aren't likely to face fresh competition. Meanwhile, Waste Management's scale allows it to optimize route density to maximize revenue and minimize operating expenses.
That's reflected in its EBITDA margin, which came in at 29.9% last quarter, despite headwinds from its newly acquired medical waste business. While the new business segment contributed significant operating revenue, it's a drag on its profit margins. Still, strong organic growth enabled it to maintain a similar margin profile to the same period a year ago, resulting in overall EBITDA growth of 19%.
Shares of Waste Management trade today at an enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiple of about 15, based on forward estimates. That's a fair price to pay for a company that's producing strong organic growth and strategically acquiring new businesses exhibiting good synergies with its excess cash flow. It has been a long-term winner for Gates, and it could be a great boring business for average investors to own as well."

Citing discussions with investors and Microsoft’s investor relations team, Evercore analysts stated, “On a fundamental basis, we don’t see much to justify the recent underperformance.”
The need for generative AI workloads and steady enterprise trends, the firm states, drove Azure cloud’s 39% growth in the most recent quarter. With that in mind, the mid-30% increase in fiscal 2026 seems feasible.
According to Evercore, Microsoft’s bullish outlook is supported by its capacity to commercialize AI across the infrastructure and application layers over the course of the next three to five years.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading technology company known for its core software products, which include the Windows OS, Microsoft 365 suite, and Edge browser. Its product portfolio includes corporate software, software development tools, video games, gaming gear, and cloud services.

What happens when robots take everyone's jobs? It's the question hanging over office chatter, think pieces, and late-night doomscrolling. People are scrambling to find ""AI-proof"" careers, but with predictions that automation could replace nearly every role, the anxiety feels justified.
Elon Musk, however, isn't losing sleep. He's been repeating for years that society won't just need a universal basic income — it will need something bigger: universal high income.
The latest reminder came after tech commentator David Scott Patterson claimed on X that by 2030, ""all jobs will be replaced by AI and robots."" Musk replied, ""Your estimates are about right. However, intelligent robots in humanoid form will far exceed the population of humans, as every person will want their own personal R2-D2 and C-3PO. And then there will be many robots in industry for every human to provide products & services.""

That prompted another user to ask the obvious: ""When robots replace working people, how will those who become unemployed sustain their lives?""
Musk's answer: ""There will be universal high income (not merely basic income). Everyone will have the best medical care, food, home, transport and everything else. Sustainable abundance.""
It's an audacious promise — and one he's echoed for years. Where most politicians discuss UBI as a modest safety net, Musk insists the future demands something far more generous. He stresses ""high"" because in his view, basic isn't good enough when machines can handle nearly all labor.
Trending: Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund Just Backed This Farmland Manager — Accredited Investors Can Join the Same Fund
But the natural follow-up is uncomfortable: who pays for it? America is already buried under trillions in debt, and funding a system where ""everyone has the best of everything"" would mean rethinking the entire economic structure. Critics argue it's a fantasy without a tax base to support it, while others counter that automation itself could generate the wealth needed.
Skeptics point to today's struggles as a warning sign. If the government can't fully fund Social Security or Medicare, how realistic is it to expect a brand-new universal income — let alone a ""high"" one — to suddenly appear? As one response echoed, ""If our government is cutting Social Security and Medicare, what makes you believe they'll advocate for universal income — whether high or otherwise?"""

Par Pacific Holdings Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder of Par Pacific Holdings, you need to believe in continued strong refining margins, positive Pacific energy demand trends, and successful execution of renewable fuel initiatives such as the Hawaii Renewables joint venture. Recent insider selling by a director, while drawing attention to governance, is not a material disruptor to the company’s key near-term catalysts, particularly margin strength and renewable project delivery. The most relevant short-term risk remains potential operational disruptions at concentrated regional refineries.
Among recent announcements, the joint venture with Mitsubishi and ENEOS for renewable fuels stands out, directly addressing a core catalyst: Par Pacific’s exposure to the industry’s transition to cleaner energy. While this project promises new revenue streams starting in 2026, it also underscores the importance of maintaining reliable refinery operations as the company pivots toward renewables. In contrast, investors should be aware that...

Par Pacific Holdings' outlook sees revenues falling to $6.3 billion and earnings rising to $397.9 million by 2028. This is based on an expected annual revenue decline of 6.1% and an increase in earnings of $417 million from the current loss of $-19.1 million.

Three Simply Wall St Community fair value opinions for Par Pacific range widely, from US$20.46 to US$93.79 per share.

Airbnb Investment Narrative Recap
To hold Airbnb stock, you need to believe the company can adapt and grow beyond its core short-term rental model, despite mounting regulatory challenges. The recent US$250 million AI-focused investment aims to expand Airbnb's appeal and capabilities, but for now, the most important short-term catalyst remains quarterly earnings momentum. The biggest risk is still intensifying government restrictions, and the recent announcement doesn’t materially change that risk in the near term.
The newly authorized US$6 billion share buyback stands out among recent announcements. While this supports the share price and signals management’s confidence, it isn’t expected to meaningfully impact the underlying fundamental drivers, such as regulatory headwinds or new business growth, that investors are watching closely.

The newly issued Q3 2025 guidance, calling for a pullback in earnings due to lower volumes and tighter margins, may directly affect short-term sentiment; however, the primary catalyst, new capacity from major projects, remains the key factor for potential earnings growth, while exposure to volatile steel pricing stands out as the biggest risk right now.
Among recent company announcements, the scheduled release of Q3 earnings results on October 27, 2025 is most relevant to the latest guidance. Investors will likely focus on whether actual earnings performance aligns with forecasts and what management says about margin pressures and near-term demand, both of which are central to the company's current investment narrative.
In contrast, investors should also consider how fluctuations in raw material costs could ...

FTC Solar Investment Narrative Recap
FTC Solar’s story is built on technology that reduces solar project costs and accelerates adoption in increasingly complex environments. With the recent launch of the 1P Pioneer+ Terrain Following tracker, the company strengthens its position as a solutions provider for challenging sites, a move that could reinforce its most important near-term catalyst: winning new contracts as utility-scale project pipelines resume. However, the impact on the biggest current risk, persistent net losses and the challenge of achieving sustainable margins, may take time to materialize, so on its own this news is not immediately material for risk reduction. Among recent product launches, the August introduction of the Pioneer+ High Wind tracker is most relevant, as it also targets project feasibility in difficult conditions. These efforts to broaden the product portfolio for diverse site requirements align directly with the company’s need to gain share as project development activity rebounds, especially in markets hindered by terrain and weather-related risks. Yet, in contrast to product momentum, investors should be aware of ongoing net losses and liquidity needs...

WEX Investment Narrative Recap
To be a WEX shareholder, you need to believe the company’s investments in digital platforms and integrated payment solutions will overcome competitive threats and evolving fleet needs. The rebranding of Payzerware to WEX Field Service Management expands its contractor ecosystem but does not materially shift the primary near-term catalyst, revenue growth from new fleet partnerships, or mitigate the central risk of declining relevance as fleets transition toward electric vehicles and alternative fuels.
The recent announcement that Lynkwell has integrated WEX payment technology into its EV charging platform is closely related, as it demonstrates ongoing efforts to keep WEX relevant as fleet fuel needs change.

Two names that have attracted growing attention this year are Oracle and CoreWeave.
Unlike the tech titans that dominate headlines, Oracle and CoreWeave are carving out their niche at the infrastructure layer of the AI ecosystem. The opportunity they've identified is straightforward but also mission-critical: providing cloud-based access to GPUs. These chips -- designed primarily by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices -- remain supply constrained as they are largely absorbed by the world's largest companies.
This supply imbalance has created an opportunity to enable AI model development by offering GPUs as a service -- a business model that allows companies to rent chip capacity through cloud infrastructure. For businesses that cannot secure GPUs directly, infrastructure services are both time-saving and cost-efficient.
In the background, however, a small, albeit capable, company has been competing with Oracle and CoreWeave in the GPU-as-a-service landscape. Let's explore how Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%) is disrupting incumbents and why now is an interesting time to take a look at the stock for your portfolio.
17.4 billion reasons to pay close attention to Nebius
Last week, Nebius announced a five-year, $17.4 billion infrastructure agreement with Microsoft. For reference, up until this point, Nebius' management had been guiding for $1.1 billion in run rate annual recurring revenue (ARR) by December. I point this out to underscore just how transformative this contract is in terms of scale and duration.
The Microsoft deal not only places Nebius firmly alongside peers like Oracle and CoreWeave in the AI infrastructure conversation, but it also serves as validation that its technology is robust enough to meet the standards of a hyperscaler.
For Microsoft, the partnership is equally strategic. With GPUs in chronically short supply and long lead times to expand data center capacity, this agreement allows Microsoft to secure adequate compute resources without stretching internal infrastructure or assuming the upfront capital expenditure (capex) budget and execution risks that come with it.
Why this deal matters for investors
AI investment is not a cyclical trend -- it's a structural shift. Enterprises are deploying applications into production at unprecedented speed, workloads are scaling rapidly, and new use cases in areas like robotics and autonomous systems are emerging.
For companies that supply the compute underpinning this increasingly complex ecosystem, these dynamics create durable secular tailwinds. By securing Microsoft as a flagship customer, Nebius has established itself within this foundational layer of the AI infrastructure economy.
Is Nebius stock a buy right now?
Since announcing its partnership with Microsoft, Nebius shares have surged roughly 39% as of this writing (Sept. 16). With that kind of momentum, it's natural to wonder whether the stock has become expensive. To answer that, it helps to put its valuation in context.
Prior to the Microsoft deal, Nebius was guiding for $1.1 billion in ARR by year-end. If I assume Microsoft's $17.4 billion commitment is evenly spread across five years (2026 to 2031), that adds about $3.5 billion annually -- bringing Nebius' pro forma ARR closer to $4.6 billion.
Against its current market cap of $21.3 billion, Nebius stock trades at an implied forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.6. On the surface, that looks meaningfully discounted to peers like Oracle and CoreWeave.
That said, there are important caveats to consider. My analysis assumes no customer attrition over the next several years -- this is unrealistic due to competitive pressures. While Nebius may continue winning large-scale contracts, it's also reasonable to expect some customer churn.
Moreover, comparing Nebius' future ARR to Oracle's and CoreWeave's current revenue base is not an apples-to-apples match. Oracle, for example, has reportedly inked a $300 billion cloud deal with OpenAI. Meanwhile, CoreWeave also has multiyear, multibillion-dollar commitments tied to OpenAI. The catch is that OpenAI itself doesn't have the cash on its balance sheet to fully fund these agreements -- leaving questions about their viability.
In short, Nebius appears attractively valued relative to its peers -- but the landscape is evolving quickly and riddled with moving parts. The more important takeaway is that Nebius is now winning significant business alongside its brand-name peers.
In my eyes, this validation in combination with ongoing structural demand tailwinds makes Nebius a compelling buy and hold opportunity as the AI infrastructure narrative continues to unfold."

Bill Gates, billionaire and the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), shared his approach to solving problems, including those related to his philanthropic projects.
Gates Shares A Guide To His Problem-Solving
Gates revealed his problem-solving technique in a blog post titled “The Buzz Stops Here” in 2020. He said that he has been using the same method since his teenage years, and it has helped him tackle major issues, including the pandemic which was underway back then.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
The two questions he asks himself are: “Who has dealt with this problem well? And what can we learn from them?”
Gates emphasized that although these questions may seem simple, finding the answers and turning them into actionable solutions can be challenging.
“They seem like obvious questions, but sometimes it’s surprisingly hard to find the answers,” wrote Gates.
Gates' Childhood Habits Shaped His Problem-Solving Path
The billionaire’s approach to problem-solving is deeply rooted in his childhood habits and experiences. In a previous blog post, he credited his love for reading as a fundamental part of his success. This passion for learning has been a consistent theme in Gates’ life, helping him overcome challenges and drive innovation.

However, Gates’ journey to success was not without its hurdles. In a 2005 Q&A session with Warren Buffett, Gates admitted to having a bad habit of procrastination during his time at Harvard University. He later overcame this habit, demonstrating his ability to recognize and address personal challenges, a skill that has likely contributed to his problem-solving approach.
Moreover, Gates’ success is not solely attributed to his intelligence, as noted by Larry Ellison in a 2011 interview. Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), praised Gates for his focus and endurance, highlighting the importance of these traits in problem-solving and achieving long-term success.

(Reuters) - Microsoft said on Friday it is raising the prices of its Xbox gaming consoles in the U.S. for a second time this year, as the cloud giant's video game division grapples with tariff-induced cost pressures, strong competition and uncertain spending.
The price increases, which Microsoft attributes to ""changes in the macroeconomic environment,"" will apply to its current generation of hardware, with the one-terabyte Series S set to cost around $450 and the high-end Series X around $650 when the changes go into effect on October 3.
The special edition two-terabyte Galaxy Black Series X will now retail for nearly $800.
Xbox previously raised console prices in May in several markets including the United States, Europe, Australia and the UK, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from manufacturing hubs like China threaten to raise the cost of hardware and compress margins.
Paired with the May increases, the Xbox Series X has seen a $150 price hike within six months, potentially leading gamers to curb budgets amid higher inflation levels.
""This price increase is less about opportunism or even the cost of software development. Instead, it is the result of tariff increases and rising costs in the supply chain. Hardware is being repriced to absorb new trade pressures,"" said Joost van Dreunen, games professor at NYU Stern School of Business.
Xbox rival Sony also raised the prices of its PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. by around $50 last month. Sony's most expensive PS5 Pro retails for $749.99.
Prices for controllers, headsets and consoles in other markets will remain unchanged, Microsoft said.
Consoles were expected to be the biggest driver of growth in the video game industry this year, due to the launch of new premium titles such as ""Grand Theft Auto VI,"" and hardware such as Nintendo's Switch 2. However, title delays and price hikes cast a cloud over the industry's near-term outlook.

Under the multiyear deal, Oracle would provide the social media giant with computing power for training and deploying artificial intelligence models, according to people familiar with the talks. The total commitment amount may increase and other deal terms could still change before a final agreement, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.

Oracle has previously disclosed cloud business with Meta and other companies that train AI models, including Elon Musk’s xAI.
Oracle shares climbed 4.1% to $308.66 at the close Friday in New York. The stock, fueled by the company’s cloud success, has jumped 85% this year.
Known for its database software, Oracle is emerging as a key provider of AI computing capacity, competing against cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.
Meta declined to comment. Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
In August, Bloomberg reported that Oracle was in talks with Meta for additional cloud capacity.
Still, investors have voiced concern over how much of Oracle’s booked cloud deals are attributable to a single customer, OpenAI, which is the leading AI company. Earlier this year, Oracle won a deal to provide the AI company with 4.5 gigawatts of computing power, an unprecedented sum.

(Reuters) -Oracle is in talks with Meta for a multi-year cloud computing deal worth about $20 billion, underscoring the social media giant's drive to secure faster access to computing power, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Oracle would provide Meta with computing capacity for training and deploying AI models, in addition to Meta's existing cloud computing providers, the person said.
Meta declined to comment, while Oracle did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters.
Oracle offers integrated cloud technologies along with flexible deployment models, enabling it to meet a range of customer demands.
The potential deal comes just a week after a Wall Street Journal report on OpenAI signing a contract to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years from Oracle, marking one of the biggest cloud contracts ever signed.
The company has struck deals with Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft to let their cloud customers run Oracle Cloud Infrastructure alongside native services. The revenue from these partnerships rose more than sixteen-fold in the first quarter.
Oracle unveiled four multi-billion-dollar contracts last week, amid an industry-wide shift, led by companies such as OpenAI and xAI, to aggressively spend to secure the massive computing capacity needed to stay ahead in the AI race.
The enterprise software maker said it expects to sign up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in the next few months, and that booked revenue at its OCI business would exceed half a trillion dollars.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TEAM. Atlassian Corporation's share was trading at $173.87 as of September 15th. TEAM’s forward P/E was 39.37 according to Yahoo Finance.
Atlassian Corporation (TEAM) is a cornerstone of modern knowledge work, with its products Jira and Confluence deeply embedded in the workflows of over 300,000 companies, including NASA, Netflix, and Airbnb. Its software forms the backbone for collaboration, project management, and knowledge sharing, creating a sticky ecosystem that is difficult for customers to abandon. Despite this entrenched position, Atlassian’s shares have declined over 30% year-to-date, reflecting investor concerns over margin compression, intense competition, and a cautious forward outlook. The company faces multifaceted pressure from Microsoft’s integrated enterprise suite, GitLab’s end-to-end DevOps platform, and work management tools like Monday.com and Asana, challenging Atlassian across product, platform, and user-experience dimensions.
Originating from a $10,000 credit card bet by its founders, Atlassian pioneered a product-led growth model, reinvesting sales savings into engineering to build highly adoptable, low-friction tools. Its ecosystem expanded through cross-selling and the Atlassian Marketplace, fostering high switching costs and creating a durable economic moat. Today, Atlassian is executing a strategic pivot centered on AI, enterprise expansion, and enhanced collaboration. Its AI agent, Rovo, leverages proprietary “Teamwork Graph” data to deliver contextual intelligence across integrated products, while the Loom acquisition embeds asynchronous video capabilities to deepen engagement. Enterprise-focused bundles, along with FedRAMP authorization, position the company to capture high-value contracts and accelerate adoption.
Financially, Atlassian’s cloud revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $1.36 billion in Q3 FY2025, with $638 million in free cash flow, highlighting the strength of its underlying economics despite GAAP margin pressures from strategic investments. The stock, trading at a 29.7x Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow ratio, offers potential upside relative to intrinsic value. Atlassian represents a high-conviction investment in a company transforming into an AI-driven intelligent work platform, with long-term growth, robust cash generation, and a defensible moat, making the current share price an attractive entry point for patient investors.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Atlassian Corporation (TEAM) by Deep Value Returns in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s strong free cash flow, disciplined expense management, scalable business model, and guidance toward 20% CAGR through fiscal 2027. The company's stock price has depreciated approximately by 16.4% since our coverage. This is because broader market pressures weighed on valuation. The thesis still stands as TEAM’s resilient growth and cash generation remain intact. Darius Dark Investing shares a similar but emphasizes Atlassian’s strategic AI pivot and enterprise expansion."

Google and PayPal partner in preparation for agentic commerce
Google and PayPal want to “help advance the intelligent agent revolution” by making the next generation of digital commerce more accessible to a broad swath of consumers.
The two companies announced Wednesday that they had entered a multi-year partnership focused on upgrading consumers’ transaction experience for evolving AI systems. One of the goals of the partnership is to solidify the necessary cogs for future agentic commerce by leveraging PayPal’s data capturing, identity verification and payment solutions and using Google’s AI savviness. While the two companies have a vested interest in pushing agentic commerce forward, they also highlighted the need for reliable, safe transactions, particularly with AI’s involvement. The partnership announcement comes just one day after Google unveiled its Agent Payments Protocol, which is intended to foster trustworthy transactions led by agents.
Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said the partnership will have far-reaching implications for the technology and e-commerce industries, if executed as planned.
“In this emerging world of agentic commerce, trust and innovation are key,” Chriss said in a statement. “Together with Google, we are leading the way for digital commerce, ensuring greater opportunities for merchants and users worldwide. We are bringing PayPal’s products and services to billions of Google users and redefining what’s possible at global scale.”
The move comes a few months after major payment providers Visa and Mastercard announced that they had teamed up with some of the world’s largest AI companies to enable agentic commerce securely and without sacrificing consumers’ sensitive information.
While the work stemming from those partnerships has not yet come to life at scale, the hope is that linking payment systems with existing AI shopping applications can allow for a truly autonomous experience that would see assistants purchasing items on consumers’ behalf based on a specific inquiry.
Uber Freight upgrades TMS with AI
Uber Freight announced at Deliver 2025, its annual conference, that it had upgraded the AI capabilities available on its platform in an effort to make logistics simpler and more efficient.
Uber Freight’s transportation management system (TMS) has been leveraging AI for some time, but this week, Uber announced that clients can now use the platform to track and handle the order-to-cash journey of shipments in full. That means that, where operators may previously have needed separate, disconnected systems, they can now leverage a single platform that helps them decision quicker and identify issues sooner.
Uber said the platform gives operators “greater control of freight spend and more accurate forecasting across the network.” The company’s hope is that clients use the TMS for real-time information, rather than treating it as a source for completed transactions and freight runs.
In addition to its spend upgrades, Uber has added more features to its procurement platform. The company said it can now automate the data-gathering and modeling behind bid awards. Rather than having a human spend days or weeks finding the information, requesting quotes and evaluating the options against one another, Uber Freight’s platform can generate a real-time comparison of costs, carriers, available services and more. What’s more, the system can project financial and performance metrics ahead of an operator choosing a specific carrier or plan.
The logistics player hopers that, in doing so, it can help clients cut costs and make faster decisions relying on data.
Steve Barber, vice president of product at Uber Freight, said it has already been leveraging agentic AI in its operations with customers, and noted that it expects to provide tangible improvements with these new capabilities.
“From procurement to payment, shippers face constant complexity across the freight lifecycle. Through continued investment in platform innovation, Uber Freight delivers the tools, automations and integrations that simplify the work and unlock meaningful outcomes such as faster decisions, smarter cost control, and more resilient supply chains,” Barber said in a statement.
Seattle-based startup secures pre-seed for in-store feedback
Seattle’s Ethosphere announced Tuesday that it has raised a $2.5 million pre-seed round. Point72 Ventures led the round, with additional participation from AI2 Incubator, Carya Ventures, Pack VC, Hike Ventures and J4 Ventures.
Ethosphere uses microphones to anonymously and securely capture real conversations between in-store retail associates and customers. It then parses through the key parts of the conversation, generates a transcript and passes feedback to both the employee and their manager.
Evan Smith, CEO and co-founder of Ethosphere, said the technology brings a unique use case for AI into companies’ stores and creates a proactive learning opportunity for employees as they go through their normal days.
For instance, Ethosphere might tell a manager that a particular associate is excellent at greeting and interacting with customers, but often shares incorrect product information about a newly stocked product line. The system may then recommend that the manager review the descriptions with that employee to ensure future accuracy.
“AI is bringing change to every industry, and retail is no exception, but there is a significant gap in how the technology can be applied in a useful, human-focused manner,” Smith said in a statement. “Ethosphere wants to bridge that gap by empowering retailers to invest in their people, recognizing that a well-supported and knowledgeable team is the key to building exceptional customer experiences. This human-centric approach not only enhances brick-and-mortar purchasing but also directly impacts a company’s bottom line by fostering loyalty and driving sales. We’re partnering with major brands to achieve this goal.”
The startup plans to use the funding to scale up the pilots it has already started with undisclosed “major retail brands.” Its site also shows that it’s hiring a senior software engineer, who would “lead a squad of two to four engineers” and build various systems to support the continued development of Ethosphere.
Ralph Lauren introduces Microsoft and OpenAI-powered shopping assistant
Ralph Lauren announced last week it had introduced a new, conversational AI chatbot it calls Ask Ralph.
Ask Ralph can handle consumer styling questions and provide recommendations on matching existing items, finding the right outfit for an occasion and more. For instance, a consumer might tell the chatbot that they need to attend an important business meeting and would like to purchase an outfit that matches their favorite navy blue blazer. For the brand, the idea is that consumers can work with the chatbot “just as they would with a stylist in a Ralph Lauren store.”
David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, said allowing consumers to have richer e-commerce experiences will allow the brand to foster an even deeper connection with its shoppers.
“Whether getting ready for a first day of a new job, or creating the perfect look for a night out, Ask Ralph is about more than just discovery—it is about engaging consumers with what they love most about Ralph Lauren: our iconic, unique take on style, providing timeless head-to-toe looks that inspire them to step into our world,” Lauren said in a statement.
Ask Ralph is available only in Ralph Lauren’s app for U.S. users. The brand partnered with Microsoft to leverage its Azure OpenAI platform to enable the technology.
Shelley Bransten, corporate vice president of global industry solutions at Microsoft, said the partnership felt like a natural step for the brand and the technology provider, especially in a moment where consumers are changing their shopping and discovery habits.
“AI is transforming the way consumers get inspired, educated and purchase from fashion brands around the world,” Bransten said in a statement. “We’re proud to bring the combination of our trusted generative AI capabilities through Azure OpenAI together with Ralph Lauren’s iconic brand to pave the way for an entirely new conversational commerce experience.”
Inspectorio introduces intelligence layer Paramo
Supply chain intelligence firm Inspectorio announced Thursday it is introducing Paramo, which it calls “an AI-native ‘intelligence layer’ that is embedded across Inspectorio‘s entire supply chain platform.
Today, some AI solutions are deployed in pieces—for instance, a company might have one provider’s technology running to streamline inventory management and another platform leveraging different data to aid with insights on risks impacting their shipments. Because those two systems are not integrated with one another—that is to say, they don’t leverage the same data sources and don’t have the same baseline for external information—they cannot effectively interact one another, nor can they make parallel recommendations informed by context from the other.
But Inspectorio wants to change that with Paramo. The company said it has built a unified system that uses structured data from retailers and suppliers, with the intention of creating a single source of truth that underlays the recommendations an AI model provides to a user. That system then employs copilots and agentic AI to handle myriad tasks inside an organization. Inspectorio said it has trained the copilots to handle risk detection, document scanning and more. The agents, meanwhile, are meant to independently handle tasks that streamline brands and retailers’ sourcing, compliance and traceability strategies. If the system is deployed as designed, it could help the technology provider’s clients lower their technology and sourcing spends, upgrade compliance protocols and expedite sourcing.
Chirag Patel, CEO at Inspectorio, said supply chain management needs to be able to evolve effectively alongside technology.
“As retailers and brands navigate an increasingly complex supplier landscape, high-quality data and production chain visibility fuels more trustworthy outputs and decision making,” Patel said in a statement. “Organizations must evolve their operations by increasing agility and automation, and Paramo enables brands and retailers to transform this disruption into stability and growth. Embedded operational intelligence is the only way to future-proof operations. Paramo sets the industry standard for the future of supply chain management.”"

With the global cloud infrastructure market projected to reach $2 trillion by 2030 and generative AI alone expected to drive $200-$300 billion in annual cloud spending, these technology giants are positioning themselves as essential partners in the digital transformation journey.
Oracle's stunning 359% surge in remaining performance obligations to $455 billion and its groundbreaking $300 billion OpenAI deal have sent shockwaves through the market, while Microsoft's $80 billion AI infrastructure commitment for fiscal 2025 and expanding Copilot ecosystem demonstrate its determination to maintain cloud leadership. Let's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.
The Case for ORCL Stock
Oracle has emerged as a dark horse in the AI cloud race, transforming from a traditional database company into a major hyperscaler. The company's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure posted a remarkable 55% revenue growth in its latest quarter, significantly outpacing the broader market and approaching an annual run rate of $18 billion for fiscal 2026. This explosive growth is backed by $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, including a historic $300 billion contract with OpenAI beginning in 2027, representing one of the largest cloud agreements in history. Oracle's aggressive expansion includes bringing 101 cloud regions online, with plans to eventually exceed all competitors combined in regional coverage.
The company's unique multi-cloud strategy sets it apart, as Oracle is embedding native versions of its infrastructure directly within AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud through partnerships like Oracle Database@AWS and Oracle Database@Azure. This approach allows customers to leverage Oracle's superior database performance while maintaining their existing cloud relationships. Oracle's Gen 2 cloud architecture claims 50% better price performance and 3.5 times time savings for high-performance computing workloads, making it particularly attractive for AI training and inference tasks. The company's announcement of the Oracle AI Database service in October, enabling customers to run OpenAI and other AI models directly on Oracle databases, further strengthens its AI positioning.
However, the company's total revenue growth of just 7% year over year to $14.9 billion in first-quarter fiscal 2026 pales compared to its cloud infrastructure growth, suggesting heavy dependence on this single segment. Converting the massive $455 billion backlog into actual revenues will require flawless execution and substantial capital investment in data centers and infrastructure."

Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko urged Bitcoin to accelerate quantum-resistant upgrades, warning there’s a 50% chance of a quantum breakthrough within five years that could compromise existing cryptographic security.
Speaking at the All-In Summit 2025, Yakovenko said Bitcoin should migrate to quantum-resistant signature schemes as AI acceleration makes the timeline from research to implementation “astounding.”
His warning aligns with growing industry concerns about quantum computers’ ability to break elliptic curve cryptography, which protects Bitcoin wallets.
Current quantum machines have around 1,000 qubits, but experts estimate thousands or millions would be needed to threaten crypto security.
Tech giants, including IBM, Google, and Microsoft, are pushing massive development timelines with some targeting millions of qubits within the coming decade.
Vulnerable Bitcoin Holdings at Risk
Cybersecurity experts estimate approximately 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, roughly 6-7 million BTC worth hundreds of billions of dollars, remains vulnerable to potential quantum attacks.
These coins sit in older Pay-to-Public-Key addresses or reused Pay-to-Pubkey-Hash formats that expose public keys directly on the blockchain.
In an interview with Cryptonew, David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol and a former ethical hacker, warned that adversaries may already be implementing “harvest now, decrypt later” strategies.
These attacks involve collecting encrypted blockchain data today for future decryption once quantum computers become capable enough.
In response to the growing threat of this technology, El Salvador took proactive steps in September, splitting its 6,284 BTC national reserve across 14 separate addresses to reduce exposure to quantum attacks.
The redistribution followed security experts’ recommendations to avoid single-address storage that concentrates risk when public keys become visible through transactions.
Major financial institutions have also begun acknowledging quantum risks. BlackRock highlighted quantum computing threats in Bitcoin ETF filings, while Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino warned about inactive wallet exposures.
Industry Timeline Estimates Converging on Late 2020s
Multiple quantum computing experts have narrowed their estimates for when quantum computers could break Bitcoin’s security to the late 2020s or early 2030s.
Dating back to 2017, researchers, including Divesh Aggarwal and Gavin Brennen, initially warned that elliptic curve cryptography could be broken “as early as 2027.”
However, Gavin Brennen from Macquarie University recently updated his assessment, noting that required quantum computer sizes have dropped from 10-20 million qubits to around one million.
“Quantum computers pose a threat to blockchains, primarily by attacks on digital signatures, and cryptocurrencies should get started sooner rather than later to upgrade their systems to use post-quantum cryptography before their asset valuations are threatened,” Gavin said.
Gavin also shared that “French startup Alice & Bob estimates that specialized [quantum computers] with just 126,000 physical qubits could crack 256-bit elliptic curve signatures.”
According to a Cryptonew interview in April, John Lilic, CEO of Telos and an early Ethereum contributor, has stopped making deals involving tokens after 2027 or 2028 based on his quantum timeline research.
He warned that quantum attacks will appear innocuous initially, resembling dormant wallets becoming active rather than obvious security breaches.
The convergence of AI with quantum computing has accelerated development timelines beyond earlier predictions.
Microsoft’s recent chip breakthroughs prompted claims that quantum computing is now “years, not decades” away.
Amazon and Google have also reportedly made similar aggressive timeline commitments with their respective quantum initiatives.
IBM is also planning to build 100,000-qubit chipsets by decade’s end, while PsiQuantum targets one million photonic qubits within the same timeframe.
These developments have prompted Yakovenko and others to emphasize the urgency of preparing cryptographic defenses before quantum capabilities mature.
Migration Challenges and Post-Quantum Solutions
Upgrading Bitcoin to quantum-resistant cryptography requires enormous coordination challenges for decentralized networks.
Unlike centralized institutions that can update SSL certificates overnight, blockchain networks require consensus from all participants, including inactive users and legacy wallet holders.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology finalized three main post-quantum digital signature standards in 2024: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+.
However, implementing these algorithms requires hard forks, which Bitcoin’s decentralized governance structure makes it difficult to coordinate quickly.
Quantum-resistant algorithms typically require larger key sizes and more processing power, which can slow transaction times and increase computational requirements for mining operations.
These performance tradeoffs complicate the transition while quantum threats loom closer.
However, Carvalho recommends phased migration approaches, including dual-signature transactions that combine current ECDSA signatures with post-quantum proofs.
This allows testing quantum-safe infrastructure while maintaining compatibility with existing systems until full transitions become necessary.
As it stands now, the immediate focus remains on defensive preparations, rather than speculations on when.

The company's recent announcement to expand its Wisconsin datacenter plan to $7 billion underscores a broader commitment to building the computational backbone necessary for AI and cloud services dominance.
The scale of Microsoft's datacenter ambitions is staggering. Operating over 300 datacenters across more than 60 regions globally, the company has positioned itself as one of the world's largest datacenter operators. This extensive network directly translates into revenue potential, as evidenced by the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, where Azure and other cloud services revenues grew 29% year over year, driven largely by AI services demand that relies heavily on this infrastructure.
The Wisconsin expansion, building upon earlier investments, reflects Microsoft's strategic bet that datacenter capacity will become the limiting factor in AI adoption. This $7 billion commitment alone could generate thousands of jobs while providing the computing power necessary to serve enterprise AI workloads at scale.
Microsoft's datacenter investments create multiple value streams beyond direct cloud revenues. These facilities enable the company to offer lower-latency services, improve data sovereignty compliance for international customers, and maintain competitive advantages in the rapidly growing AI-as-a-service market. With capital expenditures in datacenter infrastructure exceeding $50 billion annually, Microsoft is essentially building a moat that few competitors can match, positioning the stock for sustained growth as digital transformation and AI adoption accelerate globally.
How Amazon and Google Stack Up in the Datacenter Race
Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services operates approximately 105 availability zones across 33 geographic regions, with Amazon continuing to expand its infrastructure footprint through multi-billion dollar investments. Amazon's datacenter strategy focuses on maintaining its cloud market leadership, with the company announcing plans for additional regions in Malaysia, Mexico, and New Zealand.
Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform runs 40 regions and 121 zones globally, with Google investing heavily in subsea cables and edge locations to differentiate its infrastructure. Google's recent commitment to invest $3.3 billion in South Carolina datacenters demonstrates its determination to close the gap. While Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader by market share at roughly 31%, Google has accelerated its datacenter buildout to capture more enterprise AI workloads, though both companies trail Microsoft's geographic reach of more than 300 datacenters worldwide."

The company, which owns Facebook, filed an application with US regulators this week seeking authorization to do so. A Meta representative said it was a natural next step to participate in energy markets as it looks to power operations with clean energy.

Buying electricity has become an increasingly urgent challenge for technology companies including Meta, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. They’re all racing to develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems and tools that are notoriously resource-intensive. Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft are already active power traders, according to filings with US regulators.
While big tech companies consume huge amounts of electricity, they also have contracts for power that they can flip around and sell when prices are high.
“There will be opportunities to sell electricity into the wholesale markets and make a little extra money doing that,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James.
Plus, tech companies that have batteries or on-site generators at data centers can sell power from those back to the grid when prices spike, said Andy DeVries, a utilities and power analyst at CreditSights Inc.
Power demand from data centers used to build and run AI models is set to quadruple in 10 years, based on projections from BloombergNEF. At the same time, power prices are rising amid this surge in electric demand. In fact, capacity payments — which generators get in some US markets — hit a record in an auction held this year by the country’s biggest grid, which stretches from Washington to Chicago.
The demand is so robust that some tech firms that touted their climate goals are now considering natural gas a key source to help power their data centers. Last month, for instance, Louisiana regulators approved utility Entergy Corp.’s plan to build three natural gas plants to power Meta’s data center there.
Meta’s application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks authorization “to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services.” It didn’t identify, however, where in the US it would seek to trade power. The company would be required to file for membership in order to trade in one of seven competitive power markets, such as the Texas grid or the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which encompasses the Louisiana data center."

A Startup Growing From $7M to $50M Revenue in Months
Micro1, founded in 2022, competes directly with Scale AI and other players in the training data sector, TechCrunch reported. The company's business focuses on connecting contractors, or as it calls them, experts, with leading AI labs and enterprises for labeling and training tasks.
Ansari told TechCrunch that Micro1 has grown its annual recurring revenue from $7 million at the start of 2025 to $50 million, a sharp rise in less than a year. Clients reportedly already include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and multiple Fortune 100 companies.
While that revenue still trails rivals like Mercor, with more than $450 million, and Surge AI, which reported $1.2 billion in 2024, Ansari said Micro1's growth pace and adoption rate by major labs are promising signs.

Micro1's competitive edge comes from its proprietary AI recruiter known as Zara, which interviews candidates and helps vet their expertise before connecting them to projects. Ansari said the company has already recruited thousands of experts, including professors from Stanford and Harvard, with plans to onboard hundreds more each week.
The change in the market comes after Meta (NASDAQ:META) invested $14 billion into Scale AI and hired its CEO, prompting concerns among other AI labs about potential conflicts of interest. OpenAI and Google were among those that said they would move away from Scale AI."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-19T14:30:00,Prediction: This AI Growth Stock Will Become Europe's First $1 Trillion Company by 2035,"Even near a 52-week high, ASML has plenty of room to run for patient investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2b7bde98783357de6cea9864dd5240c863df836525404dbfedb822bdd9b0168d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,fool.com,200,,"On Sept. 15, Alphabet joined Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple as the fourth U.S. company to surpass $3 trillion in market capitalization. But turn your attention across the pond, and there is not a single European company that is worth over $1 trillion, or even half that amount.
Here's why Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML 2.69%) is the best-positioned company to surpass $1 trillion in market cap within the next decade.
Why leading European companies are much smaller than top U.S. companies
The European stock market is highly fragmented. Instead of being viewed as European Union companies, Siemens is a German company, Novo Nordisk is a Danish company, and Shell is a British company. It would be like if U.S. investors viewed Oracle and Tesla as Texas companies versus Microsoft and Amazon as Washington companies.
There are also different regulations in Europe and more conservative pension and funding rules. Companies tend to be more specialized, although there are some conglomerates, like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, that united French luxury brands in the 1980s.
Most importantly, European stock markets simply haven't benefited from technology as much as the U.S. Many of Europe's largest companies aren't tech enterprises. In contrast, the U.S. stock market is dominated by tech-focused companies like the ""Ten Titans"" that continue to make up a larger share of the S&P 500. The U.S. is the tech capital of the world, and the tech sector makes up around a third of the S&P 500 -- illustrating its importance in the U.S. market.
ASML is an anchor in the AI industry
ASML popped 6.5% on Monday after a sell-side analyst who had been neutral on the stock upgraded it to a buy. The move pushed ASML's market cap to $341 billion -- making it the most valuable European company, even ahead of LVMH. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years, ASML would need a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% -- which seems reasonable for a cutting-edge technology company that heavily benefits from artificial intelligence (AI).
There's no contest that ASML is my top AI stock to buy now and hold for the long term. Holding a stock for years or even decades takes a lot of conviction. For ASML, the essential ingredient in the investment thesis recipe is its monopoly over the most complex part of the semiconductor manufacturing process. ASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems use lenses to print features on microchips.
There are plenty of companies that make DUV machines, including Nikon and Canon, which specialize in camera lenses. However, what sets ASML apart is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. These machines use mirrors to reflect light because EUV light has a wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers (almost X-ray range), which is too small to pass through glass. At a wavelength that small, a glass lens would absorb the light instead of bending/refracting it.
Achieving such a small wavelength unlocks untold efficiency improvements, allowing ASML's machines to pack more transitions per chip by printing more precise features (narrower lines, smaller spacing, etc.). It's an incredible engineering feat, and one that is driving advancements in AI.
EUV's smaller wavelength, fewer steps, and high efficiency make it a must-have for fabs like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung Electronics, and Intel to handle increasingly sophisticated designs from Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.
Steady growth at a great value
Despite the long-term potential, ASML warned investors during its last quarterly earnings release that it may not grow in 2026 -- which sparked a steep sell-off in the stock. However, ASML reaffirmed its 2030 targets. The high end of its guidance range calls for doubling revenue relative to 2024 levels. Additionally, ASML expects its gross margin to expand to the high 50% range, likely because high-margin EUVs are expected to make up an increasingly larger percentage of its sales mix compared to DUVs.
Even after its run-up, ASML sports a reasonable 31 forward price-to-earnings ratio, which is far cheaper than many other fast-growing AI stocks, especially considering ASML's strong moat in EUV technology. What's more, the company has a strong dividend. Currently yielding 0.8%, the quarterly payout is a nice cherry on top for investors seeking to add some passive income to their long-term holdings.
Round out your AI portfolio with ASML
ASML isn't a high-flying AI stock that is heavily disrupting cloud computing or making next-generation chips. Nor is it a tech conglomerate like Microsoft and Alphabet, which have a lot of moving parts in addition to their AI focus. However, ASML is well positioned to grow earnings by double digits over the long term, in lockstep with fabs expanding their manufacturing capacity to meet AI demand.
The stock is an especially attractive buy for investors who have valuation concerns about the current market, especially leading S&P 500 tech stocks. However, it's important to understand that ASML's results can swing based on its order volumes from key customers, as well as geopolitical tensions and trade policy.
Although ASML is a Dutch company, it is heavily influenced by U.S. trade actions. So, ASML's growth could stall in the near term due to factors outside of its control. Therefore, it's best to approach the stock with a long-term mindset, especially as a balanced play bridging the gap between growth and value.
In sum, ASML will benefit from higher chip demand, especially from AI. The stock may be a perfect buy for investors with exposure to other aspects of the value chain, such as the chip designers, fabs, or cloud computing plays. Adding an equipment supplier like ASML, rather than doubling down on just one part of AI, is a great way for investors to build a diversified portfolio."

Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1c653b550634bb7d8ceb095dba536160ce998ea2edf564a4f172f4a691e48929,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-attracting-investor-130003677.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-attracting-investor-130003677.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-attracting-investor-130003677.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Microsoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this software maker have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has gained 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.65 per share, indicating a change of +10.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $15.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.8%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.93 indicates a change of +16.5% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Microsoft."

The world's biggest public company Nvidia announced on Thursday that it would invest £2 billion (€2.3bn) in UK artificial intelligence start-ups.
The pledge comes as a number of other tech firms are also making promises to funnel capital into the country, notably during US President Donald Trump’s trip to the UK. The announcements have turned the nation into the centre of the AI world this week.
During Trump's state visit, the UK has secured a series of investments amounting to £150bn (€172.2bn) spread out across the UK's technology, finance and energy sectors, creating more than 7,600 jobs, according to the government.
Private equity group Blackstone pledged to spend £100bn (€114.8bn) over 10 years, and Microsoft made a £22bn (€25.25bn) commitment.
Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has been in Britain, too, attending events with the US president along with other Silicon Valley bigwigs.
Among the new initiatives announced, Nvidia has pledged to invest £11bn (€12.6bn) to help build UK AI factories by the end of 2026, with partners including CoreWeave, Microsoft and Nscale. It is also seeking to boost quantum computing in the UK.
The further £2bn the company has just pledged to spend in the country will go towards supporting the start-up ecosystem.
""The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the UK to compete in the AI market globally,"" Nvidia said.
The company also noted that scaling AI companies is currently difficult in the country due to ""limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital (VC) outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs,"" it said.
Nvidia is partnering with venture-capital investors Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court to provide capital and AI infrastructure for start-ups, researchers and developers. The focus is on hubs including London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester."

The fund just hit a 52-week high and has soared 105.9% from its 52-week low of $156.78 per share.
Are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed:
XSD in Focus
The semiconductor fund holds companies like Astera Labs (5.13%), Credo Technology (4.42%), IMPINJ Inc (3.69%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Rigetti computing. The ETF XSD charges 35 bps in fees (see: all technology ETFs here).
Why the Move?
Semiconductor space has been hot now as Trump and Britain joined forces on advancing AI, quantum computing and nuclear technologies. Microsoft, NVIDIA, other tech giants plan over $40 billion of new AI investments in the United Kingdom, as quoted on CNBC. With semiconductor being the backbone of the above-said technologies, ETFs like XSD had every reason to rally.
If this was not enough, Rigetti Computing was awarded a $5.8 million contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to advance superconducting quantum networking. NVIDIA also announced a $5 billion investment in Intel.
More Gains Ahead?
XSD might remain strong, given its positive weighted alpha of 46.62 (per barchart.com). There is definitely still some promise for investors who want to ride on this surging ETF.

This is an interesting time in tech. We saw the Nvidia Intel news.
Is this a good thing to see these tie-ups like this?
Well, there's some good in this, always. Look, the United States, as we know,
has to become a chip manufacturer. We cannot be dependent on the rest of the world for chips. Look, we came out of COVID
understanding the supply chain better than we ever did before. We understood that without chips being imported to the United States,
our economy, our manufacturing economy shut down. You literally could not buy most of the things that we want in this country, even simple things as toasters today, somehow have to have chips.
We got to connect to your phone, Gary. I need to know when my toast is done.
I I guess you have to hit your phone in bed to put the toast down in the morning so you you can do that. So, look, we now are in an economy where everything we buy has a chip in it.
We can't be beholden to the rest of the world. So, to the extent that the federal government is getting involved and encouraging chip manufacturing in the United States. And this started in the last administration with the chips Act and we continue to press on this independence of vital necessity goods in this country, I do think is a good thing.
Do you view it as the administration picking winners and losers?
I hope the administration is not picking winners and losers. It's not their job to pick winners and losers. What it is the the federal government's job is is to protect the citizens, protect our safety, protect our well-being. And we know that chips are a vital part of protecting our our our country. You know, simple missiles today have 300 plus chips in them.
So to be to be able to defend ourselves, to be able to build military equipment, we need to be in the chip manufacturing business here. So that I do applaud that we understand the risk of not having chip manufacturing in the United States.
IBM investing uh just billions of dollars in in AI and its own infrastructure. Where do you think we are in the AI CAPEX build out?
You know, look, it's it's the AI CAPEX build is pretty transparent. There's an enormous amount of money being spent in data centers. These data centers will come on
sort of over the next three to four to five years. You know, we'll continue to see more and more use of AI. What what what's going on right now is, you know, people are using AI, but they're using sort of independent software, independent programs to solve a specific AI problem.
Like an agent. Yeah.
Yeah, like an agent.
Do my payroll.
Oh, do my payroll, uh handle my HR, read my, read my documents, help me with my tax return, help me with my tax returns.
Where I believe this is going, where IBM believes this is going, this is going to an enterprise-wide solution where all of these AI programs, these in these these, um, AI facilities will work together. They'll be more coherently, more cohesively related and they'll have a big infrastructure behind that.
And look, that's going to lead us into a really interesting world as people get their data and databases in a more coherent place, and that's what it takes to make I I work. It's going to lead us into a quantum quantum revolution. We think by the end of this decade, we're going to have quantum, you know, be a major part of this equation."

It includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Meta Platforms, Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), and Nvidia.
There is an argument for investing in each of these corporations. All are leaders in their respective fields, generally deliver excellent financial results, and are led by impressive CEOs. But which one is the best option right now?
Going by average Wall Street price targets (according to Yahoo! Finance), the answer is Microsoft. The tech company price target implies an upside of 20.1% from its current levels, higher than that of its peers in the trillion-dollar club, as of this writing. Whether Microsoft is a better pick than these other companies, though, the stock looks attractive. Here's why.
The artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind
Microsoft has been firing on all cylinders, as its cloud division, Azure, is taking off. This segment has been the company's top growth driver for some time, but its momentum has accelerated thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). Based on current trends, investors can anticipate continued growth driven by cloud and AI for Microsoft in the foreseeable future. Here are three reasons why.
First, demand for AI-related services continues to surge. That's partly what's powering not just Microsoft, but several other tech leaders as well.
Second, Microsoft's cloud division has been gaining on the leader in the field, Amazon. Microsoft's established relationship with companies that use its computer operating systems and productivity tools is likely playing a role here. Microsoft also grants users access to OpenAI's large language model through Azure. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is still seen as a (perhaps the) industry standard, something that is likely pulling at least some companies toward Azure versus competing providers.
Third, in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2025, Microsoft topped $100 billion in commercial bookings for the first time in its history, with the metric increasing 37% year over year. It ended its fiscal year with a contracted backlog of $368 billion, even higher than its trailing-12-month revenue of $281.7 billion.
Microsoft's financial results during its latest period were excellent. Revenue jumped 18% year over year to $76.4 billion. Azure revenue was up 39% year over year. Operating and net income increased 23% and 24%, respectively.
Expect the tech giant to maintain that momentum -- or something close to it -- through the next 12 months at least.
Think long term
Will Microsoft match Wall Street's price target in the next year? In my view, there is a good chance that it can. However, even if it doesn't, the stock appears incredibly attractive to investors focused on the long term.
Although the company's AI and cloud businesses are booming, this is likely still the early stages of these industries' growth stories. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pointed out last year that 85% of IT spending still happens on-premises.
In other words, cloud computing hasn't taken over yet -- not even close. Microsoft is about as well-positioned as any company to benefit from this long-term tailwind.
Besides the fact that it is already a leader and is proving it can thrive despite stiff competition, Microsoft's cloud services come with high switching costs, granting it a strong competitive advantage. So, the future is bright for the company. And that's before looking at its dividend.
Also, Microsoft is one of the top dividend payers among the trillion-dollar companies. It has increased payouts by 130.6% in the past decade. Although its forward yield of 0.7% is unimpressive, the company's strong underlying business and ability to generate significant amounts of free cash flow more than compensate for that.
Lastly, Microsoft still looks reasonably valued. The company's 33 forward price-to-earnings ratio isn't significantly higher than the 29.2 average for the information technology sector.
The stock certainly deserves a premium. And at current levels, there should be plenty of upsides for Microsoft, especially for investors who hold on to the company's shares for a long time."

(BAC)strategists.
A BofA team led by Michael Hartnett studied 10 equity bubbles since the start of the previous century, finding that these periods of extreme overvaluation produced average trough-to-peak gains of 244%. That suggests that, after rising 223% from their March 2023 low, the so-called Magnificent Seven cohort has “more to go,” the strategists wrote in a note.

Current valuations also support the notion of further gains for the group, the strategists said. Past stock bubbles typically ended with trailing price-to-earnings ratios of 58, with the benchmark of these stocks 29% above its 200-day moving average.
The seven — Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) — have a trailing P/E ratio of 39 and are still only 20% above their 200-day DMA. This renders them the “best bubble proxy today,” Hartnett and his team wrote.
Appetite among investors for US tech megacaps has driven stocks to all-time highs this year and shows no signs of abating. The Magnificent Seven group recovered swiftly from the shocks caused by the Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek and the turmoil around Trump Administration trade-tariff announcements.
The S&P 500 Info Tech Index has surged 56% from its low in April, with investors buying into every dip along the way.
A positive macro-economic backdrop, the sustained frenzy around AI, along with expectations of further Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts are acting as tailwinds for the sector. In fact, the BofA fund manager survey released this week showed that “Long Magnificent Seven” was regarded as the most crowded trade for the second month running by 42% of respondents.
Hartnett and his team noted that bubbles tend to be short and very concentrated. Back in 2000, as internet-related stocks rallied to extreme levels, the tech sector rose 61% in six months to its peak, while every other S&P 500 sector was down that year.
Meanwhile, investors should also “barbell” their exposure to the Big Tech bubble with some holdings in “distressed value,” as these spurts of hyper-valuation boost economic growth as they unfold. Hartnett said current potential examples of such plays included Brazil, the UK and global energy stocks."

We're still in the early innings of this exciting technology, but most companies agree that 2030 will be a turning point in this space. However, waiting until 2030 to start investing in this field after the winners are established is a mistake. Many of these companies will likely have dramatically increased in value by then, causing investors to lose out on massive returns.
By investing today, it's possible to pick some of the winners in this space before they've become too large to provide substantial returns. I've identified four options that appear to be excellent investments in quantum computing, ranging from startups to established big tech players. By staying balanced in this opportunity, investors can capitalize on the trend while ensuring positive returns.
Pure plays: IonQ and D-Wave Quantum
The stocks that most investors consider in reference to the quantum computing arms race are pure-play investments, such as IonQ (IONQ -5.85%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 3.99%). These companies are startups that have no other goal besides developing commercially viable quantum computing technologies, and their upside could be immense if they achieve their goals.
IonQ and D-Wave only have market caps of $16.5 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. This makes them relatively small companies in general, although they could grow to be monsters if their technology becomes widespread.
The primary reason I prefer these two over many of the other quantum computing pure plays is their approach to quantum computing. The most popular quantum computing technique is superconducting, which involves cooling a particle to near absolute zero to utilize its quantum mechanics to perform calculations. This is an incredibly cost-intensive process, and may be cost-prohibitive in deploying quantum computing at scale, especially in the early years.
IonQ doesn't use this approach; its quantum computing technology is known as trapped ion. This provides several key advantages, namely cost (because it doesn't require cooling a particle to absolute zero, it can be done at room temperature) and accuracy. IonQ holds world records in quantum computing accuracy and with the largest concern surrounding quantum computing being how accurate it is, I think IonQ's technology could be a popular pick.
D-Wave isn't taking the same approach as many companies. Instead of creating a general-purpose quantum computer, it's developing a quantum annealing platform. This approach cannot be applied to every quantum computing application, but it excels at optimization problems, which can be solved by finding the lowest energy state in a system. D-Wave's technology will be useful in determining logistics networks and statistical models, which represent a large chunk of quantum computing use cases. D-Wave doesn't have to capture the entire market; it just needs to secure enough business to make it viable.
Both of these two stocks are high-risk, high-reward investments, and balancing them out with more established players is a smart idea.
Legacy tech companies: Microsoft and Alphabet
Both Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) and Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) are developing quantum computing technologies in-house for their cloud computing divisions. Currently, Alphabet and Microsoft are paying a substantial premium to their current primary computing hardware supplier, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). If they can develop a viable quantum computing option for these platforms in-house and not have to purchase them from a third party like IonQ or D-Wave, they will save a ton of money and become more profitable.
This makes quantum computing a highly lucrative field to invest in, and both companies have already announced significant breakthroughs in the realm of quantum computing. Furthermore, these two companies have nearly unlimited resources to deploy compared to IonQ and D-Wave, and it may become too cost-intensive for them to compete against Microsoft and Alphabet in the long run.
However, David versus Goliath stories exist for a reason, and IonQ and D-Wave may ultimately prevail against their larger competitors, but there's no way to know that right now.
By purchasing all four of these stocks, investors are taking a balanced approach to the quantum computing investment trend. This gives them the upside of pure plays like IonQ and D-Wave, while also investing in established players like Microsoft and Alphabet, which continue to benefit from the ongoing AI arms race. I believe this cohort has a great chance to outperform the market, and if IonQ or D-Wave achieves significant success, this group could crush the broader market."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-19T09:55:00,3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now,"Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all riding the AI wave.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=492af7f12bffcc8a8f2842ef3667be3e5e9a6b0585ed0ff6f93d21b1d94cad2e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/top-artificial-intelligence-stocks-buy-right-now/,fool.com,200,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is in full swing, and there are no signs of it letting up. With the technology looking to be a game-changer that could reshape the world we are living in, it is a place you want to be invested.
Let's look at three top AI stocks to buy right now.
1. Nvidia
No company has captured the AI infrastructure wave like Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). Its graphics processing units (GPUs) went from powering video games to becoming the must-have hardware for training AI models, and it hasn't let go of that lead.
The company built a deep moat with CUDA, as most code for optimizing GPUs was written using its proprietary software platform. Switching off CUDA would mean rewriting code and retraining engineers, which is why Nvidia controls over 90% of the AI GPU market.
Nvidia also smartly moved early into networking. Its NVLink technology lets its GPUs work together as a single system, which is critical for running AI workloads. Its acquisition of Mellanox, meanwhile, gave Nvidia a major presence in data center networking. Last quarter, its networking revenue nearly doubled to $7.3 billion.
Nvidia sees the AI infrastructure market growing to be between $3 trillion to $4 trillion in the next several years from around $600 billion today. With AI infrastructure spending still booming, Nvidia looks well-positioned to continue to be one of AI's biggest winners.
2. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) has quickly turned what was seen as a threat into a growth driver. A year ago, many investors thought AI would cannibalize Google Search, but search revenue growth has actually picked up. Features like AI Overviews, Lens, and Circle to Search are driving more queries, and many of those have commercial intent, which feed into Alphabet's massive ad network. The recent federal court decision letting Alphabet keep not only Android and Chrome, but also the key parts of its Apple search deal intact, was another big win, preserving its distribution advantage.
AI is also giving Alphabet's cloud computing business a boost. Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% last quarter and profits more than doubled, with demand for AI infrastructure leading the way. Alphabet is one of the few players with a fully integrated AI stack. It not only owns the infrastructure, but it also has one of the top AI models in Gemini and its own custom AI chips. The company's impending acquisition of fast-growing cloud computing security company Wiz only further fortifies its cloud offering.
In addition to search and cloud computing, Alphabet has other bets that could pay off in the future. At the top of this list is its Waymo robotaxi business, which is expanding quickly around the country. The company needs to lower the costs of its vehicles and gain scale, but this is another big potential long-term growth driver. The company is also investing in quantum computing, having made strong progress in reducing error rates with its Willow chip. Quantum computing is years away from being commercialized, but it could be another big opportunity.
Between its strong, growing core business and the potential of its emerging bets, Alphabet is a stock to own for the long haul.
3. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) moved quickly to make AI a core part of its strategy, starting with its big investment in OpenAI. That deal gave it early access to OpenAI's most advanced large language models (LLMs) and allowed it to roll out AI assistant copilots across its productivity suite. Those copilots are now gaining traction with enterprise customers.
The even bigger driver has been with its cloud business, as customers have flocked to Azure to gain access to OpenAI's models. This growth was still going strong last quarter, with Azure revenue jumping 39%. Revenue could have been even higher if not for capacity constraints. Microsoft is ramping up capital spending to add GPUs and servers directly tied to AI workloads, which should support continued growth.
Microsoft and OpenAI recently announced that they have come to an agreement to change their relationship to allow OpenAI to restructure into a for-profit company. While terms were not disclosed, it should allow Microsoft to gain preferred access to OpenAI's technology and share in its revenue growth.
Microsoft was firing on all cylinders last quarter, with strong growth across its segments, driven by AI. Given its leadership in workforce productivity tools and cloud computing, the stock looks like it will be a long-term AI winner."

finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-19T08:07:00,"Did Nvidia Just Help Amazon, Microsoft, and Google at CoreWeave's Expense?",Nvidia's decisions can have huge ripple effects through the AI world. But probably not this time.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c1446191a5f0ef1cd75cd1bb048419e4260edc2564ba00049c5bf329249d154e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/nvidia-amazon-microsoft-google-coreweave/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) enjoys great relationships with some of the biggest tech companies on the planet. Its customer base includes the three largest cloud service providers: Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%).
However, Nvidia's reach isn't limited to the biggest of the big. It also works closely with many rising stars. CoreWeave (CRWV 3.86%) is arguably the most prominent example, especially considering that Nvidia has a multibillion-dollar stake in the AI-focused hyperscaler.
It stands to reason that Nvidia wants all these partners to succeed. But did the GPU giant just help Amazon, Microsoft, and Google at CoreWeave's expense?
Nvidia's retreat
Nvidia launched DGX Cloud in 2023. The company billed the new platform as a way for enterprises to get immediate access to Nvidia's AI supercomputers so they could train generative AI and other advanced AI models.
But Nvidia appears to be retreating from this market. The Information, a website that focuses on technology industry news, recently reported that Nvidia is primarily using DGX Cloud for internal use now instead of marketing the platform to customers.
Is there other evidence that supports the view that Nvidia is shifting its strategy? Maybe. In the past, Nvidia highlighted its DGX Cloud services when discussing cloud spending commitments in its quarterly 10-Q filings. In the company's update for the second quarter of 2025, though, DGX Cloud wasn't mentioned in this context.
Instead of marketing the DGX Cloud platform to customers, Nvidia appears to be focusing now on its Lepton GPU rental marketplace. CEO Jensen Huang explained in the May 2025 announcement of Lepton that the new service ""connects our network of global GPU cloud providers with AI developers.""
Helping the ""big three,"" hurting CoreWeave?
Some industry observers saw DGX Cloud as a move for Nvidia to compete against the major cloud service providers. But Nvidia rented GPUs from CoreWeave to use with DGX Cloud. Could the company's reported move to back away from marketing DGX Cloud help Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud while hurting CoreWeave? The short answer is ""no.""
For one thing, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud host DGX Cloud. Although AWS didn't, there's no solid proof that Nvidia's cloud platform hurt its business.
A retreat from DGX Cloud wouldn't hurt CoreWeave, either. CoreWeave recently disclosed that Nvidia will purchase $6.3 billion of its unused cloud computing capacity through April 13, 2032.
Perhaps most importantly, though, Nvidia might not be retreating from DGX Cloud as reported by The Information after all. According to Data Center Dynamics, Alexis Bjorlin, who is Nvidia's vice president and general manager for DGX Cloud, said, ""DGX Cloud is fully utilized and oversubscribed, and we are expanding its scale.""
Winners all around
Whatever Nvidia's strategy with DGX Cloud is, I don't think CoreWeave has anything to worry about. My view is that all of these stocks -- Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and CoreWeave -- are poised to be big winners over the long run.
The AI boom doesn't appear to be slowing down. That's great news for Nvidia because more of its GPUs will be needed. It's great news for Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and CoreWeave because their cloud platforms will continue to enjoy tremendous demand.
It's possible that the momentum could even accelerate. I think Nvidia's technological advances will play a key role, if so. For example, the company plans to launch Rubin CPX, a new class of GPUs built for massive-context inference, in late 2026. This new technology could pave the way for an explosion in the use of AI in software development and long-form video creation.
As the smallest of the group, CoreWeave might have the most room to run. However, I expect all five of these top AI stocks will deliver tremendous gains over the next 10 years and beyond."

""The United States, as we know, has to become a chip manufacturer,"" Cohn, who served as director of the National Economic Council during President Trump's first term, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. ""We cannot be dependent on the rest of the world for chips.""
His remarks come after Nvidia (NVDA) said it would take a $5 billion stake in Intel (INTC) this week. As part of the investment, the two tech giants will co-develop chips for PCs and data centers. The tie-up also makes Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, potentially giving Intel the lift it needs as it falls behind in the global chip race.
Currently, Intel is America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer. In late August, the federal government agreed to invest $8.9 billion in the company in exchange for a 9.9% stake.
Cohn, now IBM (IBM) vice chairman, described the Nvidia-Intel deal as having ""some good,"" noting that it highlights a larger push to bolster domestic chip production.
He pointed to lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We understood that without chips being imported to the United States, our economy, our manufacturing economy [would] shut down,"" he said.
He added that the federal government encouraging domestic chip manufacturing is a ""good thing,"" referencing the CHIPS Act, which was signed in 2022 during the Biden administration.
Still, Cohn stressed the government's role isn't to pick winners and losers, but to protect national security and the economy. ""To be able to defend ourselves, to be able to build military equipment, we need to be in the chip manufacturing business here,"" he said.
Even so, the comments come amid a $42 billion US-UK tech agreement dubbed the ""Tech Prosperity Deal,"" a major catalyst for AI chip demand in the UK. Big Tech players like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Google (GOOG), and OpenAI (OPAI) are part of the investment.
More broadly, Cohn highlighted the long-term infrastructure investments required for AI, particularly new data centers, which he estimates will come online in three to five years.
He is bullish on AI's potential, expecting it to expand beyond the software used today. He cited AI agents as an example of tools that currently ""solve a specific AI problem.""
IBM is also betting that the next decade will push beyond AI into quantum computing. ""Where I believe this is going, where IBM believes is going ... to an enterprise-wide solution where all of these AI programs … will work together. They'll be more coherently, more cohesively related, and they'll have a big infrastructure behind that,"" he said."

""This is a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Thursday. Intel stock soared more than 25% after the market open Thursday.
In an unusual move, the Trump administration took a 10% stake in Intel in August with a roughly $9 billion investment, and Japanese investment holding company SoftBank Group (SFTBY) made its own $2 billion investment last month.
Still, the Nvidia-Intel deal would not bolster Intel's ailing manufacturing business as it looks to bring on outside customers, noted Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.
Intel designs chips for data centers and personal computers, and while it has always manufactured its own semiconductors, the company opened up that manufacturing business to outside customers in 2021 under former CEO Pat Gelsinger. Intel has aimed to both compete with Nvidia's AI chips in its design segment and draw in customers such as Nvidia in its manufacturing business — but both efforts have fallen short.
Intel recently said it would only pursue the development of its new 14A manufacturing process, which would be used to develop cutting-edge chips, if it can bring in such customers.
""But frankly Intel can use the help on the product business just as much given share position in key markets has been bleeding,"" Rasgon said in a note Thursday.

Nuclear power could be a $10 trillion market opportunity
Nuclear energy represents a $10 trillion potential market opportunity that could hold ""the answer to the world's power shortages,"" according to a new report from Bank of America.
Rising demand, combined with strong support from the Trump administration and a public narrative turning positive after years of a dour outlook on the sector, has given a share price boost to companies operating throughout the nuclear sector supply chain in 2025.
""In many ways,"" Bank of America analysts wrote, ""nuclear energy has been 'rediscovered' amid surging electricity demand ignited by the rise of AI/data centers, building electrification, industrial growth, and EVs.""
According to Bank of America, the answer to meeting this demand amid a ""rediscovery"" of nuclear's potential benefits may lie in what the bank calls ""one of the most consequential energy technologies for the next 25 years"": small modular reactors, or SMRs.
Shares in [providers] NuScale (SMR) and Oklo (OKLO) are up more than 100% and more than 350% since the beginning of the year, respectively.
Nvidia bets big on Intel, sending its stock soaring

Appearing before reporters Thursday at the close of Trump’s two-day trip, the US president still seemed dazzled by the previous day’s events at Windsor Castle, calling it a “spectacular honor” and describing King Charles III and Queen Camilla as “amazing people.”
It was exactly the kind of response UK officials had been hoping for, and Starmer played on the sentiment by repeatedly stressing the “unique bond” between the nations forged through historic ties that made them “first partners.”
Coming after Wednesday’s pomp and celebration, the diplomatic sessions at the prime minister’s country residence, Chequers, were seen as more risky for the UK and for Starmer, with potential clashes over Gaza, Russia’s war on Ukraine, plus trade and the dismissal of Peter Mandelson as the UK ambassador to Washington over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.
To be sure, there was little sign of significant shifts in the president’s stances on issues including trade and Ukraine where Starmer had hoped to make progress. But in their comments to reporters, the two leaders stressed their common ground along with big-ticket investments in tech and energy, while skirting over the areas where they diverged.
“Let’s be clear, this relationship is not just about history, it’s about the future,” Starmer said at a joint press conference capping the visit.
Trump echoed that sentiment as he spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One after departing London, brushing off questions about disagreements with Starmer by saying he saw the prime minister as a “nice man.”
“I guess I disagree with him on two things, immigration, which is very rough in the UK, very rough, and energy,” Trump said, before adding that despite the differences, he thought Starmer was “a really nice person.”
A UK official expressed relief that Starmer had got through it without any major controversy over Mandelson and Epstein. Despite fears that those topics might dominate, they were barely mentioned at all. Trump neatly side-stepped a question about Mandelson and showed little interest in engaging with any of the more awkward questions such as on Christianity in Britain and freedom of speech."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-18T17:45:01,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Microsoft (MSFT),Microsoft (MSFT) could produce exceptional returns because of its solid growth attributes.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7af6ab638d1539f896491aa335eb52775432b6195681083102681b9847e1351a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-growth-investors-love-164501875.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-growth-investors-love-164501875.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-growth-investors-love-164501875.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.
That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.
However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Microsoft (MSFT) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this software maker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Microsoft is 15.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 12.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12%.
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Microsoft is 23.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.9%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 19% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.5%."

Part of the plan entails leveraging artificial intelligence to enable personalized travel planning as part of the connected trip vision. The company is also exploring strategic collaborations with tech giants such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft as it seeks to develop advanced artificial intelligence tools. Additionally, it is enhancing investments in AI to improve customer service, product development, and marketing.
AI integration is a key step as Booking Holdings continues to capitalize on alternative bookings by combining traditional and alternative accommodations on a single platform and presenting them to consumers.
“We continue to grow. Again, it’s now a really sizable number of listings. We have 8.4 million listings at the end of the second quarter globally in alternative accommodations only. That grew 8% year over year. We’re very much focused on continuing to drive that growth,” said CFO Ewout Steenbergen.
Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a global online travel services provider that helps people book accommodations, flights, car rentals, and other travel experiences through its family of brands like Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, and KAYAK.

Before fintech darling Ramp was launching multimillion-dollar Super Bowl ads, disrupting time-consuming expense reports, and notching $1 billion in annualized revenue, cofounder Eric Glyman was seeking out tech’s most battled-tested CEOs for some sage business advice.
At Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference last week, the 35-year-old entrepreneur shared that instead of turning to executive coaches for wisdom, he prefers candid one-on-one conversations with fellow entrepreneurs.
“I try to kind of go and call people up for an hour at a time,” he told Fortune Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell on-stage during a live recording of the Fortune 500: Titans and Disruptors of Industry podcast. “If I can just get their advice on AI or marketing or sales, learn just a little bit, ask them who they’ve learned a lot from in particular fields and just kind of jump from person to person, that’s been very helpful.”
Founded in 2019, Ramp now boasts a $22.5 billion valuation thanks to multiple funding rounds this summer, plus a roster of over 45,000 customers. Under its hyperspeed strategy, Ramp accounts for about 1.5% of the $2 trillion corporate and small-business credit card market in the United States, as Fortune’s Leo Schwartz reported in the latest magazine issue.
Key mentors
Two leaders in particular, Glyman said, have served as trusted guides for his six-year-old company: Fidji Simo, the French tech executive who now runs OpenAI’s consumer applications business, and Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s longtime chief executive.
Offstage, Glyman credited Simo as an “incredible entrepreneur,” noting her stewardship of Instacart’s long-awaited IPO in 2023, and praising her new role as the first-ever CEO of Applications at OpenAI, reporting directly to Sam Altman.
“I just think that her ability to go and get the best out of people, to understand people’s capabilities, to teach them and understand what are their spikes and help make their spikes sharper—I think that’s extraordinary,” Glyman said, adding that he believes Simo is “very underrated.”
In 2023, Ramp announced Simo as an individual investor and advisor, along with other AI leaders including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, and Stanford AI Lab professor Chris Re.
“They truly earned every bit of their success through profound customer obsession,” Simo later shared in a 2024 post on X marking Ramp’s anniversary.
Glyman described Nadella as an “exceptional leader,” praising both his Wall Street successes and his management style during his decade at the helm of Microsoft."

Among the frequently compared names are C3.ai, Inc. (AI), a company specializing in enterprise AI solutions, and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), a global powerhouse that embeds AI across its cloud, productivity and software ecosystem.
For investors, the question is not just about growth potential, it is about stability, scalability and which company offers a safer long-term bet in an industry evolving at lightning speed.
The Case For AI
C3.ai has carved out a unique position in the enterprise AI market with its Agentic AI platform and more than 130 ready-to-use applications tailored for industries like manufacturing, defense, and energy. These offerings are not just theoretical; they are being put into practice by major customers such as Nucor, Qemetica and the U.S. Army, proving the technology can deliver real operational value.
The company also highlights that much of its business is now partner-led, with about 90% of recent deals coming through heavyweights like Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud. This broad partner network gives C3.ai access to large distribution channels without needing to scale its direct sales force as aggressively.
Another strength is the development of the Strategic Integrator Program, which allows system integrators and partners to build their solutions on C3.ai’s platform. This approach may expand adoption at much lower costs to C3.ai, turning its technology into the backbone for multiple industries.
Even with recent challenges, the company maintains a solid financial cushion, holding more than $700 million in cash and equivalents. That liquidity provides a runway to fix sales execution issues, invest in growth and weather the transition toward larger-scale deployments and subscriptions.
Despite the long-term promise, the near-term picture shows real risks. C3.ai’s revenues fell nearly 19% year over year in the latest quarter, marking its first miss since going public. Management acknowledged the shortfall was mainly due to weak sales execution and organizational disruption, particularly after leadership changes and CEO Tom Siebel’s reduced involvement. While steps are being taken to reset the sales organization, execution risk remains high until the company demonstrates that it can consistently close and convert large deals.
Financial performance also raises concerns. The gross margin dropped to 52% as more deals came from initial production deployments, which are costlier to support. Meanwhile, the company posted a non-GAAP operating loss of nearly $58 million and burned more than $30 million in free cash flow."

Shares of online learning platform Udemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) jumped 2.6% in the morning session after the company released a report highlighting a surge in demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) skills on its platform, which happened during a broader market rally fueled by a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
The central bank trimmed rates by 25 basis points, boosting investor optimism and lifting stocks, particularly in the technology sector. Adding to this positive market mood, Udemy published its ""2026 Global Learning & Skills Trends Report."" The report revealed a massive appetite for AI knowledge, showing 11 million enrollments in generative AI courses to date.
Specifically, consumption of Microsoft Copilot content soared by 3,400% year-over-year, while GitHub CoPilot content saw an incredible 13,534% increase. These figures suggested strong demand for Udemy's offerings and positioned the company as a key player in corporate upskilling for the AI era.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $7.42, up 3.4% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Udemy’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 5.9% on the news that the company announced its Board of Directors approved a $50 million share repurchase program. The program, which is effective immediately, authorizes the company to buy back its own common stock. Share repurchase programs are often viewed positively by investors as they can reduce the number of shares outstanding, potentially boosting earnings per share. Furthermore, such a move typically signals that the company's management believes the stock is undervalued and has strong conviction in its future growth prospects. According to the press release, the board's decision reflects a ""strong conviction in Udemy's ability to capture this significant growth opportunity while delivering returns to our shareholders."".
Udemy is down 9.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $7.42 per share, it is trading 26.5% below its 52-week high of $10.10 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Udemy’s shares at the IPO in October 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $269.99.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

SOUN is placing strong emphasis on the agentic AI platform, Amelia 7, as it looks to strengthen presence across enterprise markets. The platform combines autonomous workflows with precise controls, designed to improve customer service, employee interactions and operational tasks. By offering low-code and no-code options, Amelia 7 allows enterprises to build and refine AI agents quickly, thereby reducing complexity in adoption.
In the second quarter of 2025, the company began migrating 15 large enterprise customers to Amelia 7. Early adoption reflects demand for solutions that enhance efficiency and reduce costs, while creating new upsell opportunities. The integration of SoundHound’s proprietary Polaris speech recognition engine into Amelia 7 improves speed and accuracy, which is already supporting renewals and expansions across industries.
The company has highlighted strong traction within sectors such as financial services and healthcare, where existing customers are expanding into new use cases. By embedding agentic AI into its product mix, SoundHound is positioning Amelia 7 as a driver of deeper customer relationships and broader market penetration.
The rise of agentic AI across enterprises indicates a structural shift in how organizations engage with automation. For SoundHound, the question is whether Amelia 7 can scale adoption quickly enough to sustain revenue momentum and support the path toward profitability. With rising interest in AI-driven efficiency, Amelia 7 could become a key catalyst for enterprise growth in the coming quarters.
Competitors in the Agentic AI Enterprise Adoption Push
SoundHound’s agentic AI push for enterprise adoption comes up against strong rivals like Palantir Technologies PLTR and Microsoft Corporation MSFT.
Palantir is doubling down on its Foundry platform, offering governments and large enterprises scalable AI solutions that directly compete with SoundHound’s ambitions. Another significant competitor is Microsoft, which is embedding generative and agentic AI into its Azure ecosystem and enterprise products. By integrating AI into Azure and Microsoft 365, the company is lowering adoption barriers and encouraging large-scale enterprise deployments.
Both Palantir and Microsoft are focusing on solving the same adoption hurdles SoundHound emphasizes — security, scalability and accuracy. With Palantir entrenched in government and defense, and Microsoft leveraging the broad enterprise footprint, SoundHound must prove its agentic AI platform can stand apart and convert pilots into long-term, enterprise-wide adoption."

The 16-month-old British startup is part of a new generation of “neocloud” firms that run and lease capacity in data centers specially designed for AI and other data-intensive workloads, often filled with advanced chips known as graphics processing units. They’re raking in considerable sums from investors and creditors to build these centers despite being relative newcomers with limited experience. Their arrival underscores how desperate Silicon Valley titans and governments have become to get their hands on more AI computing capacity.
It’s a high-stakes business. Nscale is now on the hook for securing the Nvidia GPUs that dominate the AI industry, finding the land for its facilities and sourcing the vast volumes of electricity necessary to power their centers. It’ll also be expected to regularly replace worn-out or older-generation hardware to meet customers’ demand for the latest and greatest products, which may require financing every three to five years.
Nscale posted a video on LinkedIn of its CEO Josh Payne meeting Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
Nscale CEO Josh Payne framed the company’s UK announcements this week — part of £31 billion in US investment pledges made around President Donald Trump’s visit to the country — as a victory for British tech. “As a UK-based company, we’re showing how we can be makers, not takers, of the most important technology of our time,” he said in a statement.
“I’ve never seen a startup take off like that before,” Nvidia’s Huang said in a video posted to LinkedIn, in which he signs a bottle of whisky to congratulate Payne.
Nscale was spun out of Arkon Energy, an infrastructure provider for cryptocurrency mining, and officially launched in May 2024. CoreWeave Inc., which similarly counts Microsoft and OpenAI among its partners, also has its roots in crypto, giving it experience building high-performance data centers. Nebius Group NV, a Dutch cloud computing infrastructure company that emerged from the Russian internet giant Yandex, signed a deal this month to provide Microsoft with AI capacity for as much as $19.4 billion."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft on Thursday said it plans to build a second massive artificial intelligence data center in Wisconsin, bringing its spending in the state to more than $7 billion.
The new $4 billion project will join a $3.3 billion data center in Mount Pleasant in the southeastern corner of the state, announced last year.
Microsoft said the initial data center remains on track to open next year and will employ about 500 people at its peak, expanding to about 800 once the second data center is complete.
It said with the addition of the second large-scale data center, the site would eventually house the world's most powerful AI supercomputer, connecting together hundreds of thousands of powerful chips from Nvidia.
The area in Racine County, which sits nestled between Milwaukee and Chicago, has drawn the attention of U.S. presidents of both political parties in recent years.
It was initially the site of a proposed $10 billion factory by electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which builds phones for Apple and others, during the first term of President Donald Trump, but those plans were drastically scaled back.
At Microsoft's unveiling of the first data center last year, U.S. President Joe Biden, then running against Trump for a second time, highlighted Foxconn's pullback at the site.
Microsoft said on Thursday that it plans to pre-pay for electrical infrastructure to avoid raising electricity rates in the region and that a state-of-the-art cooling system will tap into Wisconsin's cool climate and reduce the data center's yearly water use to that of an average restaurant.
The company plans to build solar power in a different part of Wisconsin to offset its energy use at the data centers, but Microsoft President Brad Smith said the project will entail new fossil fuel power generation near the facilities.
The driving factor was ""what can be built in a particular area,"" Smith said in an interview. ""This is (liquefied natural gas) territory.""
He said that the 800 permanent jobs the data centers create will be fewer than the thousands of jobs required to construct them but that there will still be jobs for skilled pipefitters and electricians.
""All the things that we build need to be operated,"" Smith told Reuters. ""It needs to be maintained. These are good jobs.""

- Microsoft plans to spend $4 billion to build a second data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin.
- The new facility will be part of a distributed training supercomputer for Microsoft's artificial intelligence services.
- This brings Microsoft's total spending in the Racine County complex to approximately $7.3 billion.
- Environmental groups have raised concerns and filed a lawsuit over the data centers' electricity and water usage.
Microsoft plans to spend $4 billion to build a second data center in Mount Pleasant that it says will be the most advanced AI center in the world.
The new project includes construction of the facility and technology infrastructure, according to a company announcement on Sept. 18.
The latest announcement brings the cost of Microsoft's Racine County developments to about $7.3 billion, including the $3.3 billion commitment the company made in 2024.
At the time of the initial Microsoft announcement in May 2024, which included a visit from President Joe Biden, the Journal Sentinel reported that the company's Racine County spending could easily exceed $10 billion, given the huge parcel of land it controls there.
Much of the work is taking place on land previously acquired by the Foxconn Technology Group for a high-tech manufacturing complex that was touted by state and federal officials, including President Donald Trump, as transformational for the state's economy.
While the Foxconn project failed to live up to its original promises, the infrastructure work to bring utilities to the area helped Microsoft choose the property for this development.
The second Microsoft data center is planning to house part of what the company calls a distributed training super computer. Microsoft said the facility will be the most advanced AI data center in the world.
Brad Smith, Microsoft president and vice chair, said when the first data center opens, the facility plans to house hundreds of thousands of the world’s most powerful NVIDIA graphic processing units which will be critical for the company's AI development and one of the most unique pieces of technology in the world.
“The data center that you’ve seen rising up in Mount Pleasant goes live early next year and it will house what is literally, the most powerful super computer on planet Earth,” Smith told an audience at Festival Hall in Racine. “In fact that building will have the super computer that is 10 times more powerful than any super computer anywhere in the world.”
The company plans to build the second largest ""chiller,"" which is used to cool the technology used in the facility, in the world. The largest chiller is in Qatar, Smith said.
But beyond the constrution and operation of the facility, Smith said the company is helping create a ""data center academy"" at Gateway Technical College and its partnerships with University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Titletown Tech will be critical to training workers and partnering with area small businesses.
Microsoft says the Racine County data center would be the first of several facilities, located in multiple states, in the company's latest initiative to compete with other technology companies like Facebook's parent company Meta on artificial intelligence.
Construction of first Racine County data center nearly done
Microsoft is finishing construction on its first Racine County data center, which is to be completed in early 2026. The company says it will hire more than 400 employees to work at the first data center and once the second data center is open, the total number of employees plans to be nearly 800 for both facilities.
Construction for the second data center plans to be finished by the end of 2028. Thousands of construction jobs are planned to be related to the completion of the data center, the company said.
Gov. Tony Evers said the Microsoft investment is “making Wisconsin home of the most powerful data center in the world.”
“We’ve seen the benefits for Wisconsin workers with tens of thousands of construction workers and skilled labors participating in this project,” Evers said. “This project is creating good family sustaining union jobs across the entire region from carpenters, plumbers and electricians.""
Evers said innovation is part of the state's tradition and the new AI frontier has been used in different areas like advanced manufacturing, biohealth and personalized medicine.
“That puts Wisconsin on the very cutting edge of AI power, not just in the United States, but across the world,” Evers said. ""Thanks to Microsoft's partnerships, the new Innovation Lab at UW-Milwaukee hundreds of small and lean-in-size business owners are learning how to use AI.""
Microsoft development watched closely by environmental groups
Data centers require massive amounts of electricity and water. Those demands have stirred international concerns, and Wisconsin environmental groups have raised questions about plans from Microsoft and other companies in the Badger State.
On Sept. 15, Midwest Environmental Advocates, on behalf of Milwaukee Riverkeepers, filed a lawsuit against the city of Racine, which provides water to Mount Pleasant, for documents related to the Microsoft development.
On Sept. 16, the city of Racine released a document showing that the first Microsoft data center would use 234,000 gallons of Lake Michigan water per day and discharge back into Lake Michigan 81,000 gallons per day in 2026.
The document also stated the rest of the expansion could use up to 2,814,000 gallons of water per year with wastewater discharge of 2,031,000.
Smith says Microsoft plans to minimize water use
Smith addressed the water concerns saying, ""Lake Michigan has nothing to fear from our data center"" and added the company has built data centers in places like Phoenix, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
""We build data centers in the desert, that's because we've figured out how to run them without using a lot of water,"" Smith said adding the company has developed at ""closed-loop cooling system.""
The chiller plans to take hot water through a series of pipes, stretching more than 60 miles, and use giant fans, which are 20 feet in diameter, to cool the hot water and then is piped back into the facility.
Smith said more than 90% of the facility is going to rely on the system that's circulated continously and the remaining portion will use outside air for cooling and switching to water on days when it's above 85 degrees.
Smith said the data center has enough fiber cable to circle the Earth four times, and also have a modest annual water use requiring roughly the amount of water a typical restaurant uses annually or ""what an 18-hole golf course consumes weekly in peak summer.""
Separate from the lawsuit, Clean Wisconsin conducted an analysis of the power used by data centers in Mount Pleasant and Port Washington stating the facilities could use more electricity than all the houses in Wisconsin.
The first data center uses about 450 megawatts. Microsoft and We Energies have proposed a special rate specific for data centers to minimize impact on local residents.
Smith said Microsoft is ""pre-paying for the energy and electrical infrastructure that we’ll use—ensuring prices remain stable and protecting consumers from future cost increases because of our data center.""
""We will match every kilowatt hour we consume that comes from a fossil fuel source one for one with carbon-free energy we put back onto the grid,"" Smith said. ""This includes a new 250 (megawatt) solar project in Portage County that is under construction to support this commitment. And our partnership with WE Energies ensures we will continually explore and add energy transmission, generation, and usage—under transparent tariffs that support grid reliability.""

NBIS reaffirmed the $2 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025 on its latest earnings call as it doubles down on capacity expansion to gain market share in the fast-growing AI infrastructure space. The demand for AI infrastructure has exploded in 2025, fueled by the increasing usage of generative AI, machine learning and high-performance computing applications. On its last earnings call, Nebius called the AI infrastructure boom a ""once-in-a-generation"" opportunity.
NBIS is already experiencing hypergrowth with revenues surging 625% year over year to $105.1 million. AI cloud infrastructure revenues grew more than nine times year over year, driven by demand for copper GPUs and near-peak GPU utilization. Explosive revenue growth demonstrates NBIS’ ability to capture demand in a rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. With the new Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and its data center capacity expanding significantly in parallel, the company expects a substantial increase in sales by year-end.
To meet demand, it plans to secure 220 megawatts of connected power (active or ready for GPU deployment). This also includes data centers in New Jersey and Finland. The company is also finalizing two new large-scale greenfield sites in the United States. NBIS plans to build out more than 1 gigawatt of power capacity by 2026, setting the stage for sustained growth into the AI compute boom.
Moreover, it recently closed a deal with Microsoft MSFT for $17.4 billion, which involves NBIS providing dedicated GPU capacity to the latter from the new data center in Vineland, NJ, beginning later this year through 2031. Microsoft could also purchase extra services or capacity as per the terms of the deal, which would raise the total value to around $19.4 billion. NBIS added that cash flow from this deal will be utilized to finance part of the capex associated with the same.
Recent MSFT deal, combined with the AI compute boom, necessitates massive capex to meet demand. On its last earnings call, management pointed to significant cash on hand and an opportunistic approach to raising capital.
After raising $4 billion (highlighted on the last earnings call), NBIS recently announced the closing of its public offering of Class A ordinary shares and private offering of convertible senior notes, which have gross proceeds of nearly $4.2 billion as of Sept. 15, 2025, to fund capex associated with delivering AI infrastructure to Microsoft. In addition to the MSFT deal, it plans to use some of the proceeds from financing to accelerate business growth, including the purchase of additional computing power and hardware, and well-located land plots for expansion of its data center footprint and for general corporate purposes."

The AI neocloud company announced a huge deal with tech giant Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), and its shares soared nearly 50% the next day.
That was great news for Nebius shareholders, but investors who hadn't gotten involved beforehand might wonder if, after that monster move, it's too late to jump into the stock. I think not, because there's one compelling reason to believe that there are more gains to come.
Building data center capacity to meet demand
Nebius provides advanced cloud computing services designed for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. That a hyperscale cloud provider like Microsoft would desire Nebius' data center AI infrastructure capacity should be eye-opening for investors. The deal is worth up to $19.4 billion, which is more than Nebius' total market cap was at the time of the announcement. It shows how much demand there is for the AI infrastructure Nebius provides.
With demand so far outpacing supply, Nebius Group should be announcing more deals like this. Proof of that demand is the reason investors should look into buying Nebius shares. Just this week, it was revealed that Nvidia has placed a $6.3 billion order with cloud AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave.
That came on the heels of news that tech giant Oracle expects its cloud infrastructure revenue to soar eightfold over the next four years. Oracle also said it signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in its most recent fiscal quarter.
That type of activity and spending should continue. And it's the reason that Nebius stock still looks attractive even after its recent move higher."

Partnership integrates Viridi's fail-safe, American-made battery systems into Schneider Electric's Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative, unlocking safer, faster, and more flexible energy solutions for communities and critical infrastructure across the U.S.
BUFFALO, N.Y., Sept. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Viridi, the industry leader in fail-safe battery energy storage systems (BESS), today announced it has been named an energy ecosystem partner within Schneider Electric's Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative—a nationwide effort uniting more than 20 partners, including Microsoft, Sunrock, Zurich, and AlphaStruxure, to rapidly deploy resilient clean energy systems.
Together, Viridi and Schneider Electric will advance the design and deployment of microgrids–ranging across a wide customer base from small-scale, flexible installations to utility-grade, hyperscale data centers, and other applications–delivering new value in safety, resilience, revenue, and performance–at a time when aging infrastructure, extreme weather, rising AI-driven demand, and cyber threats are straining the U.S. grid.
By integrating Viridi's Fail-Safe, FEOC-compliant, American-manufactured battery energy storage systems into Schneider Electric's global platform, this partnership will enable projects to achieve unparalleled resilience and speed-to-power. Viridi's proprietary anti-propagation technology, designed to prevent thermal runaway and mitigate the risk of lithium-ion battery fires, makes its BESS among the safest and most adaptable in the world.
Through this strategic collaboration, customers will accelerate their resilience, sustainability, operational and compliance goals while taking full advantage of federal incentives, including the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and an additional 10% bonus ITC for qualifying U.S.-manufactured content.

Its stock is in the neighborhood of a record high right now, but its attractive valuation suggests more upside could be on the way. Read on.
Google Search turned AI from a threat into a tailwind
Wall Street expects Alphabet to generate a record $394 billion in total revenue during 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. Google Search is likely to account for more than half of that figure on its own, so it's the company's most important segment by far.
When AI chatbots like ChatGPT went mainstream two years ago, investors feared they would drive internet traffic away from Google Search because they offered a faster, more convenient way to find information online. However, Alphabet mounted an aggressive response to protect its golden goose.
The company developed a family of large language models (LLMs) called Gemini -- and its own chatbot, which bears the same name -- to compete with start-ups like OpenAI. And those LLMs also power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews, which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to create more comprehensive answers to search queries.
Overviews appear above the traditional Google results, so users no longer have to spend time sifting through web pages to find the information they need. Over 2 billion people are using them every month, and Alphabet says they generate advertising revenue at roughly the same rate as regular Google Search outputs, so they aren't hurting the company's core business.
Google Search's revenue growth actually accelerated from 9.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to 11.7% during the second quarter, suggesting the business is building momentum, not slowing down. This offers some proof that AI Overviews are having the desired effect.
Google Cloud is Alphabet's growth engine
Google Search might be Alphabet's biggest business, but Google Cloud is the fastest growing. It generated a record $13.6 billion in revenue during the second quarter, which was up 32% year over year. That growth rate accelerated from 28% in the first quarter.
Google Cloud operates state-of-the-art data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers such as Nvidia, and it rents the computing capacity to developers, which use it to build AI software. The platform also offers access to hundreds of ready-made LLMs, including Gemini, which developers can use to accelerate their progress. Over 85,000 organizations are now using Gemini to create AI software.
This business still has plenty of room to grow because it had a $106 billion order backlog at the end of the second quarter, from customers waiting for more data center capacity to come online. That was up 38% year over year, so based on Google Cloud's revenue growth during the quarter, demand appears to be increasing even faster than supply.
The stock still looks cheap
The U.S. Department of Justice won a lawsuit against Alphabet last year, which determined that the company used monopolistic practices to safeguard its market share in the internet search industry. For example, Alphabet paid Apple enormous annual fees to make Google the default search engine on devices like the iPhone, making it almost impossible for other search engines to compete.
Lawmakers sought to break up Alphabet by forcing it to sell certain assets, which could have significantly disrupted the company's ability to generate revenue. Its valuation has been suppressed for the last couple of years while this saga played out, as investors braced for the worst.
But earlier this month, the judge in the case handed down a rather lenient decision that will allow management to continue paying partners like Apple, as long as the deals aren't exclusive. He also declined to support the Justice Department's proposed breakup.
Alphabet stock has surged by almost 20% since the ruling, which catapulted the company into the $3 trillion club. But with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 26.8, it's still the cheapest stock in the ""Magnificent Seven"" (a group of peers operating at the forefront of the AI industry), as shown in the chart below.
For that reason, I think Alphabet stock still has plenty of room to run."

The three stocks that I've listed here have tremendous long-term growth prospects, offer great dividends, and have been increasing their payouts for years.
These are the types of stocks that are good buys even without factoring in their dividend payments, and that's what makes them no-brainer investments for the long haul.
Walmart (WMT 1.71%), Eli Lilly (LLY 1.71%), and Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) may not be the highest-yielding stocks around or appear to be the most exciting options for dividend investors, but they have the potential to be amazing dividend growth stocks in the future.
1. Walmart
Walmart is a top retail stock to own, but its dividend may not be all that exciting as it yields just 0.9%. That's below the S&P 500 average of 1.2%, which already isn't all that high to begin with. But shares of Walmart have skyrocketed more than 120% over the past five years. If not for such an impressive rally, the stock would be yielding far more than it is.
That's not a bad problem for income investors to have. The company has been growing its dividend generously, the stock has simply been incredibly hot. As the share price rises, the yield declines. It's a much better position to be in than a high yield due to a crashing share price.
Earlier this year, the big-box chain announced it was raising its dividend by a generous rate of 13%. It's the 52nd year in a row that this Dividend King (stocks that have increased their dividends for over 50 years) has boosted its payout, and underscores just how underrated of a dividend stock it is. Many dividend growth stocks make just small incremental increases to their payouts for the sake of keeping their streaks going. Walmart, however, has rewarded its shareholders with a sizable, double-digit increase.
The company is in a sweet spot where it can attract both low and high-income shoppers, with the latter making more trips to their local Walmart recently in an effort to save amid inflation and rising costs. Walmart's business has proven to be resilient over the years and with strong grocery operations and opportunities in e-commerce and advertising, this is a business that still has plenty of growth potential in the long run.
2. Eli Lilly
Another stock that's doing so well its yield is low is drugmaker Eli Lilly. The company's business has been thriving due to the success of its popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro (diabetes) and Zepbound (weight loss), which are raking in billions for the business.
Eli Lilly's yield looks paltry at just 0.8% and its massive gains of around 400% in five years help explain why its payout also doesn't look all that high. And if you think Walmart's recent dividend increase was impressive, consider that Eli Lilly announced a 15% increase to its payout last December. And that was the seventh straight year it has boosted its dividend by such a generous amount.
The mammoth growth the healthcare company is experiencing makes it a compelling option for both growth and dividend investors alike. Even despite such significant increases to the dividend, the stock's payout ratio is less than 40%.
Eli Lilly has generated more than $53 billion in sales over the past 12 months and it was only a few years ago when its annual revenue was less than $30 billion. This is a growth beast that's worth buying and holding for the long haul.
3. Microsoft
The lowest-yielding stock on this list belongs to tech giant Microsoft. At less than 0.7%, this is another seemingly unimpressive dividend stock that is better than it looks. Like the other growth stocks on this list, it has performed exceptionally well in the past five years, rising by around 150% over that stretch.
The tech giant has been increasing its dividend since the early 2000s and it has more than doubled its payout within the past decade. And with so much growth on the horizon due to artificial intelligence (AI) and the business already being flush with cash, I believe Microsoft will raise its dividend at high rate for years to come.
Over the trailing 12 months, Microsoft has generated an incredible $71.6 billion in free cash flow and its dividend payments during that stretch have totaled just $24.1 billion. It may not be a terribly popular dividend growth stock to own today, but over time and as its dividend continues to increase, that's likely to change."

Is It a Buy?,This company just received fantastic news.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c88f8570b3036be157a2332b950f5cc3e18536503265c0e64154b06be5b02dbf,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/this-ai-stock-just-joined-3-trillion-club/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/this-ai-stock-just-joined-3-trillion-club/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/18/this-ai-stock-just-joined-3-trillion-club/,fool.com,200,,"A few years ago, Apple reigned as the world's biggest company, with Microsoft close behind. But the artificial intelligence (AI) boom upset those rankings, helping AI giant Nvidia to zoom ahead into the top spot, with a market value of more than $4 trillion. In recent days, another AI player has seen its market value increase, pushing it into the $3 trillion club with Apple and Microsoft.
Of course, this isn't actually a real club with membership rules and benefits, but rather a way of referring to the few companies that have reached such an enormous market capitalization. It's important to note that all these players are in the tech industry, and each is involved in AI to a certain degree. Let's take a look at this new addition to the exclusive group of $3 trillion stocks and find out whether it's one to buy.
Billion-dollar earnings
So, which company has passed the key level of $3 trillion, bringing it closer to market giants Apple and Microsoft? I'm talking about Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), owner of something you probably use every day -- the world's No. 1 search engine, Google. On top of this, Alphabet is the parent of high-growth cloud business Google Cloud and generates revenue through the sale of hardware such as smartphones. All these businesses have helped Alphabet deliver billion-dollar revenue and profit quarter after quarter.
Alphabet has also become a key player in the field of AI, offering a vast number of services through Google Cloud, which has supercharged that unit's revenue in recent years. In the latest quarter, the company reported that cloud revenue soared 32% to more than $13 billion, boosted by AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions.
The company has been using AI itself to make gains across its Google Search business, too. For example, Alphabet's large language model (LLM) Gemini is improving advertisements across the platform to generate better results. Considering ads are Alphabet's biggest revenue driver, this is an important move that may prompt advertisers to spend more.
An antitrust lawsuit
This paints a very bright picture, but in recent times, one particular risk darkened the image: a U.S. antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet. A district court ruled last year that Alphabet's Google was an illegal monopoly, and the U.S. Justice Department recommended a breakup of Google. Though many investors (including myself) didn't expect this worst-case scenario to unfold, the possibility still represented a headwind for the stock.
Earlier this month, though, a district judge ruled that Alphabet wouldn't be ordered to sell Google's Chrome browser or the Android operating system. Instead, the decision ordered Alphabet to share search data with rivals. Removing the worst scenario from the landscape, the decision drove Alphabet shares higher and helped the company's market value advance past $3 trillion.
Now, let's return to our question: Following this much-awaited outcome, is now a good time to buy Alphabet stock? As mentioned, Alphabet's businesses are going strong -- and the latest court ruling suggests this trend will continue. The company's leadership in search, along with its use of AI, should keep ad revenue climbing, and overall demand for AI is set to power Alphabet's cloud revenue growth.
The cheapest ""Magnificent Seven"" stock
Alphabet's recent gain in market value alone isn't a reason to buy the stock, but the other positive points I've mentioned all add to the buy case for this stock. ""But what about price?"" you might ask. Even though Alphabet's valuation had increased, it remains reasonable at 25 times forward earnings estimates, and the stock is still the cheapest among all the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- these are the tech players that have driven market gains over the past two years.
Alphabet's valuation today, despite the recent share price performance, also supports the idea of getting in on this tech player.
Of course, Alphabet faces competition in the cloud business, and the company must continue to invest heavily to meet the needs of AI customers. But this tech player has the strength to do so and is well positioned to be among the AI winners as this growth story continues. All this means that today, after the biggest headwind has subsided, is the perfect time to buy Alphabet shares."

Chicago, IL – September 18, 2025 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Excluding the Tech sector contribution, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be up only +2.0% (vs. +5.1% otherwise)""
Q3 Earnings Outlook Remains Positive: A Closer Look
Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>
Here are the key points:
-
For 2025 Q3, total S&P 500 index earnings are expected to be up +5.1% from the same period last year on +6.0% higher revenues.
-
The positive revisions trend makes the overall setup for the Q3 earnings season favorable, but it raises the odds of actual results coming up short of expectations. In other words, it is reasonable to worry whether expectations for the period are too high, particularly for the Tech and Finance sectors.
-
Excluding the Tech sector contribution, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be up only +2.0% (vs. +5.1% otherwise).
-
For the Magnificent 7 group, Q3 earnings are expected to be up +12.2% from the same period last year on +14.6% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +26.4% earnings growth on +15.5% revenue growth in the preceding period.
Are Q3 Earnings Expectations Too High?
As we have consistently highlighted in recent weeks, the overall revisions trend remains positive, with estimates for the back half of the year steadily going up.
For 2025 Q3, the expectation is for earnings growth of +5.1% on +6.0% revenue gains.
Since the start of Q3 this month, estimates have increased modestly for five of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance, Technology, Energy, Retail, and others.
On the negative side, Q3 estimates remain under pressure for the remaining 11 Zacks sectors, with significant declines to estimates for the Medical, Basic Materials, Construction, Transportation, and other sectors.
For the Tech sector, Q3 earnings are expected to be up +11.9% from the same period last year on +12.5% higher revenues.
You can see the Tech sector’s positive revisions trend by looking at bellwether Tech sector operators like Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA and others.
Microsoft is currently expected to bring in $3.65 per share in earnings in Q3 on $75.37 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +10.6% and +14.9%, respectively. Microsoft’s Q3 EPS estimate has increased from $3.64 a month ago and $3.53 two months ago."

Staking into Bittensor’s subnets offers one of several emerging routes for retail investors to gain exposure to decentralized AI’s early days – which might have more upside than comparatively mature OpenAI or Nvidia.
What to know:
- Robinhood's tokenized shares of OpenAI are under scrutiny for not constituting equity, raising investment risks.
- Bittensor's dTAO upgrade aims to democratize AI investment, offering retail investors a chance to stake in AI subnets.
- Bitcoin remains stable post-Fed rate cut, while Ethereum sees gains amid expectations of further cuts.
Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets:
Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.
Robinhood got all kinds of attention earlier this year when it claimed to be able to offer its retail users exposure to OpenAI’s growth story via tokenized shares backed by a special purpose vehicle.
Counsel for OpenAI, has warned that these tokens do not constitute equity and claimed that the whole thing is unauthorized, which could potentially mean it could be a risky investment for the token holders.
This gets at a bigger question of investor access. The hottest AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, remain firmly private, their growth captured by venture capital funds and strategic backers like Microsoft or Google.
The institutional investors get it all, and retail investors are locked out, forced to either buy into Big Tech equities like Nvidia, or hope that structured products like SPVs deliver something resembling exposure.
Enter Bittensor.
In February 2024, the decentralized AI network rolled out its Dynamic TAO (dTAO) upgrade, which is aiming to turn staking into something closer to venture capital, where everyone gets a chance to have access to yield.
Instead of passively validating the root subnet, TAO holders now allocate directly to subnets, each with its own on-chain AI startup, and receive “alpha” tokens in return. These tokens reflect the performance and demand of the subnet, and staking decisions determine which projects earn a share of the network’s emissions. It’s a simple market-driven incubator where value is rewarded only if it is created.
""The subnets form an ecosystem within an ecosystem, where performance and utility are rewarded, stacking opportunities both through staking returns and alpha token appreciation,"" explained ‘Zerobit’, CEO of Talisman, a wallet that’s part of the dTAO ecosystem, during a recent panel on AI at Taiwan Blockchain Week.
Two subnets illustrate why this matters. Ridges (SN62) is a coding agent that has already outperformed Anthropic’s Claude 4 on SWE-Bench, an industry-standard test of code generation.
In just weeks, decentralized miners competing for emissions pushed Ridges’ accuracy above 80%, surpassing what a heavily funded centralized tech company delivered with hundreds of millions in capital.
Crucially, it achieved this while spending just tens of thousands of dollars on compute, leveraging Bittensor’s ecosystem of shared subnets and proving the thesis of decentralized AI holds water.
Another one of those is Chutes (SN64), the network’s serverless compute backbone. Think of it as a decentralized AWS for AI workloads: It processes billions of tokens daily, scales models in seconds, and undercuts centralized providers by up to 85% on cost.
Chutes also hosts DeepSeek’s large language models on HuggingFace, making it the largest decentralized provider of open-source inference at scale.
For retail investors, it could provide a compelling alternative. SPVs offer synthetic claims on private companies, riddled with potential legal and liquidity risk. Subnet staking, by contrast, is permissionless, performance-based, with results that can be verified on-chain.
""Where most crypto projects lock growth behind insider deals, Bittensor’s dTAO opens investment access from day one, letting them ride the growth in the value of the alpha token,” explained Brad Fuller of Bittensor.ai, a subnet staking data portal, during the same panel at Taiwan Blockchain Week. “It’s an on-ramp for anyone to join the ownership class and share in AI’s growth.”
The winners attract stake, grow emissions, and compound into stronger projects. With Anthropic and OpenAI still locked away from public markets, Bittensor could be one of the few ways for everyday investors to ride AI’s upside without waiting for Wall Street’s blessing.
While TAO may not have the similar pull like flashy Big Tech equities, subnet staking is becoming easier through new wallets, and with heavyweights like DCG’s Barry Silbert circling the ecosystem – who has already called it a protocol as important as bitcoin – this could provide a potential opportunity for those who might go down the rabbit hole of alternative investment options within the AI sector.

More broadly, markets are shaking off initial hesitation that dragged on stocks after the Fed reduced rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday. While the Fed's ""dot plot"" signaled that two more cuts are likely in 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comment that high inflation and a weak labor market leave ""no risk-free path"" dented confidence.
Weekly jobless claims figures out on Thursday showed further signs of labor market stress. On the upside, the number of Americans filing for unemployment dropped, after surging the previous week. But hiring all but stalled as demand for and supply of workers slowed.
On the corporate front, FedEx (FDX) will report its quarterly results after the bell. Analysts expect the delivery giant's profit to take a hit from President Trump's decision to end the ""de minimus"" tariff exemption for low-value direct-to-consumer packages from China and Hong Kong.
Investor focus now turns to a highly anticipated call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping slated for Friday. Trump described a deal over TikTok as all but completed and added that he is looking to make progress on broader issues like tariffs.

Bitcoin rises above $117,000 as crypto rally gains steam
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose above $117,000 per token on Thursday as the overall market rallied on the heels of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, and a newly revised, streamlined process for issuance of crypto ETFs.
The world's largest cryptocurrency rose 1.5% after a period of consolidation around the $115,000 level.
Meanwhile, ether (ETH-USD), the native token of Ethereum, rose more than 2% to surpass $4,600 per token.
The crypto rally comes after the Federal Reserve cut its fed funds rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, also on Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission streamlined the approval process for crypto ETFs. Compass Point analysts note the move opens the ""floodgates for altcoin ETFs"".
""Prior to the announcement, the SEC individually approved each ETF application, which significantly slowed the process for crypto ETF listings,"" noted analyst Ed Engel. ""Under the new standards, ETF applications will automatically be approved after a defined timeframe, assuming the digital asset meets minimum standards.""

Bullish jumps 12% on key approval for US crypto exchange expansion
Bullish (BLSH) rose 10% on Thursday after the crypto exchange cleared a key milestone necessary for its breakout into the US market.
The company, which also owns the publication CoinDesk, reported its first quarterly results since going public last month on the New York Stock Exchange in a splashy debut.
On the earnings call CEO Tom Farley, former president of the NYSE Group, announced the exchange received a key New York license, critical to its business model expansion.
""While we have already had the ability to operate in many states because of our regulatory approval, we refrained from launching our exchange in the United States until we received the New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense,"" said Farley.
""We received that license yesterday, and we look forward to bringing our exchange and our leading liquidity to the United States imminently, and we believe this to be the largest geographic market by far,"" he added.
Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani and his team wrote ""Bullish remains on track for a successful U.S launch and crypto options rollout (expected Q4’25E) - providing key growth catalysts for the coming quarters.""
""Bullish now holds multiple tier 1 regulatory licenses (German BaFin, Hong Kong SFC and U.S BitLicense) across major crypto markets, strengthening its positioning as global regulated institutional crypto exchange,"" he added.

Nvidia's planned 4% Intel stake would bring recent investment in chipmaker to $16 billion
Nvidia's (NVDA) $5 billion planned investment in Intel common shares announced Thursday would represent a 4% stake and bring recent outside investment in the ailing chipmaker to $16 billion.
""This is a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Thursday. Intel stock soared more than 25% after the market open Thursday.
In an unusual move, the Trump administration took a 10% stake in Intel in August with a roughly $9 billion investment, and Japanese investment holding company SoftBank Group (SFTBY) made its own $2 billion investment last month.
Still, the Nvidia-Intel deal would not bolster Intel's ailing manufacturing business as it looks to bring on outside customers, noted Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.
Intel designs chips for data centers and personal computers, and while it has always manufactured its own semiconductors, the company opened up that manufacturing business to outside customers in 2021 under former CEO Pat Gelsinger. Intel has aimed to both compete with Nvidia's AI chips in its design segment and draw in customers such as Nvidia in its manufacturing business — but both efforts have fallen short.
Intel recently said it would only pursue the development of its new 14A manufacturing process, which would be used to develop cutting-edge chips, if it can bring in such customers.
""But frankly Intel can use the help on the product business just as much given share position in key markets has been bleeding,"" Rasgon said in a note Thursday.

Nasdaq leads US stocks higher at the open
The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains in US stocks after Nvidia (NVDA) announced its plans to take a $5 billion stake in Intel (INTC), boosting spirits.
The Nasdaq jumped nearly 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%, paring earlier gains in premarket. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%.
Stocks' broad gains come after the Federal Reserve returned to easing interest rates yesterday and indicated more cuts are coming.

Nuclear power could be a $10 trillion market opportunity
Nuclear energy represents a $10 trillion potential market opportunity that could hold ""the answer to the world's power shortages,"" according to a new report from Bank of America.
Rising demand, combined with strong support from the Trump administration and a public narrative turning positive after years of a dour outlook on the sector, has given a share price boost to companies operating throughout the nuclear sector supply chain in 2025.
""In many ways,"" Bank of America analysts wrote, ""nuclear energy has been 'rediscovered' amid surging electricity demand ignited by the rise of AI/data centers, building electrification, industrial growth, and EVs.""
According to Bank of America, the answer to meeting this demand amid a ""rediscovery"" of nuclear's potential benefits may lie in what the bank calls ""one of the most consequential energy technologies for the next 25 years"": small modular reactors, or SMRs.
Shares in [providers] NuScale (SMR) and Oklo (OKLO) are up more than 100% and more than 350% since the beginning of the year, respectively.
Nvidia bets big on Intel, sending its stock soaring
Nvidia (NVDA) said Thursday that it plans to invest $5 billion in Intel (INTC), throwing its weight behind the beleaguered chipmaker but holding off from making a crucial manufacturing order.
The move comes just weeks after the Trump administration pushed through a deal for the US government to take a significant stake in Intel.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>
Here are the key points:
-
For 2025 Q3, total S&P 500 index earnings are expected to be up +5.1% from the same period last year on +6.0% higher revenues.
-
The positive revisions trend makes the overall setup for the Q3 earnings season favorable, but it raises the odds of actual results coming up short of expectations. In other words, it is reasonable to worry whether expectations for the period are too high, particularly for the Tech and Finance sectors.
-
Excluding the Tech sector contribution, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be up only +2.0% (vs. +5.1% otherwise).
-
For the Magnificent 7 group, Q3 earnings are expected to be up +12.2% from the same period last year on +14.6% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +26.4% earnings growth on +15.5% revenue growth in the preceding period.
Are Q3 Earnings Expectations Too High?
As we have consistently highlighted in recent weeks, the overall revisions trend remains positive, with estimates for the back half of the year steadily going up.
For 2025 Q3, the expectation is for earnings growth of +5.1% on +6.0% revenue gains. The chart below illustrates the evolution of Q3 earnings growth expectations over recent weeks.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Since the start of Q3 this month, estimates have increased modestly for five of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance, Technology, Energy, Retail, and others.
On the negative side, Q3 estimates remain under pressure for the remaining 11 Zacks sectors, with significant declines to estimates for the Medical, Basic Materials, Construction, Transportation, and other sectors.
For the Tech sector, Q3 earnings are expected to be up +11.9% from the same period last year on +12.5% higher revenues. The chart below shows how the sector’s Q3 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last couple of months.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
You can see the Tech sector’s positive revisions trend by looking at bellwether Tech sector operators like Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA, and others.
Microsoft is currently expected to bring in $3.65 per share in earnings in Q3 on $75.37 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +10.6% and +14.9%, respectively. Microsoft’s Q3 EPS estimate has increased from $3.64 a month ago and $3.53 two months ago."

Claiming the top spot in notional short is mainly related to Nvidia’s surging market capitalization, the report highlights.
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) maintains its position as the second-largest short position by notional dollar value at $32.7 billion, while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) (NASDAQ:MSFT) has moved into third place at $30.6 billion, the report indicates. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in fourth at $27.7 billion in notional short interest.
The rankings represent a significant shift in market capitalization from the beginning of 2025, when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the group at $3.9 trillion but has since experienced a 9% decline in valuation, dropping it to third place in market capitalization. Nvidia, which was previously tied with Microsoft for second place in market cap, has surged 30% in market cap to claim the top position at $4.3 trillion. Microsoft sits second at $3.8 trillion. Despite this increase, Nvidia’s short interest percentage of float has decreased by 11%, while Microsoft and Tesla have each seen increases of approximately 20% in this metric.
The research highlights notable changes in volatility across these major technology stocks. Tesla has become 22% less volatile, while Nvidia has experienced a 15% volatility decline, contributing to a 25% reduction in its daily risk exposure. Using recent volatility measurements, Nvidia’s volatility has decreased to levels comparable to non-technology stocks.
S3 Partners’ analysis reveals a strong inverse relationship between stock returns and short interest percentage of float across these four companies, which creates a degree of stability in notional calculations by making them less sensitive to volatility in either component.

“In striving for a better world, we also have a precious opportunity to safeguard and restore the wonders and beauty of nature for the generations who follow us,” Charles continued.
Trump nodded along as Charles spoke, but the comments — hitting on two areas where he has broken with other allies — were particularly notable given how the state dinner was designed to curry favor with the US president and the king’s traditional restraint from engaging in political issues.
The king emphasized the longstanding bonds between the nations and became the latest leader to flatter Trump’s love of golf. “I understand that British soil makes a rather splendid golf course,” he said, referencing Trump’s properties in the UK.
The trappings of the event — from a string orchestra that played Trump playlist favorites from Elton John and the Rolling Stones to a 1945 vintage port intended to honor the 45th American president — underscored the efforts at flattery.
But the guest list of the event nodded to the work that Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who are set to meet Thursday, face as they attempt to bring the special relationship back onto stronger footing. Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang, Blackstone Inc. CEO Steve Schwarzman, Arm Ltd CEO Rene Haas, and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch were among 160 guests listed to attend the banquet, and the nations are set to solidify joint tech, energy and digital asset agreements.
US and UK officials have said they expect to roll out economic deals worth billions of dollars to coincide with the visit, with artificial intelligence data centers and nuclear plants to help power them high on the agenda. The UK government is touting a £150 billion ($205 billion) investment package led by the promise of £90 billion from Blackstone Inc. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI and other American companies also announced plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on technology infrastructure in the UK."

- Alphabet this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted recently by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom
- Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have trended sharply higher this month.

Alphabet (GOOGL) this week became just the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, boosted by a favorable legal ruling and optimism about the company's prospects amid the AI boom.
The tech giant joined Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) in the exclusive club. Alphabet shares surged in recent weeks after a federal judge ruled that Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case. Investors have also cheered the integration of Google’s AI tools across its ad and cloud business.
Alphabet shares were down 1% at around $248 in early-afternoon trading Wednesday, leaving the company's market cap hovering near $3 trillion. Despite today's decline, the stock has gained about 17% since the start of September and is up 30% since the start of the year.
Below, we dial into Alphabet’s technicals and point out key price levels worth watching out for.
September Rally in Focus
Since breaking out from a saucer pattern in late August, Alphabet shares have continued to trend sharply higher this month.
While the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum with a reading nearing 90, the indicator also warns of heated conditions, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations and profit taking.
It’s also worth noting that the price formed a spinning top candlestick pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, signaling indecision among buyers and sellers.
Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where the stock could be headed if the rally continues and also point out key support levels worth monitoring.
Bullish Price Targets to Monitor
Investors can forecast two possible bullish price targets on Alphabet’s chart by using the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements.
To apply the analysis, we calculate the distance of the saucer pattern from its low to high and add that to the formation’s top trendline value.
When calculating the distance in points, we add $60 to $201, which forecasts a target of $261. ($60 + 201).
Alternatively, we can measure the distance as a percentage change, which projects a target of $286.53. (applying a 42.55% increase to $201).
Key Support Levels Worth Watching
The first support level to eye sits around $215. This location on the chart may attract buying interest on a fill of the stock’s antitrust news-driven breakaway gap.
Finally, selling below this level could see Alphabet shares retest a key floor at $201, currently situated just under the rising 50-day moving average. Investors may look to accumulate shares in this region near the saucer pattern’s top trendline, which may flip from prior resistance into future support.

-
Phoebe Gates, the Gen Z daughter of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates, has launched an AI-powered fashion-tech startup called Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni. She shared with Fortune the best advice her famous parents gave her, before its $8 million success.
Before launching her $8 million startup, Phoebe Gates turned to her billionaire founder parents for advice. After all, when your dad is the cofounder of Microsoft, he might know a thing or two about building a business.
The 23-year-old daughter of Bill and Melinda French Gates recalled the guidance they shared wasn’t about money. Instead, the thing that could make or break a product’s success, they advised, is your team.
“The people that you build with, who you’re at the office until 1 a.m. with—even, it comes down to the summer intern you have. The people that you choose to build with every single day, whether that’s your incredible co-founder, like I have Sophia—that’s what’s actually going to define, you know, whether the product succeeds,” Gates told Fortune in an episode of the Term Sheet podcast.
As she worked alongside her peers, that advice quickly proved true. Gates realized the importance of surrounding herself with like-minded people who shared her vision for Phia, the new fashion-tech startup she launched with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni.
Since its debut in April 2025, the AI-powered shopping assistant has attracted over 500,000 users and partnered with more than 5,000 brands.
“We are the women who use this product day in and day out. That’s why we wanted to bring people onto our cap table who truly understand how shopping needs to adapt and where it’s headed,” she said.
It’s no doubt when building out the team of her app and mobile browser extension that its prominent backers are what unlocked the door to such success.
Fortune exclusively learned that the product’s $8 million in seed funding is led by Kleiner Perkins, with high-profile investors including Hailey Bieber, Kris Jenner, Sheryl Sandberg, Spanx founder Sara Blakely, Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, and eBay.
“It was foundational for us not only to have women on our cap table but especially people who deeply understood the problem,” she added.
Melinda French Gates draws the line at writing a check for a start-up
But despite Gates’ parents opening up the door for a substantial rolodex of billionaire contacts, her mother Melinda, who has an estimated $29 billion of net worth, draws the line at career guidance when it comes writing a check."

It’s Fed decision day for the markets.
Market bulls have sent stocks to fresh records this week, banking on a big gift from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and leave the door open for more rate cuts.
Anything short of that will be a big gift for … you guessed it … the bears! Such is life in the markets.
""If we see Jay Powell become maybe more dovish than what the market expects, that could be actually taken as a negative because more dovish would suggest maybe he's panicking a little bit. Maybe he feels he's behind the eight ball. And then you could see the market retrace,"" said Slatestone Wealth Management chief markets strategist Kenny Polcari on Opening Bid.

Around the horn
The AI trade spreads
President Trump has landed in the UK with First Lady Melania and tech leaders from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). AI giants are wasting no time making announcements that coincide with Trump’s UK arrival.
Marc Benioff-led Salesforce (CRM) said it will invest $6 billion into its UK operations by the end of the decade as it tries to make the country its European AI hub. Microsoft (MSFT) said it’s investing $30 billion in the UK between 2025 and 2028.
Meanwhile, China’s AI stocks have ripped to new records as optimism spreads further. The Hang Seng Tech Index (HSTECH.HK) closed at its highest level since Nov. 21. Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA) saw very strong sessions.
""I don't know if this is a bubble,"" Polcari said, adding that the infrastructure buildout for AI remains in its early innings. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar drove home that point to me in a recent chat, and so did CoreWeave's (CRWV) co-founder and CEO Michael Intrator.
Crypto comeback
Somewhat under the radar, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices have broken out of a trading range the last five days as the US dollar reached a four-year low. Crypto insiders tell me the crypto market is also readying another charge higher as the Fed begins to cut rates — which could create even more pressure on the US dollar.
I spent some time with first son Eric Trump and one of his crypto partners, Asher Genoot of Hut 8, at Trump Tower on Tuesday afternoon.
Besides being executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Eric is also the co-founder of the newly public crypto miner American Bitcoin (ABTC). Genoot's Hut 8 — where he is CEO — provides the infrastructure (power, back office services, etc.) that allows American Bitcoin to mine bitcoin."

OSLO, Sept. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Nscale Global Holdings Ltd. (""Nscale""), Aker ASA (""Aker"") and Microsoft Corp. today signed a binding five-year customer agreement marking a major milestone in the development of advanced European owned hyperscale AI infrastructure.
At a contract value of approximately USD 6.2 billion, the agreement secures Microsoft's access to high-performance AI compute capacity to be delivered in staged deployments beginning in 2026. Located in Narvik, Northern Norway, the project will deliver the most advanced AI infrastructure powered by secured grid capacity and entirely renewable electricity.
Jon Tinter, President of Business Development and Ventures, Microsoft said: ""This demonstrates our unwavering commitment to customers in Norway and across Europe, enabling us to deliver our latest and most advanced AI services. We're inspired by how Nscale and Aker are advancing AI infrastructure powered by renewable energy, and we're excited to work with European technology innovators to bring the benefits of scalable, sustainability-driven AI to Microsoft Cloud customers.
Josh Payne, founder and CEO of Nscale said: ""This agreement demonstrates our continued ability to execute at scale and establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure. Delivering one of the largest GPU deployments in the world reflects the unprecedented demand for compute and confirms Narvik's role as a strategic hub for AI in Europe. It's a powerful testament of Nscale's approach – bringing together data centres, GPUs and orchestration to accelerate access to AI compute while ensuring efficiency, compliance and sustainability. We are excited to continue scaling our partnership with Aker with this milestone.""
Øyvind Eriksen, President & CEO of Aker said: ""This agreement with Microsoft – a long-standing partner to Aker – is a milestone for the joint venture with Nscale and for Norway's role in enabling sovereign AI infrastructure. It underscores our ambition of converting clean hydropower into strategic digital capacity, and positions Narvik as a launchpad for Europe's sovereign cloud. With trusted infrastructure, renewable power, and industrial readiness, Norway is stepping into a new era of value creation – one that is digital, secure, and globally relevant.""
The Aker-Nscale joint venture continues to advance as planned and is expected to be formally established during the third quarter of 2025, subject to fulfilment of closing conditions."

“This is the biggest meme stock we’ve ever seen. Even at its peak, Amazon was nowhere near this level. The PE on this, well above 200, is just crazy. When you’ve got stocks like Nvidia, the price-earnings ratio is around 25 or 30, and Apple is maybe 35 or 36, Microsoft around the same. I mean, this is way out of line to be at a 220 PE. It’s crazy, and they’ve, I think, put a little too much emphasis on the magic wand of Musk.”

Tesla’s EV sales are falling all over the world as the company faces challenges from competitors. Tesla’s global sales in the second quarter fell 14% year over year. Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

Chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA) announced on Tuesday that alongside AI infrastructure partners Nscale, CoreWeave (CRWV) and others, it would invest £11bn ($15bn) in UK AI factories.
Microsoft (MSFT) also said that it plans to pump $30bn (£21.95bn) into AI infrastructure and its ongoing operations across the UK over four years through to 2028.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google announced the opening of its data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, as part of a two-year £5bn investment in the UK.

In addition, software giant Salesforce (CRM) pledged to put a further $2bn into its UK business through 2030, extending a previous five-year investment of $4bn made in 2023.
The commitments came ahead of the UK and US revealing details of their Tech Prosperity Deal on Tuesday evening, as US president Donald Trump arrived in Britain for his state visit.
Richard Clode, portfolio manager on the global technology leaders team at Janus Henderson, said: ""AI is a scale game in terms of infrastructure and scarce AI talent. The UK has the latter while these announcements give us more confidence in the UK having the former. That should pave the way for continued strong AI innovation in the UK with natural advantages versus the rest of Europe.""
With that in mind, here's a closer look at the main companies with which US tech giants are partnering as part of their investments.
Nscale
Nvidia (NVDA) said it was partnering with UK-headquartered AI-infrastructure company Nscale to scale up 300,000 of the chipmaker's Grace Blackwell graphic processing units (GPUs) worldwide, with up to 60,000 in the UK.
Nscale has also entered into a commitment with Microsoft (MSFT) to deliver the UK's largest AI supercomputer at its campus in Loughton, Essex. Nscale said that the site will deliver 50 megawatts (mw) of AI capacity, scalable to 90mw, and will initially house 23,040 Nvidia GB300 GPUs, which will be delivered in the first quarter of 2027.
In addition, Nscale is teaming up with ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Nvidia (NVDA) to establish Stargate UK, an infrastructure platform designed to deploy OpenAI’s technology in the UK.
Nscale, which was founded by CEO Josh Payne in 2023, has already partnered with OpenAI to launch Stargate Norway: an AI infrastructure project in Narvik aiming to deliver 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026."

And finally, let's talk about President Trump's visit to the UK. He's been greeted with a lot of fanfare, not just from officials there, you know, royalty, etc., but from companies that are also uh inking partnerships there, Ramzan.
That's right. There's a lot of pageantry, but it's interesting to note that President Trump isn't in London, he's in Windsor. There have been protests as well. But he has been accompanied by uh quite a few of the, you know, leading names in technology, US leading names. Among them, uh Jensen Huang, from Nvidia's Jensen Huang and also Microsoft's Satya Nadela are all are with him as well. And what they've the two countries have agreed is a big, what they called a tech prosperity deal. And it's estimated to be worth around 42 billion dollars. And some of the investments that have been promised include Microsoft saying it'll spend around 30 billion dollars expanding cloud and AI infrastructure in the UK. Google's promised almost 7 billion dollars in spending on a new data center and AI research. Nvidia said it would deploy 120,000 advanced chips across the country. So, a lot of US investment uh in the UK, uh also Salesforce has said they're going to invest, Core Weave as well. So, that's good for the UK, but what about the US? Well, on the flip side, the British pharmaceutical firm GSK said it's going to invest 30 billion dollars in US research and development and supply chain infrastructure over the next five years. Now, remember, Pharma is a bit of a hot topic because of President Trump's threat to potentially somewhere down the line to hit hit uh the these drug companies with 200% tariffs. Well, a lot of companies are already making that move to invest in the UK to avoid that. So, that's quite an interesting take. Also an interesting thing on the tech front, the investment in um the UK could be quite significant because just across the water, across the channel, uh in Europe, there's a bit of a an uneasy relationship with US tech firms and these and uh the European regulators there. And President Trump has often criticized you the EU uh in terms of their how how they hit US tech firms. So maybe going to the UK is is one way of showing, well, actually, we don't need you, we can go to the UK and we can be as prosperous there. Uh also, the UK is desperate as well for this investment. GDP growth in the three months up to July was just 0.2% in the UK. So the economy not really firing on on all cylinders. So this investment will be uh very much welcome here in the UK."

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks to watch in September.
Dan Niles from Niles Investment Management, in a recent program on CNBC, reiterated his concerns about a potential slowdown in AI demand. This time, Niles highlighted Nvidia’s data center miss in its latest quarterly report.
“Over the weekend it came out that OpenAI has sort of pushed up their revenue forecast for 2030 by about $26 billion to $200 billion,” Niles said. “But to get that revenue increase of $26 billion, they’re going to have to burn $85 billion more in cash. So the data points are definitely there, but you know, we’re in this business to make money. So you have to go, all right, well, do the fundamentals matter right now, or is it the fact you’re going to get even more easy money? The 10-year yields going down to 4%. And so this market, much like in 2021, will keep going up right up until it doesn’t. And so I think you have to look at that. And Nvidia missing on data center revenues, and you can say yes the growth was so high and all this, but they missed, so that should give you another data point. And you throw on top of that Dell or Marll or the fact that AVGO got more ASIC revenues because companies want to cut their costs—those all speak to the same narrative, so don’t confuse the actual data with what the stock prices are doing.”

Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Loomis Sayles Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, which enables computers to mimic human-like intelligence for problem solving and decision making capabilities. Founded in 1993 to develop faster and more-realistic graphics for PC-based video games, Nvidia created the first graphics processing unit (GPU), a dedicated semiconductor that employs a proprietary parallel processing architecture to perform superior graphics rendering outside of a computer’s standard central processing unit (CPU). The parallel processing capability of Nvidia’s GPUs, which contrasts with the linear processing requirement of CPUs, can accelerate computing functions performed by standard CPUs by greater than ten times. As a result, Nvidia extended its visual computing expertise beyond its legacy gaming market into innovative new and larger markets, including data centers, autos, and professional visualization. The parallel processing capability facilitates pattern recognition and machine learning functions that have enabled Nvidia to be at the forefront of growth in artificial intelligence applications. As a result, the data center business, which first surpassed the gaming business to become Nvidia’s largest revenue and profit generator in its 2023 fiscal year, grew to represent over 88% of revenue in the company’s most recent fiscal year. The company is also focused on building out its GPU-computing-based ecosystem and is helping to enable breakthroughs in autonomous driving, and virtual reality."

Trending Now: Why You Should Start Investing Now (Even If You Only Have $10)
Up Next: The New Retirement Problem Boomers Are Facing
When it first went public in 1986, Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) was worth just $21 a share. In today’s dollars adjusted for inflation, that’s about $60. So what does that look like over the past decade? If you’d invested in Microsoft 10 years ago, what would it be worth today? Let’s take a look.
What You’d Have Now If You’d Invested Then
As of 2015, Microsoft’s stock price averaged around $48.61. For the sake of simple math, if you round that up to $50 per share, that means if you invested $2,000 at that time, it would have given you about 40 shares. As of Sept. 5, 2025, the stock price is $493.62, which means you would have about $19,745.
Even though you can’t go back in time and invest when you didn’t, it’s still an interesting thought experiment to run the numbers and see what could have been. Here are a few other examples of what you could have now if you’d invested different amounts a decade ago:
-
If you’d invested $1,000 in MSFT a decade ago, you’d have roughly $9,872 now.
-
If you’d invested $5,000 in MSFT a decade ago, you’d have roughly $49,362 now.
-
If you’d invested $10,000 in MSFT a decade ago, you’d have roughly $98,724 now.
-
If you’d invested $15,000 in MSFT a decade ago, you’d have roughly $148,086 now.

Quick Take: Is Microsoft Stock a Buy?
Microsoft has been on a winning streak for decades. One of the biggest tech companies in the world, it’s currently valued at about $3.67 trillion. This isn’t surprising considering Microsoft is a pioneer in AI, cloud computing, software and leading operating systems in general. As of Sept. 5, 2025, MSFT is considered a strong to moderate buy and here is how it is currently performing:
-
Stock price: $493.62
-
Market cap: $3.67 trillion
-
52-week high: $555.45
-
52-week low: $344.79
What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio?
This doesn’t necessarily mean you should run out there and start investing in Microsoft right now — but it doesn’t mean the opposite either. It’s up to you, your financial goals and situation and what works best with your investing strategy and risk tolerance.

U.S. President Donald Trump touched down in the United Kingdom on Tuesday for an unprecedented second state visit. He was accompanied by American tech CEOs, who pledged $42.3 billion worth of investments in U.K. AI projects.
The investments from major players, including Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, and OpenAI, are part of a sweeping £31 billion ($42.3 billion) “Tech Prosperity Deal,” aimed at building out the UK’s AI infrastructure, funding data center projects and computer chips.
The bulk of this investment comes from Microsoft, which unveiled a plan to spend almost $30 billion (£22 billion) over the next four years. The investment package is the company’s largest outside the U.S. and is separate from OpenAI’s recent announcement of a smaller, U.K.-based version of Stargate.
At the heart of the company’s push is a supercomputer in Essex, which will house over 23,000 GPUs in partnership with British-based AI infrastructure company Nscale, a project that CEO Satya Nadella says could accelerate the UK’s economic growth by 10% within just five years. “As we make these investments, we are guided by a clear and bold vision, ensuring that both the United States and the United Kingdom remain at the forefront of cloud and AI innovation,” Nadella said in a video statement.
According to the company, $15.5 billion would be spent on capital investments, such as the data center project, while a further $15.1 billion would be directed towards maintaining and growing its U.K. operations. Microsoft President Brad Smith said during a Tuesday press briefing that the company already had contracts in place or had pre-purchased the electricity needed to power the new data centers it plans to build.
“We will be good for every cent of this investment,” Smith said in the press briefing. “We care about British pounds, not empty tech promises.”
Microsoft isn’t the only U.S. company committing to major AI infrastructure investments in U.K. Google pledged $6.8 billion for AI research and infrastructure, which includes a new $1 billion AI data center that is set to open this week, and more funding for research at Google DeepMind, its advanced AI lab that continues to be headquartered in London.
DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis celebrated the investment as demonstrating “the strength of the US–U.K. partnership.”
“Combining the unique strengths of both countries will help to ensure our scientists continue to lead on the breakthroughs and innovations that will define the future. In particular, we look forward to working with both governments to advise on how scientists can harness the latest AI tools, as well as building on our partnership with the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority to advance fusion energy research in the US and the U.K.,” Hassabis said in a post on LinkedIn."

What Is STEF's Investment Narrative?
To be a long-term STEF shareholder, I think you have to believe in the resilience of its specialist refrigerated logistics platform and the eventual payoff from its investment in low-carbon and hydrogen technology. Nevertheless, the latest half-year results suggest the path may be rockier than previously thought. Despite another year of revenue gains, profit margins collapsed, with net income falling to €15.83 million from €67.97 million. This sharp drop amplifies short-term risks to STEF’s investment case: it could signal deeper cost inflation, project overruns, or structural pressure on profitability, at least for the immediate future. Catalysts such as a recovery in margins or successful execution of hydrogen initiatives may now have less influence in the short term, and the severe earnings miss puts greater scrutiny on management’s ability to control costs and protect cash flow. For investors, the recent results suggest a need to reassess how quickly or convincingly near-term issues can be addressed. But sharp drops in profitability are something investors cannot ignore.
Despite retreating, STEF's shares might still be trading 33% above their fair value. Discover the potential downside here.

NEW YORK, Sept. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rezolve Ai (NASDAQ: RZLV), a leader in proprietary AI-powered commerce solutions and a strategic partner of Microsoft and Google, today emphasized how it believes its strategy avoids common pitfalls that are bogging down many AI organizations. Recent articles* make clear that worldwide, AI companies are miscalculating scale and expenditures but, Rezolve believes that its architecture can deliver efficiently, with its leadership, operational structure, and focus on execution.
“The AI hype cycle has exposed many AI firms to ballooning costs, missed deadlines, and fragile infrastructures,” said Daniel M. Wagner, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Rezolve Ai. “Rezolve is built differently. We own our AI tech, we’re making hires who’ve scaled before, and we prioritize efficient, reliable delivery over blue sky promises. We believe that translates into lower risk, greater predictability, and real opportunity for our customers and investors.”
Lessons from the AI Industry
-
A recent LSE × Forbes article highlights that “scaling needs AI leadership, not just code” emphasizing that many firms lose money or suffer delays by focusing on tooling rather than strategic direction and market execution.
-
A survey reported in CFODive found that one in four firms overshoot their AI cost projections by 50% or more, which Rezolve believes indicates widespread under-investment in governance, cost controls, and reliable engineering discipline.
How Rezolve Performs Differently
Rezolve is designed to avoid those mistakes, and instead deliver disciplined, valuable AI commerce infrastructure:
-
Strong Leadership & Ownership: Rezolve owns its foundational AI, vision and semantic models; its leadership hires (including recent appointee Crispin Lowery) bring enterprise-level experience in scaling AI and retail systems.
-
Cost Predictability & Efficiency: Using proprietary models rather than renting third-party LLMs helps Rezolve control ongoing licensing or usage fees. Integrated architecture, lean model pipelines, and in-house innovations, like Visual Search and conversational commerce reduce overhead.
-
Execution Focused: Rezolve has already launched Visual Search, is advancing its Brain Commerce + Brain Checkout stack, and is actively building toward regulated payments/wallet infrastructure with Tether.
Investor Implications
-
In an era where many companies overspend on AI or fail to scale effectively, Rezolve’s approach is designed to provide comparative advantages aiming for lower risk, clearer cost structure, and stronger potential margins.
-
The AI sector is crowded; companies with strong leadership, cost management, and owned tech, such as Rezolve, are likely to outperform. Rezolve checks those boxes.
-
With ARR expected to exceed $100 million by the end of 2025, institutional support growing, and regulatory tailwinds in place, Rezolve believes that it is well-positioned for responsible growth and investor value."

Microsoft Investment Narrative Recap
To be a long-term Microsoft shareholder, I believe in the company's capacity to deliver sustainable growth by expanding its AI and cloud infrastructure, driving new enterprise revenue streams. The recent UK AI supercomputing partnership showcases Microsoft's continued focus on global Azure expansion, but does not materially alter the short-term catalyst, which remains the acceleration of AI adoption across its cloud ecosystem; the biggest risk is ongoing margin pressure from high capital investments outpacing revenue growth if AI projects don't deliver as expected.
Among recent announcements, the collaboration with Workday to streamline and secure enterprise AI agent management is especially relevant. This move directly ties to Microsoft's effort to deepen AI capabilities and integration within Azure, reinforcing the core catalyst of intensifying enterprise adoption and usage of its cloud and AI services.
However, investors should be mindful that while infrastructure partnerships are expanding, the potential for margin pressure and capital intensity from sustained AI investment is a real risk that ...

The stock popped in response to a highly ambitious five-year roadmap to grow Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) from around $10 billion in annual revenue to a staggering $144 billion.
If Oracle achieves this goal, OCI will surpass the current size of the leading three cloud giants by revenue -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud.
On Thursday, a 6.2% decline in Oracle, paired with a 6% jump in Tesla, led to Ellison slipping $1 billion below Elon Musk on the billionaire leaderboard, according to Bloomberg. Regardless, Ellison is now in a virtual tie with Musk as the richest person in the world because of his massive stake in Oracle.
Here's why Ellison's ownership of Oracle is great news for long-term investors, and whether the growth stock is a buy now.
The billionaire throughline
A common theme among the world's richest people is that the primary source of their wealth is existing ownership in one company. With the exception of the three Walton children, who inherited large stakes in Walmart, the other nine people on the list of the 10 richest billionaires all played pivotal roles in growing a business, and still hold meaningful positions in those businesses.
|

Total Net Worth (Billions) |
Main Source of Wealth |
|---|---|---|

$384 |
Around 13% ownership of Tesla |
|
Larry Ellison |
$383 |
Around 42% ownership of Oracle |

$369 |
Around 45% ownership of Walmart |

|
Jensen Huang |
$154 |
Around 3.5% ownership of Nvidia |
Ellison is unique because he owns such a massive amount of Oracle, whereas other founders have decreased positions in their businesses over time. So even though Oracle isn't worth as much as other ""Ten Titans"" stocks like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, or Nvidia, Ellison's massive stake can put a charge in his net worth when Oracle soars.
From a legacy stalwart to a cutting-edge AI play
Founder-led companies can be especially effective in the ever-changing technology sector. Ellison's large ownership stake and role as CTO make him heavily involved in Oracle's strategic direction.
Oracle has completely transformed its business model from a large database infrastructure and enterprise software model to a cloud computing giant. To pull it off, Oracle has had to invest a ton of capital, and fast, as the cloud computing race is highly competitive. Its capital expenditures (capex) have exploded higher -- outpacing revenue and earnings growth. So Oracle has taken on a considerable amount of debt to foot the bill.
Oracle is spending so much so quickly that its capex is now higher than its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Most of its capex is going toward building data centers. It's worth noting that capex doesn't even factor into Oracle's operating expenses with its existing businesses. This illustrates the extent of Oracle's leverage.
Oracle's spending is sky high and adds a considerable amount of risk to Oracle's investment thesis. With so much skin in the game, Ellison clearly saw this move as the right one for the long-term growth of the company. Ellison co-founded the company nearly 50 years ago in the late 1970s. So in this vein, Ellison's position is like Bill Gates still being a part of the top brass at Microsoft and having a massive stake in the company.
Oracle still has room to run
Ellison isn't calling all the shots at Oracle, but his large stake gives the company a level of credibility and a vote of confidence for individual investors interested in buying or holding the stock. If Ellison is putting his chips on the table and taking this big bet on cloud, then he must really believe it's the right long-term move, even if it takes a sledgehammer to Oracle's balance sheet and cash flow in the near term.
Wall Street was around. Oracle has nearly doubled in the last year and is up over 300% in the last three years. Investors often prefer capital-light, high-margin business models like those of Nvidia and Apple. Both companies design their products and outsource manufacturing, leading to high margins. But in Oracle's case, its capital-intensive strategy is a strength, as it is at the cutting edge of the future of hyper-efficient cloud computing.
Oracle isn't cheap by any means, but the stock could still be a good long-term investment for risk-tolerant investors seeking innovative companies where founders still have substantial financial incentives to make growth investments pay off."

(ORCL) has entered the conversation.
Shares of the database software company have soared 84% this year, the seventh-best performance in the S&P 500 Index (^GSPC), as scorching demand for AI computing turbocharges its revenue growth. The latest leg of the rally came after Oracle projected revenue in its cloud-computing business will jump 700% in the next three fiscal years, sending the stock up 36% on Sept. 10.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Oracle also has been linked to the Trump administration’s negotiations to keep TikTok operating in the US. The company has served as TikTok’s primary cloud infrastructure provider for years. On Wednesday, the White House extended the deadline for its ban of the Chinese video-sharing app until Dec. 16 while talks continue.
The stock is now trading around the highest price-to-estimated earnings since the dot-com era at 43 times, making Oracle more expensive than eight of the nine most valuable companies in the S&P 500. Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), for example, trades at 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months and is expected to have much faster sales growth over that period.
“Investors viewed Oracle as a boring low growth company, and all of a sudden it’s an AI winner,” said Michael Bailey, director of research at Fulton Breakefield Broenniman. “But you’ve got a lot of risk. You’re buying the stock now based on hope that we’re going to see massive growth in year four, five and six.”
The long-term nature of Oracle’s anticipated expansion, with the heaviest growth coming several years from now, is a major reason why its stock looks so expensive, as analysts haven’t adjusted their earnings expectations for the current fiscal year and next. But looking at profits estimated over the next three years, Oracle’s multiple is a more manageable 25 times — although that’s still almost twice the average over the past decade.
“This year is irrelevant, next year is irrelevant, the year after that is more important,” Bailey said. “If you go out a few years, there’s going to be this massive spike in growth. You’ve got to value that today.”
Of course, plenty of investors are comfortable taking a longer-term view with growth stocks. Two of the most popular examples — Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) — are priced at more than 180 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, compared with 27 times for the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). Even over a three-year horizon, Tesla and Palantir are still very expensive at around 100 times."

Nvidia, the world's largest company, dominates the AI chip market. Meanwhile, Microsoft's tremendous revenue backlog created by the booming demand for its AI cloud and productivity services is one of the reasons why it is the second-biggest company in the world. Apple, the other name on the $3 trillion-plus market cap list, is also looking to capitalize on the proliferation of AI to supercharge its growth. Alphabet, like Microsoft, is a cloud computing player and digital advertising leader.
However, there is another big tech company that's winning big from AI adoption within its industry and could witness outstanding growth. Let's take a closer look at that name and check why it has the potential to enter the $3 trillion market cap club ahead of peers, including Amazon.
Digital advertising dominance is set to give this tech giant a major boost
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) is the sixth-largest company in the world with a market cap of $1.9 trillion. It is known for its family of social media applications, including Instagram, Facebook, Threads, and WhatsApp, which have billions of users. This puts Meta in a terrific position to capitalize on the massive digital advertising market.
Grand View Research estimates that the digital ad market could generate $1.1 trillion in revenue in 2030. That would be a huge improvement over last year's revenue of $488 billion. Meta is taking advantage of AI to ensure that it can corner a nice chunk of this massive addressable opportunity on offer. It is using AI to drive stronger engagement across its apps, apart from giving advertisers access to AI tools so that they can improve audience targeting and create ad campaigns easily.
For instance, smaller advertisers can use Meta's generative AI creative tools to create and optimize ad campaigns for Facebook and Instagram, eliminating the need to hire a separate agency. Meanwhile, the AI-recommended content that's driving an increase in time spent on both Facebook and Instagram is another positive for advertisers since they have a chance to capture more eyeballs.
Additionally, Meta's AI advertising tools use real-time data from campaigns so that they can be optimized for better performance, helping advertisers reach a wider audience at lower costs. As mentioned in a company blog post citing a recent study conducted by Meta management: ""This study also assessed the impact of our new AI-driven advertising tools and found that they drive a 22% improvement in return on ad spend for advertisers. This means that for every dollar U.S. advertisers spend with Meta, they see a $4.52 return when they use our new AI-driven advertising tools.""
As such, it is easy to see why Meta is growing at a much faster pace than the digital ad market. Its second-quarter revenue increased 22% year over year to $47.5 billion. For comparison, the digital ad market is predicted to grow by almost 8% in 2025. Meta, therefore, seems to be capturing a bigger chunk of the lucrative digital advertising market. Not surprisingly, Meta expects massive growth in generative AI-fueled revenue, which will be enough to help it join the $3 trillion club.
Meta Platforms projects a massive spike in its AI revenue
In June last year, Meta management estimated that its AI revenue in 2025 could hit at least $2 billion (according to unsealed court documents). By 2035, the company estimates this figure to land between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion. That forecast points toward massive growth considering that Meta is expected to end 2025 with $196 billion in revenue.
But even if Meta's AI revenue lands at the midpoint of its guidance range after a decade, the company would see a massive spike in its top line that could send its market cap way beyond the $3 trillion mark in the long run. Importantly, analysts also updated their growth expectations, and that's not surprising considering the points discussed above.
But then, there is a good chance that the company will be able to outpace these expectations as it has the potential to keep growing at a faster pace than the 15% annual growth that the digital ad market is expected to clock. Assuming it can hit 20% revenue growth in 2026 and 2027, Meta's top line could jump to $282 billion after two years (using 2025's projected revenue of $196.1 billion as the base). If it maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could go past $3 trillion.
However, Meta could get to that milestone at a quicker pace. The market may reward it with a higher premium on account of its growing dominance in digital advertising."

Chicago, IL – September 17, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, IonQ, Inc. IONQ, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.
Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:
Is IonQ the NVIDIA of Tomorrow, and Should You Buy the Stock?
The way NVIDIA Corp. benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom to become a $4 trillion behemoth, a smaller company, IonQ, Inc., is aiming to do the same by taking advantage of the next major tech wave – quantum computing. Can IonQ do it, and is the stock a buy now? Let’s find out –
Why Quantum Computing is Growing and Why IonQ Stands Out
Unlike traditional computing, quantum computing can inherently solve complex problems much faster, making it highly sought after for training AI models and revolutionizing drug discovery, to name a few. As a result, the global quantum computing market is projected to reach around $20.20 billion by 2030 from $3.52 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 41.8%, according to marketsandmarkets.
However, quantum computing has its own problems as well. Qubits can’t provide an exact 0 or 1 as an answer, and this leads to errors in calculation. But here is where IonQ steps in. It’s easily interconnected qubits boost computational accuracy. IonQ’s use of trapped ions is less error-prone than the man-made qubits that many of its competitors are utilizing. This trapped-ion method for quantum computing operates at room temperature, unlike other methods that require absolute zero, which curtails costs.
More Reasons to Be Bullish About IonQ
IonQ’s quantum-as-a-service (QaaS) model helps seamlessly integrate its systems into main cloud infrastructures, including Amazon.com, Inc.’s AWS, Microsoft Corp.’s Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s GCP. The company has also enhanced its presence in the quantum space by acquiring several companies, including Oxford Ionics, Lightsynq, Capella and partnering with Sweden’s Einride.
The Oxford Ionics acquisition was the recent one, as it got approved by the UK Investment Security Unit (“ISU”). This acquisition will help IonQ aim for 10,000 physical qubits with 99.99999% accuracy by 2027 and scale to 2 million qubits by 2030, citing investors.ionq.com. This means that the chances of errors in the future will be minuscule, which is vital for building comprehensive quantum computers."

Many of these technology giants use AI not only to cut costs or boost efficiency, but to help transform entire industries and build platforms that are likely to be the drivers of global expansion over the next decade.
For investors with a long-term mindset, the smartest move now is to target the best of these businesses based on their proven cutting-edge technologies, scale, and long-term vision. Let's highlight two of these AI players taking a leading role and find out why they are well-positioned to create significant value in the long run.
1. Nvidia
Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is the undisputable leader in the global AI infrastructure market. The company's cutting-edge GPUs have become the backbone of AI workloads worldwide and help power massive cloud data centers and enterprise AI applications.
Nvidia's recent financial performance highlights its business momentum. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended July 27, 2025), revenue surged 56% year over year to $46.7 billion, driven by explosive demand for its new Blackwell platform. The company began production shipments of its new Blackwell Ultra GB300 racks in the second quarter, marking a smooth transition from the earlier GB200 systems. Net income was also up 59% year over year to $26.2 billion.
Nvidia has transformed itself from a gaming-focused GPU provider to a full-stack AI platform player. Beyond hardware, the company has built a strong competitive moat with its proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) parallel computing software platform, used to optimally program GPUs. With over 5.9 million developers using CUDA worldwide, the company has created an exceptionally strong developer ecosystem that raises switching costs for clients.
Nvidia has also made rapid advances in AI-optimized networking solutions. Management highlighted that NVLink 72, an advanced interconnect architecture used in Blackwell AI platform, enables each rack (enclosure used to organize multiple data center servers) to operate as a single computer, significantly improving efficiency for reasoning and agentic AI workloads -- an advantage that is becoming critical as data centers face power constraints.
Nvidia is also focusing on opportunities in areas such as robotics, automotive, and automation. Spending on AI infrastructure globally is projected to be somewhere between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by the end of the decade. Nvidia is well-positioned to be a key recipient of this spending.
Although the company trades at a rich valuation of 39.5 times forward earnings, Nvidia's robust growth prospects make it an exceptional pick for long-term investors -- even at elevated valuation levels.
2. Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) is positioning itself as a foundational platform in the AI-powered economy, building a comprehensive ecosystem of AI products and large-scale technology infrastructure. Once known primarily for its productivity suite and Windows operating system, the company is now embedding Copilot virtual AI assistant and agentic AI capabilities across its core offerings. Subsequently, the company is reshaping how clients organize and execute workflows.
Copilot (across all applications) counts over 100 million monthly active users, and its backend is powered by GPT-5. The company expects Copilot to help users connect with specialized AI agents for solving business challenges.
Microsoft is also strengthening the cloud, data, and model infrastructure that powers Copilot and the growing ecosystem of AI products. The company's Azure computing business, which forms the hardware layer of its technology infrastructure, crossed an annualized run rate of $75 billion, up 34% year over year at the end of the second quarter. Although the company has built over 400 Azure data centers across 70 regions and has added over 2 gigawatts of new capacity in the past year, it is still seeing demand outpacing supply. This highlights the growth potential in the data center space.
Microsoft Fabric, an AI-powered data and analytics platform, is rapidly gaining traction, with revenue soaring 55% year over year in the second quarter. The company is also positioning Azure AI Foundry as the model layer to help clients build and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Foundry was used by over 80% of the Fortune 500, while the Foundry Agent services are powering agent development at more than 14,000 enterprises.
Microsoft's security offerings are also strengthening its business. The security business caters to nearly 1.5 million customers and had already generated over $20 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended June 30, 2023). The security business will become even more significant, as the rising adoption of generative AI has also added new ways in which hackers can break into an enterprise system. Additionally, it is also tightly integrated into Copilot and the Microsoft 365 suite, which further strengthens its value proposition.
Microsoft trades at about 37.4 times forward earnings. This rich valuation, however, is supported by its accelerating AI-driven growth. With rising Copilot adoption, expanding Azure scale, and a fast-growing security business, it is proving to be a smart buy for long-term investors."

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the agreement represented “a general step change” in Britain’s relationship with the US that would deliver “growth, security and opportunity up and down the country”.
The “tech prosperity deal”, announced as Mr Trump arrived in the UK on Tuesday night, will see the UK and US co-operate in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and nuclear power.
It comes alongside £31 billion of investment in Britain from America’s top technology companies, including 30 billion dollars (£22 billion) from Microsoft.
Microsoft’s investment, the largest ever made by the company in the UK, will fund an expansion of Britain’s AI infrastructure, which Labour sees as a key part of its efforts to secure economic growth, and the construction of the country’s largest AI supercomputer.

The Prime Minister said: “This tech prosperity deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US, shaping the futures of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and delivering growth, security and opportunity up and down the country.”
The build-up to Mr Trump’s second state visit has already seen London and Washington announce a deal on co-operating on building new nuclear power stations, and a £5 billion investment by Google in Britain’s AI sector.
It also follows the agreement of an economic deal in May this year that covered a reduction in some tariffs imposed by Mr Trump in April, although plans to eliminate US tariffs on British steel have now been shelved."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-17T09:30:00,1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia Microsoft and Apple in the $2 Trillion Club by 2028,This company is at the heart of the AI boom -- can the shares double in three years?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7a43c1f490bd5cc9d90267b003253221e8508508998ade852a858f6016361540,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-microso/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-microso/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/17/1-unstoppable-stock-that-could-join-nvidia-microso/,fool.com,200,,"Half a century ago, the idea of a $2 trillion company was unthinkable. Just consider this: In July 1975, the entire U.S. GDP barely cleared $1.7 trillion. Fast-forward to 2025, and the five largest companies in the world -- Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), Apple (AAPL 0.54%), Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), and Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) -- individually command valuations at or above that.
At the moment, two companies are within a few hundred billion of the $2 trillion mark. These are Meta (META 1.20%), $1.9 trillion, and Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), $1.7 trillion.
But there's another company that looks strong enough to cross the $2 trillion mark by 2028, or even sooner than that. Indeed, it's a company without which several tech giants would lose their dominance: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). Here's why I think its market cap of about $1 trillion will double in three years.
Why TSMC fits the $2 trillion thesis
TSMC is the world's first and largest pure-play semiconductor foundry. What that means is simply this: Instead of designing chips, TSMC manufactures them for hundreds of clients. These clients include other trillion-dollar companies, like Nvidia and Apple, as well as semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%).
Just how dominant TSMC is in the foundry industry can be summed up by two pieces of data: TSMC commands about 70% of the global foundry market (according to data by research firm TrendForce), and it held about 35% of the expanded foundry market for more advanced chips in the first quarter of 2025 (according to Counterpoint Research).
To put it another way, TSMC's second-quarter 2025 foundry revenue was more than $30 billion. The foundry revenue of its closest competitor, Samsung, was about $3.16 billion, according to TrendForce.
TSMC has been dominating the foundry scene since Dr. Morris Chang founded the company in 1987. Superior execution by Chang and his successors has dug TSMC a deep competitive moat in the advanced chip industry. The company is often the first (or sole) supplier for some of the most advanced chips on the market.
What needs to happen for TSMC to hit a $2 trillion valuation by 2028
By now, it's clear that TSMC is in firm control of the foundry market. But the question still remains: Can this company's market cap really double in three years?
One back-of-the-envelope way to answer this is by looking at the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). At today's price, TSMC is trading at about 22 times earnings. If we keep that multiple the same, the company needs to double its net income (projected to hit about $48 billion in 2025) to about $90 billion to $100 billion by 2028.
On paper, that doesn't sound all that outlandish. Indeed, Wall Street is already forecasting high-teens percentage revenue growth through 2027, and TSMC's margins are some of the best in the business. If TSMC can keep a stronghold on the chipmaking industry, its current trajectory could be enough to get it to the $2 trillion mark by late 2028 or early 2029.
TSM Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
But I don't want to make it sound as if this will be a walk in the park. TSMC doesn't operate in a vacuum, and several headwinds could knock the company off course. Geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan is an ongoing concern and was the reason Warren Buffett cited when he sold most of his TSMC stock a couple of years ago. Likewise, the current geopolitical rift between China and the U.S. could cause problems for TSMC down the road. It's notable, for instance, that the U.S. recently revoked fast-track export licenses for shipping U.S. chipmaking equipment to TSMC's main plant in China.
At the same time, TSMC stands at the center of one of the most exciting developments in technology: artificial intelligence. As AI models get larger and computing needs explode, demand for TSMC's most advanced chips only grows. This should be even more the case when it starts producing 2-nanometer chips, which, according to TSMC, will consume 25% to 30% less power than its 3nm chips, even when configured to run at the same speeds.
Whether that's enough to outweigh political risks and other headwinds is an open question. Still, if tailwinds hold and the company keep producing at today's rates, $2 trillion in three years isn't out of reach at all."

- Quantexa designed an AML solution for mid-size and community banks.
- It can help them identify crypto-powered crime, according to Quantexa's Christopher Bagnall.
- Stablecoin legislation is expected to unlock new competitors.
Quantexa, a data and analytics software firm, introduced a product on Wednesday that’s intended to help smaller financial institutions fight crypto-powered crime in the U.S.
The London-based company is now offering a cloud-based, anti-money laundering (AML) solution through Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, which is “designed specifically for U.S. mid-size and community banks,” according to a press release.
Quantexa said the pre-packaged product allows teams investigating financial crimes to make faster decisions with less overhead while maintaining accuracy, noting that banks are held to the same compliance standards across the U.S., despite what resources they may have. The product, dubbed Cloud AML, is also meant to reduce “false positives.”
A company survey published earlier this month found that 36% of AML professionals think digital assets will have the biggest impact on the AML industry within the next five years.
The product’s debut follows the passage of stablecoin legislation in the U.S. this summer that’s expected to unlock competition from the likes of Bank of Ameerica and Citigroup. With federal rules in place, stablecoins are expected to become more mainstream.
Some banks are taking a forward-looking approach toward their products, but most are more concerned about the ability to monitor inflows and outflows within the context of financial crime, Chris Bagnall, Quantexa’s head of financial crimes solutions for North America, told Decrypt.
“They're just trying to find a way to monitor it, and that's pretty much it,” he said. “Only the most innovative banks, which is a small handful in this space, are focused on making it a business.”
Banks may be able to see that a customer received or sent cash from a cryptocurrency exchange, but where the funds came from beyond that could be a blind spot, Bagnall said. If stablecoins become more common in everyday payments, then infrastructure providers could also emerge as common touch points, as funds flow between digital and traditional rails.
In some ways, stablecoins are prompting banks to take a more comprehensive view of their exposure to crypto-related risks, Bagnall said. In the past, banks knew what they were getting into if approached by a crypto-native firm, but those same factors can apply to individuals."

Microsoft has pledged its biggest ever investment in the UK with $30 billion (£22 billion) committed over the next four years.
Brad Smith, Microsoft’s vice chair & president said half the money would be dedicated to capital expenditure on the UK’s cloud and AI infrastructure.
It will include building the country’s largest supercomputer — with more than 23,000 NVIDIA GPUs — in partnership with Nscale.
The announcement is the latest in a series timed to coincide with President Trump’s second state visit to the UK.
Yesterday Google opened its data centre in Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, as part of a two-year £5 billion investment in the UK.
Today Smith said:”The relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States has long been more than a matter of diplomacy — it’s a friendship rooted in shared ideals and mutual ambition. Across generations, our countries have stood shoulder to shoulder — economically, politically, and in a shared pursuit of innovation. From the Atlantic Charter to the digital age, the UK and the US have pursued the power of partnership.
“Today, this alliance enters another new chapter, as we work together to expand access to trusted American technology and strengthen the infrastructure that will drive economic growth and technological advancement in the AI era.”
Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:“Microsoft’s landmark investment is a powerful vote of confidence in UK’s leadership in AI and cutting-edge technology.
“This commitment will not only strengthen our digital infrastructure and support thousands of highly skilled jobs, but also ensure Britain remains at the forefront of global innovation as we deliver on our Plan for Change.
“We are proud to partner with world-leading companies like Microsoft to build a future powered by British ingenuity and ambition.”

Microsoft said the capital investment “will also expand our datacenter footprint to meet growing AI demand and adoption from customers across every sector in the UK — from Barclays, the NHS, the London Stock Exchange Group, the Premier League, Vodafone, UK Met Office, Unilever, and Wayve – customers that are rapidly embracing AI to transform their businesses.
“Vodafone has expanded Microsoft Copilot to 68,000 employees worldwide after seeing productivity gains of four hours per week during its pilot. Barclays is rolling out Copilot to 100,000 colleagues and integrating it into its own tools to unlock insights and efficiency, while developers at the London Stock Exchange Group are using GitHub Copilot and Windows 365 to dramatically accelerate secure, trusted application development.”
The other half of the investment will go to supporting Microsoft’s ongoing operations across the UK, where it employs 6,000 people."

Microsoft announcing a major investment in the United Kingdom, just before President Trump is set to land in the UK for a state visit. Microsoft president and vice chair, Brad Smith, saying in a statement, the investment will total $30 billion over four years, saying it is the largest investment in the country ever. Half the investment is on building out the UK's cloud and AI infrastructure. Microsoft CEO Sati Nadella also speaking in a new video, saying the company is committed to creating new opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic. This announcement is the latest in a string of similar moves from American companies ahead of the president's trip. Alphabet just announced, you remember, a $6.8 billion investment on Monday.
Dan Howley, still with me. Dan, the Howley take on these headlines. What do you make of it?
Uh look, I think that, you know, one of the things that uh if you look at, we have the the Microsoft uh 30 billion, 15 billion going to capital expenditures, uh 23,000 advanced GPUs. Uh no real name there as to uh which ones they are, but they say they're working with N scale to to build them out. Uh it would be the largest uh supercomputer in the UK. Uh and I think, you know, one of the things to look at first and foremost is this isn't, you know, the first time a European country's gotten this kind of uh play when it comes to AI and companies looking to build out AI. France uh had their own conference where there was a lot of talk of building out their AI uh over the summer. The other thing is, obviously this is uh a race to see who could have released their their uh announcements first, either Google or Microsoft. Google with their uh 5 billion pound announcement, which works out to about $6.8 billion. Uh Microsoft coming later but just kind of dunking on them saying, oh, we got 30 billion. What's what's going on there? Um, and I I do think it also though speaks to how important it is to not just have AI business in the US, but to building it out globally. You got to think these things are just like regular data centers, right? You you need to connect, you need to connect at the speed of light. The further away something is, the more time it's going to take to get an answer. People in the UK want to get answers. They don't want to have to wait for something to come from Ohio. So they build them there. So we're going to see more of these buildouts across the globe and I think that this is just just the start of it.
All right, thank you, Dan. Appreciate it."

- An analysis suggests two Wisconsin data centers could use more energy than all the state's homes combined.
- The estimate assumes constant power demand, so actual usage may be lower.
- Three other proposed data centers have not yet disclosed their estimated energy consumption.
- Developers have stated the projects will not affect local residents' utility rates.
Wisconsin's approved data center projects may consume more energy than all households in the state combined, according to an analysis from environmental advocacy organization Clean Wisconsin.
The analysis combined energy use estimates provided for Microsoft's data center in Mount Pleasant and the Vantage data center in Port Washington. Together, the two projects totaled 3.9 gigawatts of power, or enough to power 4.3 million Wisconsin homes, according to the report.
There are 2.82 million housing units in Wisconsin, according to U.S. Census data.
The report noted that the data centers' actual power usage may be lower because the analysis assumed that they operated 24 hours a day with a constant power demand.
Three more data center projects have been proposed or approved across the state, but they have not disclosed estimated energy consumption, according to Clean Wisconsin.
""Because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built,” said Clean Wisconsin Science Program Director Paul Mathewson, who conducted the analysis.
Data centers power much of the online world, including social media, cloud storage, banking and artificial intelligence, through computers housed in secure, temperature-controlled buildings. Vantage's Port Washington campus stretches 1,600 acres with another 300 acres set aside for future expansion. The Microsoft data center is on roughly 1,900 acres of land.
The Port Washington data center alone is projected to have a capacity of 3.5 gigawatts by the time it fully comes online in 2030. Microsoft has not disclosed the energy capacity of the Mount Pleasant project's full buildout, but phase one is estimated to use as much as 0.45 gigawatts.
We Energies spokesperson Brendan Conway said the utility company has submitted a proposal with the Public Service Commission to create a separate electricity rate for large customers like the Port Washington data center. The proposal is meant to ensure that other ratepayers are not saddled with costs associated with building power plants and electric infrastructure necessary for power-hungry data centers.
""These large customers will directly pay for the power they consume, along with costs of the power generation plants and distribution facilities built to serve them,"" Conway said. ""We designed the rate to make sure no costs to serve these new customers will be subsidized by, or shifted to, other residential or business customers.""
Microsoft declined to comment on the analysis from Clean Wisconsin but it has been taking steps to minimize the power to cool its facilities according to its 2025 sustainability report.
According to the company it has “doubled our rate of power savings and are transitioning from traditional air-cooled datacenters to chip-level liquid cooling designs at all owned datacenters.”
“One key initiative, power harvesting, maximizes the use of our available power by reallocating unused power from workloads that do not consume their full power allocation,” the report states. “Despite increased demands from AI workloads over the past year, Microsoft has doubled our rate of power savings, scaling this approach across our datacenter.”
Developers have previously said the data centers will not impact nearby residents' water and utility rates.
In a statement released Sept. 16, Clean Wisconsin criticized developers and utility companies for what it called a lack of transparency regarding the impact of data centers on local energy and water supplies. Another environmental group sued the city of Racine on Sept. 15 to disclose the Mount Pleasant data center's projected water use.
Conway said developers they ""are committed to paying their fair share"" for energy.

On September 9, BWS Financial raised the firm’s price target on Nebius to $130 from $90, while keeping a Buy rating on the shares after the company announced its first hyperscaler contract worth ~$19.4 billion with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) over 5 years.
With Nebius having a major contract in hand, the company is expected to accelerate GPU installations and bring New Jersey online as fast as possible. Earlier in August, Nebius Group reported its financial results for Q2 2025. The company announced an increase in revenue, which more than doubled from the previous quarter, and was up 625% year-over-year to $105.1 million. This was driven by strong demand for its AI cloud infrastructure.
Nebius’s core AI infrastructure business became EBITDA positive ahead of its own projections and is expected to remain so throughout the year, though the overall group is forecasted to be EBITDA negative for the full year. For the full year, the company’s annualized run-rate revenue guidance was raised to a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion for the end of 2025, up from a previous guidance of $750 million to $1 billion.
Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) is a technology company that builds full-stack infrastructure to service the global AI industry in the Netherlands, Europe, North America, and Israel.

Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best ESG stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. On September 12, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI is close to finalizing a governance overhaul that would convert it into a more conventional for-profit structure, while granting its nonprofit arm an equity stake of at least $100 billion. Bret Taylor, Chairman of OpenAI’s board, stated that the nonprofit will maintain controlling authority through a new public benefit corporation, ensuring oversight of OpenAI’s long-term mission.

The stake, which could grow beyond the $100 billion floor, would translate into roughly 20% ownership if the company proceeds with an employee share sale valuing OpenAI at $500 billion. That transaction would cement its status as the world’s most valuable startup.
The move follows months of negotiations with Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest backer, whose approval was critical to advancing the restructuring. For Microsoft, the deal preserves deep integration rights for OpenAI’s tools and helped ease investor concerns, with a positive reaction to share prices.
The story gained prominence in early May when OpenAI discussed its plans to restructure its for-profit division as a public benefit corporation. Given the implications for both OpenAI and Microsoft, we had also highlighted this development in our June 24 article, Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops and sells a wide range of software, cloud services, devices, and business solutions, serving both individual users and enterprise customers worldwide.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the segment delivered $29.9 billion in revenues, up 26% year over year, while Azure and other cloud services rallied 39%, well ahead of estimates. This growth was driven by strong enterprise demand and the rapid adoption of AI workloads across Microsoft’s cloud ecosystem.
Recent innovations further strengthen this trajectory. The rollout of GPT-5 across Azure AI Foundry and Copilot, the opening of a new datacenter region in Austria, and enhancements to Microsoft Fabric for AI readiness all reinforce Microsoft’s ability to capture rising AI demand.
AI continues to be the primary growth engine. Azure continues to see strong demand for AI infrastructure, while GitHub Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption highlight how AI and cloud are converging into sticky, revenue-generating productivity tools. These developments deepen customer engagement and reinforce Microsoft’s competitive moat, giving investors strong confidence in continued upside.
Looking ahead, management guided Intelligent Cloud revenues of $30.1-$30.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, signaling continued strength. According to the Zacks model, Intelligent Cloud revenues are projected to rise 20.7% in fiscal 2026 and 21.2% in fiscal 2027, supporting a durable long-term outlook.
Microsoft’s confidence is also evident in its record $24.2 billion in capital expenditures, with plans to raise this to $30 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 to expand AI infrastructure and data centers. With deep AI investments, strategic partnerships and strong enterprise adoption, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud is well-positioned to deliver consistent upside and cement leadership in the AI-powered cloud era.
Microsoft Faces Rising Cloud Competition
Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the cloud market with 30-32% share, unmatched scale, 200-plus services and a massive $100 billion in annual infrastructure spend. Still, Amazon trails Microsoft Azure in enterprise and hybrid adoption. Although Amazon’s breadth and legacy remain powerful strengths, surging innovation from Microsoft and Google is eroding AWS’ edge, raising questions about its ability to defend long-term leadership in the fast-shifting cloud and AI race.
Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform is rapidly gaining ground, posting 32% annual growth and $13.6 billion in quarterly revenues in the second quarter of 2025. Fueled by AI infrastructure demand, Google Cloud leverages TPUs, Vertex AI and Gemini to strengthen its competitive edge. Partnerships with leaders like NVIDIA and PayPal are accelerating enterprise adoption. With expanding global data centers and robust security, Google Cloud is positioning itself as a serious rival to Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS in the evolving cloud market."

Price Performance
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The momentum can be attributed to overall strong AI demand trends as well as company-specific developments. Yesterday, CoreWeave announced a new order form with an initial value of $6.3 billion under its existing Master Services Agreement (originally dated April 10, 2023) with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. Under this arrangement, NVDA will be purchasing residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions. Shares of CoreWeave rose 7.6% following the announcement on Sept 15, 2025.
Before that, last week, CRWV announced the launch of a Ventures Group to invest in AI start-ups and position itself at the forefront of the AI wave. Investing in start-ups will aid CRWV to gain access to the latest technologies and strengthen its competitive moat against the other players in the AI infrastructure space. It is also set to purchase OpenPipe, which focuses on training AI agents with reinforcement learning.
Now, the question arises whether this momentum has the staying power. Let’s unpack the company’s fundamentals and challenges to determine if staying invested is a smart move.
CRWV is a Key Beneficiary of the AI Infra Boom
With its GPU-based cloud services tailored specifically for AI workloads, CRWV is at the center of the AI infrastructure boom. Management has raised 2025 revenue guidance to $5.15-$5.35 billion compared $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion projected earlier, citing accelerating demand and a robust pipeline.
Strategic partnerships with major players, such as OpenAI and NVIDIA, bode well, along with a massive $30.1 billion revenue backlog. On the last earnings call, management had highlighted a $4 billion expansion with OpenAI, adding to the previously announced $11.9 billion deal and onboarding of a new hyperscaler customer that expanded within the quarter. OpenAI’s (which is a leading AI company) massive contract not only enhances revenue visibility for CRWV but also validates its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable.
CoreWeave’s partnership with NVIDIA is a big plus. CoreWeave was one of the first cloud providers to deliver NVIDIA H100, H200, and GH200 clusters into production for AI workloads. The company's cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems and entered into a multiyear contract with Moonvalley (an AI video generation startup) for the same earlier in the year. It also deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its “Mission Control” for reliability and performance."

President's Trump's latest idea to scrap quarterly earnings in favor of semi-annual reports is stirring debate across corporate America.
""I think I'd be OK either way,"" Okta (OKTA) CEO Todd McKinnon said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. ""I do like the opportunity to talk to investors every quarter about the business and the future and the vision of what we're trying to do.""
Still, he added, ""I do think sometimes the industry gets too obsessed with the quarterly numbers ... from a single quarter.""
For McKinnon, a good balance would involve reporting a little less frequently ""but having long-term strategic conversations with investors.""
Okta posted Q2 earnings that beat on its top and bottom lines, fueled in part by global organizations and government agencies. Revenue hit $728 million, topping consensus estimates of $711 million, according to Bloomberg data. Earnings per share came in $0.91, versus $0.84 expected.
The company raised its full-year revenue outlook to between $2.875 billion and $2.885 billion, a 10% to 11% year-over-year increase. However, its Q3 forecast was more cautious: $728 million to $730 million in revenue, or 9% to 10% growth.
Its shares are up 14% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 13% advance.
Trump's call for eliminating quarterly numbers comes at an awkward time for a company like Okta. It's still carving out market share against giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), which means quarterly execution is exactly what investors want to scrutinize. With the stock trading around $90, well below its pandemic-era high of over $290, patience for long-term promises may be limited.
Analysts are mixed on how much slack investors should cut.
JPMorgan's Brian Essex struck an optimistic tone. In a research note after meeting with Okta executives, he highlighted record pipeline levels, strong public sector wins, and a push to consolidate the fragmented identity market.
Essex reiterated an Overweight rating and $92.77 price target, but cautioned that closing those deals and translating them into sustained growth remains key.
Evercore ISI analyst Peter Levine called Okta's quarter ""well executed"" and flagged its $100 million acquisition of Axiom Security as a potential differentiator in the fledgling AI security market.
He argued the deal bolsters Okta's private access management capabilities, which could become a ""key identity layer"" as companies rush to deploy AI agents. His firm issued an Outperform rating with a $130 target price."

The bank explained that the company lifted its quarterly dividend by eight cents to $0.91 per share, or $3.64 annualized, pushing the yield to 0.7% from 0.6%.
Morgan Stanley said the move “supports a durable strong teens and total return profile at MSFT, framing an attractive risk/reward. Remain OW.”
The bank noted the raise was “in line with prior 5-year average at ~10%,” consistent with Microsoft’s history of annual increases between 8% and 11% over the past decade.
Beyond dividends, Morgan Stanley highlighted Microsoft’s substantial buyback capacity.
The firm pointed out that “over $55 billion [remains] in current share repurchase authorization suggesting buybacks to continue.”
As of June 30, 2025, Microsoft held more than $90 billion in cash and short-term investments and is expected to generate more than $70 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2026.
Microsoft repurchased $13 billion of stock in fiscal 2025, excluding shares used for tax settlement, and Morgan Stanley expects “slightly higher levels on repurchases in FY26.”
As of the end of June, $57.3 billion remained from its most recent $60 billion program. Microsoft has also “been able to reduce its weighted-average diluted shares outstanding every fiscal year since FY 2005.”
Morgan Stanley added that the dividend yield is “just one component of capital return” within a broader investment case.
The bank forecasts “mid-teens revenue growth” and a 16% EPS compound annual growth rate through fiscal 2028, supporting what it called an “attractive 17% total-return profile at Microsoft.”

Much of the momentum stems from its recent AI infrastructure deal with Microsoft Corporation MSFT, with the stock surging 42% since the announcement on Sept 8.
But with such steep near-term gains, the natural question arises: Should investors stay invested or take profits off the table and exit?
Let’s unpack the company’s fundamentals and challenges to ascertain the best course of action.
MSFT Deal & Other Tailwinds
Based in Amsterdam, Nebius is a specialized AI infrastructure neo cloud company. The demand for AI infrastructure has exploded in 2025, fueled by the increasing usage of generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing applications. In the last reported quarter, NBIS revenues surged 625% year over year to $105.1 million. AI cloud infrastructure revenues grew more than nine times year over year, driven by demand for copper GPUs and near-peak GPU utilization.
As companies build GPU-intensive data centers, Nebius emerges as one of the key beneficiaries. The recent deal with MSFT involves NBIS providing dedicated GPU capacity to Microsoft from its new data center in Vineland, NJ, beginning later this year. The GPU services will roll out in several tranches during 2025 and 2026, with the agreement valued at approximately $17.4 billion through 2031. Microsoft could also purchase extra services or capacity as per the terms of the deal, which would raise the total value to around $19.4 billion.
While this represents NBIS’ first major long-term contract with a big tech firm, the company has indicated that more multi-faceted deals will likely follow, further solidifying its capacity and reach in the booming AI cloud space.
NBIS’ partnership with NVDA (also an investor in the company) is another plus. With the new Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and its data center capacity expanding significantly in parallel, the company expects a substantial increase in sales by year-end.

Nebius plans to secure 220 megawatts (“MW”) of connected power (active or ready for GPU deployment), including 100 MW of active power by 2025. This also includes new data centers in the U.K., Israel and capacity expansion in Finland. The 1 GW capacity target by 2026 positions Nebius to capture incremental upside from accelerating demand for AI compute. On the last earnings call, NBIS highlighted that it is scaling up capacity and is also “able to sell it quickly”."

The brokerage set a $180 price target on the stock, saying the company is well positioned as large cloud providers increasingly rent GPU clusters instead of building them in-house.
Outsourcing is accelerating faster than expected, with Oracle’s blowout $455 billion backlog and reports of a $17 billion Microsoft contract with rival Nebius.
The firm now estimates the GPUaaS market could expand from just $3-4 billion today to as much as $300 billion by 2030, with CoreWeave among the key beneficiaries.
CoreWeave had an agreement with Nvidia for $6.3 billion for master service, under which Nvidia agreed to buy unused capacity, further boosts visibility on demand.
CoreWeave’s shares have slumped about 30% since its second earnings report on concerns over margin compression in the second half of 2025.
Citizens said investor sensitivity remains high but believes the scale of new outsourcing deals should outweigh near-term pressure.
Analysts cautioned that longer-term issues remain, including pricing pressure as contracts mature and the risk of the GPUaaS market eventually resembling the commoditized content delivery network business. But the immediate upside from hyperscale demand is too strong to ignore.
“Despite what we believe to be obvious disconnects with investors, we think the volume of the business available will allow the company to reset expectations with investors,” analysts at Citizens said.
CoreWeave’s software-light model is often misunderstood, analysts added.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a press conference Monday that the two countries agreed on a framework for a TikTok deal during high-stakes trade talks in Madrid. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to speak on Friday to ""complete"" the agreement.
A US buyer for TikTok has not been officially named. The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday, citing unnamed sources, that a consortium of investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz, would control TikTok's US business with an 80% stake under the current framework. TikTok's existing US users would be asked to move to a new app the company is testing, and Oracle would handle the user data on its servers in Texas.
Oracle did not respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.
The stock climbed as much as 6% Tuesday before paring gains as the major stock indexes pulled back from record highs.
The tech firm's stock first climbed on Monday, spiking as much as 5% in premarket trading when Trump initially hinted at a TikTok deal on social media.
""The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""A deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""

TikTok faces a US ban unless it divests its ownership to a US- or US-allied country by Dec. 16.
Politico reported in March that the White House was considering a deal from software giant Oracle to run TikTok, but that deal could leave ByteDance some control over the app, according to the Information.
Oracle already has a relationship with TikTok, and its servers have been used to store TikTok's American user data as part of an initiative called Project Texas since 2022.
Oracle has also worked closely with the Trump administration on its push to develop AI in the US. The tech firm's chair, Larry Ellison, joined OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank Group (SFTBY) CEO Masayoshi Son, and Trump in January at the Oval Office to announce a $500 billion initiative, called Stargate, to build AI data centers in the US — though the project has faced delays.
While Oracle has emerged as a leading contender to acquire TikTok, other suitors have also expressed interest in buying the social media company, from a group of investors led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. to Microsoft (MSFT), Perplexity AI, and YouTuber Mr. Beast."

By Pritam Biswas
(Reuters) - AI robotics company Figure said on Tuesday it had received over $1 billion in committed capital in its latest funding round that valued the firm at $39 billion post money.
The Series C round was led by Parkway Venture Capital, and also saw participation from industry majors such as Nvidia, Intel Capital, LG Technology Ventures, Salesforce, T-Mobile Ventures, and Qualcomm Ventures.
Venture capital firms have been pouring massive amounts into companies that leverage artificial intelligence, helping them stay private for longer.
U.S. startup funding is set to hit its second-highest total on record, up 75.6% in the first half of 2025, driven by the ongoing AI surge, according to a report by Pitchbook.
Figure's new funding round also valued the autonomous robot developer sharply higher than the $2.6 billion last year, when it secured $675 million from investors such as Microsoft and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.
""Investors increasingly view humanoids in the same league as foundational AI models or EVs,"" said Ali Javaheri, emerging technology analyst at PitchBook.
""The surge in VC interest in humanoids is being driven by structural demand-side factors like aging workforces and geopolitical competition, paired with supply-side advances in AI software and hardware breakthroughs.""
Startups and major tech companies such as Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla are racing to develop humanoid robots to tackle labor shortages and handle repetitive, hazardous tasks in logistics, manufacturing and household chores.
San Jose, California-based Figure will use the capital to scale humanoid robots into homes and commercial operations, build on its infrastructure to accelerate training and simulation, and double down on its data collection efforts.
""This milestone is critical to unlocking the next stage of growth for humanoid robots, scaling out our AI platform Helix and BotQ manufacturing,"" Figure founder and CEO Brett Adcock said.
Figure's funding round also saw investment from other big investors such as Brookfield Asset Management, Macquarie Capital, Align Ventures and Tamarack Global.

""For grocers, every second your team spends navigating systems or questioning the accuracy of data is a second lost,"" Schafer said. ""Agentic AI can dramatically reduce the time it takes to get answers and take action, but it is imperative that those agents are tightly tethered to a single version of the truth.""

The dividend boost comes on the heels of strong quarterly results. In July, Microsoft reported fourth-quarter revenue of $76.44 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The revenue total beat a Street consensus estimate of $73.80. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $3.65, beating a Street consensus estimate of $3.37.
For the first quarter, Microsoft expects sales in a range of $74.70 billion to $75.80 billion versus $74.07 billion analyst estimate.
Analysts have highlighted Microsoft’s cloud and artificial intelligence momentum as key growth drivers. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives described the company’s fourth-quarter results as “eye-popping,” citing strong demand for cloud services and AI products.
“Microsoft delivered strong fourth quarter results with strong guidance to start the year as the company’s ‘shining moment’ is now underway with AI already changing the growth trajectory of MSFT’s cloud growth story,” Ives said.
He pointed to the launch of Azure AI Foundry as particularly important for enterprise adoption, adding that fiscal 2026 could be the company’s “true inflection year” for AI-driven growth. “We believe Microsoft is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front,” he said.
Other analysts have echoed that optimism. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey maintained an Overweight rating and raised his price forecast from $581 to $639.
Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated an Outperform rating and lifted his forecast from $600 to $630. KeyBanc analyst Jackson Ader upgraded the stock to Overweight with a $630 forecast.

TAMPA, Fla., September 16, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Syncro, provider of the first Extended Monitoring and Management (XMM)™ platform for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and IT professionals, today launched Syncro Cloud Backup, an integrated backup and restore solution for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID. Building on Syncro XMM’s automated configuration, security-baseline management and compliance monitoring, the new service helps MSPs and IT teams protect users and identities and ensure rapid recovery from data loss or identity threats.
In a recent IDC survey, 60% of organizations reported that they had experienced unrecoverable data loss during the past 12 months. Identity systems, such as Microsoft Entra ID, are frequent attack targets. Without protection, a single misstep or cyberattack can cripple access and security. Syncro Cloud Backup allows rapid restoration of roles, policies and permissions with just a few clicks.
""Microsoft Entra ID is the digital backbone of your business identity and if it’s compromised in a cyberattack, your entire organization is at risk,"" said Jay McBain, chief analyst at Canalys. ""That’s why securing, backing up and ensuring rapid recovery of Microsoft Entra ID isn’t optional; it’s one of the most critical steps any company can take to recover from a breach. By embedding Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID backup into its platform, Syncro enables MSPs to strengthen compliance and deliver rapid recovery to ensure necessary business continuity.""
Microsoft Entra ID is a core component of Microsoft's security solutions, enabling organizations to enforce policies and secure access across various environments.
""Safeguarding identity infrastructure and business data is essential to keeping organizations running without disruption,"" said Matt Lee, senior director of security and compliance at Pax8. ""By embedding Microsoft 365 and Entra ID backup into their platform, Syncro is simplifying MSP operations while enabling them to deliver more resilient computing environments for their clients.""
Key Benefits of Syncro Cloud Backup include:
-
Unified management: MSPs can configure and restore backups for Microsoft Entra ID infrastructure, such as users, groups, roles and policies, as well as Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive and Microsoft Teams.
-
Automated provisioning & billing: New users are added automatically to the backup service; invoicing stays accurate and MSPs can automatically capture all revenue.
-
Strengthened security & compliance: Organizations can address cyber insurance requirements with encrypted data stored in Microsoft Azure datacenters in the United States or Canada.
-
Rapid restore capabilities: Teams can quickly recover from data loss incidents with flexible, granular restores for everything from a single email or file to an entire business’ Microsoft Entra ID configuration.
-
Predictable pricing: Customers pay a per-user, per-month fee that includes unlimited storage under a fair use policy, eliminating complex calculations and hidden costs."

Successfully completed AI pilot with Microsoft – now live – boosts fraud detection
FLORHAM PARK, N.J., September 16, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Conduent Incorporated (Nasdaq: CNDT), a global technology-driven business solutions and services company, is embedding generative AI (GenAI) and other advanced AI technologies into its suite of solutions for state and federal agencies. These technologies aim to improve the disbursement of critical government benefits, enhance the citizen experience, and fortify fraud prevention across major aid programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
As part of a recently completed GenAI pilot with Microsoft – originally announced in 2024 and now fully deployed – Conduent has significantly increased its fraud detection capacity for its largest open-loop payment card programs. Because these cards can be used at a wide range of merchants, monitoring for fraud is particularly complex. Leveraging AI, a small team of specialists can now surveil tens of thousands of accounts for suspicious activity, including identity theft and account takeover with significant improvement in accuracy. This capability is in the process of being scaled to other payment card programs.
Following the pilot’s success, Conduent is now seeking to apply similar AI methodologies to help detect and prevent fraud in Medicaid and closed-loop EBT cards, including SNAP benefits – helping safeguard usage at approved retailers. A leader in government payment disbursements, Conduent currently supports electronic payments for public programs in 37 states.
""As states adapt to evolving budget constraints and eligibility requirements, AI can empower agencies to reduce fraud and improper payments while improving service delivery,"" said Anna Sever, President, Government Solutions at Conduent. ""With decades of experience supporting critical government programs, Conduent is deepening its investment in AI to expand these gains across multiple programs.""
Transforming Customer Support with AI
Conduent is also deploying AI to drive improvements in the contact center experience for public benefit recipients. A standout example is the Conduent GenAI-powered capability that equips agents with instant access to accurate, program-specific information – reducing call handling times.

The brokerage said neoclouds emerged to fill a shortage of graphics chips and electricity as demand for AI infrastructure outpaced supply at traditional hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.
Companies including Coreweave, Nebius, Lambda and Crusoe are now rushing to build data centers to meet that demand.
“These companies are seeing surging demand, filling up their data centers,” Seaport wrote, but warned that rapid growth comes with risks.
Many neoclouds began as crypto mining operations, and now face punishing economics, including steep upfront capital spending on hardware that quickly loses value.
Coreweave alone plans to spend more than $20 billion this year on data centers. Seaport said such heavy investment, coupled with customer concentration and intense competition, could make it difficult for smaller players to survive as the sector matures.
For now, hyperscalers are underwriting much of the industry’s growth by turning to neoclouds for spare capacity. But Seaport cautioned that this overflow is temporary.
“Many of these companies exist as an arbitrage opportunity to take advantage of near-term constraints, but that window will close,” the analysts said.
Over the longer term, Seaport expects wide-ranging consolidation in the sector, with only companies that maintain solid balance sheets and sustainable business models likely to carve out a lasting role.

Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Nebius Group (NBIS) is a leading artificial intelligence infrastructure company. The Netherlands-based company’s core business is Nebius, an AI-centric cloud platform built for intensive AI workloads. Nebius builds full-stack infrastructure for AI, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms and tools, and services for developers.
Nebius’ two main businesses are:
· AI Infrastructure: Mega-cap tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers to train and optimize their large language models. With so much capital at stake, they cannot build data centers fast enough and are reliant on companies like Nebius.
· AI Cloud Services: Nebius also offers its AI infrastructure as a service, allowing big tech companies to gain access to resources at a lower cost.
What Sets Nebius Apart from it’s Competitors?
What separates NBIS from most competitors is that it is vertically integrated, meaning it provides its own proprietary AI software and hardware, including servers and racks.
Nvidia Partnership is a Competitive Advantage for Nebius
Nvidia (NVDA) is the undisputed chip leader in the AI market. Simply put, if you want to run the best AI models, you need Nvidia’s GPUs. With demand soaring for NVDA GPUs, many companies do not need to wait for Nvidia’s in-demand top-of-the line technology. Not Nebius. Nvidia is both a partner and investor in Nebius. Through the agreement, Nebius enjoys priority access to Nvidia’s latest and most powerful GPUs. Meanwhile, according to the latest filings, Nvidia owns roughly ~$700 million worth of NBIS, meaning it has “skin in the game.”
Have NBIS Shares Run Too Far, Too Fast?
NBIS has a “nosebleed” price-to-sales ratio nearing 100x. Meanwhile, as the AI hype builds on Wall Street Nebius shares have exploded by nearly 400% since going public late last year.

Microsoft Deal is a Gamechanger for Nebius
If there is one lesson I have learned in my two decades of investing, it’s that traditional valuations mean little in a vacuum. Instead, investors must weigh forward growth and fundamental catalysts to get a clear picture. Because of a new bullish catalyst, Nebius is an example of a high valuation stock worth owning.
On September 9th, Nebius landed a massive multi-year deal with Microsoft (MSFT). In a contract worth a whopping $17.4 billion (with potential to get to $19.4B), Nebius will provide Microsoft with access to its Vineland, New Jersey data center, and the valuable GPUs within it."

Mehta had pointed directly to ChatGPT's rise to 700 million weekly users, along with emerging rivals like Anthropic and Perplexity, as evidence that Google no longer holds an unchallenged monopoly.
The judge concluded that generative AI technologies could be ""game changers,"" undermining the DOJ's demand that Google divest core businesses such as YouTube, Chrome, or Android. Ironically, ChatGPT — once considered a serious threat that prompted Google's internal ""Code Red"" — became proof in court that competition is intensifying in search, bolstering Google's defense.
Alphabet shares have climbed more than 30% year-to-date, doubling the Nasdaq Composite’s 15% gain.
Google is driving growth through its Cloud division, which projects at least $58 billion in added revenue over the next two years. Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's CEO, told the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference that about 55% of the unit's $106 billion backlog will convert to revenue within that period, excluding new contracts. The division already boasts an annual run rate above $50 billion, highlighting its rising importance for Alphabet.
Kurian noted that new customer sign-ups jumped 28% quarter-over-quarter, with nine of the 10 largest AI labs, including rivals OpenAI and Anthropic, choosing Google Cloud.
Although Google Cloud contributed just 14% of Alphabet's revenue last quarter, it remains one of the company's fastest-growing businesses, even outpacing Microsoft's Azure in recent quarters. Alphabet is also preparing to launch Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL) in 2026, signaling ambitions in blockchain finance that could rival Ripple's XRP Ledger.
Additionally, Google Cloud is expanding automotive partnerships to power next-generation in-car experiences, further diversifying its growth drivers.
Under CEO Sundar Pichai, the company has faced intense regulatory scrutiny and mounting AI competition from OpenAI and Perplexity."

Alphabet's shares have continued to climb, pushing the tech company's market capitalisation to a new level and the company value to more than $3 trillion (€2.55tr).
This means that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, entered a small but elite club of tech giants, worth more than $3tr. Other members include leader, Nvidia, which is valued at more than $4.2tr (€3.57tr), followed by Microsoft with an approximate $3.8tr (€3.23tr) market cap and Apple, worth $3.5tr (€3tr).
Alphabet shares received a boost in September after a long-awaited ruling in the US, concluding an antitrust case that had lasted nearly five years, in which the company avoided being forcibly broken up.
The US Department of Justice had previously demanded that Alphabet’s Google sell its Chrome browser business and potentially its Android operating system amid competition concerns. Google's search business accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.
However, a US federal judge has ruled that it doesn’t have to sell either, though the company must share data with competitors.
Alphabet's prospects appear to be promising, as the second-quarter earnings showed that demand for artificial intelligence products is lifting sales. Revenues were up 15%, better than expected.
Alphabet shares were up by more than 4% on Monday afternoon in Europe, after they had gained more than 30% since the beginning of the year."

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a press conference Monday that the two countries agreed on a framework for a TikTok deal during high-stakes trade talks in Madrid. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to speak on Friday to ""complete"" the agreement.
A US buyer for TikTok has not been officially named. The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday, citing unnamed sources, that a consortium of investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz, would control TikTok's US business with an 80% stake under the current framework. TikTok's existing US users would be asked to move to a new app the company is testing, and Oracle would handle the user data on its servers in Texas.
Oracle did not respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.
The stock climbed as much as 6% Tuesday before paring gains as the major stock indexes pulled back from record highs.
The tech firm's stock first climbed on Monday, spiking as much as 5% in premarket trading when Trump initially hinted at a TikTok deal on social media.
""The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""A deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.""

TikTok faces a US ban unless it divests its ownership to a US- or US-allied country by Dec. 16.
Politico reported in March that the White House was considering a deal from software giant Oracle to run TikTok, but that deal could leave ByteDance some control over the app, according to the Information.
Oracle already has a relationship with TikTok, and its servers have been used to store TikTok's American user data as part of an initiative called Project Texas since 2022.
Oracle has also worked closely with the Trump administration on its push to develop AI in the US. The tech firm's chair, Larry Ellison, joined OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank Group (SFTBY) CEO Masayoshi Son, and Trump in January at the Oval Office to announce a $500 billion initiative, called Stargate, to build AI data centers in the US — though the project has faced delays.
While Oracle has emerged as a leading contender to acquire TikTok, other suitors have also expressed interest in buying the social media company, from a group of investors led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. to Microsoft (MSFT), Perplexity AI, and YouTuber Mr. Beast."

Rate Optimization Challenges on Azure
Organizations face multiple challenges when optimizing rates on Azure.
-
Dynamic, cyclical workloads: Organizations often have volatile usage that cannot be easily optimized without automation.
-
Complex pricing schema: Pricing differs between Dev/Test and production environments, and organizations must take this into account when building out their rate optimization strategy.
-
Misallocated costs and savings: Organizations cannot easily allocate commitment costs and savings equitably using native tooling.
-
Differences between how resources are organized versus how they are billed: Azure organizes infrastructure resources under tenants, but a single tenant generally contains many subscriptions, each potentially tied to different billing profiles/accounts. This further complicates rate optimization.
Key Updates to ProsperOps ADM for Microsoft Azure
Building on insights from the Early Access launch in 2024, the general release of ProsperOps ADM for Microsoft Azure includes expanded capabilities and addresses the challenges above:
-
Commitments Dashboard provides advanced insights into commitment flexibility. It includes Commitment Lock-In Risk (CLR) metric and commitment burndown chart. These KPIs and visualizations complement Effective Savings Rate (ESR) outcomes from the Savings Dashboard.
-
Intelligent Showback support for Azure automatically reallocates commitment costs and savings equitably across subscriptions at a granular level for organizations using a centralized rate optimization strategy. (See blog post.)
-
Enhanced Automation for Cyclical Workloads detects cyclical usage patterns, determines optimal coverage, and executes actions quickly to maximize ESR for organizations with highly variable workloads.
-
Azure Marketplace integration enables customers to streamline procurement and billing. (See Azure Marketplace listing.)
-
Expanded support for all currencies under Microsoft Customer Agreements (MCAs) and Enterprise Agreements (MEA) means that multinational enterprises can optimize using ProsperOps."

BIDU is encountering the squeeze as rising costs erode profits just as management doubles down on AI. The pressure is visible in the margins. In the second quarter of 2025, its cost of revenues climbed nearly 12% year over year as Baidu scaled AI Cloud infrastructure, while higher operating expenses further reduced operating leverage and EBITDA. Management also warned that the advertising environment will remain soft in the third quarter, limiting near-term recovery prospects.
The financial strain is evident. Free cash flow turned negative at RMB 4.7 billion, while revenues declined 4% year over year to RMB 32.7 billion. Core online marketing, still Baidu’s largest revenue stream, dropped 15% year over year in the reported quarter, widening the gap between legacy advertising weakness and heavy AI investments.
Yet, Baidu is laying the groundwork for long-term growth, with AI Cloud momentum driven by enterprise demand, the Ernie model and Apollo Go’s autonomous ride services. By July, 64% of mobile searches already featured AI-generated content, reflecting strong user adoption even before monetization began. Backed by RMB 124 billion in cash and equivalents, the company has the resources to optimize GPU use, secure domestic chip flexibility and refine AI monetization pilots.
The broader AI market offers a powerful tailwind, with global spending projected to rise at a 35.9% compound annual growth rate through 2030, reaching $1.8 trillion, according to a Grand View Research report. For Baidu, the challenge is turning adoption into profits quickly enough to offset advertising declines. Based on these factors, current cash constraints can be viewed as a catalyst for long-term AI-powered growth.
How Global Rivals Stack Up Against BIDU
Alphabet GOOGL faces similarly large operating cost pressures as it scales up its AI/cloud infrastructure. The company has committed to invest over $85 billion in AI and cloud, driving up operating costs but fueling rapid Google Cloud growth. Alphabet’s dominant ad business, vast ecosystem and global reach provide cash flow and data advantages that Baidu lacks. With its scale, diversified revenues and ability to spread costs across services, the company maintains margin resilience. Ultimately, Alphabet’s superior resources and global dominance make it far stronger than Baidu in the AI race.
Microsoft MSFT is pouring massive capital into AI infrastructure, especially Azure data centers, committing over $80 billion in fiscal 2025, with costs expected to rise further in 2026. Microsoft’s vast scale, diversified revenue streams and OpenAI partnership help it spread expenses, optimize operations and preserve margins. Unlike Baidu, Microsoft benefits from its global reach, strong Azure growth and greater efficiency in managing AI costs, making it far more resilient and dominant in the AI race."

The only others to have reached that level are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), the latter which earlier this year became the first company to top $4 trillion. (It remains the only member of that club.)
Alphabet’s stock has gotten a boost this month after a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case, a major legal win for the search giant that eased worries it might be forced to sell a key part of its business.
In a note to clients Monday, Citi analysts became the latest to boost their price targets for the stock to a Street high of $280 from $225, citing an “improving legal landscape” in the wake of the decision, as well as growing adoption of Google’s artificial intelligence tools across its ad and cloud businesses.
With Monday's gains, Alphabet's stock has added roughly a third of its value this year, making it the best-performing member of the Magnificent Seven for 2025 so far.

Alphabet finally crashed tech’s most exclusive party. On Monday, Google’s parent company became only the fourth U.S. firm ever to hit a $3 trillion market value when it touched that number in intraday trading, a milestone that caps months of investor hand-wringing over antitrust pressure and proves that Wall Street is ready to give the company more credit for its AI ambitions.
Suggested Reading
Shares jumped more than 4% to record highs, lifting both of Alphabet’s publicly traded classes into the three-comma club. That puts the company alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple — three rivals that have already made $3 trillion look routine — and reshuffles a leaderboard that, until recently, looked like a closed shop.
Related Content
For Alphabet, the timing matters. The move comes just weeks after Judge Amit P. Mehta stopped short of the harshest remedies in a long-running antitrust case, declining to break up the company or strip away its Chrome and Android platforms. Instead, the court targeted certain exclusivity contracts and forced Google to share some of its search index, a ruling that imposed new obligations but left the crown jewels intact. For investors, that was the difference between existential risk and a manageable compliance bill — and Monday’s rally reflected the relief.
Google’s move to $3 trillion also comes as Google Cloud is finally throwing its weight around. In July, Alphabet reported that cloud revenue leapt nearly 32% year over year to $13.6 billion, with adoption of its in-house Tensor Processing Units and Gemini AI models driving growth, putting Google on pace to generate more than $50 billion annually if growth holds. The company also signaled it would spend more aggressively to meet data-center demand, boosting its 2025 capital expenditures plan by $10 billion to $85 billion. For a market skeptical about whether Google could turn AI into more than a defensive play, that was evidence that the company could potentially grow a second profit engine alongside its dominant search business.
The milestone underscores how AI has redrawn the stock market’s rules in real time. Nvidia rocketed past $4 trillion this summer on the back of GPU demand, while Apple and Microsoft have held their ground thanks to iPhone durability and cloud scale (Microsoft briefly joined the $4 trillion club this summer). Alphabet’s late arrival to the $3 trillion club suggests that investors now see AI as an accelerant, not just a cost sink — and that legal uncertainty, for the moment, has receded enough to let the market focus on growth.
Google’s next test is translating that momentum into durable margins without denting the cash-gushing search business — and keeping regulators at bay while Gemini seeps deeper into consumer and enterprise workflows. Today is a vote that the company can do both.
The $3 trillion club is still tiny, but the message is loud: scale, distribution, and power-hungry infrastructure are monetizing AI faster than skeptics expected. The bigger question for Google is whether this durability lasts. The remedies decision won’t be the last word from regulators, and the capex surge could squeeze margins if cloud adoption cools. But for now, Google has what every tech giant covets: clarity, momentum, and a market cap that has learned to count to three."

PARIS (Reuters) -Canadian AI startup Cohere is expanding operations in Europe, intensifying competition with homegrown players like France's Mistral to supply AI services in the region.
Cohere, which was valued at $6.8 billion in its latest funding round, opened an office in Paris on Monday and is keen to take a bigger share of Europe's growing demand, said CEO Aidan Gomez.
The firm will join others lured to the French capital by French President Emmanuel Macron's push to create a European AI hub in the country, part of a bid to reinforce Europe's digital sovereignty.
""Previously, when we've looked at our global revenue, Europe had been slower to take off, but we're starting to see renewed momentum, in particular this year,"" Gomez told reporters.
Smaller AI firms are striving to rival U.S.-based giants such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta, which dominate the industry. Both Cohere and European AI champion Mistral are targeting business clients with an emphasis on data security and sovereignty.
Mistral, valued this month at $11.7 billion, declined to comment on Cohere's offering in Europe.
Founded in 2019, Cohere already counts major global companies such as South Korea's LG, Japan's Fujitsu and Oracle in the U.S. as partners, said Gomez.
He said recent political unrest in France was not a concern, and that he was ""super confident"" in the country's tech ecosystem.

The new agreement creates a framework allowing CoreWeave to sell reserved cloud computing capacity to customers while giving NVIDIA access to any unsold capacity.
The timing of the NVIDIA deal proved fortunate for CoreWeave, as it was announced just before Kerrisdale Capital published a critical report calling the company ""the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.""
In its report, Kerrisdale argued that CoreWeave, which has rallied 30% in the past week and trades nearly 200% above its IPO price from five months ago, is ""an undifferentiated, heavily levered GPU rental scheme"" rather than a lasting innovation.
The short seller noted that CoreWeave has transformed in three years from ""a crypto mining outfit in a founder’s grandfather’s garage"" to a self-declared ""AI hyperscaler"" with a $75 billion valuation.
Kerrisdale expressed concerns about CoreWeave’s customer concentration, with Microsoft reportedly accounting for 70% of revenue. The report claimed Microsoft recently opted against an expansion with CoreWeave, instead signing a larger contract with competitor Nebius.
The short seller also criticized CoreWeave’s financial model, stating it ""generates returns below its cost of capital, destroying rather than creating shareholder value."" Kerrisdale set a fair value target of $10 for CoreWeave shares, suggesting a potential 90% downside.
Despite these criticisms, investors appeared to focus more on the NVIDIA partnership announcement, pushing CoreWeave shares higher in Monday’s trading session.

The shift to cloud and the rise of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) models offer recurring revenue visibility for vendors while offering flexibility and scalability for users. The industry growth is also being fueled by the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The cutting-edge technologies are being integrated into enterprise and consumer applications. Software vendors are increasingly embedding generative AI into productivity tools, customer service platforms, and enterprise resource planning systems.
According to a Grand View Research report, the global software market is expected to witness a CAGR of 11.3% from 2025 to 2030 and reach 1,397.31 billion. These trends augur well for industry participants, such as Microsoft Corporation MSFT, PTC Inc PTC and Manhattan Associates MANH. Uncertainty prevailing over global macroeconomic conditions and stiff competition continues to be concerning for the participants.
Industry Description
The Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to AI, cloud computing, electronic design automation (primarily for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform. Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which engineers, designers and researchers use across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction, product design, manufacturing and digital media.
3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Software Industry
Higher Spending on AI and Cloud: The industry’s prospects are bright, given higher spending by enterprises on the latest software upgrades. The continued investment in AI, big data and analytics and the ongoing adoption of SaaS open up opportunities for these players. Going ahead, AI and ML tech are expected to be widely integrated into the software tools. This increasing demand for AI-powered software tools for automation, personalization, predictive analytics and decision-making augurs well.
Further, cloud computing will continue to be a dominant force in the software industry, with businesses adopting hybrid and multi-cloud environments to meet their growing needs for flexibility and scalability. Cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform for developing and testing applications. The deployment time is also shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.
Increased Cybersecurity Focus: The increasing need to secure cloud platforms amid growing cyberattacks and hacking incidents drives demand for cybersecurity software. As software becomes more interconnected, cloud-native and AI-powered, it is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments. Zero-trust architectures, identity and access management and real-time threat detection underpinned by AI are becoming key features of next-gen software platforms.
Macroeconomic Headwinds a Concern: Global macroeconomic weakness and volatile supply chain dynamics are persistent concerns. Though tariff troubles are unlikely to affect the software industry directly, higher tariffs on hardware would lead to higher costs. This would affect the software pricing as well. Inflation could affect spending across small and medium-sized businesses globally. The uncertainty in business visibility could dent the industry’s performance in the near term. According to a report from Gartner, worldwide IT spending is now projected to reach $5.43 trillion in 2025, calling for an increase of 7.9% from 2024 levels. This is below its January forecast of 9.8% growth. The research firm added that spending on software and services will slow down due to this global uncertainty, but AI-related infrastructure spending will continue to increase."

Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia is up 1,050%, while Palantir has jumped 2,360%, and was even higher before a recent pullback. Both stocks have also performed well this year. Nvidia is up 24%, while Palantir has gained 108%.
But there are a pair of lesser-known AI stocks that recently went public and have outperformed both those companies this year. They are CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) and Nebius (NBIS -1.73%), two AI cloud infrastructure companies that have soared since their debuts. CoreWeave has jumped 144% from its IPO in late March.
Meanwhile, Nebius is up 377% since it resumed trading last October, evolving from the Russian tech company Yandex after that company sold off its Russian assets. Yandex was delisted from the Nasdaq in 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The disposal of Russian assets allowed it to rejoin the Nasdaq.
Let's see what potential both of these young stocks could have from here.
Big growth, but big risks
CoreWeave and Nebius both provide a new kind of service. They are AI cloud infrastructure companies that provide data centers and computing power for hyperscalers and AI start-ups to run demanding AI workloads.
The two companies overall have more similarities than differences. CoreWeave is based in the U.S., while Nebius is based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. While CoreWeave evolved out of a crypto company, Nebius was born out of Yandex. CoreWeave is the larger of the two, but Nebius provides a broader suite of software and services. CoreWeave is better known for performance hardware, handling large AI workloads.
Both companies are growing rapidly, demonstrating the massive opportunity in the space. CoreWeave's revenue jumped 206% in the second quarter to $1.21 billion, while Nebius posted 625% revenue growth in its second quarter to $105.1 million.
However, the two companies are also deeply unprofitable at the moment, reflecting both the size of the opportunity in front of them as they invest in the infrastructure necessary to grow and provide services, but also the risk in the business. Demand for AI infrastructure is still brand new, essentially. There are already concerns about a bubble in AI, and there are risks of obsolescence as the chips they're buying now will lose value over time.
Microsoft makes a splash
Microsoft has been the biggest investor in the AI cloud infrastructure space, and it just made a monster deal with Nebius, showing its intentions and the huge amounts of capital flowing into AI cloud infrastructure. Nebius just announced a multi-year agreement with Microsoft to deploy GPU infrastructure at its new data center in New Jersey, with a total contract value of $17.4 billion. Microsoft also has the option to purchase $2 billion more in services or capacity.
Nebius stock soared on the news, jumping more than 40%, and the tailwinds were strong enough that it even lifted CoreWeave up more than 5%. Though you might think CoreWeave would be a loser on the news, given that Nebius is a competitor, investors instead see it as a win for the sector, as it validates demand for AI infrastructure services.
Meanwhile, CoreWeave still has plenty of backlog to work its way through, at $30.1 billion as of the end of the second quarter.
Time to buy CoreWeave and Nebius?
After their surges this year, CoreWeave and Nebius are high-risk stocks. CoreWeave, after peaking in June, fell by more than 50% as investors are still struggling to appropriately value both it and Nebius. CoreWeave currently trades at price-to-sales ratio of 13, which seems reasonable, given its high growth and high losses, while Nebius, which is much smaller, trades at a lofty P/S ratio of 61.
These stocks have high upside, but also a lot of downside risk as well. For AI investors who have already made a tidy profit in Nvidia and Palantir, diversifying part of that windfall into CoreWeave and Nebius makes sense. If AI maintains its pace of expansion, those two stocks are likely to continue outperforming Nvidia and Palantir in the coming years."

Year over year sales rose 30% and quarter of quarter sales grew 50% in Q2 with 40% of new business from Europe.
Twenty-nine new enterprise customers purchased WorkBoardAI in the first half of the year, including companies across Technology, Healthcare, Financial Services, Retail and Energy industries – many of whom replaced Microsoft Viva Goals.
Importantly, the company continued to deliver 45% of its sales from existing customers expanding their use. Customer response to its acquisition of Quantive Inc in the second quarter has been overwhelmingly positive as 40 large enterprise customers migrate to the WorkBoardAI platform, now the most trusted enterprise strategy execution and OKR platform worldwide.
Enterprises use WorkBoardAI as their strategy execution system of record to drive alignment, measurement, execution, and adaptation of ambitious strategies in a rapidly changing world.
""We returned to growth last quarter after nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines. This was in no small part due to WorkBoardAI, which we standardized on as the system of record for strategy and execution to align the company and drive our transformation."" — Sam Wilson, CEO of 8x8
Chief of Staff AI Agents and Leadership Coach AI Agents Uplevel Managers and Team Performance
Over 55% of customers already use WorkBoardAI to set better goals and performance metrics, identify and resolve dependencies, assess risks and progress, streamline meetings, and summarize attainment. 75% of customers hired a WorkBoardAI agent when they were launched in April, and use by first line and mid-level managers is rising 50% week over week as these managers look for ways to be more effective in a hectic world.
Unlike chatbots, these agents have full context on the strategy, org structure, team and individual goals, know what the manager is trying to achieve and have access to data from Salesforce, Teams, Jira and other apps.
-
The Chief of Staff agent proactively drives alignment and OKR setting, identifies risks, prepares meeting pre-reads, creates and updates scorecards, distributes progress updates, follows up with team members on deliverables, and prepares fact-based agendas – all things that managers should do but often lack the time to do well.
-
The Leadership Coach agent is a thought partner, helping frame and deliver challenging feedback, creating pre-reads and agendas for 1on1s and performance conversations, and helping managers be effective leaders."

Parth is also an author of 4 self-published books.
Key Notes
- LSEG completes the first transaction on its new blockchain-based platform.
- DMI targets private funds first, with plans to expand into other asset classes.
- The UK’s tokenisation market is projected to triple by 2030.
The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has reportedly launched its blockchain-based Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI) platform.
The group confirmed on September 15 that the platform completed its first live transaction.
MembersCap, a Bermuda-based investment manager, was the first to use DMI to raise capital for its tokenised MCM Fund 1. Archax, a Financial Conduct Authority–regulated digital securities exchange, acted as a nominee for the transaction.
The DMI platform is developed in partnership with Microsoft. It is designed to handle the entire lifecycle of an investment, from issuance to post-trade settlement and ongoing servicing, entirely on blockchain rails.
Initially focused on private funds, LSEG has hinted at its plan to broaden the platform’s scope to include other asset classes in the future. According to Bloomberg, the group aims to make private market transactions more efficient and transparent by using blockchain technology.
Tokenisation Gains Traction Across the UK
Tokenization is the process of creating digital representations of real-world assets such as stocks, bonds, or loans. The sector is quickly gaining attention among global regulators and institutional investors due to faster settlement, improved liquidity, and fractional ownership.
Nasdaq’s recent SEC filing highlights how tokenized securities can integrate into traditional markets while preserving investor protections.
However, challenges remain around regulation, valuation, and market structure.
The UK has emerged as a particularly active hub for these developments. The financial regulators have been working on comprehensive rules for crypto and digital securities.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has explicitly incorporated fund tokenisation into its pro-growth strategy, signalling strong regulatory support. Data from Grand View Research estimates that the UK tokenization market generated around $284 million in revenue in 2024.
According to the research firm’s analysis, the country’s tokenization market is expected to reach about $929 million by 2030. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 18.4%.
If LSEG’s new platform proves successful, it could increase the blockchain adoption in the mainstream capital markets.

finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-15T12:27:00,OKLO's Tennessee Bet Lifts Hype - But Should Investors Buy?,"OKLO shares jumped 19% after unveiling a $1.68B fuel recycling facility, but years of cash burn and delays leave its lofty valuation in question.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a28bc7dab96c87fad43d56b97e4a65676b583dc22e02ee9027514ee4e56ec321,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oklos-tennessee-bet-lifts-hype-112700490.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oklos-tennessee-bet-lifts-hype-112700490.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oklos-tennessee-bet-lifts-hype-112700490.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Oklo Inc. (OKLO) has been one of the hottest names in the nuclear energy space, with shares soaring nearly 19% after unveiling a $1.68 billion private nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, TN. The project — announced on Sept. 4 and expected to create 800 jobs as the first-of-its-kind commercial recycling site in the United States — ties directly into America’s growing demand for secure fuel supply amid the energy-hungry rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The gains on the back of this Tennessee announcement have also taken Oklo’s one-year stock surge to more than 1200%.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
A lot of the buzz around Oklo comes from its unique position at the meeting point of clean energy and AI. The data centers that power AI technology require huge amounts of reliable electricity. Oklo's advanced, small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are being promoted as a perfect solution to this massive energy need.
Nuclear energy stocks more broadly are heating up, and for a good reason. This year, President Donald Trump has put nuclear power firmly in the spotlight, while countries worldwide have pledged to triple nuclear capacity by 2050. Yet, even against this supportive backdrop, investors need to step back and assess whether Oklo’s fundamentals truly justify the hype.
OKLO’s Lofty Pipeline and High Hopes
Oklo’s story is built around scale and ambition. The company touts a 14 GW pipeline that could translate into nearly $5 billion in annual revenues by 2028. Its Aurora microreactors, designed to run on recycled fuel, target data centers, military bases and industrial hubs. Instead of selling reactors, Oklo aims to own and operate them, securing revenues through long-term power purchase agreements. Partnerships with names like Liberty Energy, Vertiv and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power enhance its credibility. On paper, this integrated model looks promising and gives the company a strategic angle that competitors lack.
Reality Check: OKLO Years Away From Cash Flow
Despite the big headlines, Oklo is still a pre-revenue company. Its first commercial reactor isn’t expected online until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest, and the Tennessee recycling facility won’t begin operations until the early 2030s. Meanwhile, the annual cash burn is estimated between $65 million and $80 million, a figure that will demand ongoing capital raises. Regulatory challenges are another concern. Oklo’s initial application was rejected by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2022, and even if resubmitted in late 2025, reviews could stretch two to three years. Such delays could easily push commercial revenues further out, leaving investors holding a highly speculative bet. The long timeline also exposes shareholders to greater volatility, especially if market enthusiasm for nuclear cools."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-14T12:45:00,3 Top Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy in September,"Cyber threats are rising, but three industry leaders are turning defense into opportunity, making now an attractive moment for investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d51994cb3c880b1f58a0ae423c9c29010e95b262013a5e897ca942b714e0b7bd,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/3-top-cybersecurity-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/3-top-cybersecurity-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/3-top-cybersecurity-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,fool.com,200,,"Cybersecurity threats are a persistent problem for companies across the globe, requiring businesses, small and large, to devote some of their budgets to fighting them. IDC estimates that cybersecurity spending is on the rise and will reach an estimated $377 billion by 2028. And it's not just that there's an increase in threats; the rise of artificial intelligence-based attacks makes defending critical software and infrastructure increasingly complex.
But good investors know that opportunities are created out of these threats when companies create the right tools to combat them. And that's where Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.45%), CrowdStrike (CRWD -0.03%), and Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) come in. Their sophisticated toos are leading the charge against cyber threats -- and rewarding shareholders with significant gains.
1. Palo Alto is a cybersecurity leader that's continually growing
Palo Alto Networks shocked investors recently when it announced that it was acquiring CyberArk, an identity access management leader, for $25 billion -- the largest purchase by Palo Alto by far. The purchase will allow Palo Alto to offer clients a comprehensive cybersecurity solution, covering all aspects of identity and access control, and is expected to close in the second half of fiscal 2026.
Even without the acquisition, Palo Alto's growth is impressive. The company's Q4 revenue of $2.54 billion beat Wall Street's consensus estimate of $2.5 billion, and its earnings of $0.95 easily topped estimates of $0.88 for the quarter. Management also issued strong guidance for 2026, with revenue estimated to increase 14% to about $10.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share to rise 14% to $3.80, at the midpoint of guidance.
The company recently announced that the founder and CTO of Palo Alto Networks, Nir Zuk, is retiring. But investors shouldn't be concerned about the transition. CEO Nikesh Arora has served as the company's leader since 2018 and is still at the helm and leading the company into its next era of growth.
2. CrowdStrike makes security easy for clients
CrowdStrike offers its customers a one-stop shop for security, with the company's Falcon platform providing an easy-to-use cloud-based solution. The company was also quick to implement new artificial intelligence features into its services, launching Charlotte AI two years ago and saving customers an average of 40 hours per week as the AI finds and neutralizes threats on its own.
The company recently reported its Q2 results, with earnings per share sliding 10% to $0.93 but coming in ahead of analysts' consensus estimate of $0.83. Meanwhile, revenue jumped 21% to nearly $1.2 billion, ahead of estimates.
Investors weren't thrilled with the results, even though they weren't bad, and some latched onto management's estimate that Q3 revenue will be in the range between $1.21 to $1.22 billion, slightly below Wall Street's estimate of $1.23 billion. CrowdStrike's shares slid following the report and are down about 7.5% over the past three months.
Don't be distracted by the temporary dip. The recent decline is giving investors a good time to pick up shares, and CrowdStrike is still on track to meet its goal of achieving $10 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2031.
3. Microsoft is an AI leader with solid cybersecurity chops
Microsoft took early steps into the artificial intelligence market through its partnership with OpenAI years ago, giving it access to one of the most advanced chatbot systems and integrating the tech into everything from its Azure cloud computing platform to Windows 365 software.
But hidden within Microsoft's cloud and AI opportunities is a growing cybersecurity business. Microsoft has 1.4 million cybersecurity customers globally and has 34,000 engineers working full-time on security. Most importantly, Microsoft's cybersecurity sales will reach an estimated $37 billion in fiscal 2025, accounting for about 14% of the company's total revenue.
With Microsoft already a leading AI and cloud computing company, in addition to having an impressive cybersecurity business, the company is one of the best no-brainer tech stocks to own. And with the stock sliding about 3% over the past month, now is a good time to buy shares as the company continues to lead in the expanding AI and cybersecurity markets."
finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-14T10:22:00,"Broadcom and Oracle's Blowout Earnings Just Proved Why It's Time to Forget the ""Magnificent Seven""","Without Broadcom and Oracle, the ""Magnificent Seven"" is no longer a good representation of the market's leading growth stocks.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a07dec5d012ee0ad63fcf5247aa58487c57f1aaef742edb2926ef688975e052c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/broadcom-oracle-ten-titans-magnificent-seven/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/broadcom-oracle-ten-titans-magnificent-seven/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/14/broadcom-oracle-ten-titans-magnificent-seven/,fool.com,200,,"Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) and Oracle (ORCL 1.45%) just delivered exceptional earnings reports and guidance that sent both tech stocks to all-time highs. Over the last five years, Broadcom is up over 925% and Oracle is up over 475% -- outperforming every ""Magnificent Seven"" stock (Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla) except one -- Nvidia.
The ""Ten Titans"" provide an update to the Magnificent Seven by adding Broadcom, Oracle, and Netflix to the list. Combined, these three companies have nearly the same market cap as Apple, and are gaining increasing influence in the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%). In fact, the Ten Titans now make up 39.1% of the index compared to 33.7% for the Magnificent Seven.
Beyond the market cap influence of these names, Broadcom and Oracle embody groundbreaking advancements in cloud computing, infrastructure software, and artificial intelligence (AI).
Here's why Broadcom and Oracle have become such dominant companies, and whether either growth stock is a buy now.
Broadcom is a balanced way to invest in AI
Broadcom and Oracle's surging stock prices illustrate how AI is redefining previously stagnant investment theses. Just a few years ago, both companies were often viewed as dividend-paying stalwarts.
Broadcom was known for its established semiconductor business, providing the nuts and bolts behind networking, broadband, wireless, cybersecurity, and more. But the company is completely different today due to its acquisition of VMware in late 2023 and the development and adoption of its AI chips.
Cloud computing giants are lining up to buy Broadcom's AI chips, known as XPUs. XPUs are highly advanced application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are tailored to a specialized function and are especially good at handling increasing AI workloads. Broadcom doesn't just design the chips, it also makes associated networking products, like Tomahawk switches that link chips within a server rack, and Jericho Ethernet fabric routers, which enable the connection of over 1 million XPU clusters across multiple data centers.
Broadcom is unique because it is far bigger than just an AI play. Rather, it is a highly diversified company that benefits from the buildout of AI infrastructure, AI software, and the growth of high-speed connectivity.
Oracle is heavily disrupting incumbent cloud giants
Oracle's latest quarter perfectly represents why Broadcom has become a behemoth that is closing in on $1 trillion in market cap. On Sept. 9, Oracle said that its cloud infrastructure segment is expected to grow 77% in fiscal 2026, 78% in fiscal 2027, 128% in fiscal 2028, and 97% in fiscal 2029 to become a $144 billion business. If Oracle comes remotely close to these estimates, its cloud business will become far larger than its legacy database services segment.
Like Broadcom, Oracle was once an entrenched business-to-business giant in tech, known for its stodgy growth and reliable dividend. But Oracle is now a completely different company. Its strength comes from its competitive pricing model, which makes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) a great add-on for customers that use its database services.
Oracle is an enterprise-facing company. Whereas investors in the ""big three"" cloud players, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, are getting a lot of moving parts that have nothing to do with cloud computing. In this vein, Oracle has become one of the best ways to invest in high-octane cloud growth, somewhat similar to how investors are drawn to Nvidia. Nvidia has become a pure-play AI stock because its data center business is now magnitudes larger than its gaming and professional visualization markets.
Broadcom and Oracle's stock prices are running up far faster than they are growing earnings because investors are buying these stocks for where they could be years from now rather than where they are today. Forward earnings estimates will probably increase as analysts adjust their targets based on recent results and guidance. But for now, Broadcom's forward price-to-earnings ratio is a staggering 54.8 compared to 48.2 for Oracle. For context, Nvidia's forward P/E is 39.5 -- meaning investors are even more excited about Broadcom and Oracle's growth.
Broadcom and Oracle are moving markets
The breakneck growth rates and size of Broadcom and Oracle prove why it's time to forget the Magnificent Seven and use the Ten Titans as a better descriptor for market-moving growth stocks. Even folks who don't own the Ten Titans outright may be indirectly impacted through their holdings in index funds and exchange-traded funds.
In addition to their foundational role in the major indexes, the Ten Titans will likely make or break broader market sentiment. If the S&P 500 keeps making new highs, it's probably because of the Ten Titans. If it undergoes a major sell-off, it's probably because a few key Titans fell. You may have even seen headlines about how the S&P 500 is expensive relative to its historical valuation. That's because many of the Ten Titans are valued more for their future earnings than their current profits. So investors should only approach these stocks if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term time horizon, and believe these companies can deliver on highly optimistic expectations.
It's also worth noting the correlation that these companies can have. For example, Oracle's blowout quarter sent Broadcom and Nvidia soaring on Sept. 10 because Oracle is a major customer of these chip makers. Increased AI spending to build out OCI benefits Broadcom and Nvidia. Although Oracle may account for less than 2% of the S&P 500, its results had a significantly larger impact on the S&P 500 than the movement in its stock price alone."

The technology sector makes up a whopping 30% of the S&P 500, and also has the best performance among equities, with a 15.6% overall return for the sector so far this year.
Tech stocks represent companies that are at the forefront of innovation as cloud computing, data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) reshape the world we live in. Investors are flocking to tech stocks, pushing their valuations higher by the quarter. It should come as no surprise that of the nine U.S. companies with market caps greater than $1 trillion, eight of them are tech companies.
If you want to beat the market and grow your portfolio, tech stocks are some of the best names you can choose. As part of your well-rounded portfolio, one way you can achieve your financial goals is by picking some tech stocks that you can comfortably own for a decade. Consider Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%), and Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%).
Nvidia: The market leader
No company is more impactful in the tech space right now than chipmaker Nvidia. The company's rocketed up the charts in the last few years on the strength of its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) that make high-functioning compute processing possible.
Nvidia continues to make its GPUs better, from Hopper to Blackwell to the incoming Rubin architecture. CEO Jensen Huang has said he expects spending for AI infrastructure to top $1 trillion a year by 2028, with Nvidia on track to fill most of that demand.
Nvidia is still growing fast -- revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended July 27, 2025) was $46.7 billion, up 56% from a year ago. Blackwell data center revenue was up 17% from the first quarter.
And the innovations keep coming. Just this week, the company unveiled a new chip on its Rubin architecture. Nvidia says its Rubin CPX GPU allows the highest performance and token revenue for long-context processing, making AI coding assistants much more sophisticated and effective.
Microsoft: Dominant position, steady growth
While Nvidia has been shooting up the charts, Microsoft stock offers stable growth and a powerful position in software, hardware, services, and cloud computing. Its Microsoft 365 suite of office software is the industry standard, and it has a growing cloud computing segment.
Microsoft reported revenue of $76.4 billion its fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 (ended June 30, 2025), which was an increase of 18% from a year ago. Net income of $27.2 billion was up 24% from last year, and earnings per share (EPS) of $3.65 was an increase of 24%.
For the full fiscal year, Microsoft's revenue was up 15% to $281.7 billion, with net income up 16% to $101.8 billion and EPS up 16% to $13.64 -- not as dramatic as Nvidia, but steady and reliable.
The company saw 27% growth in its Microsoft Azure cloud services revenue, 21% growth in Microsoft 365 consumer cloud services, 16% growth in Microsoft 365 commercial cloud services, and Xbox revenue growth of 13%.
Microsoft's massive businesses make it a safe, profitable investment that you can hold for a decade -- or more.
Palantir Technologies: The disruptor
There's no other company like Palantir. The data mining company is changing both government and commercial businesses through its revolutionary platform that pulls information from multiple sources, digests it, and provides solutions in real time. Military commanders and intelligence analysts use it for an advantage on the battlefield; commercial customers use it to manage supply chains, perform studies, and improve workflows.
The differentiator is Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform, which uses generative AI so users submit detailed prompts to get specific responses without learning coding. Palantir has been rolling out boot camps to prospective clients so they can try the platform, and the response has been incredible.
U.S. commercial revenue grew 93% in the second quarter to $306 million, and government revenue jumped 53% to $426 million. Palantir closed 157 deals in the quarter that were valued at $1 million or more; 42 of them were valued at more than $10 million. Palantir says it closed U.S. commercial deals in the quarter with a total contract value of $843 million, up 222% from a year ago.
While Palantir was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024 and the first half of 2025, the question about it continues to be the valuation. Palantir has a price-to-earnings ratio of 541 and a forward P/E of 188. But I say the valuation is out of whack because the market is just starting to understand Palantir's true potential. By the end of the decade it has enormous potential to be one of those $1 trillion stocks -- and investors who get in early will see the biggest returns."

Coatue curates the Fantastic 40 Growth & Innovation Index, which distills the 150 largest technology companies into a list of 40 stocks best positioned to lead the market in the years ahead.
Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) and Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) currently top that list. Coatue expects them to be the largest companies in the world by 2030, with market values approaching $6 trillion, as detailed below:
- Coatue estimates Microsoft will be worth $5.7 trillion in 2030. That implies 54% upside from its current market value of $3.7 trillion.
- Coatue estimates Nvidia will be worth $5.6 trillion in 2030. That implies 30% upside from its current market value of $4.3 trillion.
Importantly, Laffont has put his money where his mouth is. Microsoft and Nvidia are two of the largest positions in his $36 billion portfolio, accounting for over 10% of his invested assets. Here's what investors should know about these artificial intelligence stocks.
1. Microsoft
Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company and the second-largest public cloud provider, and it's using its strength in those markets to profit from artificial intelligence (AI). Its family of Copilot applications, which automate work across software such as Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, surpassed 100 million monthly active users in the most recent quarter.
CEO Satya Nadella says customers are adopting Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other product in the business productivity suite. And traction with Copilot is driving the adoption of Copilot Studio, which lets users build AI agents using company-specific data by simply describing the desired functionality in natural language.
In cloud computing, Microsoft recently introduced Azure AI Foundry, a suite of pretrained models and tools that let customers develop, customize, and manage AI applications. ""All up, 80% of Fortune 500 companies already use Foundry,"" according to Satya Nadella. ""We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year.""
Microsoft reported encouraging fourth-quarter financial results in fiscal 2025, which ended in June. Revenue increased 18% to $76 billion, driven by particularly strong growth in cloud services, where revenue accelerated for the second straight quarter. Commercial bookings growth also accelerated to 37%, hinting at strong future sales growth. And GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose 24% to $3.65 per diluted share.
Wall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to increase at 12% annually during the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 37 times earnings look expensive, but analysts may be underestimating it. Enterprise software and cloud services spending through 2030 are likely to grow at 12% annually and 20% annually, respectively, according to Grand View Research.
That gives Microsoft a good shot at annual earnings growth in the mid-teens, which makes the stock look a little more attractive and could carry the company to a $5 trillion market value by 2030. Nevertheless, it makes sense to start with a very small position due to the elevated valuation. You can always buy more shares if the stock pulls back.
2. Nvidia
Nvidia dominates the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that function as accelerators for demanding workloads such as AI training and inference. The company currently holds more than 80% market share in AI accelerators, and Morgan Stanley analysts think Nvidia will maintain that same level of dominance for years to come, despite intense competition.
Several large customers -- Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet -- have developed custom AI accelerators, called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), but they are unlikely to dethrone Nvidia GPUs because they lack ready-made software development tools. In other words, custom chips need custom software tools, and designing those products requires a great deal of technical expertise that most companies lack.
Nvidia introduced its CUDA software platform nearly two decades ago, and it has become an unparalleled ecosystem of code libraries, pretrained models, and frameworks that help developers build applications across use cases such as content generation, computer vision, predictive analytics, and autonomous machines. I/O Fund analyst Beth Kindig says CUDA affords Nvidia an ""impenetrable moat.""
Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to increase at 36% annually over the next three years, a sensible estimate, given that AI accelerator sales are forecasted to increase at 36% annually through 2030. That makes Nvidia's current valuation of 51 times earnings look reasonable. I have no doubt that Nvidia is on its way to a $5 trillion valuation, and I expect the company to hit that milestone well before 2030."

On September 12, the European Commission announced that it accepted Microsoft’s proposed commitments to resolve a long-running antitrust investigation into its Teams messaging and videoconferencing app. The investigation was initiated after a complaint from Slack Technologies and one from German company Alfaview, which accused Microsoft of possibly abusive practices by tying Teams to its Office software suites.
To address these concerns, Microsoft proposed making its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software packages available at a reduced price without Teams. The company also committed to allowing customers with long-term licenses to switch to these unbundled versions and promised to make it easier for rival software to work with Teams.
These legally binding commitments will remain in force for 7 years, with the interoperability and data portability requirements lasting for 10 years, allowing the company to avoid a potentially massive fine. The decision was made after a market test of the initial proposals conducted in May and June 2025.

finnhub,MSFT,2025-09-13T18:36:00,3 Reasons to Love Microsoft's Dividend,"A small yield can still be a great dividend when it's safe, growing, and backed by a powerhouse business.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d70bcbd79745789f1f0fcbcbdbc1aaa806607e823d7240538fbb8eea360a1901,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/3-reasons-to-love-microsofts-dividend/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/3-reasons-to-love-microsofts-dividend/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/13/3-reasons-to-love-microsofts-dividend/,fool.com,200,,"With another strong quarter behind it, it's a good time to revisit the dividend from Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%). Of course, one area where the company continues to deliver is its dividend. Even as the software and cloud giant is spending heavily to build artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, cash generation remains robust, setting the stage for further dividend growth for years to come.
Of course, the case for Microsoft's dividend isn't about a high yield. It's about safety, consistent increases, and the company's capacity to keep lifting the payout as earnings expand. In fact, despite its low yield, Microsoft arguably remains one of the best dividend stocks around -- despite its conservative dividend yield.
Here are three reasons Microsoft's dividend still stands out.
1. A reliable dividend
The best place to start is with dependability. Microsoft earned $13.64 per share in fiscal 2025 (fiscal year ended June 30). Yet, it's only paying out a small fraction of these earnings in dividends. At the dividends $0.83 quarterly run rate ($3.32 annualized), the dividend represents roughly 24% of last year's earnings per share -- a conservative level for a mature, cash-rich company.
Moving over to the cash flow statement, it's a similar story. In fiscal 2025, net cash from operations was over $136 billion, and capital expenditures totaled roughly $64.5 billion, leaving free cash flow near $71.6 billion. Yet, even with so much cash flow, Microsoft paid just $24 billion in dividends -- only about one-third of its free cash flow. Such significant headroom gives management flexibility to continue investing in growth while steadily raising the payout.
2. Strong dividend growth potential
Microsoft has been paying quarterly dividends for years and has repeatedly lifted the rate. Indeed, it's risen from $0.52 five years ago and $0.31 10 years ago.
The current $0.83 per-share quarterly dividend equates to $3.32 per share annually. At recent prices, the yield sits at about 0.7% -- modest but more meaningful when considering the dividend's growth potential.
Importantly, further increases are highly probable, given the company's incredible business momentum recently. In its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, revenue rose 18% year over year, and Microsoft Cloud revenue climbed 27%.
The company is bullish on its growth prospects, investing heavily in expansion opportunities. In fact, management expects fiscal first-quarter capital expenditures to top $30 billion, ""driven by the continued strong demand signals we see,"" said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood in the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call. Those demand signals, of course, have been bolstered by the company's ongoing integration of AI features into its software and services.
""Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry,"" Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release.
These robust investments should secure strong double-digit annualized revenue and earnings growth for Microsoft for the next few years at least, providing nice support for continued dividend growth.
3. Don't forget Microsoft's buyback program
Microsoft's capital expenditures have been mounting as the company builds data centers and capabilities for AI workloads. Even so, the software giant continues to send substantial cash back to shareholders -- and it's doing so in more ways than one.
In fiscal 2025, Microsoft repurchased about $18.4 billion of stock and returned $9.4 billion via dividends and buybacks in the fourth quarter alone. A $60 billion repurchase authorization -- approved last fall -- adds another lever that management can pull alongside the dividend. These dynamics point to a thoughtful capital allocation approach: Invest aggressively in the business while returning capital through dividends and buybacks.
There are, of course, risks to watch. Heavy capital spending can compress near-term free cash flow, and cloud competition remains intense. But Microsoft's scale, balance sheet strength, and expanding earnings base leave ample room to navigate those pressures while continuing to lift the payout.
For investors who prefer safety and growth over headline yield, Microsoft stock is a good option, featuring reliable coverage today, strong growth potential, and a well-rounded capital return program that includes an aggressive share repurchase program."

Fortive Investment Narrative Recap
To invest in Fortive today, you need conviction in its ability to benefit from AI-driven innovation, disciplined capital allocation, and sector normalization to offset recent earnings declines and revenue pressure. The company’s upbeat message at the Morgan Stanley conference reinforces confidence but does not materially alter the short-term risk around segment concentration, which remains elevated following the Precision Technologies spin-off, nor the key catalyst of expanding recurring revenues. Among recent announcements, Fortive’s sizable share repurchase program, nearly 27.4 million shares bought back over time, with another 15.6 million authorized, aligns closely with management’s conference commitment to growing shareholder returns and reflects ongoing discipline in capital deployment. This capital return, alongside the focus on building subscription-based and software revenues, supports the most important path to improved margin stability as the company transitions post-spin. Yet in contrast to the positive recurring revenue story, investors should also be mindful of heightened earnings volatility from increased segment exposure…

ANZ Group Holdings Investment Narrative Recap
For shareholders in ANZ Group Holdings, the investment case relies on the bank’s ability to extract value from digital transformation and operational efficiencies, while maintaining robust risk controls and capital discipline. The recent appointment of Kevin Corbally to lead Capital Management Institutional, amid cost and workforce reductions and platform changes, does not materially shift the most important near-term catalyst, the successful migration to a streamlined banking platform, nor does it significantly reduce the main risks tied to execution delays or technology setbacks.
Among recent developments, ANZ’s plan to cut approximately 3,500 roles and reduce external consultant spend directly supports the cost-efficiency goals critical to its platform migration efforts. These measures could add urgency and focus to management’s push for improved digital capabilities, which remains a key watchpoint for investors tracking progress on announced catalysts.

Array Digital Infrastructure Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder in Array Digital Infrastructure, you need to believe in the company’s transition to a digital infrastructure-focused business, especially its ability to unlock value from its tower segment while managing operational and market risks. The recent earnings beat highlights resilience in its core tower assets, which could support short-term optimism, though the risk of regulatory delays or integration costs following the T-Mobile transaction remains significant and is not diminished by this quarter’s results.
Among recent announcements, the completed sale of wireless operations to T-Mobile and the linked 15-year tower licensing agreement stands out as the most relevant. This move is pivotal, directly supporting the company’s shift towards recurring infrastructure revenues, which investors have identified as a major catalyst driving near-term performance, while proceeds from the sale enable debt reduction, a special dividend, and strengthened capital position.

What is behind this steady positive performance, and is it likely to continue?
Recent headlines may have something to do with the renewed enthusiasm.

This kind of cutting-edge tech news, combined with past innovations and strategic management changes, has kept investor interest strong, even as some headlines have raised questions around broader tech industry topics.
But here is the real question: does the price accurately reflect IBM's true value? Valuation is where things get interesting. According to a quick check across six standard valuation metrics, IBM is undervalued in 2 out of 6, giving it a value score of 2. That number might raise eyebrows among cautious investors and offer a clue to potential upside or hidden risks.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model forecasts the company's future free cash flows and then discounts those projections back to today's dollars to estimate what the business is worth right now.

Analysts provide concrete estimates for the first five years, projecting steady growth. Simply Wall St extrapolates further to cover a full decade.
By 2027, Free Cash Flow is forecasted to reach approximately $15.52 billion, with projections extending out to $21.31 billion in 2035. Early estimates rely on analyst input, while long-term numbers are modeled based on historical data and anticipated trends within the company and broader IT industry."

Hasbro Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder in Hasbro, you need confidence in its ability to transform into a more innovation-driven, diversified business while managing the risks tied to its reliance on flagship brands and shifting consumer trends. The relocation of Hasbro’s headquarters to Boston offers long-term potential for talent acquisition and creative synergies, but it does not materially alter the most pressing short-term catalyst: continued momentum and profitability in its gaming segment. The greatest near-term risk remains the company’s dependence on key franchises, where a slowdown in demand could impact revenue stability.

Nowhere is this shift more evident than among the cloud hyperscalers -- Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon -- as well as other tech titans like Meta Platforms and Oracle.
In just this year alone, Meta committed $14.3 billion to Scale AI and launched a new research hub, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). It also signed a six-year, $10 billion agreement with Google Cloud. Meanwhile, Microsoft just struck a $17.4 billion deal with Nebius, a rising neocloud specialist.
At the center of this unprecedented wave of AI infrastructure spending stands one clear beneficiary: Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). Whether directly or indirectly, the graphics processing unit (GPU) powerhouse is capturing a significant chunk of the money being spent on AI infrastructure.
Let's explore how big tech is reshaping the AI landscape -- and why these secular tailwinds point to further significant upside for Nvidia.
AI infrastructure spending has accelerated since the launch of ChatGPT
The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 ignited an unprecedented AI arms race among the world's largest companies. What's important to recognize is that their capital expenditures in this battle are not plateauing -- they're accelerating.
Data from Goldman Sachs underscores just how dramatic these dynamics have become. In 2021, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft collectively had capex of about $100 billion. By next year, Wall Street expects that figure to approach nearly $500 billion.
What does this mean for Nvidia?
Training and deploying large language models (LLMs) and building generative AI applications demands extraordinary amounts of computing power. GPUs are parallel processors, which makes them some of the best chips available to provide the type of computing power AI workloads require. Today, Nvidia commands a more than 90% share of the GPU market, giving it a dominant position within the AI supply chain.
A significant portion of the AI capex surge is flowing directly into GPUs and the supporting data center equipment necessary to maximize their performance.
This dynamic places Nvidia in a uniquely enviable position as the backbone of modern AI development -- and it's poised to capture incremental budget allocations as hyperscalers and other data center operators race to secure its next-generation chips the moment they become available.
Is Nvidia stock a buy?
The magnitude of hyperscaler infrastructure investment reflects more than the world's apparently insatiable appetite for AI computing power. It underscores a deeper reality: AI is becoming the central growth engine for these companies, and securing access to the most advanced chips has shifted from being a matter of technological advantage to being a matter of competitive survival.
The accelerating pace of this spending suggests that corporations are still in the early stages of implementing their AI playbooks. Far from being a speculative bubble, this wave of infrastructure investment is the result of deliberate, long-term strategic planning by some of the world's most influential companies as they pivot away from their traditional priorities and take on sophisticated projects in robotics, autonomous systems, cybersecurity, and more.
For Nvidia, this dynamic should translate into sustained pricing power for its wares, durable recurring demand, and a multiyear runway for rapid growth. Its GPUs and CUDA software platform have become the gold standard for enterprise AI tech stacks.
Taken together, these tailwinds suggest that Nvidia could experience meaningful valuation expansion from here. As the infrastructure chapter of the AI narrative continues to unfold, Nvidia appears well positioned to remain as a core enabler of big tech's transformation.
For these reasons, I see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer investment, and view it as one of the most compelling buy-and-hold opportunities in the market."
