Its shares slid as much as 2.1% in Seoul, reversing strong early advances. That’s after Samsung reported a better-than-projected 32% rise in operating income to 12.1 trillion won ($8.5 billion) for the September quarter, while revenue rose about 9%.
The tepid market reaction reflects in part lofty expectations for the global leader in memory, a fundamental component of Nvidia Corp. accelerators and data centers. South Korea’s largest company has gained more than 60% of market value since June, buoyed by signs of recovery in its pivotal semiconductor division.
Samsung’s recent run-up underscores confidence in the durability of demand for AI servers and chips as tech firms scramble to build and amass computing power. It suggests investors are betting on the company’s chances of regaining ground in the high-bandwidth memory segment lost to SK Hynix Inc. following years of setbacks.
“Traders who were long into the print are just locking in gains,” said Haris Khurshid, chief investment officer at Karobaar Capital LP. “Some rotation is also happening across semis after the HBM hype trade ran hot. Structurally, nothing’s changed.”

The company will provide a full financial statement with net income and divisional breakdowns on Oct. 30.
Like much of the tech sector, Samsung seeks to ride an anticipated AI boom in coming years. It’s made progress with its latest HBM chips, securing an order from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. while awaiting final approval on HBM3E chips from Nvidia.
“Samsung’s operating profit was much bigger than anyone was expecting,” said Sanjeev Rana, head of research at CLSA Securities Korea. “Its high-bandwidth memory shipments have recovered, rising 70% to 80% from the previous quarter, and there is a possibility that the size of the writedowns in the foundry business was much smaller than expected.”
This month, Samsung and SK Hynix both struck agreements to supply chips to OpenAI’s Stargate project. Their projection for demand represented more than twice the current global capacity of HBM, underscoring Stargate’s enormity and quickening global AI development."

Travis Hoium: Is artificial intelligence in need of an app store? Motley Fool Money starts now. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Travis Hoium. I'm joined by Lou Whiteman and Rachel Warren. We've got to get to the big news of the week. We've got a couple of days to process this, that is OpenAI introducing apps. They have tried some of these things before, plug-ins, custom GPTs to varying levels of success, but obviously they're going in a different direction now. But this was I thought a really interesting announcement because the vision here is a lot bigger than just being an AI tool. It's being the operating system of your life, if you will. There are companies involved who are willingly building apps, companies like Zillow, Expedia, Booking.com. Rachel, what are you taking away from this and what should investors know about OpenAI's move into apps? It's not quite an app store, but they are making apps.
Rachel Warren: Yeah, it's interesting. I think you can see how a lot of the efforts that they have leveraged in the past maybe have led them to this point. I want to talk a little bit about how this app store works and why I also do think this could be really different from what we've seen in OpenAI in the past. Their app store, is this new platform, it's integrated directly within ChatGPT, and it basically allows users to interact with third party apps using conversation natural language. For instance, you could ask ChatGPT to create a playlist with Spotify or find houses for sale with Zillow and then those apps are activated from directly within the ChatGPT conversation. Instead of having to leave the chat to use another service, those apps run directly in the thread. I think the idea is to simplify the user experience. At launch they're partnering with some really big companies, with Spotify, Booking.com owned by Booking Holdings, Expedia, Zillow, Figma which is newly public, as well as private companies like Canva. I think it's interesting to note, their past attempts like plugins that you alluded to. These had been limited text-based access. They were really rigid invite-only systems for developers. The chat interface was really cumbersome. Importantly, monetization wasn't really a core feature there. Now, these new apps, I think, are very much designed to be a funnel toward monetization where OpenAI could make money from more of a revenue sharing model. It's really interesting to see what they're doing with this.
Travis Hoium: Lou, is this the way that we're going to be using AI in the future? The vision here I think is, look on an iPhone or something or another smartphone. You're going to download apps and then you're going to actually interact with the app. You're not really calling them from something like Siri, but this is taking that to the next level and going, hey, Zillow why don't you just build for this AI chatbot and we'll just call your information. Is that the way that we're going to go in the future?
Lou Whiteman: Maybe. I will say this, if it works as good as the demo, it's gold. But I've learned I think we've all learned not to just buy the demo. What I worry about here is there's a garbage in garbage out problem, I think, because AI isn't actually smart, it's just trained on data. Just to pick on one, Zillow, their walkability score is the biggest, I shouldn't call it garbage so I'll just call it sub-par. [LAUGHTER] You can't actually know whether or not a house, you can walk around it from the walkability score. In the example of give me a house that I can walk you to restaurants from, if it's based on the Zillow walkability score, I think it's going to be sub-human responses. I think there's a trillion of these problems to be worked out. I think there's all sorts of questions that we can get to later about Walled Gardens versus everybody there and how you make this work. To me, I want to get excited. It looks really good on paper, but I wonder if this is one of these things that's always going to look better on paper than it is in real world execution.
Travis Hoium: According to some interviews by Sam Altman in the past couple of days, the vision here is bigger, and it will all make sense in a few months. Maybe we need to hold a little bit on what the full vision is. But I think what was interesting with these apps and one of the reasons that this is pertinent to us as investors, I think it's from a disruption angle. If you think about the biggest disruptions are moving to a different technology paradigm, so the PC. You have opportunity and disruption, the Internet opportunity disruption, mobile devices, same thing. If ChatGPT becomes the way that we interact with technology, now you don't have Zillow as an aggregator. You don't have booking.com as an aggregator. You have ChatGPT in the power position. Altman even said, we could have just who had gone out and called all the information that Zillow was calling, but we wanted to work with these partners like he's being some philanthropist with the technology. But this is, I think, a risk for a company is if you're losing that direct customer relationship and you're giving it to ChatGPT, is this a good thing, even if you're partnering with the leading AI company today, Lou?
Lou Whiteman: There's so much here, so much unpacked. For one, the big thing is, before we even get into the brands, it's privacy. OpenAI has a ton of data. Can OpenAI just ring off my wanting to book a trip without telling every other partner they have? Hey, Lou is going to be in Toronto next week. Why don't you sell him stuff, things like that. There's all sorts of just on that layer. I like only Expedia knowing if I'm going to Toronto. But the bigger thing here, this whole idea of the OpenAI as the new Windows. Windows became Windows because it worked with everything. That was it, whatever you wanted to build, you could do. There's a chicken and the egg problem here. You need customers, you need a ton of customers to attract every retailer to come on board or every website to come on board, but you need retailers to lure the customers. In theory, yes, there is a perfect world here where it's just I go to my OpenAI, and that's all I ever need. But how we get there is a bear.
Travis Hoium: Yeah, Rachel, this does seem like an area where it's possible for disruption if this vision works. But it's pretty unclear exactly how this is going to play out, given the massive size of this vision, not only from a technology standpoint but also from a financial standpoint.
Rachel Warren: Yeah, I want to stress that I think there's room for multiple winners here. You know, I don't think OpenAI comes in, and then that standard business model from some of these flagship players just goes out the window. As you noted, it's very early days. We're still waiting to see how exactly is OpenAI going to monetize this? Are consumers going to adopt this at a broad scale. But I do think it is interesting to look at the Bear thesis for a minute. Who could face disruption here if this type of platform ecosystem really takes off? Obviously the most significant disruption, which is what you alluded to, would be companies whose core business is providing a user interface for specific tasks. You could think about how Apple, Alphabet Google, Microsoft, which obviously control their respective ecosystems could face market threats. Of course, there's other companies you think of the Adobes and sales forces of the world. They're already experiencing some market skepticism amid the AI revolution. Then there's the traditional search engine business, which of course is dominated by Google. Could that be disrupted? OpenAI's approach has been to collapse the search to convert process. That could allow in this new app store, users to interact with services directly within ChatGPT. You could even think about how companies like Uber or DoorDash, who have really built their value on having users interact with their specific app to book a service could face some threats, but I don't think the actual reality is going to be this bleak. Honestly, I think more likely than not, if this new use case for AI succeeds, we'll probably see consumers adopt it as one other tool in their vast toolkit in the digital age. I don't think strong companies with robust competitive advantages are going anywhere. If anything, maybe they can use this type of tool to play to their strengths if they execute it right.
Travis Hoium: We're going to talk about that potential widening the funnel in just a moment. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Widening the funnel for some of these applications. Some that were announced as apps that are coming soon, Peloton, DoorDash, Target, it is possible that ChatGPT allows more customers to interact with these applications than they had previously. If you're not somebody who has downloaded the Peloton app and signed up for Peloton, you don't have access to that. Same thing with Target. Maybe you don't shop at Target, but maybe just having a conversation with ChatGPT is a good way for them to broaden out and get more customers. Is that possible that some of these applications, at least, are going to see this as a way to bring more customers to them? It's an opportunity instead of a threat, Rachel, because I think there's always two sides to the coin here, and one of the things we're going to talk about in a minute is how in the world does ChatGPT make money? Well, if you have a business that makes money and your problem is customer acquisition, maybe ChatGPT answers this for you.
Rachel Warren: Yeah, I do think it could widen the funnel. I also think an important point to make is, you see all of these major companies that are onboarding in the very early launch of this app store. I don't think these companies would be coming to the table with OpenAI if they thought this was just going to cannibalize their business. I think they see this as an opportunity.
Travis Hoium: That's usually the way that disruption works, to be fair. [LAUGHTER] As you see it, Disney sold their content to Netflix and basically armed the rebels.
Rachel Warren: To play the bull case here, I do think that a lot of these companies and others might view this integration into the OpenAI app ecosystem as an opportunity to widen their user funnel. The thing is, AI can commoditize very basic functions, but I think these companies are thinking that they can leverage OpenAI's platform to maybe deliver more integrated, personalized, or even efficient experiences that would draw users back to their core services and data. You can actually take Zillow as an example, which Lou was talking about earlier. Say a user uses ChatGPT to find homes near a certain location. Let's say they want to get the estimate valuations. They want to view the 3D virtual tours. They want to connect with a Zillow premier agent. They have to then go back to that app ecosystem. That could make them more of a gateway to some of that high value data. That's just one example. I do think there could be a competitive opportunity for companies that play this right. I just think it's too soon to know for sure what this is going to look like. I think it's also fair to say to your point, Travis, there might be companies that are onboarding to this because they fear getting left behind. That's also potentially a factor at play.
Lou Whiteman: Two thoughts here. For one, the idea of, so I'm not a Peloton customer. I maybe put in something in OpenAI, how can I get in shape? Then, am I going to get spammed with Peloton? [OVERLAPPING] I keep going back to this because this all just rings as something that sounds so much better on stage than it does in execution. I'll give you another example of this. Who is the gatekeeper here? Booking and Expedia are both partners right now. If I want to fly to Minnesota, who gets that business? Who decides that? Is that a competitive auction thing? Because if it is, and it gets expensive, [OVERLAPPING].
Travis Hoium: As it works right now, you would have to specifically call booking.com. [OVERLAPPING]
Lou Whiteman: But if you do that, you're not broadening the funnel. I'm already a relationship. If DoorDash and Instacart are both in this system, and one day, I say, I need milk. How does that work? There's a lot of ways that, yes, in theory, if they can work all of this out, it is intriguing. But there's all sorts of, I keep thinking of that meme where it's like, step 1, do this. Step 2, 3, and 4 is blank, and step 5 is profit. There's a lot of blanks in that middle right now as far as figuring out the economics here, who gets paid what and how it all works out. I get the vision, I just keep coming back to these execution things and wondering.
Travis Hoium: Well, that's a question I think we should dive into a little bit is is this a TenX improvement? The concept for a lot of disruptions and moving people from what they're doing today to doing something else is that it has to be 10 times better. If you go back to the advent of the PC. You're moving from doing math, for example, on paper to doing it on a computer, way easier. The Internet, now suddenly the encyclopedias that we had at home you can just find all that information online. Mobile devices, now that all that information is just in your pocket. All these are easily TenX improvements. Is going to one app, and this is where maybe we'll find out more about what the hardware future for OpenAI looks like over the next couple of months. But I do think that is a question, Lou is this the improvement in our lives that is going to necessitate us actually adopting OpenAI as our do everything application instead of the way that we're doing things today.
Lou Whiteman: Yeah, and another point on this. If we get into retail in a second, we can do more. But look, most shopping is not as exciting as what these presentations would say. Most shopping is, I need a gallon of milk, I need something. It's not I want to explore new fashion trends. I don't know if that we need a killer app for all of this. I see the use case, I see the concept, the execution, it's just the actual day to day implementation for us normies. I don't know how you get there.
Travis Hoium: Let's talk about one of those dark horses, Rachel. I thought it was interesting that Target was listed as one of their apps that's coming soon. Every one of these other companies is a tech company. I guess all trails would be maybe not quite as much of a tech company. But there you have a retailer that's struggling in the big box retail space. Maybe this is a way to attract some new customers. Could there be some dark horses here where you extend the long term? We've gone, especially in retail, I think that's maybe the best example is that Amazon has sucked all the oxygen in the room because you choose to go to the Amazon app. Well, Amazon, guess what? They don't want to be on ChatGPT and be disaggregated. Does that present an opportunity for companies that can, like you said earlier, go, hey, I'm not only not going to be left behind, but I'm going to take advantage of this because I don't have the same digital footprint as a company like Amazon.
Rachel Warren: I do think there's an opportunity there for companies like Target that are worth the classic brick and mortar that also have a strong online presence and others. But I think a lot of the utility of this goes back to how useful it is to the consumer. I think the core idea here is that if you are, say, shopping, you're on ChatGPT rather than having to go and open up a series of different apps to find the things you want. You can tell ChatGPT to open up a specific app and search for the thing that you want within that user interface. I do think that's something that is compelling to a consumer, particularly those of us who are on our phones, on our devices a lot. For Target's part, as you mentioned, they've had a very rough few years, particularly coming out of the pandemic, as well as a host of other issues that have been very specific to them and they have also been, I think, very much adopting a lot of different AI tools into their overall business. They already use generative AI, for example, to improve a lot of their product display pages on their website. They had last year introduced a proprietary generative AI chatbot for store employees called Store Companion. I do think they could use some of that standoff attitude that Amazon has leveraged in the past and instead really focus on key areas where they can build competitive differentiation. I do think that could provide a seamless, more personalized experience. Does this save a company like Target from some of its current woes? No, but does it provide perhaps a more unified ecosystem that gets more eyeballs to its platform from users? I think that's possible.
Lou Whiteman: I don't want to pick on Target here because I enjoy Target, but Target is a destination for pragmatists, not for dreamers. I don't know, back to my other point, Target is where you go when you need dog food or toilet paper or something. I don't know if I need an AI customized experience for that. I'm not sure I'm ever going to be like, I'm hunting for some nice gift from my wife.
Rachel Warren: Some of us ladies are at Target dreaming as we walk through the aisles, Lou. You have no idea [LAUGHTER].
Lou Whiteman: Maybe so, but I don't know. I like their curbside drop off and delivery. I think they've done good things. I keep going back to this, and I hate to be such a wet blanket, but it feels like a solution in search of a problem for Target here.
Travis Hoium: We'll see out to see how this plays out and as this vision rolls out, especially with potentially new devices, maybe that will change the game. Next, we're going to ask the trillion dollar question, and that is how in the world does OpenAI and all of their partners pay for this? You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Look, here's the trillion dollar question for OpenAI. We are through all their partners, spending somewhere around $1 trillion, probably more than that at this point. How are they going to pay for all this, are these apps going to be part of that solution? If you squint, you can see a monetization strategy, but it's not really clear yet, Lou. Is this going to be the key to the future of OpenAI becoming that company that can pay for tens of billions of dollars of compute each year.
Lou Whiteman: Travis, let's be clear here. Sam Altman says he's focused on the customer experience and not monetization. Obviously, yeah, but come on. I do think back to a point you made about, is this a leap step forward or incremental? How do you turn this into a big moneymaker, if it is incremental? I come back to the chicken and the egg question. If you want to make money off of the consumer signing up for premium OpenAI, you darn well better have a lot of retailers, a lot of partners. But how do you get those retailers of partners if you don't have a lot of people signed up. There is experimentation, maybe there's losses. That's why you focus on the customer experience now. Are we headed to Walled Gardens? Am I really going to want to use this if I can get Target but not?
Travis Hoium: It seems like that's what OpenAI wants to build, even though they're saying that's not what they want to build.
Lou Whiteman: Right, well, by default. I think OpenAI would like to be so present everywhere that every retailer just has to be on it the way every retailer is. But right now I can get a Google search and see the world. Until maybe there is just a specialized thing like, I want to use Booking, and I know Booking is on here, and I like the interaction, so I will opt in that way, but that's not the way to riches. I think there's again, if this becomes an open field where everything's involved like Google, I don't know if OpenAI has the advantage there. I don't know if commoditization is their friend and if it becomes harder to charge on the back end, so that's, I think, why they would like just partners opting in. But I think that just makes it harder to get consumer adoption. I think it's really, really hard to make this pay off in a big way. It could be a side feature, but this is not a core business here for the way they're spending.
Travis Hoium: What do you think, Rachel? Is this the preview of how is the going to make money? Is it big enough?
Rachel Warren: I think it's way too early to say. I think, honestly, OpenAI is trying to figure out their monetization strategy at this point. I think that's fairly obvious. If you think about some of their most advanced models, like Sora. The huge challenge there, training and running those models, that requires enormous investment in computing, power, data centers, and now you have the new app store and the goal seeming is to take a commission on sales from commerce queries, rather than maybe relying on that traditional ad system. I saw one report that suggested there could be something like a 2% affiliate fee in the works, and then you've got, of course, this very high investment Sora product, and they're reportedly moving toward a tiered subscription model.
Travis Hoium: Now, a 2% affiliate fee sounds like a lot. But if you look at how much companies spend [OVERLAPPING] on things like Meta ads. It's significantly more than that. The customer acquistion cost can be 20, 30% of a purchase price.
Rachel Warren: That's where you look at all this and you dig beneath the surface a bit, and it's still really unclear how much of a revenue producing venture are these new initiatives going to be, much less driving the company toward profitability. Obviously, the most significant and immediate source of revenue is likely to be enterprise partnerships, and they do continue to raise massive funding rounds. I think they're working on their monetization strategy, and they're seeing what sticks. I think that's really important to take away from all these recent announcements that we've been seeing.
Lou Whiteman: I think one filter to just as you look at all this, remember, OpenAI needs this more than their rivals. Meta has that fire hose of revenue coming in to fund this. Alphabet has Google funding this. OpenAI is the one here as an official nonprofit that, A, they aren't subject to the same SEC rules, so they can do more of the Silicon Valley fake until you make it. I don't mean that as against them, I think, as they should.
Travis Hoium: But it worked.
Lou Whiteman: Right, and that should be their strategy, but also they need to be saying, look at us, look at what we're doing. It's a neat vision of the future. I don't think it's a slam dunk they get there, as I look at this, it looks like a company that is wish casting as much as they are implementing. Part of wish casting is, like you said, Travis, see what happens and stick with what works.
Travis Hoium: I have heard you said that they have to keep spending because if they fall behind, they're done. They have to keep up with the Alphabets, the Metas, everybody that's investing tens of billions of dollars, so that's why this vision keeps getting bigger. Maybe there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but we will see.

Luckily, finding what other smart people are buying has become much easier over time. From the introduction of required SEC disclosures to the advancements of the internet putting that information at everyone's fingertips, you can get a peek at what some of the top investment managers are buying and selling.
One manager worth following is Philippe Laffont, who runs the hedge fund Coatue Management. The fund's publicly traded equity portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 by about 95 percentage points during the three-year period that ended in June, based on public filings. The fund's most recent 13F filing with the SEC revealed Laffont's continued sale of leading GPU-maker Advanced Micro Devices and a new position in one semiconductor stock he thinks can more than quadruple by 2030.
Trimming a former top holding
Laffont bulked up his position in AMD in late 2022 and early 2023, as the popularity and potential of generative AI became clear. At one point, AMD was Coatue's third-largest publicly traded equity position. But since reaching a peak in mid-2023, Laffont has trimmed 89% of his position in the GPU maker.
To be fair, AMD isn't the only GPU maker Laffont's trimmed after seeing the stocks soar amid the AI boom. Coatue cut its stake in Nvidia by about 77% since early 2023. However, he added some shares back last quarter while trimming Coatue's remaining stake in AMD by another 53%.
The timing wasn't exactly great for Laffont. Shares of AMD have outperformed Nvidia since the end of June, receiving a huge boost from a new deal with OpenAI to buy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs over a multiyear period. AMD will provide OpenAI with warrants to buy shares for each gigawatt of GPUs it buys, effectively providing a discount on its GPUs, but garnering a major customer and investor.
AMD's OpenAI deal is a vote of confidence in its forthcoming MI450 GPU platform, which AMD's management says will be able to outperform Nvidia's Rubin platform in both training and inference. If true, AMD could find its chips taking significant share in the data center market at Nvidia's expense.
Meanwhile, one of Laffont's biggest purchases last quarter was a new position in another chip stock that hasn't quite kept up with the GPU giants. But Laffont and his team think the long-term potential could be huge.
The newest chip stock in Coatue's portfolio
Laffont likes to take long-term outlooks on many stocks. The payoff for being right about an industry or company can be absolutely massive. Such is the case with his newly established position in Arm Holdings (ARM 1.33%).
Laffont sees Arm Holdings' market cap climbing to $787 billion by 2030, up from its current market cap of about $179 billion. That's a 340% increase in just five years.
Arm doesn't design chips itself. It provides a basic chip architecture for other chip designers to build on top of. It found a lot of success in the smartphone market, where energy efficiency was key. Now, it's looking to take share in the data center space, where energy efficiency is a growing concern, as energy supply could be the limiting factor in scaling data center compute power.
Arm is making strong progress, with 70,000 enterprises using its data center chips, up 14-fold since 2021. That's helped by Nvidia, which built its Grace CPU for its Hopper and Blackwell server racks using Arm's intellectual property. However, a recent deal between Nvidia and Intel may shift the GPU-leaders' focus to Intel's x86 architecture instead. Still, the Nvidia chip provides a clear example of the value Arm brings to other GPU makers and hyperscalers.
Not only is Arm taking market share in the valuable data center space, it's commanding greater pricing power for its latest-generation architecture. Royalty revenue increased 25% year over year in the first quarter. That's driven by higher royalty rates for its v9 architecture and other licensed IP. As companies adopt its newest architecture, it should result in strong revenue and earnings growth over the next few years. Laffont is betting that will send shares skyrocketing.
The one knock against Arm stock right now is its valuation. Shares trade for nearly 100 times forward earnings estimates. While it should see significant earnings growth over the next few years, that's a tough valuation to justify. Laffont seems to think it's worth the price, but shares look very risky right now."

Nvidia, the company at the center of this revolution, continues to be a Wall Street favorite for all the right reasons. As an undisputed leader in accelerated computing, the company's hardware and software power much of the world's AI infrastructure buildout.
Shares of Nvidia have already surged over 43% so far in 2025. However, despite the massive demand for its Blackwell architecture systems, software stack, and networking solutions, the stock may grow quite modestly in future months. With its market capitalization now exceeding $4.6 trillion and shares trading at a premium valuation of nearly 30 times forward earnings, much of the optimism is already priced in.
Memory giant Micron (MU 2.62%), on the other hand, is still in the early stages of its AI-powered growth story. Shares of the company have surged nearly 128% in 2025, which highlights the increasing investor confidence in its high-bandwidth memory and data center portfolio. Yet, Micron could still offer investors higher returns in 2026, while riding the same AI wave. Here's why.
Lower customer concentration risk
Wall Street has been highlighting one significant underappreciated risk for Nvidia. Nvidia's revenues depend heavily on a few hyperscaler customers, with two accounting for 39% and four accounting for 46% of its revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending July 27, 2026). Many of these hyperscaler clients are developing proprietary chips, which may offer a price-performance optimization in their specific workloads. This may reduce their dependence on Nvidia's chips in future years.
Micron's revenue base is significantly more diversified than Nvidia's. The company's largest customer accounted for 17% of total revenue, while the next largest contributed 10% in fiscal 2025 (ending Aug. 28, 2025). The company has earned over half of its total revenues from the top 10 customers for the past three years. The company has a reasonably broad customer base, including data center, mobile, PC, automotive, and industrial markets.
Hence, compared with Nvidia, Micron's lower concentration risk makes it more resilient in the current economy.
HBM demand and AI memory leadership
Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, known for their superior data transfer speeds and energy efficiency, are being increasingly used in data centers. HBM revenues reached nearly $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, translating into $8 billion annualized run rate.
Management expects Micron's HBM market share to match its overall DRAM share by the third quarter of fiscal 2025. The company now caters to six HBM customers and has entered into pricing agreements covering most of the 2026 supply of HBM third-generation extended (HBM3E) products.
Micron has also started sampling HBM fourth-generation (HBM4) products to customers. The company expects the first production shipment of HBM4 in the second quarter of calendar year 2026 and a broader ramp later that year.
Beyond HBM, Micron's Low-Power Double Data Rate (LPDDR) memory products are also seeing strong demand in data centers. The data center business has emerged as a key growth engine, accounting for 56% of Micron's total sales in fiscal 2025.
Hence, Micron seems well-positioned to capture a significant share of the AI-powered memory demand in the coming years.
Valuation
Micron appears to offer a stronger risk-reward proposition than Nvidia, even in the backdrop of accelerated AI infrastructure spending. The company currently trades at 12.3 times forward earnings, significantly lower than Nvidia's valuation. Hence, while Nvidia's premium valuation already assumes near-perfect execution and continued dominance, Micron still trades like a cyclical memory stock. This disconnect leaves room for modest valuation expansion to account for Micron's improving revenue mix toward high-margin AI memory products.
Wall Street sentiment is also increasingly positive for Micron. Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore recently upgraded the stock from equal-weight or neutral to overweight and raised the target price from $160 to $220. UBS has reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and increased the target price from $195 to $225. Itau Unibanco analyst has initiated coverage for Micron with a ""Buy"" rating and target price of $249.
Analysts expect Micron's earnings per share to grow year over year by nearly 100% to $16.6 in fiscal 2026. If the current valuation multiple holds, Micron's share price could be around $204 (up 6% from the last closing price as of Oct. 9), with limited downside potential. But if the multiple expands modestly in the range of 14 to 16 times forward earnings, shares could fall in the range of $232 to $265, offering upside of 20% to 37.8%.
On the other hand, there remains a higher probability of valuation compression for Nvidia, leaving less room for growth. With diversified customers, increasing AI exposure, and reasonable valuation, Micron may prove to be the better semiconductor pick in 2026."

Don't take my word for it: The world's five most valuable companies -- each with market caps of more than $2 trillion -- are leading innovators in the field of AI.
AI chipmaker Nvidia recently became the world's largest publicly traded company, valued at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), as its graphics processing units (GPUs) became the industry standard for AI workloads. Enterprise and cloud provider Microsoft provides a growing suite of AI tools, whikch has driven its value to $3.9 trillion. With more than 1 billion iPhones in the wild, Apple has a captive audience for its Apple Intelligence (AI) ambitions, pushing its market cap to $3.8 trillion. Cloud and AI leaders Alphabet and Amazon round out the top five, boasting values of $2.9 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively.
With a market cap of roughly $1.5 trillion (as of this writing), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.96%), often referred to as TSMC, is on the fast track to join this elite fraternity. The adoption of AI continues at a hectic pace, fueling blistering demand for its most advanced chips. As the world's largest and most renowned semiconductor foundry, TSMC is on the fast track to meet the requirements for membership in this exclusive club -- and it might happen sooner than investors realize.
Want chips with that?
TMSC has worked behind the scenes for years, fabricating the most advanced processors, but recently found itself in the spotlight. Management bills the company as the ""world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry,"" making it a critical provider in the supply chain for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI.
And make no mistake, no foundry is as well-regarded as TSMC. Its customer list reads like the Who's-Who of tech glitterati, and includes Nvidia, Arm Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, and Apple, among others.
With the surge in demand for AI-centric processors, TSMC is no longer dependent merely on smartphone chips. In fact, the lion's share of the company's revenue now comes from the advanced processors needed for HPC and AI, recently responsible for 60% of sales.
TSMC's growth continues to accelerate. In the second quarter, revenue of $30 billion grew 44% in U.S. dollars, while earnings per ADR soared 67% to $2.47. Management expects this trend to continue. TSMC is calling for third-quarter revenue of $32.4 billion in USD at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent growth of 38%, and the company has been known to underpromise and overdeliver.
The path to $1 trillion
TSMC is in an enviable position as the world scrambles to adopt this groundbreaking technology. The company is well positioned to benefit from advances in generative AI, counting the biggest names in technology as its customers. Furthermore, TSMC's rapid revenue growth is the clearest sign yet that it is poised to profit from this opportunity. As such, TSMC should soon be joining the company of multi-trillionaires.
According to Wall Street, TSMC is on track to generate revenue of $123.3 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 12.8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSMC would have to generate revenue of roughly $156 billion annually to justify a $2 trillion market cap.
It's telling that Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 16% and 18% in 2026 and 2027, respectively. If the company achieves those relatively low hurdles, it will likely achieve a $2 trillion market cap sometime in 2027. That said, given the company's accelerating growth in recent years, it will likely make the grade even sooner.
Estimates regarding the market potential of AI continue to rachet higher. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the coming decade. That could be conservative, as new use cases for AI are continually being developed.
Finally, at roughly 30 times forward earnings, TSMC is attractively priced, giving investors a practical way to invest in a once-in-a-generation opportunity."

Solana is likely to be the winner in the stablecoin and tokenization wave, according to Bitwise investment chief Matt Hougan.
“I think Solana is the new Wall Street,” Hougan told Solana Foundation marketing chief Akshay BD in an interview clip shared last week, citing interest in stablecoins and tokenization.
“Really important people are saying that stablecoins will reinvent payments and tokenization will reinvent stock, bond, commodity and real estate markets,” he said.

Hougan said investors seeking to invest in the narrative were likely to turn to Solana because of its speed.
“The speed, the throughput, the finality of Solana makes it seem extraordinarily attractive,” he said. “Solana literally gets to finality in the blink of an eye.”
Hougan cited Solana’s plan to achieve near-instant finality with Alpenglow, a proposed upgrade to the network’s consensus mechanism. The upgrade is expected to reduce block finality from 12.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds.
Hougan said Solana’s competitive stablecoin and tokenization advantage was likely to drive “substantial flows” to spot SOL exchange-traded funds.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Hougan’s remarks come as Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that spot SOL ETF approvals were in the offing just before the recent federal government shutdown. At the time, Balchunas cited the Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision to eliminate 19b-4 filings for spot cryptocurrency ETF applications.
The 19b-4 is submitted by exchanges on behalf of issuers requesting a rule change to list a new ETF. The filing has historically been required for spot cryptocurrency ETF applications, but it came with a lengthy 240-day statutory approval window.
The SEC’s decision to do away with 19b-4 filings for spot cryptocurrency ETF applications followed the implementation of generic listing standards for spot cryptocurrency ETFs, leaving only the need for S-1 filings or registration statements from issuers. Balchunas said spot Solana ETF S-1 filings had already undergone four amendments, which has historically been a sign of SEC engagement and progress.

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, has been a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) supporter, labeling it as a “vital means of resistance” earlier.
Nobel Peace Prize Winner Is A Bitcoiner
Machado was honored for her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela"" and her ""struggle"" against the Nicolás Maduro regime by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.
Interestingly, Machado thanked President Donald Trump after receiving the award. Trump’s supporters were aggressively pushing for his Nobel Peace Prize victory leading up to the event.

Amid the flow of congratulatory messages, several Bitcoin-focused X accounts began circulating clips from a 2024 interview in which Machado is seen supporting the apex cryptocurrency.
BTC A ‘Lifeline’ For Venezuelans
Speaking with Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation, Machado described Bitcoin as a “lifeline” for Venezuelans during periods of hyperinflation.
""Bitcoin bypasses government imposed exchange rates and thus helps many of our people"","" the opposition leader said. ""it has evolved from a humanitarian tool to a vital means of resistance.""
Machado said that a ""new democratic Venezuela"" will embrace Bitcoin and that she sees the digital asset becoming part of the country's national reserves.
Venezuela ranked among the leading Latin American countries in cryptocurrency usage, recording nearly $45 billion in transaction volume during the period between July 2024 and June 2025, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.
The Venezuelan bolívar collapsed by almost 98% against the U.S. dollar in the last 10 years, potentially accelerating the shift toward assets that can safeguard savings.
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

The institutional money floodgates have opened for Bitcoin, and one prominent crypto investor thinks the digital asset’s journey is just getting started—despite already trading north of $126,000.
Franklin Jiang, co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, told CNBC on Oct. 6 that Bitcoin’s current $2 trillion valuation could eventually swell to match gold’s $22 trillion market cap, representing potential upside of more than 10 times from current levels. His reasoning? Bitcoin is simply “a better version of gold.”
“It’s digital, it’s cheaper to transport and transact with, and it’s global and permissionless,” Jiang said. “You don’t have to carry around a heavy rock.”

The Institutional Adoption Wave Is Real
The numbers backing Jiang’s optimism are staggering. Total inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds since their launch have now exceeded the inflows into the Nasdaq-100 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), according to Jiang. That’s a remarkable milestone that underscores just how quickly institutional investors have embraced crypto exposure through traditional investment vehicles.
BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has emerged as the clear winner in this ETF race. The asset management giant’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) is approaching $100 billion in assets and has become BlackRock’s most profitable ETF product, Jiang told CNBC.
This surge in institutional participation marks a dramatic shift from just a year ago, when many financial professionals remained skeptical about crypto’s place in diversified portfolios. “Headwinds have become tailwinds for crypto,” Jiang said, particularly when it comes to equity investors embracing digital assets.

Most Investors Still Haven’t Touched Crypto
Despite Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, Jiang argues the market is far from saturated. A Bank of America survey conducted a few weeks ago revealed that more than 60% of investors still have zero exposure to digital assets, he said.
“The idea that digital assets are ‘too late in the game’ is not true,” Jiang told Reuters. “Most people still don’t own them.”"

The company’s DGX Spark, a pint-sized AI system that TIME Magazine named one of the “Best Inventions of 2025,” will go on general sale Oct. 15. The launch marks another step in Nvidia’s push to democratize high-performance computing, bringing data center–level performance to the desktop.
At its core is the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, capable of delivering up to one petaFLOPS of performance, roughly a quadrillion floating-point operations per second, a term used to quantify compute power. The Spark integrates ConnectX-7 high-speed networking and Nvidia’s full AI software stack, effectively giving startups, researchers, and developers plug-and-play access to industrial-grade compute power.
Unveiled at Jensen Huang’s GTC 2025 keynote in March, the DGX Spark was presented as Nvidia’s answer to the growing demands of “agentic AI,” a new class of reasoning systems that think, plan, and can act autonomously. Holding the small box in the palm of his hand, Huang said DGX Spark and its workstation counterpart, DGX Station, were “created from the ground up to power the next generation of AI research and development.”
With 20 CPU cores and 128 GB of unified GPU memory, Spark’s hardware is tuned for real-world AI work. Nvidia says users can fine-tune models with up to 70 billion parameters, run inference locally, and keep sensitive data entirely on-premise, all without relying on cloud infrastructure.
It’s also designed to fit neatly into developers’ workflows: wired and wireless networking, Bluetooth peripherals, and even the option to link two Sparks into a mini-cluster. “You can literally create your own personal cloud,” said Allen Bourgoyne, Nvidia’s director of product marketing.
Nvidia frames the DGX Spark around four key use cases:
-
Prototyping next-generation AI agents and chatbots
-
Fine-tuning medium-to-large models locally
-
Inference and testing without external dependencies
-
Data security, keeping information private and on-site
The Spark’s release comes at a time when the boundary between personal and enterprise computing is blurring. As AI models evolve beyond text and vision to reasoning and autonomy, compute needs are scaling faster than cloud capacity can keep up. Nvidia’s bet is that bringing supercomputing closer to the user will be essential to sustain that pace.
“There’s a clear shift among consumers and enterprises to prioritize systems that can handle the next generation of intelligent workloads,” Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies, said in Nvidia’s spring press release, underscoring the shift in computational needs as AI rapidly advances."

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics on Tuesday said it expects its biggest quarterly profit in over three years, as the global race to boost production of AI chips has tightened supply and driven up prices of conventional memory chips, the tech giant's mainstay.
Strong demand for conventional memory chips used in data centre servers helped offset weaker sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips of Samsung, which has been lagging rivals in the race to supply to Nvidia, analysts said.
The world's leading memory chipmaker estimated an operating profit of 12.1 trillion won ($8.5 billion) for the July-September period, up 32% from a year earlier and well above a 10.1 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate. That would mark its best quarterly profit in 13 quarters.
Samsung shares slipped 0.5% as of 0302 GMT after rising as much as 2.9% earlier to their highest level since January 2021. Analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking following the rally. The stock has risen about 75% this year.
""The third-quarter earnings surprise came from the chip business,"" said Ryu Young-ho, a senior analyst at NH Investment & Securities.
Strong demand for conventional memory to support general-purpose servers, combined with robust HBM demand for AI servers, have together fuelled overall memory demand, he said.
Although progress in supplying advanced high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to major clients such as Nvidia was slower than expected, gains in commodity memory, supported by tight supplies, helped cushion the impact, analysts said.
""Samsung is a big beneficiary of growing demand for commodity chips,"" said Sohn In-joon, an analyst at Heungkuk Securities.
Sohn attributed the earnings beat to stronger-than-expected prices of commodity DRAM and NAND chips, stemming from demand for data centre servers, and lower chip inventory by chipmakers that gave them bargaining power in pricing.
Analysts said Samsung also benefited from narrower losses at its foundry unit, which makes logic chips, as utilisation rates helped ease fixed-cost pressures.
The company said revenue would likely rise 8.7% to a record high of 86 trillion won from a year earlier, also helped by the weaker South Korean currency.
Samsung is expected to release detailed results including a breakdown of earnings for each of its businesses on October 30.
Expanding on its stock incentives for senior executives, the company has decided to launch a performance-linked stock compensation plan for all employees in South Korea over the next three years, according to an internal memo dated October 14, seen by Reuters. Samsung declined to comment on the plan."

The DGX Spark, which Nvidia said offers data center-class performance, packs the company's GB10 Grace Blackwell superchip, as well as its ConnectX-7 networking capabilities and software stack.
The idea is to provide smaller businesses and developers with access to an AI computing system without requiring them to spend thousands on renting AI data center services or buying their own AI servers.
The Spark is part of a new class of computer Nvidia is rolling out with third-party partners, including ASUS (2357.TW) and Dell (DELL), which will allow customers to develop and use AI models on their own local devices.
Nvidia said the Spark can be outfitted with up to 128GB of memory, which should help when running massive AI models.
“In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their own supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon [Musk] at a small startup called OpenAI — and from it came ChatGPT, kickstarting the AI revolution,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
“DGX-1 launched the era of AI supercomputers and unlocked the scaling laws that drive modern AI. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission — placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.”
Like the DGX-1, Huang also hand-delivered one of the first Spark systems to Musk.
The company also has a larger, more powerful DGX Station, which runs on Nvidia's GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra desktop superchip.
But don't expect to grab a Spark or Station and start running your video games or other apps. The system runs on Nvidia's own Linux-based DGX OS and its AI software stack and is specifically designed for building and running AI models.
Nvidia also said users can connect two Spark systems to allow for even larger AI models with up to 405 billion parameters.
The Spark and Station are designed to complement Nvidia's existing AI offerings, enabling users to prototype AI models before deploying them more widely.
Nvidia holds the pole position in the AI chip race thanks to both its powerful processors and CUDA software service.
In addition to its desktop systems, the company continues to ink massive deals with AI companies, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) that will see the ChatGPT developer purchase 10 gigawatts of GPUs.
Last month, Nvidia signed a deal that will see CoreWeave (CRWV) purchase $6.3 billion worth of GPUs from the chip giant.
The company is also providing GPUs to Elon Musk's xAI (XAAI.PVT), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and a slew of other tech behemoths — not to mention OpenAI and Oracle's (ORCL) joint Stargate Project venture."

And like that time, new start-ups are popping up, with Groq being one notable example.
Groq is competing with AI semiconductor chip leaders Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%). But rather than the start-up posing a threat to the market share of its larger competitors, it's looking like a catalyst to drive demand higher.
Here's how Nvidia and AMD stand to win as Groq, Cerebras Systems, and other AI start-ups join the race to capitalize on artificial intelligence.
Groq's challenge to Nvidia and AMD
Nvidia and AMD emerged as AI leaders by supplying graphics processing units (GPUs) to customers such as OpenAI. GPUs are crucial for powering the computational capabilities of AI systems, making them essential hardware for artificial intelligence.
Groq challenges Nvidia's and AMD's market dominance with its language processing unit (LPU). GPUs are effective for general AI computing and training. Groq's LPUs were designed specifically for AI inference, the process of analyzing data and drawing conclusions after an AI has been trained.
Because Groq's LPU focuses only on AI inference, the product delivers impressive speed and efficiency to the task. These capabilities have attracted customers.
Today, companies focused on artificial intelligence, such as OpenAI, are aggressively pursuing better AI inference. Groq is benefiting from the trend, resulting in a $750 million fundraising round in September, which boosted its valuation to nearly $7 billion.
How Groq helps Nvidia and AMD
In what ways do Nvidia and AMD gain from Groq's success? As the old saying goes, a rising tide lifts all boats. The increase in chip demand specific to AI inference means Nvidia and AMD can sell more products.
For example, AMD adopted a multipronged approach by offering GPUs and neural processing units (NPUs) to AI customers. NPUs are processors engineered to emulate the human brain's processing capabilities.
By providing various kinds of AI chips specialized for different tasks, Nvidia and AMD can drive up revenue. Their sales are poised to grow as the AI industry increasingly shifts from training AI models to inference.
That's already proving to be the case. In October, AMD signed a multiyear deal with OpenAI to deliver AI computing hardware. Describing the partnership and how it advances artificial intelligence, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, stated, ""This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential.""
Meanwhile, Nvidia made its own deal with OpenAI in September, and as part of that, will deliver millions of AI chips to the ChatGPT creator.
Additionally, Groq's success shows customer demand exists for alternatives to the market leader, Nvidia, which is estimated to control a dominating 94% market share. Groq's rise can loosen Nvidia's grip on AI chips as enterprises become more open to adopting non-Nvidia hardware.
This creates an opportunity for AMD to strengthen its market position. But Nvidia benefits as well by reducing the chances of a federal antitrust investigation.
That said, neither Nvidia nor AMD are at risk of losing serious market share to Groq at this time. Both have deep pockets to continue investing in cutting-edge AI tech, enabling them to ward off Groq's challenge.
Does investing in Nvidia and AMD stock make sense?
Groq's success signals the opportunity to invest in Nvidia and AMD is far from over. However, the growth the industry veterans can expect in the coming years has already pushed share prices skyward.
Nvidia's stock hit a record high on Oct. 9, exceeding $195, while AMD did the same with its share price surpassing $240 that day.
Consequently, both stocks sport elevated share price valuations based on the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of earnings based on estimates for the next 12 months.
As the chart shows, AMD's announcement of a partnership with OpenAI caused the former's P/E multiple to soar, and it's now far above Nvidia's. As a result, Nvidia shares are the better value.
Its superior valuation makes Nvidia the stock to consider purchasing despite both it and AMD being poised to enjoy years of business growth from AI. That said, Nvidia shares aren't cheap either, so the prudent approach is to wait for the stock price to dip before deciding to buy."

Zooming In On Asana (ASAN)
Asana’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 38 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock dropped 7.8% as President Donald Trump threatened to impose 'massive' tariffs on Chinese products, reigniting trade war fears. In a social media post, Trump stated the move was a potential countermeasure to China 'becoming very hostile,' following Beijing's announcement of new export controls on rare-earth minerals. These minerals are critical components for magnets used across the automotive, electronics, and defense industries. The unexpected development jolted Wall Street, which had been trending higher. The news sent all major indices into negative territory, with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite falling 1.7%, the S&P 500 dropping 1.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining by 0.9%.
Asana is down 28.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $14.28 per share, it is trading 48.1% below its 52-week high of $27.52 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Asana’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $585.73.

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after President Donald Trump eased concerns over escalating trade tensions with China, calming markets rattled by his earlier tariff threats.
U.S. stocks rose sharply, with the Nasdaq-100 jumping nearly 2%, following a post on Truth Social where Trump suggested the trade conflict would not worsen. This shift in tone provided significant relief to investors, who had driven a sharp sell-off the previous Friday due to fears of higher tariffs. Technology companies with significant international supply chains and sales, such as AMD and Nvidia, led the market rally, with their shares climbing 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively. The broader market indexes, including the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, also saw substantial gains, reflecting widespread optimism that a potentially damaging trade war might be averted.

After meeting with Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) management, Morgan Stanley maintains its optimistic view. Nvidia's AI growth is still early, according to analyst Joseph Moore. The corporation gets more cloud spending and its chips are constantly popular.
Moore said businesses are still switching from CPUs to GPUs, which has driven Nvidia's growth. When new AI applications appear, he warned, the real excitement will begin. Healthcare, law, and manufacturing are investigating how AI may impact their operations. Nvidia's development potential increases.
He also suggested that robotics might bring AI to the real world with industry-specific models. Moore highlighted that this supports Morgan Stanley's projection that AI infrastructure might be valued $3 trillion to $5 trillion by 2030.
Moore discussed Nvidia's vendor financing arrangements with OpenAI and CoreWeave. He said those expenditures are meant to accelerate innovation by opening more data centers faster.
Moore claimed Nvidia's team doesn't seem concerned about AMD's rivalry. Although competitors make good CPUs, Nvidia has a long-term advantage since it has a hardware, software, and developer tools platform.
Wall Street remains optimistic. 39 analysts follow Nvidia. 36 suggest buy, two say hold, and one says sell. Prices might rise over 16% to $219.42, the average price prediction.
Investors will watch Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and AI partnerships to see how fast growth will accelerate."

The crypto market just sent a clear message to skeptics: digital assets aren’t going away. Exchange-traded funds tracking cryptocurrencies shattered records with $5.95 billion in inflows last week, propelling bitcoin to an all-time high of $126,223 on Oct. 6.
The record capital flooded into digital asset investment products during the week ended Oct. 4, according to data from Coinshares. Bitcoin surged past its August peak on Oct. 5, extending gains that pushed the world’s largest cryptocurrency above $126,000 for the first time.

Where the Money Is Coming From
The U.S. led with $5 billion in crypto ETF inflows, followed by Switzerland at $563 million and Germany at $312 million—both setting new records, Reuters reported, citing data from CoinShares. Bitcoin attracted $3.55 billion, while Ethereum drew $1.48 billion. Solana and XRP weren’t far behind, pulling in $706.5 million and $219.4 million respectively.
But what’s driving this momentum isn’t just retail FOMO. Bitcoin’s ascent comes alongside a record rally in traditional safe haven gold, as a weakening U.S. dollar amid trade uncertainty and economic concerns is pushing investors to diversify their portfolios, Reuters reported.
“This level of investment highlights the growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said in the firm's weekly report.

The Institutional Shift That Changes Everything
Here’s what separates this rally from past crypto manias: institutional acceptance is accelerating faster than even bulls anticipated. Deutsche Bank expects bitcoin to feature on most central banks’ balance sheets, alongside gold, by 2030—a projection that would have seemed absurd just five years ago, according to Fortune.
The cryptocurrency rally this year has been driven by more supportive policies under U.S. President Donald Trump, demand from institutional investors, and bitcoin’s deepening integration with global financial markets, according to Reuters.
That integration is happening in real time. While retail investors chase price movements, institutions are quietly building infrastructure that treats bitcoin as a legitimate portfolio asset rather than a speculative gamble. The record ETF inflows reflect this shift—these aren’t day traders making impulsive bets, but wealth managers and pension funds methodically allocating capital."

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) backed Perplexity's CEO says he skips pitch decks and lets AI run the meeting. In an interview released Saturday by Berkeley Haas, Aravind Srinivas said the only slides he ever made were for the Series A. He prefers a memo, a live Q&A, and an open invitation to ask Perplexity anything that is not internal data. His line is simple. The product already knows everything, so put it on the spot and see what it can do.
Srinivas cofounded Perplexity in 2022 after research roles at Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) DeepMind and OpenAI. The startup counts SoftBank (SFTBY), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos among its backers. The approach shifts diligence from polished storytelling to real time performance, where speed and accuracy matter more than slide craft. investors may move from reading decks to testing products in the room. That could raise the bar on product truth and lessen the premium on presentation.
The takeaway is clear. Perplexity wants the work to speak for itself, and investors will watch for the next funding or product update that puts this pitch style to the test."

OpenAI has taken another swing at reshaping the AI hardware landscape, signing a multiyear pact with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to build custom chips and networking gear that could redefine its computing backbone. The partnership aims to add 10 gigawatts of AI data center capacity starting in the second half of 2026, with full rollout expected by 2029. Broadcom shares surged as much as 11% following the announcement, reflecting growing investor conviction that the chipmaker is fast becoming one of the most critical beneficiaries of the AI buildout.
Under the agreement, OpenAI will design the semiconductors while Broadcom handles development and production a collaboration that could let OpenAI embed its deep learning know-how directly into hardware. CEO Sam Altman said the two companies have been working together for 18 months, refining everything from transistor design to how ChatGPT executes a query. The goal, he explained, is simple but transformative: optimize every layer of the stack to deliver faster, cheaper, and more efficient AI models. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan framed the deal as a move toward self-reliance, noting that if you do your own chips, you control your destiny, signaling OpenAI's desire to lessen its dependence on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) proprietary ecosystem.
The agreement adds yet another piece to OpenAI's rapid-fire infrastructure expansion coming on the heels of Nvidia's commitment to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI's data centers and AMD's (AMD) separate deal to provide 6GW of processors. Unlike those pacts, this one involves no equity component, but it underscores how AI's supply chain is becoming an intricate web of mutual dependence and massive capital spending. Industry estimates put the cost of a single gigawatt of AI computing power at roughly $35 billion in chips alone. Even so, OpenAI President Greg Brockman called the 10GW plan a drop in the bucket compared to what's needed to reach the company's ultimate goal a push toward artificial general intelligence that could redefine the scale of the industry itself."

Tim Beyers: The AI infrastructure opportunity. Just how big is it? You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Big up Fools, I'm your host, Tim Beyers, and with me are two of my most AI immersed teammates Yasser El-Shimy and Asit Sharma. Thank you both for being here. How are you feeling this morning? Are you feeling suitably enthused about AI?
Asit Sharma: Well, Tim, after not saying that we're your two favorite analyst, but maybe two of your most AI ford analysts, I guess I'm feeling OK.
Tim Beyers: This is a compliment. It's not a backhanded compliment, Asit.
Asit Sharma: I hear you, my friend.
Tim Beyers: Yasser, how about yourself?
Yasser El-Shimy: Yeah, well, I'm going to steal your expression here and say caffeinated and ready to go.
Tim Beyers: Perfect.
Yasser El-Shimy: Excited about talking AI with you this morning.
Tim Beyers: Very good. Let's talk about this because there's a lot of AI infrastructure spend. I'll give you a quick stat here because I find this to be absolutely bonkers. The New York Times is reporting that Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and OpenAI combined are projecting 325 billion. That's with a B, 325 billion in spend by year end. We're in October, this was published in mid September. We're in October now, 325 billion by year end in pursuit of AI. That seems absolutely outrageous to me. Let's talk about other outrageous things that AI does before we get into the stocks. I just want to go around the horn because we're spending so much money. What is the last thing you asked AI to do? Could be for work? Could be for something utterly ridiculous? Yasser, you are laughing. I want to hear the ridiculous thing that you asked AI to do.
Yasser El-Shimy: Definitely not a ridiculous thing, at least not lately, although I would say that the last thing I ask AI to do is to help me out prepare for the podcast.
Tim Beyers: Perfect.
Yasser El-Shimy: This is just how tightly integrated into my workflow it has become. I find it actually, and this is incredible just the short amount of time since we started using AI here in any capacity. Then now we are at a point where I find it pretty hard to imagine doing most aspects of my job without the help of some generative AI model or the other.
Tim Beyers: Yeah. I mean, that's a paradigm shift. That's what we call a paradigm shift when habits change. Asit, how about you?
Asit Sharma: Same Tim, I used it to help me prepare for this podcast, but skipping that, the next most recent use, explain to me the phrase [FOREIGN]. This is a Turkish phrase that you didn't expect at all. Enough said, this shows how much this has taken over my learning curve among a number of disciplines.
Tim Beyers: You know what? Fair enough. I mean, I'll let that sit there, and then listeners can look that up for themselves. I will say I do this, I have started to use AI more as like a search. It's not replaced search for me, but now I ask utterly ridiculous questions all the time. I don't even do keyword searches anymore. I ask full questions. But let's talk about the opportunity, we have three views, one for each of us and three stocks which we're going to talk about. I'm going to again reiterate the amount of spend here. Microsoft just over the trailing 12 months, 64.6 billion in CapEx. Amazon, 107.7 billion, Alphabet, 66.9 billion, Meta, 52.2 billion. Of the big names, the only one that looks like the sober responsible one is Apple at 12.4 billion. I'm not sure they are or they aren't. But here's what I want to know. Yasser, what is your view of this spend because at some point, that spends got to pay off. What's your view of this and what's a stock that you think should be on everybody's radar in the midst of all this spend?
Yasser El-Shimy: Yeah, so I'm going to start off here by maybe quoting Satya Nadella, when he said every company is becoming an AI factory. We're witnessing these just absolutely incredible numbers of investments that you just outlined Tim, that all of the big large cap, hyperscalar technology companies here in the US and abroad are making in order to catch up with this AI revolution, let's put it that way. I would say when you said Apple is being responsible by spending only $12 billion. In fact, I might argue that could be a potential yellow flag for Apple. I think that a lot of investors have actually treated Apple accordingly because Apple has not shown us so far, at least, that they are able to come up with any major innovation when it comes to AI, they have had to rely on ChatGPT for the IOS systems here sold in the US, and they are relying on the Alibaba Qwen model for phones sold in China. There have been constant changes and staff and so on. Anyway, I could go on, but the point is, we're witnessing a wholesale paradigm shift in how we approach computing and what we use computing for. I was just talking earlier about how tightly integrated AI has become into my workflow, but that's not just me. That's a lot of people out there, and a lot of companies are spending a lot of time thinking about how to invest in AI.
Tim Beyers: Give me the company then that profits from this.
Yasser El-Shimy: All right, so the company, in my view, so on a risk adjusted basis, I would argue that Alibaba probably offers investors the best investment opportunity in AI over the next decade. Predictably or logically, a lot of investors here, when they think about AI investing, they think only about US companies, and that's understandably so. However I think given just a combination of very attractive valuation for Alibaba, as well as the massive investments it's making in its AI capabilities, and that includes a false tech. It's not only building the large language models, I mentioned Qwen earlier, which is integrated into iPhones sold in China, but it's also building data centers. It's building custom chips for AI. That it is even starting to sell to other Chinese companies that are in need of those chips. That is not necessarily replacing NVIDIA GPUs, but they're working on the inferring side to supplement and complement, but they have a major cost advantage compared to, let's say, US made chips or US designed chips. We are starting to see the early signs of green shoots of that massive jump in AI deployment, usage, consumption from Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence unit, which has had its revenue grow in triple digits over the past several quarters, where I think eventually Cloud revenue is going to become a meaningful mix of its overall revenue and margins are likely going to improve as a result of that change. All in all, I would say Alibaba offers a pretty good opportunity for investors here.
Tim Beyers: All right. Ticker B-A-B-A, BABA. Asit, what do you got for me here? You agree, disagree, refine? Give me something.
Asit Sharma: Yeah, I'm generally aligned with Yasser's view on AI capacity and the buildout that we're all witnessing. Several years ago, right before everything exploded with ChatGPT, and our lives changed without any chance of looking back, Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, said that the gains out of Moore's law were coming to an end, meaning thereby this linear ability to pack more and more information on a chip, had run out. At the time, lots of folks thought that he was simply saying that it's going to be harder for us to solve this mathematical type problem. But it turns out he was saying something else. You all are going to pay more to use this stuff. Lo and behold, a few years later, he's saying now that the reason all of this capacity needs to be built out. Why we're going to keep using this stuff more and more is because we're demanding more inference. We demand that reasoning that comes from this complex multi step task that GPU performs. Hence really to go back to what Yasser was just mentioning, we're going to as consumers, keep using these models. There is no turning back. Now, you're probably going to ask me, OK, if that's the case, what stock? Should we be looking at?
Tim Beyers: Read my mind. Tell me.
Asit Sharma: Here it is. It is NVIDIA's chief rival AMD. There's news out today that AMD, Advanced Micro Devices has signed this multi year deal with OpenAI. AMD is going to supply an enormous amount of gigawatt compute capacity, something like 10 gigawatts over the next several years. Tim, that deal is estimated to be in the 10 to billion dollars of revenue. In turn, OpenAI is going to take an ownership stake in AMD that's going to vest over time. Hello, circular economy. Let's slide by that for just a second. What I think this deal is is really a validation of a decision that CEO Lisa Su made more than a year ago, to buy a small company called ZT Systems. This is an AI infrastructure company, it allowed AMD to provide rack scale solutions. That is connecting tons and tons of GPUs together within a data center to provide, guess what? Better inference. This also is a validation of AMD's next generation of accelerators due out next year, which is going to be the first time this company will be able to really compete head on with NVIDIA. As we tape, this stock is up some 28% on news of this deal with OpenAI. But I think AMD is going to find many more purchasers for its systems over the next few years. Oracle already has come out as a very big purchaser of its accelerators, and I think it vindicates the narrative that AMD doesn't have to beat NVIDIA in the marketplace, it just needs to show that it is a worthy competitor, and it will shave off market share, which is going to be very good for a stock that is really yet to see the love that NVIDIA has experienced for the last couple of years.
Tim Beyers: It's interesting. You both make interesting cases here. Ticker, AMD is, as it sounds, Advanced Micro Devices, AMD. I'm going to go with Cloudflare. I'm going to zag while you guys are zigging. You're going into the silicon and the big Cloud providers. I think it's interesting we have not yet reached the era of AI efficiency. I think that history says that is coming. That is one million percent coming, in my opinion. At it's recent birthday week, Cloudflare said, essentially, AI cart at scale in order to serve as many users as possible. What we mean by this is every product, everything that they produce, any company can have it at full enterprise license for anything. Every product's got to be great on its face. They're not going to sell you a big bundle. They're not going to sell you a big tier, and then everything is jammed into that tier. They're not doing that anymore. Essentially, what they're doing is instead of looking at trying to win a customer at the biggest enterprise scale account they can they want to win problems. They want to solve as many problems as they can and then roll them up hopefully across customers. I think this is super interesting because at some point in a market where AI is just absolutely vacuumed up, money, attention, time, people resources. It's just hoovered it all up in ways that I think are probably somewhat damaging to some companies. There is a way to fix that is to make it a little bit more efficient. Instead of applying huge amounts of resource to solve the problem, we do better with less. I'm going to come back to that we've seen that cycle before, guys. But before we do that, we're going to move on to the next section here in a minute. We're going to forecast the future and make some reckless predictions. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
All right, we're back. We're going to have some reckless predictions now. I'm going to tee this up. When I said Cloudflare and again, I failed to mention the ticker last time. That ticker is NET for Cloudflare. I'm going to start with you, Asit, by teeing you up this way. You mentioned whether you meant to mention it or not, the circular economy in AI, and boy, is it circular? It's not even oval shaped. It is perfectly circular. We're not just talking about the hyperscalar here. Let me give you some stories here. NVIDIA committed $100 billion to invest in OpenAI. OpenAI has committed $300 billion to Oracle. Intel and AMD, are talking about a foundry deal. Everybody is doing business with each other. Asit I have seen this before. I saw it during the dot com days when all of the cable companies and all the infrastructure companies, all the telecom companies were doing business with each other and selling fiber agreements and booking revenue that wasn't really revenue. Give me your reckless prediction here. You've got so much experience both of you with AI but where are we heading here? Does any of what I just told you give you pause?
Asit Sharma: Of course, it gives me pause, Tim, and I hope our listeners today, some of you all of you are jugglers or can juggle, I can juggle long term bullishness with this sector with my reckless prediction teed up so perfectly by Tim Beyers. I predict a mini crash in the AI infrastructure investment theme and that economy that's associated with it within the next three years. Now, at that point, I think we're going to see major hyperscalers suddenly reevaluating their spends. We've seen some previews of this already. The entire ecosystem is going to suffer as a result. This will be a time of significant sell offs across the semiconductor, the hyperscalar, and the energy sectors. We're going to see lots of pundits come out and claim they were right to point out this house of cards in the infrastructure buildout. I think we'll also see a flurry of news articles about the illusory value of AI or the infinitesimally small value of AI. But at that point in time, I think you're also going to see the major hyperscalars will be rejiggering their spend, so will sovereign governments who are getting into this game. They're going to complete their first realistic calibration of their investment time horizon versus their expected results. The industry is going to get back to work. It's going to continue to grow. That point in time, when this mini crash happens, I think it'll be an excellent time to buy your favorite high conviction names.
Tim Beyers: I like it. Yasser? What you got for me? You want to disagree with that?
Yasser El-Shimy: Well, I'll disagree with that, but maybe I'll offer a separate prediction later. I would say that we are going to be all surprised at how durable the AI infrastructure CapEx spend is going to be. Right now, we've seen all the forecasting agencies, and that includes Gartner and others continuously raising their forecasts of AI spend, not because they are just so extra bullish, but rather because they have been reacting to what CEOs and CFOs have been saying and have been indicating. The last I heard was Gartner saying that by 2026, we're going to have $2 trillion of investment next year. Alibaba's CEO, Eddie Wu, he's predicting now that by 2030, we're going to see $4 trillion of CapEx spend. I think that the buildup is real. I think there is a race here in order to create that capacity, compute capacity, be that the favor provider, if you will. Having said that, of course, I assume that the music is going to stop at some point. Now, when is that point? That's when it gets very testy. I would say that just as long as you avoid investing in highly speculative, extremely valued companies, you're probably going to be OK, in a long term basis. Just as the dot com bubble did burst in 1999, that didn't mean that the Internet was not useful and did not create trillion dollar companies as we look back in retrospect. We just have to be careful on how we deploy our capital and how we invest.
Tim Beyers: Yeah. I mean, and portfolio management is one way. We can do that, we can take small positions and build them up over time. I think I'm going to be in between the two of you here. I do think the dot com cycle efficiency interrupt and capital buildout is absolutely going to happen. That is going to happen. Having said that, I think the way that the efficiency manifests itself will unleash some real potential value here. I've said this before. If you've listened to me on Fool 24 or other places, I've said this before, I think that specialist AI models or embedded AI models are the thing that is most likely to gain huge traction over the next five years. In other words, inside of a distinct application, you have an AI model that does something that does something limited, specific and valuable and creates a workflow, instead of just something giant and monolithic, where all this spend is going, I see less of that and more of this. That is a pretty interesting way to spend money and get a return on AI quickly. For an example of what this is, we'll see whether or not he is right, but Aman Narang, who is the CEO and co-founder of Toast, has said, I want to make the greatest GPT in the world for restaurants. They're working on something that they very cheekily call Sous Chef. You're going to have an AI that they call Sous Chef and it'll be a specialist AI. That's what I'm talking about. Is it going to add a whole bunch of value to Toast? I have no idea, but I do know that is something we're likely to see a whole lot more of. Here's what we want to know Fools. Make your own reckless predictions. Comment on this podcast. Tell us which reckless prediction you think is most likely to come true. Your answer can be none of them, and you have a totally distinct reckless prediction. But let us know what you think. Up next, we're going to talk about some of those companies that are trying to seed new ground, and we're going to name some fakers or some breakers. The IPO edition, stay tuned. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
We're back. We got three companies and I want each of you to weigh in on this. I've played this game with Rick Benares before. This is called faker or breaker. This is the IPO edition. For those who don't know, a rule breaker is a company that can grow at an accelerated pace for a much longer period of time than expected. A faker is not the opposite of that, it is the Fools gold of the rule breakers universe where there's outrageous growth for a period of time, but it lacks some of those other rule-breaker traits. Just as a selfish plug here, you can read more about the six traits of a rule-breaker in David Gardner's new book, Rule Breaker Investing, where he lays out the traits, the habits of a rule-breaker investor, and the characteristics of portfolio management when you are trying to build a portfolio of rule breakers. Great book, you should check it out. But we want to distinguish here. A faker is one that has a lot of growth but can't sustain it 'cause it just doesn't have the traits to back it up. Three companies, and I'm going to get you each to weigh in. Yasser I'm going to start with you. Are you ready?
Yasser El-Shimy: I am.
Tim Beyers: All right. Ticker, KLAR. That's Klarna. Recent IPO Klarna, I'm going to give you some facts on this one and then you tell me faker or breaker, 20% year over year revenue growth reaching 823 million in Q2. Fairly strong commercial penetration. They have a deal with Walmart. They displaced a firm there. It looks pretty good. However, they are relying on people spending because it's a buy now pay later platform. They may be relying on consumer spending unsustainably here. We have heard reports about this. People get their delivery, their meal delivery, and then they buy it on buy now pay later. Not great. That doesn't seem like a really great habit. Yasser for you, faker or breaker, Klarna?
Yasser El-Shimy: I'm going to go with breaker here. This is a company that has been one of the very earliest companies to pioneer the buy now pay later industry, if you call it that. It has been one of the biggest financial engineering introductions in the last decade or so. It has been able to sustain its revenue growth at a decent clip over the past few years, even though it has only recently IPOed, so we don't really have a long track record of share price appreciation, for example, or other traits of rule breakers. But I'm going to go on a limb and call it a breaker.
Tim Beyers: I'm going to keep moving because we're running short on time here, Asit, and move to the next one. That's going to be StubHub. You've probably heard of this one if you ever tried to buy tickets for live events in the secondary market here. Dominant 34, 30-40% of the market here, Asit, Ticker STUB. Seems to have a flywheel that they can rely on here, $8.7 billion in gross merchandise sales in 2024. That was up 27% here. But I have to believe this is one that is maybe, if not hated, might be a little bit suspicious and might have regulators looking over their shoulder. For you, Asit, faker or breaker, StubHub?
Asit Sharma: Faker, Tim.
Tim Beyers: Okay.
Asit Sharma: What you mentioned is part of it. Now, StubHub doesn't have quite the consumer hate that Ticketmaster seems to elicit.
Tim Beyers: Yeah, sure.
Asit Sharma: It certainly struggles with margins. It's a platform, which I think is very upendable. I think challengers can come in the future. It is one that enjoys a lot of brand presence, so we can't discount that, but it's ability to stay as this first mover top dog a type of company, I think is very much open to question. I think in the long run, this is a business that runs toward commodity and a business that extracts your irate response on some days, it brings hate instead of love. At some point, when you're trying to buy a ticket or get to a basketball game that you want to get to, I think that can't be a company that is rule breaker over the long term.
Tim Beyers: I got to say, I agree with that. I'm going to give you both the quick skinny on Fermi. This is Ticker, FRMI. This is brand spanking new, just born. This is a company that is building out data center scale electric power, doing it with nuclear, maybe some solar, maybe some natural gas. It's Texas based, it just went public, guys. Dual listing on the NASDAQ and the London Stock Exchange. They call this project Matador, is their signature product. I don't know, that sounds ridiculous on its face, but this is 5,236 acre site. This is in Marion, Texas. It's going to deliver up to 11 gigawatts of low carbon behind the meter power. It seems like the theme of this show is AI infrastructure. This is playing right into it, Yasser. Give me the quick answer here. It's very early, they're building out. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry is leading this. What do you think? Faker or breaker?
Yasser El-Shimy: Faker, faker, faker.
Tim Beyers: Faker, Faker, faker. Wow.
Yasser El-Shimy: Yeah. I would say it's a business plan, it's not a company.
Tim Beyers: It's a business.
Yasser El-Shimy: It's basically there are a lot of promises about what this is going to be. The fact that they IPOed before pre-revenue, pre anything happening, I would be extremely skeptical. If investors are interested in AI infrastructure plays, there are definitely a lot of companies already publicly traded that provide that as opposed to just a promise of one in the future.
Tim Beyers: Asit can you top that?
Asit Sharma: Yes, faker, faker, faker faker.
Tim Beyers: Nice.
Asit Sharma: It's got one rule breaker trait in spades, overvalued. As Yasser rightly points out [LAUGHTER]. This is contravening famous advice that master investor Peter Lynch gave, which is, don't invest in pre-revenue companies. Those are way long shot, so I'd be very careful here.
Tim Beyers: Yeah. Thanks to both Yasser El-Shimy and Asit Sharma for joining me today.

A trader who attracted attention for successfully shorting Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) just before the recent crash added to their position even as the market rebounded on Sunday.
Investor Doubles Down On Bearish Position
The investor opened the position at $117,369 and was sitting on an unrealized profit of $3.70 million as of this writing, according to decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid. The trader took a 10x leverage bet to boost the position's value to over $163 million.
If Bitcoin reaches $123,510, which is 7.59% away from its current price, the trader will be liquidated.
Interestingly, the bet was taken despite the market’s sharp rebound, with Bitcoin regaining $115,000 on Sunday.

Signs Of Insider Trading?
The whale grabbed headlines after opening multi-million dollar short positions on BTC and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) right before President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on China.
The cryptocurrency market tumbled in response and the trader subsequently closed most of their short positions, netting a profit of $160 million.
Reacting to the development, capital markets commentator The Kobeissi Letter said, ""Did Someone Know?""
This is not the first time that suspicions of insider trading have been raised in relation to Trump’s posts.
Earlier in March, a trader opened a 50x leveraged bet on Bitcoin and Ethereum shortly before Trump announced a cryptocurrency reserve, turning an investment of $4 million into a $200 million position.
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity,Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.
SoFi Alt Investments
SoFi gives membersaccess to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time.

Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

While shares of NVIDIA have inched up 3.1% Broadcom dropped 10.8%, YTD. The broader sector has declined 0.9%.
The outperformance can be attributed to strong demand for EPYC processors that power cloud and enterprise workloads. Emerging AI use cases and rapid adoption of agentic AI are generating demand for general-purpose compute infrastructure, benefiting EPYC demand. AMD is benefiting from strong traction in the AI infrastructure market, driven by its advanced product portfolio and strategic investments in AI hardware and software. An expanding partner base, including a recent 6-gigawatt deal with OpenAI, boosts AMD’s prospects.
However, stiff competition from NVIDIA and Broadcom, along with a challenging macroeconomic environment due to tariff-related uncertainties, creates a headwind for AMD.

EPYC and Instinct Adoption Bode Well for AMD’s Prospects
Adoption of EPYC by the largest cloud hyperscalers is increasing significantly. In the second quarter of 2025, more than 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances were launched, including multiple Turin instances from Google and Oracle ORCL. AMD stated that there are currently 1,200 EPYC cloud instances available globally, and this expansion is driving enterprise adoption of EPYC in cloud. AMD won customers across aerospace, streaming, financial services, retail and energy domains in the second quarter of 2025. Telecom is becoming a stronghold for AMD, with KDDI announcing plans to deploy EPYC processors to power its 5G virtualized network and Nokia selecting EPYC for its cloud platform.
HPE, Dell Technologies, Lenovo and Super Micro launched 28 new Turin platforms in the reported quarter. In enterprise, EPYC is gaining traction with an expanding clientele in technology, automotive, manufacturing, financial services and public sector domains. The launch of the EPYC 4005 series is expected to boost AMD’s footprint among small and medium businesses as well as hosted IT service customers.
Apart from EPYC, AMD’s prospects are driven by strong demand for Instinct accelerators. In June 2025, AMD unveiled its new Instinct MI350 Series GPUs and open rack-scale AI infrastructure, showcasing significant advancements in AI performance and energy efficiency alongside major industry partners.
AMD stated that its MI355 matches or exceeds NVIDIA’s B200 in critical training and inference workloads. MI355 delivers comparable performance to GB200 for key workloads at lower cost and complexity. AMD remains on track in the development of the next-generation MI400 series and is expected to launch in 2026."

President Donald Trump's past remarks about Bitcoin's potential to ""save America"" deserve scrutiny: what it would actually take for the cryptocurrency to cover the $37 trillion U.S. national debt?
Bitcoin Would Need $1.8 Million To Match U.S. Debt
Trump has previously suggested the nation’s debt burden could be paid off with Bitcoin.
But according to calculations based on Treasury data and blockchain supply metrics, Bitcoin's circulating supply of roughly 19.93 million coins would need to reach a combined value of $37 trillion to offset the U.S. debt load.
That implies an average price of nearly $1.86 million per BTC, based on the current supply figures compiled by MacroMicro and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Trending: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.81 a Share
At today's levels, Bitcoin trades near $112,000, giving it a market capitalization of about $2.23 trillion — a fraction of what would be needed.
Even on paper, the market cap required to match U.S. debt is astronomical, and converting that value into actual dollars would be impossible without crashing the market.
Liquidity And Market Depth Make It Unworkable
Economists say even if Bitcoin were to reach such valuations, converting that amount of crypto into cash would be self-defeating.
Large-scale liquidation would erode liquidity and trigger cascading selloffs long before the government could access the full value.
Additionally, a large portion of Bitcoin's supply is considered illiquid — locked in long-term wallets, lost keys, or institutional reserves.
Estimates suggest more than 20% of all mined Bitcoin is effectively unrecoverable, further reducing available liquidity.
Beyond market dynamics, there are also legal and political constraints.
The U.S. government cannot forcibly seize or monetize all privately held Bitcoin without massive backlash and constitutional challenges.

Economic Fallout Would Overshadow The Goal
Analysts note that even if Bitcoin's market value equaled $37 trillion, attempting to convert that theoretical wealth into dollars would destabilize global markets.
Selling that volume into any trading venue would collapse prices, trigger derivatives losses, and potentially ignite systemic contagion across currencies and equities.
The Peterson Foundation has warned that fiscal solutions depend on sustainable economic growth and policy reform — not speculative asset revaluations."

Strong Advanced Packaging Demand Aids ASYS’ Prospects
The long-term prospects for the advanced semiconductor packaging industry remain strong, with growing momentum in the sector serving as a tailwind for capital equipment demand. According to a Mordor Intelligence report, the advanced packaging market is estimated to reach $89.89 billion by 2030 from the projection of $51.62 billion for 2025, seeing a CAGR of 11.73%.
Amtech Systems has identified advanced packaging as a significant growth opportunity, particularly within artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company observed a strengthening demand for its equipment used in advanced packaging applications, particularly within AI infrastructure.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, sales of equipment used in AI infrastructure were five times higher than a year ago and made up about 25% of Thermal Processing Solutions’ revenues. This shows how quickly AI demand is becoming an important part of Amtech Systems’ business. Moreover, per management, bookings in the fiscal third quarter suggest that AI-related demand should remain strong going forward. This uptick in demand is expected to serve as a growth catalyst.
In alignment with this positive momentum, Amtech Systems projected revenues of $17-$19 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, with growth in AI-related equipment sales expected to be the major growth catalyst. This outlook reflects the company's confidence in sustaining growth, driven by ongoing investments in AI-related packaging and thermal management solutions. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues suggests an increase of 4.6%.

SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif., Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heron Power, a developer of industrial power electronics for the 21st-century grid, today announced it is advancing next-generation power infrastructure for AI data centers. Heron Power’s first product, the Heron Link, is natively compatible with the 800V DC rack architecture announced by NVIDIA. Designed for high power density and manufactured in the USA, Heron Link offers greater reliability, a domestic supply chain, and lower costs for renewable, energy storage, and data center developers.
While AI architecture has advanced significantly in just the past couple of years, the equipment connecting compute power to the grid hasn’t changed in decades. This mismatch is quickly becoming a critical bottleneck holding back the development and deployment of AI technology.
“Increasing compute power density is key to accelerating AI progress and requires a first principles redesign of data center electrical architecture,” said Drew Baglino, Founder and CEO of Heron Power. “As data centers approach gigawatt-scale campuses built around megawatt AI compute racks, they are rightfully taking inspiration from mature gigascale DC technologies like energy storage and solar. Direct 34.5kV AC to 800V DC conversion is the efficient, streamlined, scalable power architecture that global leaders in AI need to achieve their goals.”
Heron’s solution combines Heron Link’s hyper-efficient 34.5kV to 800V DC solid state power conversion with integrated energy storage to stabilize GPU power ripple at the rack level and respond rapidly to grid needs and facility power transitions. With built-in N+1 redundancy, Heron’s scalable solution ensures uninterrupted AI compute performance while dramatically accelerating infrastructure deployment. NVIDIA recently recognized Heron as a data center power system provider within its Open Innovation Ecosystem, a collaboration announced at the 2025 OCP Global Summit.
Heron Power today released a new white paper, “Heron Link: Unlocking Efficient Power Conversion For Gigascale AI,” detailing the technical foundation behind the company’s next-generation architecture. The paper captures how Heron’s integrated medium-voltage power electronics platform simplifies data center design by removing legacy low-voltage stages and central UPS systems, reducing electrical footprint and deployment time while boosting efficiency and resilience. It also highlights how Heron Link’s grid-forming capabilities enable AI data centers to stabilize voltage and frequency, transforming them from passive energy consumers into grid-strengthening assets."

For instance, Susquehanna raised their price target to $400 from $300 last week after TSM reported a 31.4% increase in September sales (vs. Sep'24). And the Jan-Sep run-rate compares at +36.4% yoy.
Taiwan Semiconductor, aka TSMC, is the premier chip fabrication company for the world's most advanced digital technologies, from Apple smartphones to NVIDIA GPUs.
In less than five years, TSMC's trailing 12-month revenue has more than doubled to hit nearly $105 billion as of the June quarter. Clearly, this is on the back of NVIDIA's (NVDA) explosive growth which saw sales grow by ten times in the same period to $165 billion as of the July quarter, on its way to cross $205 billion this fiscal year (ends January).
Of course, demand for NVIDIA GPU systems didn't turn into a hockey stick until its ""ChatGPT moment"" in the spring of 2023.
I mark that moment in late May at Computex in Taipei City, Taiwan when Jensen Huang unveiled the DGX Grace Hopper 200 system and said that Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms (META) were already in line.
To me, this meant that the other 996 corporations in the Fortune 1,000 would want (or need) to build their own LLMs too. I then published this article and video to explain what was coming...
Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion
And that $2 trillion market cap came quickly. That's when the ""AI bubble"" talk started. You can imagine how astonished the bubble breathers are now that NVDA is approaching a $5 trillion market cap.
""Honey, I Shrunk the Chips!""
While Apple's business has been significant for TSMC (as much as 25% of revenues), the iPhone maker's sales growth has stalled in the low single digits.
What still makes Apple very important though is how they help drive innovation at TSMC by always demanding the latest and greatest architectures for their ecosystem of devices.
TSMC supplies chips for flagship smartphones and 5G infrastructure, where efficiency and miniaturization are crucial. The company’s 5nm and 3nm transistor nodes are widely adopted in high-end mobile devices and 5G equipment, supporting the global rollout of next-generation connectivity.
Transistor nodes refer to the specific manufacturing processes used to produce integrated circuits, where the ""nm"" (nanometer = 1 billionth of a meter) like 7nm or 5nm, historically represented a physical dimension of the transistor, specifically the gate length. For reference, the coronavirus is about 50nm.
Now it's more of a marketing term that signifies a new generation of chip technology with improved performance, power efficiency, and transistor density.
But generally, a smaller node number means...
Smaller transistors: More transistors can be packed into the same area on a chip.
Faster switching: Electrons have a shorter distance to travel, leading to higher clock speeds.
Lower power consumption: Less voltage is needed to operate the smaller transistors.
Why the AI Economy is Not a Bubble
Which brings us back to NVIDIA as they now pack 208 billion transistors into the Grace Blackwell ""superchip"" with further density on the horizon in the Rubin and Feynman series of GPUs expected in 2026 and 2027, following Jensen's nearly annual cadence of development.
I mentioned the early demand for NVIDIA systems in 2023 and have recently seen similar projections from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Marvell (MRVL) at their Custom AI Investor Event that total datacenter capex by the big ""hyperscalers"" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle) plus Meta, Tesla (TSLA), OpenAI, Apple, and xAI, will grow from nearly $600 billion this year to over $1 trillion in 2028.
This demand is not slowing down because all these companies realize that the transition to an ""AI economy"" is built on the infrastructure of NVIDIA GPU systems. I am on record late last year saying that this megatrend would lead to over $500 billion in revenues for NVIDIA by 2030. That's only ~35% CAGR from when the TTM topline crossed $100 billion.
And Citi just updated their industry outlook in their ""Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Energy"" report. The bank forecasts global AI infra capex at $5.5 trillion cumulative through 2029 (56% CAGR), hitting $2.16T in 2029 alone. So that's a double from 2028's $1 trillion.
And that's the infrastructure to power not just generative and agentic AI systems (i.e., LLMs), but a whole new world of ""physical AI"" for autonomous machines, including self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and many other types of 3D automation requiring ""embodied"" or edge intelligence and vision/spatial perception.
And of course my favorite use cases for these technologies are science and medicine, where researchers can plumb the depths of our existence and come back with wondrous and life-changing knowledge.
The training alone for these worlds requires enormous datasets and compute, using simulation and synthetic models. In this way, Jensen is forging a new universe of possibilities that keep TSMC ""fabs"" humming.
TSMC is the Backbone of the AI Economy
TSMC holds about 67% of the global foundry market and nearly 90% of advanced chip production, making it the preferred manufacturer for high-performance, custom AI accelerators and GPUs.
While NVIDIA designs the magical GPUs and systems that power the innovations of the AI Economy, it all starts with Taiwan Semi's advanced silicon fabrication. This is the epitome of high-tech manufacturing using lithographic etching to create circuits smaller than the eye can see.
And what's better for crafting new chips than brand new ""fabs"" as TSMC just broke ground on their 3rd facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In late June, Softbank's Masayoshi Son announced new plans to invest in a $1 trillion industrial complex in Arizona that will build robots and AI technologies.
Son is seeking to create a version of China's vast manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, which concentrates high-tech companies for proximity of resources, logistics, R&D, collaboration, and talent. TSMC was named as a key partner in Son's plans.
Currently for TSMC, the 5nm and 3nm nodes are the backbone for state-of-the-art AI accelerators, powering chips from NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple that are used in generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.
In Q1 2025, 58% of TSMC's wafer revenue came from 3nm and 5nm nodes, with 73% from 7nm and below, underscoring the centrality of these advanced processes in TSMC's business and the broader tech ecosystem.
But TSMC wouldn't be itself if it wasn't planning to go deeper. The company plans to begin production of its 2nm node by late 2025, promising significant gains in power efficiency and performance. Looking further ahead, mass production of the 1.4nm (14 angstroms) process is slated for 2028, offering 10–15% higher speeds or 25–30% lower energy use compared to 2nm."

It's time now for our stock of the day. Broadcom shares surging after inking a deal with Open AI, but as AI spending ramps up and more companies jump in, are investors starting to worry that we're in real growth or signs of a bubble. Still with me my round table, Lou Bassanese, Brooke DePalma, and Jennifer Schonberger. And Lou, I know you were just talking about the fact that things are different this time, that there's real earnings growth here for a lot of these AI companies, but is it a concern that these AI heavyweights are funding each other's growth? Is that a circular risk that investors aren't accurately pricing in?
I think it's definitely a potential circular risk and yes, I'm reticent to say it's going to be different this time knowing how many times that's failed for others in the past. But here's the key thing from today's announcement from Broadcom, right? We're we're seeing a transition from general processing units for for AI into custom chips, which shows that they're being the the leaders in this trend are really being thoughtful about how are they going to drive growth two years from now, five years from now, 10 years from now. and I think you're seeing this expand as well because this is not Open AI's first custom chip deal. Remember they had one with AMD as well. So, I think there's a real desire to secure as much chip supply as you can to then innovate and iterate to have custom chips to allow you to develop the products and solutions and then here's where I think things get interesting. In the dotcom days we had all the internet and fiber that we needed to do whatever we whatever the companies could imagine. In the AI days, we don't have that infrastructure yet. So I think there's a true capacity buildup that can't happen overnight and that's what's being lost on a lot of investors. I think there's a bubble in bubble talk because they don't understand that. Um but I do think that this this trend does have legs. I think it's a multi-year trend, but yes, there's going to be volatility here. Uh I think you have to pick your spots. You can't just blindly buy Nvidia and hope for the best. I think you've now that the the trade is moving on to the energy and infrastructure side, you have to look at players in that space like we've talked about before, like IRen which has about three gigawatts of power coming online to fun to uh power their data centers. I think that is a very interesting trend and trade in addition to the chip makers here that are leading the custom chip uh revolution.
Yeah, and and to that point, uh we're seeing other chip makers outside of those Mag 7 names outside of Nvidia and Broadcom rally this morning. Brooke, what are you seeing when it comes to other maybe AI adjacent names that have rallied on the heels of Nvidia and some of these other companies' growth plans and what are strategists saying when it comes to the need to continue to add exposure here despite some of those concentration risks?
Yeah, well we did hear from UBS saying that AI companies are largely adopting more prudent investment strategies and healthier corporate finances as Lou was just really pointing out there. And this momentum behind what exactly this could be has really led this tech rally. Now we're seeing some renewed optimism around that this morning. I also do want to point out some key timelines here because this Broadcom deal, the hardware rollout should be completed by what they say by the end of 2029. Of course that is nearly four years away and so it really is this renewed optimism about the future outlook here. If you take a closer look though, we are seeing Micron move higher this morning. That stock up more than 4 and a half% at the open today, up more than nearly two and a half% over the past four days. Also taking a look at some other names here, we do have AMD moving higher up about three and a half% at this open. In addition to that, you know, if you take a step back, we also have other names, ASML holding, we'll get more to that later on the top calls, but Nvidia also seeing that renewed momentum after that major sell off on Friday. That's stuck up about 3%. And so we're hearing more and more rhetoric that based upon the power of these Q3 earnings and what exactly they show, that these are companies that in the long haul will eventually show results and that they have the cash flow and the ability to do this unlike that dotcom bubble.
And Jen, it is interesting because we even heard from Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying that stocks are fairly valued and it drew comparisons to Alan Greenspan's irrational exuberance speech right before the tech boom and bust. How much does that impact sentiment in the markets when you have a fed chair coming out and saying, you know, I I think stocks are valued accurately at this point. Or or overly overly valued.
Honestly, Ally, I don't think all that much, right? Everyone has a view and everyone's going to voice it. But going back to your question at the top of the segment, which is, are we in a bubble or are profits real here? Just to quote Jeff Bezos a couple weeks ago, he said both, and I agree with him. Yes, there's exuberance around all of this and what this technology is going to do, but this is something as Fed officials would also point to, that's going to play out over the next 10, 20 years. We are very much in the early innings right now. And, you know, any chance where you see a macro uh issue like China that causes these tech stocks to sell off could be a buying opportunity. At the same time, you have the Fed in a cutting cycle likely through the end of this year, which creates a tailwin for markets and certainly for those AI stocks. So, I I I think it's, you know, obviously we're going to see the proof in the putting again, we're entering earning season right now, but uh there is still more runway to go here. Um to Lou's point, you know, there are other sectors outside of the the Mag 7, but these are stocks that you should be looking at, I think for the longer term because this is not just through the end of the year. I know we're we're looking at a quarterly basis here, but this is 10, 20 years down the road and Fed officials like Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari believe that we really haven't seen the fruits of AI at this point. So it's really taking that long-term view."

Shares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) jumped 11.9% in the afternoon session after the company announced a significant advancement in quantum chemistry simulations that could accelerate the development of technologies aimed at decarbonization.
In collaboration with a major automotive manufacturer, IonQ demonstrated the ability to accurately compute forces at an atomic level using a specialized quantum algorithm. The results proved more accurate than those from classical computing methods. This breakthrough enabled the calculation of these forces at critical moments when molecular systems undergo significant changes. These calculations can be integrated into existing workflows to better trace chemical reaction pathways, which could help in designing more efficient carbon capture materials. The development broadened IonQ’s quantum chemistry portfolio, with potential uses across the pharmaceutical, battery, and chemical industries.
Is now the time to buy IonQ? Access our full analysis report here.
What Is The Market Telling Us
IonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 106 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for IonQ and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock dropped 2.7% on the news that the company announced the pricing of a substantial $2 billion equity offering.
The offering consisted of 16.5 million shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase approximately 5 million additional shares, each priced at $93. The deal also included seven-year warrants to purchase another 43 million shares at an exercise price of $155 per share. Even though the company noted the funds were for global expansion and commercialization, such a large issuance of new stock can worry investors. Creating a large number of new shares can reduce the value of existing shares, which often leads to a drop in the stock price.
Adding to the weakness, markets pulled back as worries over worsening trade relations with China were triggered by critical comments from President Donald Trump. Trump targeted China's tightening controls on rare earth metals, which are vital components in many technology products from electric vehicles to defense systems. The president's tone and the suggestion of canceling a meeting with President Xi caused a rapid sell-off in the market.
IonQ is up 84.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $79.70 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ’s shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $7,378.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

Shares of power conversion and control solutions provider Vicor Corporation (NASDAQ:VICR) jumped 6.9% in the afternoon session after investor sentiment for the high-performance power solutions sector was boosted by a peer's announcement regarding next-generation AI data center technology.
The positive move was linked to news from Renesas Electronics, a major semiconductor firm, which announced it was supporting the 800 Volt Direct Current power architecture for NVIDIA's AI data centers. As AI workloads increase, data centers require more efficient and scalable power systems. This announcement signaled strong momentum in a key market for Vicor, which specializes in high-density power modules for demanding applications like AI infrastructure. The news underscored the growing need for advanced power solutions to handle the energy demands of modern data centers.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Vicor’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 37 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock dropped 5.2% as the U.S. threatened to impose ""massive increases"" to tariffs on China in response to new export controls from Beijing.
The potential countermeasures follow China's decision to place new restrictions on the export of strategic minerals and related products, including rare earths, which are critical for the defense, semiconductor, and manufacturing industries. This escalation in the economic competition between the two largest global economies is fueling investor anxiety. The new tariff threats raise concerns about disruptions to global supply chains, increased material costs for manufacturers, and a potential drag on an already sluggish economy. Industrial companies are particularly sensitive to these developments as they are often cyclical and heavily reliant on international trade.
Vicor is up 7.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $51.92 per share, it is still trading 19.8% below its 52-week high of $64.71 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Vicor’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $604.85.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Nvidia (NVDA) in late September said it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) as part of a partnership for the ChatGPT maker to use Nvidia’s chips to train and run its next generation of models.
This is just one of a flurry of deals among a tight web of Big Tech players that have been made public in the last few months. There's also Nvidia's $6.3 billion deal with AI data center firm CoreWeave (CRWV), a customer of the chipmaker in which it holds a 7% equity stake. There's Nvidia's reported $2 billion investment linked to its customer xAI (XAAI.PVT). Then there's OpenAI's own deals with Oracle (ORCL), CoreWeave (CRWV), and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). And on Monday, the ChatGPT maker tapped Broadcom (AVGO) to build its first in-house AI processors.
Wall Street analysts say the agreements highlight a growing trend: AI infrastructure providers, led by Nvidia, are investing in their customers, who then turn around and buy more of the infrastructure providers’ products. In other cases, customers of infrastructure like OpenAI are investing in their suppliers.
Analysts interviewed by Yahoo Finance said there are two major concerns with the circular dynamic seen in the recent spree of AI investments. For one, the nature of the transactions could make it seem like there’s greater demand for AI than there really is. It also drives a closer link among the valuations of Big Tech companies — especially given that their respective stocks have soared on news of such deals — and intertwine their fates so that a hit to any one company would be bad news for the entire ecosystem, the experts said.
“The latest developments are very troubling,” said tech analyst and Bokeh Capital Partners chief investment officer Kim Forrest. “Vendors [of AI infrastructure] have gotten a lot of money, so they're just shoving money back into their customers that may be poorly spent.”
Cornell professor Karan Girotra said instances of vendors and customers financially supporting one another reduce the “resilience” of the overall system: “If something goes wrong, then the effect flows through the system rather than [being] isolated.”
Legendary short seller Jim Chanos, famous for predicting the fall of Enron during the dot-com bust, also weighed in, writing in a post on X last week, “[Don’t] you think it’s a bit odd that when the narrative is ‘demand for compute is infinite’, the sellers keep subsidizing the buyers?”"

Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried says his “single biggest mistake” was handing the company over to restructuring officers as part of bankruptcy proceedings.
“The single biggest mistake I made by far was handing the company over,” Bankman-Fried told the magazine Mother Jones in an interview published last week.
Bankman-Fried is appealing his 25-year prison sentence for defrauding FTX investors and customers. The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed in November 2022 after a rush of withdrawals revealed an $8 billion hole in its balance sheet.

A significant portion of the deficit was the result of a concealed credit line to sister trading company Alameda Research, court proceedings later revealed. The so-called “backdoor” provided Alameda with unfettered access to FTX customer funds for speculative bets, without the knowledge or consent of investors and users.
Unable to secure a deal to plug the hole and meet withdrawal demands, Bankman-Fried yielded to pressure from his law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, to hand over the company to bankruptcy expert John J. Ray III on Nov. 11, 2022.
Bankman-Fried told Mother Jones that minutes after signing FTX over, he received a call that sparked hope of a potential investment that could save the company and he tried to revoke his signature. However, it was too late, and Ray immediately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, hiring Sullivan & Cromwell to oversee the process.

Bankman-Fried said that he could have salvaged the situation given the opportunity to be involved in the bankruptcy process. However, Ray refused to engage with Bankman-Fried after taking over, according to a January 2023 court filing.
Bankman-Fried, who maintains that he did not defraud anyone, told Mother Jones that FTX was solvent when he handed it over to Ray, referring to illiquid investments Alameda made with FTX customer funds. The funds were “always sitting there, in the company,” he said.
“We always had more value in assets than we had in liabilities,” he said. “But when you’re talking the billions, you can’t just go sell off everything in a matter of 20 minutes.”
Ray said in a March 2024 letter that Bankman-Fried’s claims that FTX was solvent were “categorically, callously and demonstrably false.”"

SoftBank owns significant stakes in major companies like Nvidia and T-Mobile, and recent reports have suggested that the firm is carving out a strategic growth plan specific to AI.
And that’s likely where ABB comes in.
Most Read on IEN:
In a statement, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son called physical AI his company’s “next frontier,” adding that “together with ABB Robotics, we will unite world-class technology and talent under our shared vision to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence and robotics — driving a groundbreaking evolution that will propel humanity forward.”
Son’s reference to Artificial Super Intelligence – or, ASI – is a theory the company head has espoused in the past. He describes ASI as a type of AI that is 10,000 times smarter than any human genius, and Son believes this technology is about ten years away.
Of course, such lofty ambitions also come with a massive price tag: the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will cost SoftBank roughly $5.4 billion.
This deal marks a strategy shift for ABB as well. The company that had earlier hinted at spinning off its robotics division into a separately listed company. Company chairman Peter Voser said the divestment “will create immediate value to ABB shareholders.”
Voser added, however, that ABB’s overall ambitions are “unchanged” and that the company “will continue to focus on [its] long-term strategy, building on [its] leading positions in electrification and automation.”

Bitcoin's run back toward record highs is forcing a question that would've sounded absurd a few years ago. Should cryptocurrency sit next to stocks and bonds in a retirement portfolio?
With Bitcoin now trading around $122,000, nearly double where it stood a year ago, the answer for many younger Americans is already yes. A NerdWallet survey issued in August found that one in ten U.S. adults with retirement accounts holds crypto.
And among Millennials, the figure jumps to 18%, making digital assets one of the fastest-growing categories inside tax-advantaged accounts.

The shift comes as traditional firms and policymakers open the door wider. Places like IRA Financial now let investors buy crypto directly through IRA accounts, and a recent executive order from President Donald Trump cleared the way for alternative assets like Bitcoin inside workplace retirement plans.
The enthusiasm isn't universal, though. Advisors are split between those who view crypto as speculative and those who see it as a legitimate hedge or growth driver. But the tone is changing.
""You have a lot of tremendously smart investors saying that Bitcoin is the best risk-reward investment right now,"" Joshua Brooks, CFP and founder of Exponential Advisors, told CNBC.
The generational divide helps explain why. Investors in their 20s and 30s, still decades from retirement, are more comfortable allocating a small slice of savings to high-volatility assets that could multiply over time. For them, crypto isn't replacing the 401(k); it's modernizing it.

Investors can use a Self-Directed IRA, Solo 401(k), or IRAfi Crypto account to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies inside a regulated retirement structure.

Oct 13 - U.S. Stock futures jumped as traders welcomed a softer tone from President Donald Trump on U.S.-China trade, lifting premarket sentiment across major indexes.
The Dow futures were up about 1%, the S&P 500 futures climbed about 1%, and Nasdaq futures rose about 2% in early trading as investors pared back fears of an immediate tariff escalation.
Chip names led gains, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 4% surge leading other semiconductor stocks moving higher in premarket trade after traders interpreted the president's comments as an easing of tensions that had rattled technology and supply-chain outlooks.
The shift followed weekend posts on Truth Social in which Mr. Trump softened language about hitting China with steep tariffs and signaled a willingness to avoid a full-blown trade clash, remarks that helped calm markets after a sharp sell-off on Friday.
Analysts said the reaction reflects how sensitive equities remain to U.S.-China rhetoric; even tentative signs of de-escalation can prompt quick rebounds in futures and cyclical sectors."

OpenAI just announced a monster deal with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), making it seem as if AMD could be catching up to the king of AI investing to date. However, I don't think that's a valid argument, as AMD cut OpenAI an incredible deal that Nvidia likely wasn't willing to make.
Nvidia is still the largest provider of artificial intelligence computing hardware by far, and I think we'll get some news on Oct. 16 regarding the strength of the demand for AI computing hardware. That's when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.96%) reports its quarterly earnings, and it will give investors a hint as to the strength of the demand for chips.
This could cause all AI hardware-related stocks to respond positively if TSMC reports great results, making Nvidia an intriguing stock to buy before Oct. 16.
Strong AI demand can power Nvidia's stock higher over the next few years
One thing investors must keep in mind is that Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer and is also the chipmaker for both Nvidia and AMD. So, just because TSMC reports strong numbers, it doesn't necessarily mean that Nvidia is still doing well. However, with Nvidia being a much larger customer than AMD, I think it will be safe to say that if TSMC is doing well, Nvidia is too.
We won't know for sure how Nvidia's third quarter went until sometime in November, but there are still signs of Nvidia's dominance everywhere. Many of the cloud computing companies are racing to build out data center capacity to meet the demands of their customers.
Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class at high-powered general-purpose computing, and continue to be a top choice for many AI developers. Rising competition from custom AI accelerator chips from Broadcom could challenge Nvidia's leadership in the future, but for now, Nvidia is still the most prevalent computing hardware being used.
Regardless of which computing chip is favored by the AI hyperscalers at the time, AI capital expenditures are expected to increase dramatically over the next few years. This year, Nvidia expects total AI data center capital expenditures to reach $600 billion. That figure is expected to rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.
That's massive spending expansion, and will benefit all companies in the AI industry. With Nvidia being the largest market share leader by far, it will benefit the most, making the stock an intriguing buy right now.
Nvidia's stock isn't as expensive as that of its competitors
Both Broadcom and AMD's stock have popped on news of chip deals with OpenAI; however, this pop has caused them to get far more expensive than Nvidia. When various forward price-to-earnings (P/E) metrics are examined, Nvidia still trades at a discount to its peers despite much better results.
Both AMD and Broadcom have increased on news of a handful of sales; meanwhile, Nvidia is generating far more revenue each quarter than each of these announcements. Broadcom's deal with OpenAI had a value of $10 billion. AMD's deal has the potential to be worth up to 10% of the value of the company, or about $34 billion. During Nvidia's fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 27), its data center division alone generated $41.1 billion.
This shows that Nvidia is far larger than both of these long-term deals, and investors have no reason to panic. In fact, with massive AI demand on the horizon and Nvidia's discount to its peers, it could be considered an excellent long-term investment right now.
Strong language from TSMC on Oct. 16 about the long-term robustness of chip demand could be all Nvidia needs to see its stock soar, and I think scooping up shares before this event would be a wise move by investors."

He Just Made a Move That Could Be a Warning for Investors.",Buffett has beaten the market over time.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=474877cfe7d99426e5d309156bf24741d84ba1bd3ac5408520cbc4fa7d4aa357,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/as-indexes-soar-does-warren-buffett-know-something/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/as-indexes-soar-does-warren-buffett-know-something/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/as-indexes-soar-does-warren-buffett-know-something/,fool.com,200,,"Though indexes slid on Friday, the direction in recent times has been clear. The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq have been soaring on optimism companies can handle President Donald Trump's tariff plan -- and continue to deliver growth. On top of this, investors have piled into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks amid hopes that these companies will see revenue explode higher as the AI infrastructure buildout scales up. AI behemoth Nvidia has predicted AI infrastructure spending may reach $4 trillion by the end of the decade -- if that happens, many companies and investors could win big.
In fact, momentum has been so strong that the S&P 500 has reached several new records in recent months and is heading for its third consecutive annual gain. Against this bright backdrop, you may be wondering about the latest moves of expert investor Warren Buffett. The billionaire, at the head of Berkshire Hathaway, has delivered a market-beating annual return for shareholders over nearly 60 years, so he's proven his ability to invest through all investment environments -- from bull markets to bear markets and even market crashes.
Now, as indexes soar, Buffett has made a move that could be a warning for investors -- does the Oracle of Omaha, as he's often called, know something Wall Street doesn't? Let's find out.
Buffett's investment strategy
So, first, a quick note on how Buffett goes about investing. He has built an empire as chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway -- but this isn't due to selecting stocks that take off overnight. Buffett hasn't broadly invested in areas like technology that have seen some stocks soar in the triple- and quadruple-digits in a year or two. Instead, the investor favors industries he knows well and feels comfortable with, and he holds a diversified bunch of stocks in areas including financials, consumer goods, and energy.
Buffett scoops up these players when he feels they're undervalued and have what it takes to gain the recognition of the rest of the market over time -- then he holds on and generally wins as these companies steadily grow earnings and their businesses. He also is a big fan of dividends and has benefited from owning Dividend Kings like Coca-Cola for decades and collecting passive income.
Finally, Buffett doesn't follow market trends and instead sticks to his investment principles throughout market environments. And this leads me to the move Buffett made recently. The billionaire, in the second quarter of this year, was a net seller of stocks for the 11th consecutive quarter -- this means the value of stocks he sold surpasses the value of those he purchased. And this has helped Berkshire Hathaway build a cash position touching record levels this year and settling at $344 billion at the end of the recent quarter.

Here's what Buffett knows
Now, let's consider our question: Does Buffett, showing this sort of caution while others pile into stocks, know something Wall Street doesn't? The investing giant may simply be paying more attention to one key factor, and that's valuation. Though some stocks offer great buying opportunities -- and Buffett has found these and made purchases in recent months, for example, opening a position in UnitedHealth Group and increasing his holding of Pool Corp. -- the overall market is looking pricey. And Buffett, a famous value investor, refuses to buy a stock at just any price.
So, the billionaire likely is focusing on the S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio, a metric that shows earnings per share in relation to price over a 10-year period -- and he probably doesn't like what he sees. The metric this year reached a level that it's only seen two other times in the past, signaling the overall market is pricey.
S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio data by YCharts
During times like these, it's not surprising that Buffett isn't deploying boatloads of cash and instead chooses to lock in profits on some stocks and invest cautiously.
What does this mean for you as an investor? This doesn't suggest you should unload your stocks and stop investing. Instead, it means that, like Buffett, you should look for opportunities -- as they exist in every market phase -- and at the same time, set aside some cash that you might deploy in the future too. After all, certain players that look expensive today may trade for more reasonable prices at some point down the road -- and, like Buffett, you'll want to be ready to seize the opportunity, hold on, and score a win over the long run."

Well, let's get more on how the president has moved markets across the globe with our guest Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Russ, great to have you here on Market Sunrise.
Thank you.
Thank you Ramsey.
What do you make of all the social media statements from the president? How do investors navigate all of this?
They're probably better off trying not to bother, but I I guess they probably can't help themselves given that we've again had a situation where there was one fairly strong statement made one day and a slightly less strong statement made the next day with a result, one big wobble, one big rally. And I think net net, markets are still hoping, longing for, anticipating that President Xi and President Trump meet in Asia towards the end of this month, possibly at the annual economic summit that's due in Korea this year.
But this taco trade that was coined earlier this year, Trump always chickens out.
Is he is he this time as well?
I was trying not to use that word. Um that seems to be the perception that there was, you know, a strong statement, a market sell off, a backtrack, a market rally. It's a pretty similar pattern to what we saw back in spring, yes.
Now, one of the uh sectors that was bit most affected by Friday's sell-off was tech and in particular any stock related to AI. Um, what does this tell us about this AI bubble that people are seem to be speculating more and more about?
Well, I think even more widely than that, we we've seen, you know, a big there was a big routing in a lot of second tier cryptocurrencies last Friday and then a rally in some of the bigger names. You've seen a lot of, you know, consternation and worry on social media about heavy losses, is the market turning. and in the end we had a you know, a one a one down day, a 2% fall in equities and you've seen an awful lot of worries. so it does make you wonder about just exactly who's got how much margin in their account, who's levered up where, because it does not just magnify profits, it does magnify losses when things go wrong. So it does make you worry a little bit about the wider market architecture. You know, Richard Buxstable's book Demons of our own design always talks about leverage, opacity and complexity as the prerequisites for any major correction. Well, you can argue they're all in position right now, not just in in AI but perhaps more widely, looking at how much margin account activity you can see on the on the Finredata, it just crossed a record level of of a trillion US dollars.
All prices are also on the rise today as Trump is in the Middle East as Israel and Hamas look set to sign a peace deal in Egypt today. Is this a but is the rise more down to what's going on between the US and China rather than what's going on in the Middle East?
I mean again, oil took a massive thumping at the end of last week because of fears of what, you know, possibly increased tensions between the US and China where that could go and what could that that could do to global economic growth. So again, it's probably a bit of a sort of automatic reaction to to soothing more calming noises. Overall, you know, the turn on oil still seems relatively bearish with a price down on on Brent in the low 60s and WTI in the high 50s. You know, OPEC's gradually sneaking demand up, the IEA is gradually sneaking its demand forecast down. I guess you can say one thing is that a lower oil prices A, something that President Trump wants to see. B is potentially quite helpful for consumers and corporations and it puts a bit of a lid on inflation. So it's probably not the worst thing in the world.
And I mentioned it's a busy week for earnings. We've got all the big US banks on deck. Uh what are you expected to hear from them all?
I think on the on the face of it that the numbers should be pretty benign. Again, if you you've seen an improvement in loan and in deposit growth. You've seen net interest margins come in relatively stable at at decent levels and loan impairments have been relatively subdued. So I think they're the trends that analysts and show will be looking for. If there is anything any upset there, it's likely to be in learning payments just because what we've been seeing at first brands, tri-color and others. JP Morgan Chase just one name banded around with regard to possible tri-color losses. be intriguing to see if that does start to come through on the impairment line."

It's time now for today's trending tickers. Global trade tensions are sending shock waves across the markets this morning, and it's not all about Trump. The Netherlands took an unprecedented step against a Chinese company to defend its national security.
Chinese chip manufacturer Wingtech, which owns Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, plunged more than 10% in Shanghai after the Dutch government took control of its local unit. It's a sign that Europe is joining Washington in tightening its grip on strategic technology. The move also sent a chill across semiconductor names globally, reminding investors that geopolitics now moves the needle in the tech trade.
Now, Tesla isn't the only EV company that's struggling with handle design. China's Xiaomi, which has staged an impressive rally this year, saw shares fall sharply in Asia trading after a tragic fatal crash. The driver of a Xiaomi SU7 electric sedan was locked inside the vehicle and bystanders weren't able to rescue him.
The company didn't immediately comment. Moving on now, two big gainers you need to know about. Big Bear.ai is climbing after confirming a new US Navy contract to expand the use of its artificial intelligence tools for fleet data analytics and mission planning. Applied Digital continues to attract attention for its data center build outs, powering AI infrastructure for clients like CoreWeave. What stands out about Applied Digital is its resilience even in a tough cycle.

The chief executives of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple and OpenAI treated the US President to a show of fealty worthy of a royal entourage.
The highlight of the trip, on the 18th September, saw Trump and UK Prime Minister Starmer announce the UK US Tech Prosperity Deal, an historic accord for deeper cooperation between the two countries’ technology innovation efforts and a much-needed boost for a UK Labour government failing to deliver on its promise of economic growth.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
The deal aims to give the UK’s tech ecosystem access to US datasets, infrastructure and compute power, as well as collaborative R&D and shared research funding opportunities on quantum, nuclear and AI. It also signals greater collaboration on regulation, national security and the skills needed to advance the UK’s technology sector, according to the official memorandum of understanding.
The deal was accompanied by a raft of US Big Tech investment announcements in the UK’s AI infrastructure. These included a $30bn investment by Microsoft which includes includes building the country’s largest supercomputer in partnership with British company Nscale, a $5bn investment by Google including the opening of a data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, a $1.5bn investment by US datacentre company CoreWeave in Scotland and the establishment of Stargate UK in a collaboration between Nscale, OpenAI and US chipmaker Nvidia.
While policy makers and tech titans alike touted the deal’s mutual benefits there was some scepticism that the US may have more to gain the UK’s cheap land and labour – some even likening the agreement to a Western multinational exploiting developing world resources (with the view that the UK has been much relegated by its economic misfortunes to low value investment location).
Most of the investment focuses on data centre buildouts, with the majority of jobs created during the construction and build out phase as data centre management is not job intensive. The huge infrastructure investment also raises the question of UK energy and water supply being diverted away from local populations in order to facilitate such levels of compute power.

By GlobalDataBut above all, these private investments by private companies with global market dominance raise questions around data sovereignty, geopolitical tensions and UK tech increasing becoming a satellite arm of the US rather than a sovereign tech power in its own right.
Across the channel European Union law makers have made a concerted effort to distance their own business ecosystems from the auspices of US Big Tech companies. France and Norway are developing their own sovereign clouds and are involving local partners in the endeavour.
Indeed, some of the Tech Prosperity Deal’s raft of US digital infrastructure investment did include a local partner Nscale, a company seemly sprung from nowhere in 2024. Little is known about this relatively recent newcomer. Nscale chief commercial officer, Karl Havard, has publicly stated that the company is the the UK’s only full-stack, sovereign AI infrastructure provider, telling Capacity in July 2025 that: “This reflects our belief that control over local AI infrastructure and compute is essential to national resilience, economic growth, and global competitiveness.”
Digital sovereignty becomes a business priority
Sovereignty has become an increasingly important issue within the digital economy evinced by the then Conservative UK government’s decision to classify data centres as critical national infrastructure in September 2024. However, economic imperatives mean that the UK government welcomes foreign direct investment in UK digital infrastructure. But are UK businesses concerned whether their data is being stored, processed and managed over US run infrastructure?
Claudio Corbetta, CEO of team.blue says it “absolutely makes a difference” for SMEs. The company’s own research found that nearly three-quarters (73%) of SMEs across the UK and Ireland are concerned about their data being stored in the US. This is also happening in Europe, with 72% of SMEs worried about their data being stored in the US. This anxiety is tied to frameworks like the US Cloud Act and continuing debates over the adequacy of the EU–US and UK–US data transfer arrangements, explains Corbetta. The US Cloud Act gives US law enforcement the power to demand electronic data stored overseas by US companies.
“The sovereignty question for SMEs goes beyond infrastructure capacity. It is about whether they trust that the data falls under either EU and/or UK jurisdiction, or not. What we’re hearing from customers across Europe is that this distinction has direct implications on their ability to adhere to regulations, as well as maintaining and building on consumer trust,” says Corbetta.
Corbetta says that SMEs increasingly see confidence in data sovereignty as a business differentiator, as it’s shaping procurement decisions and customer relationships. “If we take a step back and look at the wider European context, while Big Tech plays a huge role in AI and cloud infrastructure, we’re seeing a shift that provides opportunities for European tech companies. Europe-based providers can compete on capability while offering the certainty that data remains protected under local laws. For many SMEs, that combination of sovereignty and trust is now just as important as performance or price,” says Corbetta.
“From what we’re hearing, company directors and customers are increasingly raising questions about data location, and that pressure is shaping real business decisions.
“For tech leaders, the takeaway is that digital sovereignty is not just a compliance topic, it’s a strategic one. Providers that can combine transparency, guidance, and local hosting solutions are increasingly seen as true partners. Sovereignty isn’t an add-on, but the foundation for sustainable digital growth,” he adds.
UK opportunity for sovereign AI infrastructure
Many British business leaders like Mahdi Yahya, founder and CEO at UK AI specialist data centre provider Ori, sees a clear opportunity arising from the fact that digital sovereignty is increasingly becoming a boardroom priority for UK businesses.
The infrastructure funding announcements in the UK [US UK Prosperity Deal] mark an exciting time for the space, says Yahya, though it’s still a niche market to some extent. And the market potential for a largely UK owned and run AI infrastructure does exist. While the incumbent Big Tech cloud providers dominate, the price point, the fact that Ori’s infrastructure is built ground up specifically for AI and the data sovereignty proposition of using a UK company is what has allowed the company and other players in the space to build successful UK businesses on the back of this demand for specialist AI infrastructure.
Yahya doesn’t see the demand opportunity decreasing any time soon. “The big buying factor for a lot of enterprises, especially in Europe and Middle East, is around the sovereignty of infrastructure,” he says.
“AI will have access to and will be interacting with all the data that you have. And so, whether you’re a government entity, or an enterprise in a regulated sector, or operating in compliance heavy sector, it becomes extremely important to know where the infrastructure is and what control there is over the infrastructure.
“And many governments in Europe, specifically, and enterprises in Europe now have mandates that they need to be working with cloud providers that are local or sovereign for this precise reasons,” adds Yahya.
How would a smaller UK industry compete with big US cloud players on AI infrastructure? “It’s impossible for them to overcome the sovereignty issue, because obviously they’re US controlled,” he says.
“Some customers we talk to are adamant that they don’t want to be working with a provider that is subject to the US cloud act, for example, and the US cloud players are still subject to that. So that removes that portion of the market for them,” he explains.
And then the other big differentiator, or opportunity, is around performance specialisation of a company like Ori that was built from the ground up with AI in mind. “Like any industry, you have incumbents, and then a new technology that comes to light, and along with that come new players with a more differentiated offering, with a more performant offering, a more cost-effective offering, and that’s where we are at the moment,” he says.
Build British Big Tech
British veteran entrepreneur and CEO of AI research engine Corpora.ai, Mel Morris, sees the UK’s massive investment focus on AI infrastructure as “a wakeup call in terms of what we spend our money on”.
In Morris’s view, UK investment patterns are simply following prevailing trends and lack innovative foresight. “The money is following the fashion. The fashion says, get Jensen Huang over here, let’s put $5bn to get some GPUs in place and build a big data centre. Meanwhile, we’re seeing small entrepreneurial startups, with game changing technology that potentially could double the gross domestic product of this country, struggling to get heard and to get financed.”
Morris’s call to action is to reframe the UK’s focus on AI infrastructure to encompass a wider, more innovation first approach.
“Forget the amount of GPUs. In three years they’ll be worth nothing, because you’ll need them to be ten times faster and a tenth of the price. Let’s focus on what are small amounts of money, relatively speaking, that we could spend to build sovereignty, to build the technologies that allow us to compete, because at the moment, we’re [the UK] a net importer of AI tech, and I think that’s a dangerous place to be.”"

TAIPEI, Taiwan, Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TrendForce’s latest investigations reveal that the rapid expansion of AI server demand is propelling global cloud service providers (CSPs), such as Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu, to boost investments in NVIDIA’s rack-scale GPU solutions, data center expansion, and in-house AI ASIC design. Total CapEx from the eight major CSPs is expected to surpass US$420 billion in 2025, roughly equivalent to their combined spending in 2023 and 2024, marking a 61% YoY increase.
TrendForce predicts that as rack-scale solutions like GB/VR systems grow in 2026, the total CapEx of the eight CSPs will hit a new peak, surpassing US$520 billion with a 24% year-over-year rise. Additionally, investment priorities are moving from revenue-generating assets to short-lived infrastructure such as servers and GPUs, indicating a strategic emphasis on boosting long-term competitiveness and market share rather than immediate profits.
In 2025, NVIDIA’s GB200/GB300 rack systems are poised to become the main deployment targets for CSPs, driven by higher-than-anticipated demand growth. Besides North America’s leading four CSPs and Oracle, emerging customers such as Tesla/xAI, CoreWeave, and Nebius are increasing their purchases for AI cloud leasing and generative AI workloads. By 2026, CSPs are likely to shift from GB300 racks to the new NVIDIA Rubin VR200 rack platform in the latter half of the year.
Custom AI chip production continues to scale up
North America’s leading four CSPs are increasing their investments in AI ASICs to improve autonomy and manage costs for large-scale AI and LLM tasks. Google is partnering with Broadcom on the TPU v7p (Ironwood), an optimized platform for training, set to expand in 2026 and succeed the TPU v6e (Trilium). TrendForce predicts Google’s TPU shipments will stay the highest among CSPs, with over 40% annual growth in 2026.
AWS is prioritizing its Trainium v2 chips, with a liquid-cooled rack version expected by late 2025. The Trainium v3, developed jointly with Alchip and Marvell, is planned for mass production in early 2026. AWS’s ASIC shipments are anticipated to more than double in 2025, marking the fastest growth among major CSPs, with a further approximate 20% increase in 2026.
Meta is enhancing its partnership with Broadcom, with MTIA v2 set for mass production in Q4 2025 to boost inference efficiency and lower latency. In 2025, shipments will mainly back Meta’s internal AI platforms and recommendation systems, while MTIA v3, which includes HBM integration, will launch in 2026, doubling total shipment volume."

DUBAI (Reuters) -AI chip startup Cerebras Systems aims to deploy its infrastructure to the United Arab Emirates to support the Gulf state's rapidly growing AI sector, as well as markets in India and Pakistan, CEO Andrew Feldman told Reuters on Monday.
""I'm very confident that there will be big clusters here of our gear,"" including ""megawatts worth of equipment"" for the Stargate project, Feldman, referring to the first phase of the world's largest planned set of AI data centres outside the United States.
California-based Cerebras makes high-performance AI chips and systems designed to speed up the training and deployment of large AI models, competing with industry leader Nvidia NVDA.O in the rapidly expanding AI chip market.
Among its largest clients is Abu Dhabi-backed cloud and AI firm G42, which signed a deal in 2023 to acquire supercomputers from the startup.
G42's past ties to China have attracted scrutiny in Washington, due to concerns around Beijing's access to advanced semiconductors including via third parties such as the UAE, which has been spending billions of dollars on its AI push, looking to leverage its strong relations with the U.S. to secure access to the technology.
Technology giants, including Nvidia and OpenAI, are working with G42 to build Stargate UAE, the first phase of an AI campus project announced in May under a multi-billion dollar deal which however has not been finalised amid security concerns due to the UAE's close ties to China, Reuters has previously reported, citing sources.
Cerebras-built computers for G42 have so far remained in the U.S., with Middle East deals requiring export licences from the Trump administration.
Cerebras this month filed to withdraw its plans for a U.S. listing, after raising $1.1 billion in a funding round that valued the company at $8.1 billion.
New investors include 1789 Capital, a fund in which Donald Trump Jr is a partner.
Feldman said the company will use the proceeds to scale up manufacturing and finance the new data centres, aiming to grow to as many as 12 or 15 sites from six over the next months.
Cerebras still intends to go public, Feldman said, adding it has an ""intention to refile it as quickly as we can"", without providing a timeline.

That's because these technology players have been two of the first to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution -- Nvidia by selling the world's top AI chips to drive AI development, and Palantir by selling software that's allowing customers to immediately apply AI to their operations.
This has resulted in double-digit revenue growth at these companies in recent times and solid profitability. Investors have piled into the stocks, too, driving enormous returns. So you might be wondering how much you would have gained if you'd gotten into these stocks earlier in the AI boom. Let's find out.
Nvidia's AI dominance
Before diving in, though, let's take a quick look at both of these AI winners. As mentioned, Nvidia dominates in the AI chip market. The company designs graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips needed to power the most critical of AI tasks, and customers from start-ups to top tech players have flocked to Nvidia's products. And speaking of products, Nvidia hasn't stopped with chips. It's built out an entire ecosystem of AI tools and services to make itself the one-stop shop for all customers as they travel along the AI road.
As a result, Nvidia's revenue has soared, reaching a record of more than $130 billion last year, and importantly, the company is highly profitable on sales with gross margin generally above 70%. So it's no surprise investors have favored this stock.
The Palantir story is also a bright one. The software company specializes in platforms that help customers aggregate and analyze their data -- so they can use it to optimize their operations. And two years ago, Palantir launched an AI system called Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) that brings the power of AI into the process.
Palantir's explosive growth
Palantir's government and commercial customers have jumped to get in on AIP, and revenue for both businesses has been climbing in the double-digits quarter after quarter. What's particularly positive is the commercial growth as this wasn't a huge business for Palantir several years ago -- so, thanks to the focus on AI, Palantir has brought in more and more commercial customers and supercharged its revenue potential.
Now, let's consider your returns if you had invested $10,000 in each of these companies five years ago. Your Nvidia investment, after a 1,200% gain in the stock, would be worth more than $137,000 today, and your Palantir investment, after a 1,700% increase in the shares, would total $183,560 right now. That adds up to about $320,560.
Is it too late to buy Nvidia and Palantir today?
So you clearly would have won big by getting in on these AI players five years ago. Now the question is: Could you still set yourself up for investing success by buying these stocks today, or is it too late?
The price levels and market values of Nvidia and Palantir were much lower five years ago than they are today, making it easier for the stocks to advance in the quadruple digits.
It would be nearly impossible for Nvidia stock to post such an increase in the coming five years -- a 1,000% stock price increase would bring it to a $50 trillion market value. Such an increase in Palantir would bring it to a $4.5 trillion market cap, which may not happen in such a short time.
But this doesn't mean it's too late to invest in these two AI giants. Even if they aren't likely to replicate their performances of the past five years they still could increase significantly -- we're in the early days of this AI boom, and demand is high for Nvidia's and Palantir's offerings. All of this means that if you buy and hold these top players, you still could score an impressive win over time."

Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) was the talk of the town last month after its shares shot up by a whopping 36% after it announced a $455 billion cloud order backlog. He discussed reports suggesting that the firm was losing money from using NVIDIA’s response and outlined NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang’s take on the matter:
“[on reports of Oracle losing money from using NVIDIA’s chips and Jensen Huang’s response] Wonderfully profitable. I know, I have to believe that the Oracle people were thrilled that there is an actual explanation about how you buy these things and there is no immediate payoff. Look, when you’re building a hotel it’s true, there’s no payoff until about year five and I just feel like what he’s saying is, when you build these things, it’s, you’re not going to make money instantly. It would be great if you could. But The Information story could be right at the beginning, but at the beginning you’re trying to get a tradeoff like a Boeing plane. I would have used a Boeing plane as an analogy. Because when you first get a Boeing plane, holy cow, you’re losing money. It’s only in the later years that you start amortizing. Year four to year 23, the Boeing plane makes a huge amount of money. Maybe even year 30, because the planes are so good. But we don’t understand this new world yet. So you could have a scoop, that will look like not a foolish scoop, not a scoop at all, in a few years from now. But in the moment, it’s a gotcha. And the gotcha is basically, what is that organization saying? Well that organization is trying to break news as they have the whole way. That NVIDIA is overvalued. That if you’re short NVIDIA, you’d read that and you’d certainly would double down on your short. But you’d be doubling down at 20, at 50, at 80, at a 120 and then you’re done. You’re basically at the card table saying, I’m gonna get a ten and I’m gonna get a Jack and you run out money getting two fives, over and over again. And you split them.”

U.S. stocks skidded on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened to crank tariffs higher on China, signaling more trouble ahead between the two biggest economies.  China reported its global exports rose 8.3% in September from a year earlier, the strongest growth in six months and further evidence that its manufacturers are shifting sales from the U.S. to other markets.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=85fd468f1fa7aefbad4ffcde26fbdc93e78e8bd0f71626ad7768fc12122d4cd3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-skid-wall-street-043707731.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-skid-wall-street-043707731.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-shares-skid-wall-street-043707731.html,yahoo.com,200,,"NEW YORK (AP) — And back up goes Wall Street. U.S. stocks rallied Monday after President Donald Trump said ” it will all be fine,” just days after he sent the market reeling by threatening much higher tariffs on China.
The S&P 500 jumped 1.6% in its best day since May and recovered just over half its drop from Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 587 points, or 1.3%, and the Nasdaq composite leaped 2.2%.
“Don’t worry about China,” Trump said on his social media platform Sunday. He also said that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, “doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”
It was a sharp turnaround from the anger Trump displayed on Friday, when the S&P 500 tumbled to its worst drop since April after he accused China of “ a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.”
Trump pointed to “an extremely hostile letter” from China describing curbs to exports of rare earths, which are materials used in the manufacturing of everything from personal electronics to jet engines. Trump said at the time that he may place an additional 100% tax on imports from China starting on Nov. 1.
For its part, China urged the United States to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats. “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online.
Hours later, Trump posted his less confrontational talk about China on Truth Social. The backtrack in anger, which also came before trading began on Wall Street, raised hopes that the world’s two largest economies could find a way to allow global trade to continue smoothly.
The down-and-up moves for the market echoed its manic swings during April. That’s when Trump shocked investors with his “Liberation Day” announcement of worldwide tariffs, only to eventually relent on many to give time to negotiate trade deals with other countries.
If this time ends up similarly, potentially even after a sharp drop for stock prices, subsiding trade tensions and uncertainty could allow for a rolling recovery to continue into 2026, according to Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson.
To be sure, the U.S. stock market may have been primed for a drop. It was already facing criticism that prices had shot too high following a torrid 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April. The index, which dictates the movements for many 401(k) accounts, is still near its all-time high set last week.
Not only did Trump’s backdown from tariffs help stocks soar since April, so did expectations for several cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to help the economy."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-13T04:05:00,3 Quantum Computing Stocks That Could Help Make You a Fortune,Quantum computing is starting to become increasingly viable.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=583982613250005693370f8b94e7ef5d6a37da3b9eddaf2cb5f69c86f230fa7a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/3-quantum-computing-stocks-that-could-help-make-yo/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/3-quantum-computing-stocks-that-could-help-make-yo/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/13/3-quantum-computing-stocks-that-could-help-make-yo/,fool.com,200,,"Although the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race is still ongoing and heating up, there's another important computing trend that's on the horizon: quantum computing. Quantum computing may not completely replace traditional computing, but it can aid in increasing the speed and efficiency of the computing infrastructure that we currently have.
There are multiple ways to invest in this trend, but two of my favorite pure plays are IonQ (IONQ -5.85%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 4.13%). I think Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is a worthy addition to this group, as it still has a long way to run from AI spending and will also help bridge the gap between quantum computing and traditional computing.
IonQ and D-Wave Quantum
IonQ and D-Wave are two quantum computing start-ups that are incredibly risky. For both companies, quantum computing is the only business they're pursuing, so if they don't develop a viable quantum computing option, then their stocks will likely go to zero. On the flip side, if their quantum computing solutions become popular and they sell a ton of quantum computing units, then their stocks could skyrocket and make investors a fortune.
These two are taking two separate approaches to the quantum computing realm. IonQ is using a trapped-ion approach, which has advantages over the more traditional superconducting technique. Trapped-ion quantum computing can be done at room temperature and offers a significant accuracy boost. Computing accuracy is the primary problem with quantum computing right now, and solving this issue will ensure that IonQ's products are commercially viable. The trapped-ion approach comes at the cost of processing speed, but I think the advantage that IonQ has in accuracy will be enough to propel it to become a market leader.
D-Wave is taking an even more different approach. Instead of building an all-purpose quantum computing unit, its technology focuses on quantum annealing. This is perfect for optimization problems (think an AI model or a logistics network). This represents a large chunk of the expected quantum computing market, so building a solution that's optimized for these types of problems could be a genius move by D-Wave.
We're still a ways out from seeing viable quantum computing options commercially available, and many companies point toward 2030 as the year this will occur. Time will tell which company wins the quantum computing arms race (it may not be IonQ or D-Wave), but the winner will surely see a massive boom in its stock price and make investors mini fortunes.
Nvidia
Nvidia is the current king of AI computing hardware thanks to its impressive graphics processing units (GPUs). However, once quantum computing arrives, its GPUs will no longer be the most powerful general-purpose computing units in town. In order to prevent itself from getting disrupted, Nvidia has developed software that allows quantum computing units to be integrated into existing accelerated computing infrastructure. Nvidia's CUDA software allowed it to jump to an early lead in the AI arms race, and its CUDA-Q software will likely do the same once quantum computing is commercially available.
Additionally, the AI arms race is far from over. Nvidia expects data center capital expenditures to reach about $600 billion this year, rising to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's massive growth in the computing space, and with Nvidia's hardware being the most popular option, it's set to cash in.
By investing in Nvidia, you're capturing the upside of all of the massive AI deals that have been announced recently while also investing in the future with quantum computing deployment. This makes Nvidia an excellent stock to bridge the gap between these two monstrous trends, and it can make investors a fortune along the way."

Today, the term refers to the group of innovative companies that have driven stock market gains in recent years. They are technology names you probably know well, from Nvidia to Meta Platforms, and they're all involved in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI). These players have helped the S&P 500 climb in the double-digits this year, too, and even reach record levels.
But the Magnificent Seven aren't the only game in town, and two other stocks in particular may give them a run for their money over the next five years, as AI infrastructure spending soars and customers seek capacity for their AI workloads. Right now, these two AI stocks are charging forward and already have outperformed the Magnificent Seven so far this year -- but this movement may not be over. Let's check out the two players that may crush the Magnificent Seven in the years to come.
1. CoreWeave
CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) has climbed more than 250% since its market launch earlier this year, but that doesn't mean it's used up all of its fuel. The company may just be getting started, and that's because it offers up a service in high demand today -- and into the future. I'm talking about AI infrastructure capacity.
CoreWeave, thanks to its 250,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), has a lot of computing power to offer -- and customers can easily rent it as needed, even on an hourly basis. This means they don't have to invest in purchasing costly GPUs but still can access the power they need for the training and inferencing of their models, for example.
To make the picture even sweeter, Nvidia plays a key role in the CoreWeave story. The chip giant holds a 7% stake in the company and recently pledged to buy any unused capacity through 2032 -- this removes a great deal of risk from CoreWeave stock.
Finally, CoreWeave's revenue has been exploding higher, growing more than 400% in the first quarter from the year-earlier period -- and more than tripling in the latest quarter year over year. Considering the great need for AI capacity to power the training of AI and its application in the real world, the company should continue to see strong demand -- and this may send the stock to greater gains than those of the Magnificent Seven.
2. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) stock has advanced nearly 50% so far this year, but this company, too, could keep marching higher in the coming years as cloud service providers focus on scaling up AI infrastructure. The company is a networking giant, known for thousands of products found in a variety of places -- from smartphones to data centers.
But this data center business has driven growth as the AI boom picked up momentum. Customers are turning to Broadcom for networking solutions, needed to connect the many compute nodes that power AI workloads across data centers. Broadcom is an expert here and has seen its Tomahawk switches and Jericho routers fly off the shelves.
The company also represents a future winner in the area of computing power as it designs AI accelerators, known as XPUs -- but doesn't necessarily compete with chip giant Nvidia. The XPU is a custom accelerator, made for specific purposes while Nvidia's chips are high-powered for general use. This makes it easier for Broadcom to carve out market share, serving a customer's specific needs and offering a product that may be complementary to Nvidia's. In the recent quarter, Broadcom announced a $10 billion order for XPUs -- and analysts say the customer is top AI lab OpenAI.
The AI business has resulted in significant revenue gains in recent quarters -- for example, in the latest one, Broadcom reported AI revenue growth of 63% to $5.2 billion. And this trend could continue if Nvidia chief Jensen Huang is right: He expects AI infrastructure spending to climb to $3 trillion or $4 trillion by the end of the decade, and Broadcom clearly could benefit from this stage of the AI boom. And that suggests this stock may crush the Magnificent Seven players as this AI infrastructure story unfolds."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-13T01:00:00,Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Market Cap 5 Years From Now,The leading chipmaker has a wide range of outcomes available to it in the years to come.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d26080c30f734bd589cfa8d55e8d358ab5ef218952134efa2dd637d3c6d17c6f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/prediction-this-will-be-nvidias-market-cap-5-years/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/prediction-this-will-be-nvidias-market-cap-5-years/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/prediction-this-will-be-nvidias-market-cap-5-years/,fool.com,200,,"The world is Nvidia's (NVDA -0.17%) oyster. As the spending boom on artificial intelligence (AI) data centers gets kicked into overdrive, the largest company in the world by market capitalization keeps moving higher and higher, with the stock at a price of $188 as of this writing on Oct. 8. Nvidia has a dominant market share for AI computer chips and is signing lucrative deals with companies such as OpenAI that will drive even more growth in the years ahead.
But at a market cap of over $4.5 trillion and an expensive looking price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), some investors are rightfully nervous that the best returns are in the past. Is that true? Let's dig into the numbers and try to estimate where the company's market cap will be five years from now.
An OpenAI partnership for data center spending
The most important player in AI today could be OpenAI, a disruptor aiming to dethrone the likes of Alphabet's Google and even other technology giants. It recently achieved a valuation of $500 billion.
On the back of this announcement, the company has opened the floodgates for funding to expand its computing capacity (which is important for powering its AI software). The largest of these deals is with Nvidia. Over the next few years, Nvidia has committed to investing $100 billion into OpenAI, which it will use to buy Nvidia computer chips to build out advanced data centers. As a part of this deal, beginning in 2026, OpenAI will use Nvidia's new Rubin chips, which are built to process advanced AI video capabilities better than present computer chips.
Partnering with OpenAI is almost a can't-lose scenario for Nvidia. You might think it is taking a risk by investing $100 billion into OpenAI, but that will directly lead to more purchases of the company's computer chips while simultaneously giving it an ownership stake in the fast-growing AI company. The companies plan to build 10 gigawatts of computing capacity, which will be around 20% of the existing data center footprint in all of the United States. In other words, it is a gargantuan planned expansion for OpenAI that directly points to new sales for Nvidia chips.
Competition from customers
While the deal with OpenAI should be a slam dunk for Nvidia, it is facing a growing threat from some of its other customers building their own computer chips for AI data centers. The largest players in the industry, such as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms -- all huge spenders on Nvidia chips -- are creating their own custom-built hardware. If they can scale up these computer chips, that could mean decreased demand for Nvidia in future years.
Except for Alphabet's tensor processing unit (TPU), which has been deployed in its internal data centers for a decade and is on its seventh iteration, these competing chips from customers are nowhere near as powerful and efficient as the latest Nvidia models. When it comes to training and running AI systems, efficiency and computer processing scale are what matter above all else.
If Nvidia can maintain this large lead over the internal chips built by its cloud infrastructure customers, it should maintain its presence as the dominant player in AI. Even Alphabet still uses Nvidia chips for Google Cloud despite its long-running innovations with the TPU.
Where will Nvidia's market cap be in 5 years?
With its current industry lead, it looks likely that Nvidia will maintain its market share of AI computer chips over the next five years, barring any major disruptions.
Today, Nvidia stock trades at a P/E ratio of 53, an expensive earnings ratio that indicates large expectations for future growth over the next five years. What investors need to consider is the uncertainty around semiconductor spending in regards to AI computing. This is a booming industry that could go through a bust if the data center players get ahead of actual customer demand for AI software. It hasn't happened yet, but is entirely possible to occur in the next five years.
This leaves us with a wide set of potential outcomes for Nvidia's revenue and earnings power five years from now. It is possible that its revenue will be cut in half if AI data center demand dries up. Or, it could be double today or close to the exact same level. This is the uncertainty that comes with investing in hypergrowth stocks.
Combined with the expensive earnings ratio, I think it is likely that Nvidia's market cap is around the same level today or even lower five years from now, despite how well the stock has performed in the last five years. Don't pile into Nvidia stock at a market cap of $4.5 trillion."

The legendary investor was a rock star at Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford for more than 40 years. He was in charge of the premier Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust for over two decades, generating returns of more than 1,700% during his term.
Anderson secured his legacy early on, recognizing the dramatic growth potential of then early stage companies, including Netflix, Amazon, Tesla, and Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), delivering considerable profits for investors along the way. Given his track record, when Anderson talks, investors should listen.
Most experts agree that the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is still in its early stages, and if the trend continues, Nvidia's market cap could surge to as much as $50 trillion by 2035, according to Anderson. While that might seem improbable on its face, Anderson's reasoning is worth a look.
Dominating the space
The dawn of generative AI in early 2023 created a windfall for Nvidia. The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that quickly became the gold standard for AI. Nvidia rode the unprecedented demand for its chips to become the world's largest publicly traded company, valued at $4.58 trillion (as of this writing).
After two successive years of triple-digit year-over-year sales growth, Nvidia's results have begun to moderate but are still enviable by any standard. In its fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 27), Nvidia generated revenue that grew 56% year over year to a record $46.7 billion, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08 jumped 61%.
Yet this could be just the beginning. The AI market is projected to be worth as much as $15.7 trillion by 2030, according to data compiled by ""Big Four"" accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The report suggests ""AI is still at a very early stage."" If Nvidia earns just a small slice of that total opportunity, sales and profits could continue to surge, resulting in a windfall for the chipmaker and its shareholders.
Anderson estimates the data center market, where most AI processing is conducted, is poised to grow 60% annually. If Nvidia's profit margin holds steady and the adoption of AI continues at its current pace over the next 10 years, Anderson estimates that Nvidia would deliver EPS of $1,350 and free cash flow of $1,000 per share. That would drive the stock price to about $20,000, pushing its market cap to roughly $49 trillion.
Despite increasing competition, Nvidia currently dominates the data center GPU space, commanding 92% of the market, according to IoT Analytics. Anderson points out that the company's ""persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.""
The fine print
Make no mistake, plenty of things will have to go right for Nvidia to reach this astonishing benchmark, and there will be a lot of obstacles along the way. Demand for AI could falter, a rival chipmaker could ""invent a better mousetrap,"" so to speak, or the economy could go south -- and these are just a few examples of the challenges that could arise.
Even Anderson admits that this ""isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact."" When asked about the potential for the stock to reach these meteoric heights, Anderson puts the odds at between 10% and 15%.
However, investors shouldn't miss the forest for the trees. ""It is the long duration of the development of [GPU] usage in AI -- and not just AI -- from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,"" Anderson said.
There's also the matter of Nvidia's valuation. The stock has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 54, compared to a multiple of 31 for the S&P 500. However, at less than 30 times next year's expected earnings, I'd submit it's an attractive price to pay, particularly given the magnitude of the opportunity.
Even if Nvidia doesn't hit a $50 trillion market cap over the next 10 years, all the available evidence suggests Anderson's thesis is directionally accurate. Furthermore, CEO Jensen Huang has proven particularly adept at identifying opportunities before they materialize and positioning Nvidia for future success. Given his track record, I wouldn't bet against him.
That's why I believe Nvidia stock is still a buy."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-12T23:00:00,1 OpenAI Partner That Could Soar in 2026 (Hint: It's Not AMD),OpenAI has announced partnerships with several key computing providers in recent weeks.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=713db9d981c4adfdfc2e84f343ab5aec4439d7453fcabeb9aeb9996640dbfb5c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-openai-partner-that-could-soar-in-2026-hint-its/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-openai-partner-that-could-soar-in-2026-hint-its/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/1-openai-partner-that-could-soar-in-2026-hint-its/,fool.com,200,,"AMD's deal with OpenAI has shaken up the artificial intelligence (AI) investing landscape. By partnering with OpenAI, AMD is making an effort to bring its AI chips into the mainstream by giving OpenAI favorable terms for using them. This ripple effect could be a huge boost for AMD, but I still don't think it's the best OpenAI partner to invest in right now.
I'd much rather invest in Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), which is another company that has recently partnered up with OpenAI, although there is still a bit of speculation behind that deal. I think Broadcom is much better positioned to be a winner over the next few years, and I think it could soar in 2026.
Broadcom's custom AI accelerators are growing in popularity
Broadcom is involved in a ton of different tech offerings. It has products ranging from cybersecurity to mainframe software and hardware to a virtual desktop platform via the acquisition of VMware. However, its most promising product lineup is its artificial intelligence division, which has delivered stellar growth in recent quarters. During Q3 FY 2025 (ending Aug. 3), Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue rose 63% to $5.2 billion. It expects $6.2 billion in Q4 semiconductor revenue, so it's clear that this division is knocking it out of the park.
Broadcom's AI division has two primary products: connectivity switches and custom AI accelerators. Connectivity switches are used in data centers everywhere to stitch information back together after being processed by multiple computing units. There is a major market for these devices, but it pales in comparison to the demand for its custom AI accelerator chips.
Graphics processing units (GPUs) from AMD or Nvidia are fantastic for accelerated computing applications like AI, but they're also useful for other tasks like mining cryptocurrency, processing engineering simulations, and drug discovery. This flexibility doesn't come for free and adds to the costs of chips. Furthermore, the companies that use them for AI training and inference run different styles of workloads, so this flexibility is a big deal in developing a neutral solution. However, this adds cost to the products, and clients of AMD and Nvidia also need to pay a markup to fund their profits.
Broadcom is offering AI hyperscalers an alternative solution, and we're just seeing the beginning phase of its popularity growth. Broadcom's custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs, are designed in conjunction with the end customer. This allows Broadcom and the client to tailor the chip specifically for the workload it sees, rather than being able to handle whatever is thrown at it. This cuts down on the cost and increases performance, making them popular alternatives.
Unfortunately for investors, Broadcom doesn't specifically announce who its customers are. However, it's fairly easy to link clients, and various analysts have linked OpenAI to Broadcom in a $10 billion deal that was announced during its earnings call. This could be a valuable client on top of Broadcom's other three.
In an earlier conference call, Broadcom stated that two clients were on track to finish their designs this year, with two more starting the process. However, from their existing three clients, they believe that they will have a serviceable addressable market in the $60 billion to $90 billion range by 2027. That's monstrous growth, and could be what Broadcom needs to send the stock soaring in 2026 as these results are realized and new customers are announced.
However, Broadcom's stock isn't without risk.
Broadcom's stock is cheaper than AMD's, but it's not cheap in general
The market is well aware of Broadcom's products and has given the stock a premium valuation as a result.
The stock trades for more than 51 times forward earnings (at the time of this writing), which is still cheaper than AMD's 60 times forward earnings valuation.
However, nobody should ever claim 51 times forward earnings is ""cheap,"" and Broadcom has a ton of growing to do to make the valuation reasonable. Still, these ratios are based on analysts' estimates, and they could be understating Broadcom's growth, making the stock appear cheaper than it actually is.
If Broadcom's projection is right about 2027, and it can capture the low end of its serviceable market range ($60 billion), that would result in Broadcom's revenue doubling by 2027 (its current revenue total is just under $60 billion).
Time will tell if that projection pans out, but if it does, I think Broadcom is the better OpenAI partner to invest in versus AMD."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-12T22:19:00,Prediction: These Will Be Wall Street's 2 Most Prominent Stock-Split Stocks of 2026,"Up over 400% in just three years, these industry leaders are ripe for stock splits in 2026.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a308803e43f22ae070e38eb49218e9b170015e52f2703132aa8bfdcf8aff7334,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/wall-street-stock-split-buy-netflix-meta-2026/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/wall-street-stock-split-buy-netflix-meta-2026/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/wall-street-stock-split-buy-netflix-meta-2026/,fool.com,200,,"There were a flurry of stock splits last year, including Nvidia, Broadcom, Chipotle, and Walmart, among others. But 2025 hasn't been nearly as active a year for stock splits.
That could change in 2026.
Here's why Netflix (NFLX -1.02%) and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) stand out as top candidates to split their stocks in 2026.
When stock splits make sense
Stock splits provide an opportunity to make a company's shares more accessible to smaller investors with limited capital. While they are less important in today's age of zero-cost trading and fractional shares, companies will still pursue stock splits for other benefits like employee compensation and psychological appeal too.
For example, Berkshire Hathaway offers class A shares and class B shares. At the time of this writing, A shares trade for around $750,000 compared to $500 for B shares, with each B share making up 1/1,500th of an A share. If given the choice to invest $500 in B shares or buy 1/1,500th of a fractional share of class A, many investors will prefer the simplicity (and satisfaction) of owning one full B share.
It's also worth noting that options contracts are typically packaged in increments of 100 shares. A lower stock price can increase interest from smaller investors who are looking to buy or sell options.
Despite these benefits, a company should only execute a stock split if it is confident it can grow its value and, in turn, its share price over time. Oracle split its stock a staggering six times between 1995 and 2000. It was too much, too fast. The dot-com bubble burst, and it took over 15 years for Oracle to exceed its all-time high from 2000. Oracle has not split its stock since then.
Netflix and Meta could split next year
Netflix and Meta have what it takes to continue compounding in value, setting the stage for stock splits in 2026.
It's been over a decade since Netflix last split its stock. The company is a completely different business today, shifting its focus from growing revenue and subscribers to cash flow and profitability. Netflix is achieving impeccable results despite much more difficult competition from legacy media companies that are expanding their streaming offerings, as well as tech companies like Apple and Amazon that offer their own services as well.
By 2030, Netflix plans to triple operating income from 2024 levels, grow operating income faster than revenue (thus expanding margins), and hit a $1 trillion in market cap. With a share price over $1,200 at the time of this writing, I could see Netflix splitting its stock by 7-for-1 in 2026, which is the same ratio as its split in 2015.
Since its initial public offering in 2012, Meta has never split its stock. It is the only member of the ""Magnificent Seven"" or ""Ten Titans"" to have never done so -- and for good reason. It's easy to forget that Meta fell below $100 per share in the fall of 2022 as investors heavily criticized management's decision to invest in the metaverse. The company recovered because it unlocked massive engagement increases through short-form videos, which made Instagram more attractive for advertisers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) was another big change for Meta, as the company has fine-tuned its algorithm to further boost engagement and provide useful metrics for advertisers. In short, Instagram has become one of the most sought-after platforms for targeted digital advertising. And Meta's share price is now over $700, a remarkable recovery in less than three years.
Like Netflix, Meta is now consistently profitable and raking in free cash flow (FCF). In the last three years, Meta has increased its FCF by 163%, and Netflix has boosted its FCF more than fivefold. What's particularly impressive about Meta's FCF growth is that it is spending a record amount on capital expenditures to boost AI infrastructure. Without that AI spending, FCF would be much higher. But investors would probably prefer the company to invest in long-term growth, given the potential reward. I could see Meta announcing a 5-for-1 split next year.
Two potential Dow Jones components
Netflix and Meta's industry leadership, profitability, and international growth potential give both companies the green light to split their stocks in 2026. Another reason these companies may split their stocks is to get added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
For a stock to be added to the Dow (which is a price-weighted index), its stock price can't be too high, or it would excessively shift the balance of the index. It's worth mentioning that Nvidia, Amazon, and Sherwin-Williams all underwent stock splits before being added to the Dow in 2024. Adjusted for splits, all three stocks had a share price below $400 when they were added to the Dow.
A glaring flaw in the Dow is that it doesn't have exposure to social media. With two large cloud providers already in the Dow (Amazon and Microsoft), Meta might have a better chance of replacing Verizon Communications than Alphabet.
A less likely scenario is that Netflix replaces Walt Disney in the Dow. Disney has been underperforming the broad market for years, but it has made substantial headway in monetizing its streaming business recently.
Beyond the typical benefits, stock splits would also position Meta and Netflix for consideration in the event of further Dow Jones index shakeups in 2026."

A person generally has to be rich and well connected to invest in venture capital (VC)-backed private companies. But there's a fund that enables everyday investors to invest in this asset class for a minimum of just $500: ARK Invest's ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX -0.07%), run by well-known investor Cathie Wood.
Overall, this fund looks very attractive, though its limited liquidity means it wouldn't be a good fit for certain investors. Its performance since inception just over three years ago has been very good.
ARK Venture Fund: Overview
The ARK Venture Fund is an actively managed interval fund that invests primarily (but not entirely) in private companies. I'll expound on what an ""interval fund"" means in a moment.
Key facts about the fund, as of the end of the third quarter (Sept. 30):
- Net assets: $325.3 million
- Minimum investment: $500
- Total annual fees: 2.9%. This is higher than non-managed index-based funds, but that's to be expected. So far, the fund's good performance has been worth paying this fee.
- Total holdings: 66; 81.9% private companies/18.1% publicly traded companies by weightings.
Interval funds are so named because investors can only sell at set ""intervals."" This limited liquidity stems from non-public companies not trading daily on stock exchanges like individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
ARK Venture Fund's investors can only request redemptions on a quarterly basis. And only up to 5% of the net asset value (NAV) of the fund can be redeemed by investors each quarter. So, investors should only invest the money they are sure they will not quickly need in the near future.

1. SpaceX
SpaceX designs, manufactures, and launches rockets and spacecraft. CEO and Chairman Elon Musk founded the Texas-based company in 2002, which is two years before he joined electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla, of which he is CEO and legally considered a founder.
SpaceX is the world's leading space launch provider, has contracts with NASA and other government entities, and operates the Starlink internet satellite constellation.
2. Figure AI
Figure AI, based in Silicon Valley, is developing and manufacturing AI-powered humanoid robots for general-purpose use. It was founded in 2022.
The company's investors include such technology heavyweights as AI chip and tech leader Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) -- whose technology Figure AI uses -- Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI.
3. Neuralink
Musk co-founded this company in 2016 to develop a human brain-computer interface. It's based in Silicon Valley, but expanding near Austin, Texas. The company's near-term goal is to help people with paralysis control external devices, while the ultimate aim is to merge the human brain with AI.
Notable investors include Alphabet's Google Ventures and OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman.
4. OpenAI
OpenAI is an AI company founded by Altman, Musk, and others in 2015. Musk is no longer associated with the San Francisco-based company, as he and Altman had a very public falling out.
OpenAI launched its popular ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. This event triggered the frenzy among companies to obtain generative AI capabilities, as ChatGPT wowed users with the amazing capabilities of this then-new type of AI.
In 2025, OpenAI has made several massive deals. In January, it announced Stargate, a $500 billion U.S. AI infrastructure joint venture with Oracle and SoftBank Group. Nvidia is the technology partner.
Last week, OpenAI and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices announced AMD will supply 6 gigawatts of its Instinct series graphics processing units (GPUs) to power OpenAI's next-generation AI infrastructure. In addition, OpenAI plans to buy up to a 10% stake in AMD.
That deal follows just weeks after OpenAI's megadeal with AI GPU leader Nvidia, which involves OpenAI deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for its next-generation AI infrastructure. Moreover, Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI.
Nvidia's massive planned investment follows it joining an OpenAI funding round last year. Microsoft has been an early and huge funder of OpenAI and the two have a strategic partnership.
5. Lambda Labs
Lambda Labs is a Silicon Valley-based AI company that was founded in 2012. It bills itself as ""The Superintelligence Cloud,"" and builds massive AI factories based on Nvidia's GPUs.
Nvidia and Super Micro Computers are strategic investors, and several OpenAI co-founders are also investors. The Information has reported that Lambda is aiming for an IPO in the first half of 2026."

At the same time, the firm boosted its position in semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) by a staggering 414% -- adding more than 6.5 million shares, and bringing its stake in it to around $1.5 billion at current share prices.
These moves speak volumes about Griffin's evolving view of the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. Below, I'll unpack what might have influenced Citadel's decision-making, and what investors can conclude from this reshuffle.
Why Griffin trimmed Palantir: A rational hedge fund rebalance
On the surface, Citadel's decision to offload nearly half of its stake in Palantir may appear bearish. But in the world of hedge funds, selling doesn't always signal lost conviction -- it's often about managing risk.
Palantir's meteoric rise -- shares have soared by more than 2,000% over the past three years -- has left even its sincerest believers aware that the stock is priced for perfection. Trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 135, Palantir is flirting with valuations reminiscent of the dot-com era.
For disciplined managers like Griffin, emotion cannot override basic math. Hedge funds thrive by constantly reallocating their capital, which includes trimming their positions in their winners once they've run too far, too fast. Notably, famous investors like Stanley Druckenmiller and Cathie Wood have played this same hand with Palantir positions before.
In the grand scheme of things, taking some chips off the table from a high-flying stock is simply about risk-adjusted returns. Palantir's long-term fundamentals remain impressive, but hedge funds cannot afford to be sentimental. Locking in some profits gives them more financial flexibility to invest in opportunities that offer a better balance between upside and valuation.
Why Citadel keeps buying Nvidia: The backbone of AI infrastructure
In my view, Citadel's growing position in Nvidia signals Griffin's conviction that the next decade of computing will be defined not by those who write algorithms, but by those who control the infrastructure that runs them.
Over the past few years, Nvidia has evolved into the world's preeminent supplier of accelerated computing hardware. Its GPUs now power everything from large language models (LLMs) and autonomous systems to next-generation humanoid robots.
But Nvidia's dominance isn't just about hardware -- it's about the ecosystem. The company's CUDA software platform has become a moat of its own, locking developers into a computing standard that few rivals can match.
Citadel's accumulation of Nvidia stock reflects several reinforcing trends:
- Hyperscaler spending: Cloud infrastructure giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are collectively investing hundreds of billions of dollars annually to expand data center capacity.
- Strategic integrations: Nvidia's partnerships with OpenAI, Intel, and Oracle are only beginning to realize their potential.
- Relentless innovation: The company's forthcoming GPU architectures -- Blackwell Ultra and Rubin -- extend its technological lead and will keep its growth runway secure.
While Nvidia also trades at a premium valuation, its structural growth story remains unrivaled. As corporations and governments race to build AI infrastructure, Nvidia stands as the most reliable -- and arguably indispensable -- foundation for the AI era.
A masterclass in portfolio evolution
Griffin's moves signal a calculated rotation within the AI megatrend -- not a retreat from it. By trimming his stake in Palantir and doubling down on Nvidia, Citadel is effectively betting on where the next wave of outsize profits in AI will emerge.
The takeaway for investors is clear: Don't chase hype narratives or follow momentum. Instead, try to anticipate capital flows. Griffin isn't abandoning AI; he's rebalancing his bets on the trend toward the pick-and-shovel plays that are supporting it.
My take is that Griffin thinks Palantir's story is maturing, while Nvidia's machine is still poised to add muscle."

According to an autonomous vehicle market forecast from Next Move Strategy Consulting, the global driverless vehicle market was roughly $106 billion in 2021, but is expected to grow to over $2.3 trillion by the end of the decade. The question for investors is: How do we invest in this future? This is a good place to scratch the surface with three driverless vehicle stocks that could end up becoming monsters long-term.
Processing power for the win
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is pretty close to a household name, at least within the investing community that's well aware of its eye-popping gains over the past decade. The company enjoys durable competitive advantages, or an economic moat, thanks to its leadership in graphics processing units (GPUs), hardware, software, and networking tools -- all of which revolve around the artificial intelligence (AI) world.
While Nvidia will be certainly tied to the AI industry long-term, investors have high hopes for the company's automotive business as greater processing power will be absolutely needed in more complex active safety systems, as well as driverless vehicles. According to Morningstar, Nvidia's automotive business is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next decade to reach nearly $11 billion in fiscal 2035.
Investors looking for a brilliant way to play the driverless vehicle future, while owning a business that's generating immense value outside of the automotive industry, should absolutely take a look at Nvidia first.
So much more than calculators
Texas Instruments (TXN 0.72%) is probably more well known for its calculators found on school desks across the globe, but it generates roughly 95% of its revenue from semiconductors. Texas Instruments is the world's largest maker of analog chips, which are used to process signals such as sound and power.
Here's the good news for Texas Instruments investors, especially when it comes to the automotive industry. Automotive, industrial, and communications infrastructure consumers are highly unlikely to choose inferior or unproven analog chips or microcontrolers (MCU) to save a buck on crucial pieces of equipment that could be valued at tens of thousands of dollars. Driverless vehicles are expected to have a much longer lifespan than a product such as a calculator, making Texas Instruments products a logical long-term choice for many automakers.
Another positive for Texas Instruments investors is that the company, similar to Nvidia, has a solid economic moat thanks to its intangible assets revolving around the analog chip designs and manufacturing experience, as well as switching costs -- it's more difficult for a customer to swap out analog chips that have been designed for a specific device.
Pushing the envelope
QuantumScape (QS 5.60%) is far from a household name and its journey has only just begun. The company develops the next generation of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles (EVs) and other applications. Imagine an EV battery that offers vehicles better range, faster charging, and improved safety, and costs less than the status quo -- that's essentially what QuantumScape set out to achieve, and testing has so far gone well.
One of the biggest reasons for optimism for QuantumScape investors is the company's strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with PowerCo, the battery company of Volkswagen Group. Further, just recently news hit the markets that this strategic agreement is expanding and under the new terms PowerCo will provide up to $131 million in new payments over the next two years if the joint venture achieves specific milestones, the first of which has already been reached.
The expanded partnership will enable PowerCo to produce QSE-5 battery cells earlier than anticipated and will accelerate the timeline of QuantumScape's pilot-line development. This just brings QuantumScape one step closer to its goal of commercial production of its solid-state batteries which, if achieved, would significantly change the EV industry for the better. While QuantumScape's batteries will be used in a wide range of EVs, it is particularly intriguing when EVs are combined with driverless vehicles for robotaxis, and extending their range and cost effectiveness would be in huge demand long-term.
Buy and hold
The hype and expectations for driverless vehicles has died down a bit as investors come to grips with the difficulty in perfecting this technology, while juggling evolving regulations surrounding the industry. However, as far as driverless stocks go, these three are almost no-brainers, not only because they have significant opportunity as driverless vehicles gain traction in the real world, but because their technology and products extend beyond the automotive industry giving investors some relief with diversification. If you're interested in investing in the future of driverless vehicles, start by scratching the surface of these three potentially monster stocks."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-12T16:45:00,From Chips to Power Grids: The Hidden Plays Behind the AI Gold Rush,Investors should focus on companies offering advanced packaging and power management solutions to AI data centers.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=79b51ba0b01dab71b1e268d40675928d44972b00e607f841d5fd46abc71f1d74,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/from-chips-to-power-grids-the-hidden-plays-behind/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/from-chips-to-power-grids-the-hidden-plays-behind/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/12/from-chips-to-power-grids-the-hidden-plays-behind/,fool.com,200,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a technology megatrend. It is transforming how we live, work, learn, and play, and is reshaping the world as we know it.
However, training and running the advanced AI models that drive this transformation requires a massive amount of compute capacity and data bandwidth. Subsequently, the demand for the cutting-edge chips, servers, networking gear, and power systems needed to build massive data center capacity has skyrocketed.
Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are being used extensively to enable accelerated computing in AI data centers. Broadcom is also helping these chips communicate efficiently with custom networking and connectivity solutions. But AI isn't only about semiconductors. It also depends on reliable chip packaging, as well as power management systems to make these high-performance servers function efficiently and reliably.
Here are two prominent yet lesser-known companies driving this gold rush from chips to power grids.
Amkor Technology
Amkor Technology's (AMKR 4.51%) advanced packaging and testing solutions also play a crucial role in the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. The company is the second-largest outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) player globally. It assembles, packages, and validates GPUs, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in accelerated computing platforms. These services ensure the performance and reliability of AI and high-performance computing chips.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Amkor's revenue was up 3% year over year to $1.5 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) were $0.22. The company's gross margin was just 12% due to increased preparation costs for upcoming product ramps and headwinds from the early stage scale-up of the high-volume manufacturing facility in Vietnam. Those margin headwinds, however, are temporary.
While Amkor's financial growth doesn't seem explosive, there are still many reasons to keep an eye on the company. The global advanced packaging market is estimated to grow from $48.5 billion in 2023 to $119.4 billion in 2032. This appears to be a conservative estimate, considering the massive demand for AI chips in data centers worldwide.
Amkor continues to strengthen its position in advanced packaging technologies. The company offers advanced packaging solutions, including 2.5D and High-Density Fan-Out (HDFO), that facilitate efficient integration of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) in next-generation computing chips. The next-generation HDFO product has already entered high-volume production for a lead customer.
HDFO helps minimize signal loss and enables high-bandwidth communication between densely integrated, AI-optimized chips. The company's advanced packaging and testing lines in South Korea and Taiwan are working at high utilization levels. Amkor plans to expand capacity at these facilities further.
Amkor carried $2 billion in cash and $3.1 billion in total liquidity, while its total debt was $1.6 billion as of the end of the second quarter. With a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 1.5, Amkor maintains sufficient financial flexibility to invest in future growth initiatives.
Amkor trades at almost 20 times forward earnings, which is very reasonable. Coupled with its significant exposure to AI-driven packaging and testing demand, the company seems like a worthwhile pick now.
Vertiv Holdings
Vertiv Holdings (VRT 2.95%) has emerged as a key player in the development of AI infrastructure. The company provides the critical power and thermal management infrastructure needed to operate AI data centers at scale.
Its liquid-cooling franchise has scaled capacity over 40 times since 2024, driven by surging demand from hyperscalers for high-density server racks with larger power utilization. By dissipating the intense heat generated in these high-power AI servers, liquid-cooling systems enhance energy efficiency and minimize performance degradation due to overheating.
Vertiv's financial performance has been impressive. The company's net sales were up 35% year over year to over $2.6 billion in the second quarter. The company's backlog also soared 21% to $8.5 billion. This highlights the company's exceptional revenue visibility for 2025. Vertiv is now guiding for net sales of $10 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $3.80 for this year. Management is also targeting an adjusted operating margin of 20% in 2025 and 25% by 2029.
Vertiv is increasingly helping link the power and thermal systems (gray space ) with IT hardware and racks (white space) in the data center. The acquisition of Great Lakes has added data rack enclosures, custom racks, and enhanced cable management solutions to Vertiv's portfolio. This deal has further strengthened Vertiv's capabilities to integrate white space and gray space in data centers.
The company has also strengthened its capabilities for AI-powered monitoring and control of its power and cooling infrastructure by acquiring Waylay NV. Hence, the company is well-positioned to deliver fully integrated and prefabricated systems to hyperscalers, enabling rapid expansion of data center capacity.
Vertiv has collaborated with CoreWeave and Dell Technologies to deploy Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture-based GB300 NVL72 system. Its alliance with Oklo can help data centers access advanced nuclear power plants. Vertiv's nuclear power plant technology can help data centers manage their long-term energy demands in a cost-efficient manner. All this highlights that the company is at the forefront of AI infrastructure development.
Vertiv expects to generate adjusted free cash flow of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2025. With $2.5 billion in liquidity and net leverage (total debt to earnings) of only 0.6x, the company has ample flexibility to fund future growth initiatives both organically and inorganically.
Trading at almost 33.4 times forward earnings, Vertiv shares are not cheap. However, the premium valuation is justified considering the solid demand for its power and thermal management solutions in the global AI buildout. Hence, the stock can be a smart pick now."

The company sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power crucial AI tasks -- and its GPUs are the fastest around. This makes it the key element needed in every AI data center, and considering spending in AI infrastructure may reach into the trillions in the coming years, Nvidia's revenue may be set to explode higher to new record levels.
Though Nvidia is the market leader, it still faces competition from other chip designers that have set their sights on taking share from this giant. One of these players is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%), a company that's boosted the power of its GPUs in recent years and seen demand and revenue climb. And this player just signed a multi-billion-dollar, long-term deal for compute with AI powerhouse OpenAI -- a partnership that even Nvidia chief Jensen Huang called ""clever.""
Did AMD just say checkmate to Nvidia? Let's find out.
Nvidia's focus on AI
First, though, let's take a quick look at the Nvidia and AMD stories. Years before this AI boom began, Nvidia recognized the opportunity and made a major transition, shifting its focus from the gaming market to designing its GPUs to suit AI. This was a winning bet as it resulted in Nvidia entering the market first and leading in innovation -- and all of this has generated double- and triple-digit revenue growth in recent quarters, into the billions of dollars.
AMD has increased its push into the AI market over the past few years, launching the AMD Instinct line of accelerators, and in the latest quarter, predicted its MI350 series would drive revenue growth in the second half of the year. Some analysts have said that AMD's innovations position it to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and chip -- released late last year -- but Nvidia's commitment to release upgrades on an annual basis could keep it a step ahead when it comes to overall GPU performance and therefore revenue.
Big tech companies are looking for the most powerful compute available -- and so far, they know they can find that at Nvidia.
OpenAI's deal with AMD
But just recently, a major tech customer has turned to Nvidia rival AMD. OpenAI, the research lab behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, signed a deal for compute that could lead to it taking a 10% stake in the chip designer. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's chips over several years -- the first 1-gigawatt launch is set to begin in the second half of next year. For reference, 1 gigawatt is comparable to 100 million LED bulbs, according to the Department of Energy.
In return, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for as many as 160 million shares, representing as much as 10% of AMD, and these will vest as certain milestones are reached.
With this, it's natural to ask: Did AMD just say checkmate to Nvidia? After all, OpenAI is a massive customer and considered one of the key players in the AI space. Nvidia's Huang, interviewed by CNBC, said it was surprising that AMD would potentially offer such a stake, but called the deal ""clever.""
And it is indeed an interesting operation for AMD, ensuring the company a major position in this infrastructure scale-up phase. Huang has said AI infrastructure spending may reach $4 trillion by the end of the decade, and this represents an enormous opportunity for chip designers such as AMD and Nvidia.
What the deal means for AMD and for Nvidia
So, the OpenAI deal is positive for AMD -- but I wouldn't say it's negative for Nvidia. This chip giant signed its own deal with OpenAI last month, and it involves the deployment of 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems across data centers. Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI progressively as the project unfolds, and the initial gigawatt, as with the OpenAI-AMD deal, is set to deploy in the second half of next year.
A quick comparison of the two deals: The Nvidia-OpenAI agreement involves more gigawatts, and Nvidia isn't giving up a stake in its business -- on top of this, though Nvidia is offering OpenAI funding, this will result in revenue growth as OpenAI returns to Nvidia to order GPUs. This pretty much guarantees that Nvidia will be the chip designer to benefit the most as OpenAI expands -- and AMD isn't about to step ahead of the market leader.
All of this means that, yes, AMD should score a win thanks to its agreement with OpenAI and this may boost its growth in the market. But the chip designer can't say ""checkmate"" to its bigger rival as Nvidia is perfectly positioned to maintain its lead over the long term."

Can we stop with all this AI bubble talk, please?
I get it.
Those hunting for a dot-com style stock market explosion want to make names for themselves by predicting a bubble. Who doesn't want the fame and fortune associated with being right in a big way?
Who doesn't want to spend a month reporting on stocks going down 75% because of a freak warning out of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT)?
Entire years could be made for content platforms in a week if the stock market were to get blown up because of a Lehman-like meltdown in tech valuations. If you are over the age of 40, you remember the trading screens during the height of the great financial crisis. Massive declines, a full-on sea of red. Every. Single. Day.
But I'm here to say we have to give these AI bubble predictions a rest. Ditto the predictions that we are in a tech bubble. It's just not what's happening out there yet.
First of all, AI is a real technology being deployed in real ways inside of Corporate America.
Second, this technology is requiring more physical assets in the ground — which are being built to support AI's real-world application. What Zach Dell (son of Michael Dell) is working on at startup Base Power (which just raised $1 billion) impressed me this week. It's addressing a key issue —power availability and costs in part because of rising stress on the grid due to AI development.
Next, the spending on AI infrastructure doesn't strike me as reckless.
I talk to CFOs and they walk me through their thinking, which seems logical. They aren't foaming at the mouth with wild-eyed predictions of grandeur similar to the late '90s.
Plus, the tech giants making the biggest AI investments are fueling their ambitions by cash on hand — not loading up balance sheets with debt. The upstarts in AI are well funded, not being 100% stupid in their organizational build-outs. They're working on tangible technology that has actual orders behind it.
""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su told me about concerns of AI overspending this week (video above). ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world.""
AMD is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded."""

On October 9, Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated the stock as “Overweight” and raised its price target to a Wall Street high of $300 per share from $240 following management meetings.
“We hosted NVDA mgmt for investor meetings in NYC this past week, including Jensen Huang (CEO), Colette Kress (CFO), Toshiya Hari (IR), as well as other Senior Executives.”
The executives discussed details of the new partnership with OpenAI.
“The vision here is to remove margin stacking by server ODM’s and CSP’s, enabling the cost delta between NVDA and ASICs to only an average of 15% – truly a win-win for both and placing potentially further pressure on the ASIC market,” said Cantor analysts, led by C.J. Muse, in a Thursday investor note. “The company continues to work at Extreme Co-Design at an annual cadence, enabling the optimization of the entire AI Infrastructure (no one wants to buy chips only, they want to deploy AI at scale), helped by a full-stack solution including CUDA-X.”
The firm believes that Nvidia will reach an $8 earnings per share in calendar year 2026. Furthermore, it said that token demand has climbed sharply in the previous months, increasing profit per token.
“OpenAI and other platforms are now generating 50-70% gross margins, leading to every stood up GPU now sold out. Customers are searching desperately for compute wherever they can find it. More specifically, in the last 12-16 weeks we have seen an inflection – likely tied to time-based reasoning explosion coupled with multimodal inputs, led by video where context length is super long.”
The firm is also strongly convinced that the rapid, wide-scale adoption of generative AI is proof that it is not a bubble.
“In the last 12 months, recommenders have adopted Generative AI,” Muse noted. “Search has moved to Generative AI. Social Media to Generative AI. User-Generated content, Ad recommendation, everything has moved from classical machine learning to Generative AI. NVDA sees $2 Trillion in spending here from traditional compute to Generative AI alone. We are simply not in a bubble, rather the market is beginning to see how ‘quality’ AI can deliver meaningfully positive ROI’s.”
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.

One area of overlap is that you should invest a certain portion of your income. While this is solid financial advice, some finance experts, like entrepreneur Mark Cuban, think a large portion of your portfolio should be in cash.
Be Aware: Key Signs Your Credit Card Is Quietly Wrecking Your Finances
For You: Here's the Minimum Salary Required To Be Considered Upper Class in 2025
Here are some of the reasons for keeping cash on hand.
Financial Opportunities
When it comes to investing, few can match the accomplishments of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Over the years, Buffett has made a name for himself as a top investor who preaches patience and holding for the long term. However, Buffett doesn’t just invest; he also holds a lot of cash.
Toward the end of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway’s cash reserves reached $325 billion, doubling the amount of cash it had at the end of 2023. Having cash on hand gives Buffett the upper hand in terms of flexibility. When a stock’s price dips and he determines it’s undervalued, other companies might not have the liquidity to buy it up on the spot. However, Buffett’s cash reserve allows him to jump at the chance and maximize his profits.
Not everyone runs a multinational conglomerate like Berkshire Hathaway, but holding cash can still give you the chance to take advantage of opportunities that may later arise. Whether it’s an undervalued stock, a property or a rare watch, if you have enough cash on hand, you won’t need to rush to sell any other investments to acquire it.

Market Volatility
Buying low and selling high may be the most common investing advice out there. However, market volatility isn’t always great. Cuban, a successful entrepreneur, investor and TV personality, always keeps a large portion of his portfolio in cash because, whether it be political unpredictability, a global event or a new innovation, he isn’t a fan of losing money and doesn’t want to take big risks.
On Jan. 27, 2025, Nvidia’s stock dropped 17%, dropping its market cap by almost $600 billion — the largest plunge for a U.S. company in history. While the company quickly rebounded, Cuban didn’t feel right about buying in as he thought there was still too much uncertainty. Other market-shaking events, such as President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements, have also kept Cuban from investing. By keeping his money in cash, he’s been unaffected by the market swings and can stay confident about preserving his wealth."

We recently published 10 Stocks Everyone’s Talking About As AI Investments Continue. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein senior semiconductor analyst, was recently asked about the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)-OpenAI $100 billion deal and what it indicates. The analyst said the deal shows there is a “shortage” of computing power and customers are lining up in advance.
“I mean, one of the primary overarching themes seems to be a shortage of compute. Everybody out there who’s involved in this seems to still be scrambling for compute. And so I do think that is part of this, and you know, Jensen’s thrown out some big numbers for what he thought infrastructure spending would be by the end of the decade. I think he said three to four trillion — like, who knows, I don’t know how big — but I do think that it’s big. So you have that. I think the power question is very interesting. I think customers are lining up power in front of these kinds of investments years in advance because the power infrastructure as it sits isn’t there; that has to be put in front. People have really thought about whether or not power might actually be the primary constraint as we ramp all this up over time. It may not even be compute. Over time, I mean.”
The current AI boom cycle stems from spending by major tech companies, and Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of this spending. In Q2 FY2026, three direct customers accounted for 23%, 19%, and 14% of NVDA’s accounts receivable. Almost all of the company’s revenue comes from AI-related infrastructure spending. In the latest quarter, $41.3 billion of the $46.7 billion revenue came from these clients. The music could stop for Nvidia if these major companies decide to slow down their spending amid a lack of ROI. If investors sense a weakness in CapEx spending, and the market begins to waver, NVDA stock price would be the first to see its impact.
Baird Chautauqua International and Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported first quarter results that were extremely solid. The company took a write-down on China-specific datacenter products and flushed out any future China contributions from their guidance, following the new export restrictions introduced in April. Demand commentary ex China was extremely encouraging—Nvidia is outgrowing expectations despite supply constraints and outgrowing competing ASIC products by a large margin. We have been underweight Nvidia relative to the benchmark, which was up 46% in the quarter, given our short-to medium-term concerns that the feverish AI datacenter build may be resulting in overcapacity, which has not come to bear.”"

Oct 10 - Shares of two Semiconductor giants, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), fell sharply on Friday after the U.S. Senate advanced a bill that could restrict exports of artificial intelligence chips to China, reigniting trade tension fears.
The proposed legislation would curb how many advanced AI processors American companies can ship overseas. The bill's future remains uncertain, as President Donald Trump, who earlier eased chip export rules, could veto it. The House of Representatives is drafting a separate version that currently lacks export limits.
Investors reacted swiftly. AMD dropped about 7%, while Nvidia slipped roughly 5%. The pullback reflected renewed concerns over Washington's tightening stance on technology trade with Beijing.
Despite Friday's fall, AMD has had an 83% year to date, with Nvidia increasing by about 41%. The two stocks have been major winners in the worldwide AI phenomenon, though the Senate's action indicates that U.S. chipmakers face increasing threats in a climate of trade policy uncertainty."

The path to retirement is paved with numbers, rules of thumb, and more than a few sleepless nights spent wondering if you’ve saved enough. For one couple featured on the “Money Guy Show,” hosted by Brian Preston and Bo Hanson, that journey led to a specific target: $3 million—a figure that sparked a broader conversation about how Americans should actually think about their retirement goals.
The Magic Number and How They Got There
According to the “Money Guy Show,” the couple initially considered a range between $2.5 million and $3 million before settling on the higher figure. The calculation wasn’t pulled from thin air—it was anchored in one of personal finance’s most enduring guidelines: the 4% rule.
Don't Miss:

Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the $36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property
Here’s how the math worked: The couple wanted to withdraw $100,000 annually in retirement. Using the 4% rule, which suggests limiting annual withdrawals to 4% of total savings to ensure the portfolio can sustain itself, they arrived at $2.5 million ($100,000 represents 4% of $2.5 million). But they ultimately bumped their target to $3 million, which would support $120,000 in annual withdrawals.
The reasoning behind the increase? They expect to be mortgage-free by retirement. That freed-up housing payment could then flow into their general living expenses, justifying the higher withdrawal amount, Preston and Hanson explained.
Living Off the Interest—Or So the Theory Goes
The philosophy underpinning the 4% rule is elegantly simple: withdraw only 4% each year, and your account should replenish itself through investment returns. It’s the modern equivalent of “living off the interest,” though as Hanson noted, that 4% figure isn’t set in stone.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Some financial advisers recommend a more conservative 3% withdrawal rate, particularly in low-return environments or for those worried about longevity risk. Others, like personal finance guru Dave Ramsey, suggest you might safely go slightly higher depending on your circumstances and risk tolerance.
The Inflation Question That Changes Everything
But here’s where the couple’s plan hits a potential snag—one that trips up countless Americans planning for retirement. When they talk about wanting $120,000 a year, are they referring to today’s dollars or the purchasing power they’ll need when they actually retire?"

As part of the deal, OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct graphics processing units (GPUs) across multiple generations of hardware, beginning with a 1 gigawatt rollout of its MI450 chip in the second half of 2026.
Meanwhile, AMD granted OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares that vest as specific rollout and share price milestones are hit, with the final tranche tied to AMD's stock reaching $600 a share. AMD said the deal will be immediately accretive and gives it a clear line of sight to tens of billions of dollars in annual AI data center revenue beginning in 2027.
Looking to challenge Nvidia
What makes this arrangement so striking is how different it looks from the Nvidia deal OpenAI signed just a couple of weeks earlier. Nvidia invested directly into OpenAI, which would allow it to help fund the company's purchase of its chips, while here the capital flow is reversed. Instead of AMD investing in OpenAI, the AI model company will take a stake in AMD, which gives it every reason to help AMD's chips succeed. This is important because it shows a concerted effort by one of the company's biggest builders of AI infrastructure to diversify away from a single chip supplier. It is also believed that OpenAI has designed a custom chip with Broadcom that will start to be delivered next year.
The market's reaction shows how significant this is for AMD. For years, the company has been a distant second in the data center GPU market due to the moat Nvidia created with its CUDA software platform and entrenched ecosystem. AMD's Instinct chips have improved steadily, but Nvidia's software edge has been difficult to overcome. Landing OpenAI as an anchor customer gives its software ecosystem a powerful partner committed to making it work. That combination could open doors with other hyperscalers (companies that own massive data centers) that have been looking for a viable alternative to Nvidia's premium-priced chips. With the market expected to shift from training large language models (LLMs) more toward inference, where Nvidia's CUDA moat is not as strong, AMD finds itself in a good place.
Is it too late to buy the stock?
While this looks like a potentially transformative deal for AMD, there are still risks. The first gigawatt of Instinct GPUs won't ship until late 2026, and the bulk of the revenue lift comes later. Meanwhile, OpenAI's massive 6 gigawatt rollout depends on financing and on adding power infrastructure that rivals what many national grids can supply.
The warrant structure also raises some issues. OpenAI essentially receives shares for a penny each as it hits deployment and share price milestones, meaning up to 10% dilution for AMD's existing shareholders if all the conditions are met. Competition remains fierce as well. Nvidia still holds the lion's share of the market, and large customers continue to weigh a mix of GPUs from both Nvidia and AMD along with custom ASICs to balance cost, performance, and availability.
Even with those challenges, the potential upside is hard to overstate. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that each gigawatt of AI compute could add roughly $3 in annual earnings power for AMD. That could lift its prior 2027 adjusted earnings-per-share projections from about $6.74 to closer to $10 as more gigawatts come online. Management, meanwhile, believes this partnership moves AMD toward its target of generating tens of billions of dollars annually from AI data center revenue by 2027, which would mark a dramatic shift in the company's growth profile.
After the surge, AMD trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 36 times 2026 earnings estimates, which looks expensive at first glance. However, it has a PEG (price/earnings-to-growth) ratio of around 0.4, with PEGs below 1 considered undervalued.
While the shares could see near-term swings after such a steep rally, the longer-term story has changed fundamentally in AMD's favor. That means for long-term investors, it's not too late to buy the stock even after this run."

The gloves are off in Britain’s crypto regulation battle. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey just drew a hard line in the sand on Oct. 1, declaring that any stablecoin widely used for payments in the UK must be regulated exactly like money in a traditional bank—complete with depositor protections and access to central bank facilities.
The announcement marks a major escalation in the BoE’s regulatory stance and has crypto industry figures scrambling to understand what comes next, according to the Financial Times.

Bailey’s comments aren’t just regulatory noise. They signal a fundamental shift in how Britain’s central bank views the intersection of crypto and traditional finance. Stablecoins would need depositor insurance, resolution schemes, and the ability to exchange for cash without relying on cryptocurrency exchanges, according to the central bank chief.
The BoE confirmed it would publish a consultation paper on stablecoins in the coming months, setting the stage for what could become one of the most comprehensive stablecoin regulatory frameworks outside the U.S, Reuters reported.
Here’s the kicker: Bailey raised the possibility of banks and stablecoins coexisting, with non-banks taking on more credit provision roles. That’s a seismic statement about potentially restructuring how money moves through the British economy.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
The Crypto Industry Isn’t Taking This Lying Down
Crypto industry figures have expressed concern about the BoE’s caution, citing issues including caps on stablecoin holdings the BoE has proposed, the share of backing assets eligible to earn interest, and the criteria the BoE will use to determine which stablecoins fall under its remit, according to Reuters.
The timing couldn’t be more loaded with tension. Stablecoins have surged in popularity and their demand is expected to increase further after the U.S. enacted its GENIUS Act in July, which sets federal rules for stablecoins. While America was opening the door, Britain appears to be installing a much more restrictive entry system."

When Colette Kress, CFO of the artificial intelligence (AI) tech leader, gave quantifiable data about the company's sovereign AI business, I thought, ""Finally!"" as such data is only rarely shared.
Nvidia's sovereign AI business is growing like gangbusters. It appears to be the biggest growth engine of the company's AI-driven data center platform, which accounts for the bulk of Nvidia's total revenue. Yet, it gets little coverage in the financial press.
""Sovereign entities"" are those that are independent and have total or at least significant control within their borders. This includes many nations, U.S. states, and the European Union (EU).
Nvidia ""on track to achieve over $20 billion in sovereign AI revenue this year""
From Kress' remarks on last quarter's earnings call:
Sovereign AI is on the rise as the nation's ability to develop its own AI using domestic infrastructure, data, and talent presents a significant opportunity for NVIDIA Corporation. NVIDIA Corporation is at the forefront of landmark initiatives across the UK and Europe. ...
We are on track to achieve over $20 billion in Sovereign AI revenue this year, more than double that of last year.
I'll put the $20 billion in context below.
Kress said that the EU plans to invest 20 billion euros to establish 20 AI factories in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. This will include five gigafactories, and it will increase its AI compute infrastructure by 10-fold.
A ""gigafactory"" means that the AI compute facility will contain the number of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) -- which dominate the market for AI chips -- that require at least 1 gigawatt of power. For context, 1 gigawatt (or 1,000 megawatts) equates to about the power output of a large-scale nuclear power plant.
Nvidia CEO: ""Nations are investing in AI infrastructure like they once did for electricity and the Internet.""
The above quote is from CEO Jensen Huang's remarks on Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter earnings call in May. Here are more Huang snippets from that call:
I was honored to join him [President Donald Trump, in May] in announcing a 500-megawatt AI infrastructure project in Saudi Arabia ...
[In May,] we announced Taiwan's first AI factory ... Last week, I was in Sweden to launch its first national AI infrastructure. Japan, Korea, India, Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, and more are now building national AI factories to empower startups, industries, and societies. ... [N]ations are investing in AI infrastructure like they once did for electricity and the Internet.
All the countries that Huang rattled off as building sovereign AI infrastructure are using Nvidia's GPUs and related technology. Talk about big customers!
Putting the sovereign AI business' projected annual growth in context
For the current fiscal year (fiscal 2026, which ends in late January), Wall Street expects Nvidia's revenue to be $206.5 billion, up 58% from $130.5 billion last fiscal year. If that estimate proves relatively accurate and the sovereign AI business brings in revenue of $20 billion, it will account for about 9.7% of total revenue. And Kress said ""over $20 billion,"" so the percentage could be higher.
Below are more stats for further context.
|
Nvidia Market Platform |
First-Half Fiscal 2026 Revenue | Year-Over-Year-Growth* |
|---|---|---|
| Data center | $80.2 billion | 64% |
| Gaming | $8.1 billion | 46% |
| Auto | $1.2 billion | 70% |
| Professional Visualization | $1.1 billion | 26% |
| Total | $90.8 billion | 62% |
The above are half-year stats, but they give you an idea of what a standout performer Nvidia's sovereign AI business is. Given the annual projections Kress shared, this business probably generated first-half revenue in the ballpark of $8 billion, or 10% of the data center's revenue, and likely grew 100%-plus year over year.
Why Nvidia's sovereign AI strategy is particularly brilliant
Nvidia is not only selling its technology to sovereign entities, it's also assisting them in their massive undertakings. These relationships should make Nvidia's sovereign AI business especially ""sticky."" Countries that are happy with Nvidia are likely to stick with Nvidia when they want to upgrade or expand their AI infrastructure.
The sovereign AI business should also lead to other opportunities for Nvidia. Companies, researchers, and technology students that use and become familiar with a country's sovereign AI infrastructure will probably be more likely to buy Nvidia's offerings if and when they need their own AI-enabling tech."

FurtherAI, an artificial intelligence platform built for insurance workflows, on Oct. 7 announced it has raised $25 million in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz to automate repetitive tasks that bog down the industry.
Insurance professionals handle trillions of dollars in premiums each year while navigating outdated technology systems. According to FurtherAI, annual document reviews, disconnected software platforms, and endless spreadsheets consume hours that could be focused on risk assessment and client relationships.
The funding round arrived just six months after FurtherAI raised $5 million. Nexus Venture Partners, Y Combinator, and other investors joined the round, bringing total funding to $30 million.

Automating Workflows That Handle Billions In Premiums
FurtherAI says it processes billions in premiums annually for insurers, including Accelerant (NYSE:ARX), Millennial Specialty Insurance, and Leavitt Group. The platform tackles submissions processing, underwriting audits, claims handling, and policy comparisons through AI automation designed specifically for insurance workflows.
“We’re grateful to partner with leaders across the industry as they modernize operations,” FurtherAI co-founder and CEO Aman Gour said in the company's statement. “Insurance is the backbone of the economy, but the people running it have been stuck with outdated tools. With this funding, we’re doubling down on building AI workflows that give underwriters, brokers, and claims teams superpowers — freeing them to focus on the work that truly matters.”
Results show a measurable impact, the company says. Teams using FurtherAI double their productivity, improve submission-to-quote ratios by 15%, reach over 95% accuracy in policy comparisons, and generate proposals 10 times faster than traditional methods.

Why Generic AI Tools Fail Insurance Companies
The insurance industry faces pressure on several fronts, according to FurtherAI. Skilled talent remains in short supply, climate-related risks continue to intensify, and regulators are calling for higher levels of transparency. Many insurers have tested AI tools but found that general-purpose models fall short when handling complex insurance documents, while specialized solutions often solve only a small part of the process."

The technology sector -- led by such companies as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Oracle -- is up even more at 160%. But the semiconductor industry within the tech sector has done even better.
The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX 3.09%) is up a staggering 191% over the last five years. There's a lot more to the fund's success than its exposure to well-known names like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.
These two Motley Fool contributors discuss why the exchange-traded fund (ETF) may still be a good buy even after its massive run-up, as well as reasons to be cautious when approaching red-hot chip stocks at all-time highs.
A role player in the age of AI
Daniel Foelber: The iShares Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to semiconductor designers, manufacturers, and equipment suppliers that are underrepresented by technology sector ETFs and many growth ETFs.

As you can see in the table, the iShares Semiconductor ETF holds meaningful positions in companies that are underrepresented in the iShares U.S. Technology ETF. And while Nvidia and Broadcom make up just shy of 20% of the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF, the other eight semiconductor stocks in the table, including AMD, are absent from the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF.
A common issue with growth ETFs is that they tend to concentrate heavily on a handful of industry-leading names. The iShares Semiconductor ETF doesn't have that issue. It's an ideal choice for investors looking for exposure to the entire semiconductor value chain. Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a lot of attention, but it's just one use case of semiconductors.
For example, Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors are used in many Android devices that run Alphabet's software. AI is Micron's fastest-growing segment, but PC and mobile devices are still the primary use cases for its memory chips. Texas Instruments makes analog and embedded semiconductors that are used in consumer electronics, automotive, healthcare applications, and more.
Fabrication plants operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing include equipment made by companies like Lam Research, Applied Materials, ASML Holding, and KLA. Combined, these five companies make up 22.6% of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. But Taiwan Semi and ASML are absent from the iShares U.S. Technology ETF because they aren't U.S. companies. And Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA combined only make up less than 4% of the iShares U.S. Technology ETF.
In sum, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a great buy for investors looking for an ETF with exposure to the integrated semiconductor value chain rather than just a few popular names.
Even chip lovers should think twice in this economy
Anders Bylund: Buying the iShares Semiconductor ETF is a bold bet on a very specific high-growth industry. I'm usually all for that type of targeted investment. Things are different in the fall of 2025, though.
I still think of the AI boom as a positive market force. It's not a bubble, and the chip stocks that have soared due to great AI-related sales in the last three years have earned their lofty valuations. At the same time, even legendary bull runs usually have a couple of sharp price corrections along the way. That's particularly true when the bulls are racing in the middle of a shaky global economy.
On that note, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is too narrowly focused for my taste in this economy. I mean, even the classic S&P 500 funds look too concentrated since 27.8% of their total value comes from the top five holdings (including semiconductor king Nvidia in the top spot, of course). The iShares Semiconductor ETF takes this focus one step further. It holds just 30 stocks, and the top five names add up to 33.6% of the portfolio's assets under management (AUM).
Again, I'm usually fine with sector-specific ETFs. This just doesn't look like a good time to load up on this richly valued ETF. The ETF trades at a P/E ratio of 37 with a meager 0.7% dividend yield and a lofty beta value of 1.6. In other words, it's both expensive and volatile. I'd much rather put my investable cash to work in a tried-and-true market-wide tracker like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now.
I will surely consider hyper-targeted ETFs like the iShares Semiconductor ETF again someday. The same AI boom will probably still be in full force when I do. I just need the economy to calm down before I can commit to a swaggering AI-chip fund again. For now, I'm more interested in risk management."

Many of these agreements will cover multiple years of hardware deliveries, with values in the $100 billion or greater range.
While Nvidia has so far been the go-to company for AI computing hardware (and still holds a commanding lead in the space), deals for large quantities of Broadcom's custom AI accelerator chips and AMD's GPUs have begun to become more common. This may make it harder for investors to assess which one of these chip designers will be the biggest success story moving forward.
However, all three of these companies are fabless businesses, which means that while they design chips, they don't manufacture them. Instead, they outsource the majority of their chip production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.96%), which is a neutral player in this industry. I think it's one of the best-positioned stocks to benefit from the ongoing increase in spending on AI infrastructure, and investors should scoop up shares of it before 2025 is over in anticipation of what's coming in 2026 and beyond.
TSMC is the semiconductor foundry market leader
There aren't a lot of advanced semiconductor factory operators in the world, mainly because TSMC has been so dominant. It's the leading chip foundry in terms of revenue by far. It also has a wide technological lead, and that lead is about to get even wider.
Currently, the most advanced chips anyone in the world makes are 3-nanometer (nm) chips. That figure reflects the sizes of certain features on the chip, and the smaller those features are, the more transistors can fit on it. Smaller features thus result in more powerful and faster chips.
While a foundry capable of producing 3nm chips is impressive, TSMC never rests on its laurels. Its practice is to be developing processes for its next-generation node even before it's done fully integrating the last one. Later this year, TSMC is slated to begin producing 2nm chips for its clients.
These chips could be a major upgrade for AI companies, as they will consume 25% to 30% less power when configured for the same speed. Given how energy consumption has become a pain point for AI companies, that would be a welcome innovation. It could also drive even more business to TSMC as companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD design chips around this new manufacturing technology.
TSMC's next process node beyond 2nm, which it has dubbed A16, is slated for launch in 2026. Those chips will use 15% to 20% less power than the 2nm chips. Beyond that, its A14 process node chips are expected to use 25% to 30% less power than the 2nm.
TSMC is always innovating, and the chips that deliver these efficiency improvements will generate more revenue for the company. Furthermore, TSMC has locked in its leadership position, making it about as no-brainer of a stock pick as it gets. Moreover, on a valuation basis, the stock is still quite cheap compared to its peers despite its excellent growth and outlook.
TSMC's stock isn't as expensive as its peers
When compared to AMD, Nvidia, and Broadcom, TSMC's growth rate is now one of the best in the group.
Yet its stock trades at a significant discount to those chip designers on a forward price-to-earnings basis.
At 31 times forward earnings, TSMC's stock isn't necessarily cheap, but it's far more reasonable than the other stocks.
I think this combination makes TSMC a much better buy than some of the other AI computing hardware providers. While the other three will battle for chip design supremacy, all three of them will be using TSMC to make their chips. This keeps it positioned nicely to thrive regardless of which designers are in the lead at any given time, and I think it's one of the safer picks in this investing sector."

Service robots powered by Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) chips are working in restaurants and hospitals, handling tasks humans would rather skip. The stock agrees -- shares are up 143% year to date and 852% over the prior 12 months, driven by index inclusion and investor excitement.
But beneath the rally lies the challenge facing any young robotics company: turning pilot programs into steady revenue while managing how fast it spends cash. For investors wondering whether Richtech is a real opportunity or a trap, the answer comes down to execution -- whether the company can roll out robots faster than it burns through money.
Here's a brief overview of this up-and-coming robotics player.
More pilots than profits
Richtech designs and builds service robots -- indoor delivery bots like Matradee, cleaning systems, food-and-beverage automation such as the ADAM beverage robot, and heavy-duty Titan units for industrial tasks. The company also runs Clouffee & Tea, a robotic café that serves as both a business and a showcase.
Recent wins include a pilot program with a top-five U.S. automotive dealership testing robotics in service environments and a $4 million sales agreement through a joint venture with Beijing Tongchuang Technology for deployment across Asia.
Richtech claims over 400 robots operating in the field across the U.S., and the company recently announced plans to integrate Nvidia's Jetson Thor computing platform into its systems, connecting to the AI infrastructure wave.
Earlier this year, Richtech announced its addition to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indexes, bringing passive fund flows and broader visibility. The challenge is scaling revenue. In the nine months ended June 30, 2025, Richtech recorded just $3.6 million in sales.
Still, the market opportunity is real. The total addressable market for service robotics is expected to reach $230 million by the mid-2030s. So, if Richtech executes, revenue could accelerate sharply over the next few years.
Valuation ahead of results
Richtech trades at 7.8 times book value, a high price for a company with minimal sales. The premium shows investors expect robotics adoption to speed up and Richtech to grab a significant share of the market. But robotics hardware businesses face tough economics -- manufacturing costs, service infrastructure, software work, and customer support all erode margins.
At $6.25 (as of Oct. 10, 2025), the stock trades at 63% above the Wall Street average price target of $3.83, meaning the market has raced well ahead of what analysts expect. The industry is full of robotics companies that have proven the concept works but couldn't make it profitable at scale.
Hardware is expensive to build, and turning one-off installations into steady revenue requires not just technology but also service networks, training programs, and ongoing customer support. That's a lot to overcome for any company, especially a relatively young small-cap robotics player.
The automation opportunity
Richtech offers investors front-row exposure to the convergence of labor shortages and AI-driven automation. If it can turn pilots into recurring contracts -- and scale its China joint venture -- revenue could accelerate. Its Nvidia partnership and index visibility lend credibility that many early-stage robotics businesses lack.
The risks, however, are substantial. Sales remain minimal, mounting losses continue, and today's valuation already prices in near-flawless execution in a space where scaling has tripped up many would-be pioneers.
For risk-tolerant investors, Richtech may represent a speculative investment with clear catalysts over the next year. For those seeking profitability or attractive valuations, the case is far weaker. The robots are real -- the business model is still unproven."

finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-11T13:32:00,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" or the Entire S&P 500: What's the Better Option for Growth Investors?","The big names in tech have been doing well of late, but a slowdown could be overdue.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4b9d139ec826a38981202cad07daf0304bc49c0262367d5772fe0c51a1b632a1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-magnificient-seven-or-the-entire-sp-500-whats/,fool.com,200,,"If you're thinking about investing in the stock market today, you may be wondering whether it's a better idea to go with the big names in the ""Magnificent Seven"" or to simply hold a position in the entire S&P 500.
The Magnificent Seven refers to some of the most prominent growth stocks in the world: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Investing in these companies has yielded strong returns for investors over the years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 makes for a more balanced investment overall, as it gives investors broader exposure to the market while still growing over the long term. By having a position in the 500 best stocks rather than just the top seven, there's much more diversification.
Which option should you go with today, if your focus is on long-term growth?
The Magnificent Seven are magnificent, but they could be overdue for a decline
One way you can gain exposure to the Magnificent Seven is by investing in the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS 0.63%). The fund invests in just the Magnificent Seven and, thus, can be an easier option than investing in each stock individually. Since its launch in April 2023, the fund has soundly outperformed the S&P 500, rising by more than 165% while the broader index has achieved gains of around 64%.
Many of the Magnificent Seven have benefited from an uptick in demand due to artificial intelligence (AI) and have been investing heavily in next-gen technologies. However, many investors worry that a bubble has already formed around AI stocks and that spending could slow down, especially if there's a recession on the horizon. If that happens, then these stocks could be susceptible to significant declines.
While these stocks have been flying high of late, back in 2022, when the market was in turmoil due to rising inflation and as investor sentiment was souring on growth stocks, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks fell by more than 26%. The worst-performing stocks were Meta and Tesla, which lost around 65% of their value. That year, the S&P 500 also fell, but at 19%, it was a more modest decline.
The S&P 500 is more diverse, but that doesn't mean it's risk-free
If you want to have exposure to the S&P 500, you can accomplish that by investing in an S&P 500 index fund, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 0.38%). Its low expense ratio of 0.09% makes it a low-cost, no-nonsense way of tracking the S&P 500. Its focus is to simply mirror the index, and it does a great job of that.
The problem, however, is that while the S&P 500 will give you exposure to more stocks than just the seven best stocks in the world, how those leading stocks do will still have a significant impact on the overall stock market. And the Magnificent Seven, because they are so valuable, are also among the SPDR ETF's largest holdings.
But even if you were to go with a more balanced exchange-traded fund, such as the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which has an equal position in all S&P 500 stocks, that may only offer modest protection from a wide-scale sell-off. In 2022, the ETF declined by 13%.
You're always going to face some risk when investing in the stock market, especially if your focus is on growth stocks, which can be particularly volatile.
What's the better strategy for growth investors?
If your priority is growth, then going with the Magnificent Seven can still be the best option moving forward. These stocks will undoubtedly have bad years, but that's the risk that comes with growth stocks. However, given their dominance in tech and AI, the Magnificent Seven still have the potential to vastly outperform the S&P 500 in the long run, and their gains are likely to far outweigh their losses."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-11T13:24:00,Billionaire David Tepper's Biggest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bet (Hint: It's Not Nvidia),Roughly 12.4% of Tepper's $6.5 billion portfolio is invested in this Chinese AI leader.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=77bfc1ceb8e0e4e5af55f81157d1d475b52a7bab7532b30cccaca61f18e60c43,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/billionaire-david-tepper-ai-bet-not-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/billionaire-david-tepper-ai-bet-not-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/billionaire-david-tepper-ai-bet-not-nvidia/,fool.com,200,,"Billionaire David Tepper bought shares of Nvidia hand over fist in the second quarter of 2025. His Appaloosa Management hedge fund increased its stake in the stock by a whopping 483%. However, Nvidia is emphatically not Tepper's biggest artificial intelligence (AI) bet.
Which stock holds that honor? Look across the Pacific. The top AI stock in Appaloosa's portfolio (and the biggest holding, period) is none other than Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding (BABA 1.87%).
Standing above the rest
There's no doubt that Tepper likes AI stocks. Of Appaloosa's top 10 holdings, seven fit squarely in the category -- including Alibaba and Nvidia.
Three of the top 10 are AI hyperscalers. Amazon ranks as Tepper's third-largest position. Google Cloud parent Alphabet is his eighth-largest holding. Microsoft, whose Azure platform trails only Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the cloud market, rounds out the billionaire's top 10.
Meta Platforms and Uber Technologies aren't hyperscalers. However, they're both big players in the AI space. Meta uses AI extensively in its social media platforms. It's also the leader in the AI glasses market. Uber has referred to itself as an ""AI-first"" company for years, with AI integrated throughout its business.
Two other members of Appaloosa's 10 biggest positions have deep AI ties. Vistra and NRG Energy provide electric power that is critical for running many data centers that host AI applications.
Only Alibaba stands at the top of Tepper's portfolio, though. The stock makes up 12.4% of his total holdings. His stake in the Chinese company was valued at $801.5 million as of June 30, 2025.
Why Tepper likes Alibaba
We don't have to guess why Tepper likes Alibaba. He told CNBC in an interview in September 2024 that he would buy ""everything"" in China after the country announced a huge economic stimulus.
That stimulus wasn't the only thing Tepper liked about Chinese stocks, though. He also told CNBC that many Chinese stocks offered attractive valuations and solid growth prospects. Alibaba checked off both boxes.
Granted, Alibaba's valuation isn't as attractive now as it once was. That's because the stock has more than doubled in 2025. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio now stands at 23.3. The multiple was below 10 at the beginning of the year.
What about Alibaba's growth prospects? They might not look too great, judging from recent history. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2% in its quarter ending June 30, 2025. Sure, earnings soared 76%. However, that's mainly because of mark-to-market changes with Alibaba's equity holdings and a gain from the sale of a business.
But Alibaba's future could be better than its past. The company's AI-related product revenue has delivered triple-digit percentage growth for eight consecutive quarters. Its Cloud Intelligence Group revenue jumped 26% year over year in the latest quarter. Alibaba's cloud platform is critical for China to achieve its goal of becoming the global leader in AI by 2030.
Is Alibaba stock a buy now?
It's important to note that Tepper doesn't appear to be as enamored with Alibaba as he once was. He sold over 2 million shares in Q2, reducing his stake in the Chinese company by roughly 23%.
I suspect this move resulted from a desire to take some profits off the table. However, Tepper would have made even more money by holding onto those shares of Alibaba. The stock has gained more since the end of Q2 than it did during the first half of the year.
To be sure, Alibaba isn't as great a bargain as it was several months ago. The stock could also be volatile if the Chinese government takes actions that hurt Alibaba. I don't think Tepper's top AI stock is the best AI stock to buy right now, but it's still a pretty good pick for long-term investors."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-11T11:20:00,Think It's Too Late to Buy Navitas Semiconductor? Here's the 1 Reason Why There's Still Time.,"Navitas has more than doubled in the last year, and investors are wondering if the stock has hit a ceiling. Here's why there's still optimism for the stock.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=46f62c3d5e1ca0c7336144026adff2885c43f19f2c2851a8b1718e3852e48b99,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/think-its-too-late-to-buy-navitas-semiconductor-he/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/think-its-too-late-to-buy-navitas-semiconductor-he/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/think-its-too-late-to-buy-navitas-semiconductor-he/,fool.com,200,,"Data center construction has been accelerating over the past few years; however, the industry has been encountering issues. Among other things, power and water availability for cooling have become major bottlenecks, which opens up demand for companies that can solve these issues.
Enter Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS 20.09%). The pure-play power semiconductor company manufactures gallium nitride and silicon carbide components used in a wide range of applications, from mobile phone chargers to, you guessed it, data centers.
Last year, the stock traded between $2 and $3 per share. Now, it's $7.78, as of the previous close. The stock is also up over 200% since this time last year.
Understandably, some investors are worried that they missed the ride up. But that's not the case. I might even go so far as to say that the best is yet to come.
GaN: Powering the next generation of innovation
At the center of Navitas' offerings are its Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) chips, which offer several advantages over traditional silicon.
According to the company's website, its GaNFast, GaNSense, and SiC chips can deliver up to 40% higher energy efficiency than traditional silicon-based power systems. They also allow for monolithic integration, save space, and have faster switching speeds, which leads to less heat generation, giving the dual benefit of reduced power consumption and lower cooling requirements.
Data centers are hungry, hungry hippos
According to the Department of Energy, data centers consume 10 to 50 times the energy of a typical commercial office building. Meanwhile, a recent study published on the Environmental and Energy Study Institute's website states that large data centers consume up to 5 million gallons of water per day. To put that into perspective, that's about the same consumption as a town with up to 50,000 residents.
So, any measure or technology that can reduce these figures will be worth its weight in gold, as they'd translate to cost savings and environmental benefits. Navitas' GaN tech fits that requirement almost to a T, offering energy and cooling solution savings without compromising on performance.
The Nvidia partnership
Early this year, Navitas announced a partnership with Nvidia, in which the former will provide GaN and SiC power semiconductors to develop a next-generation 800V high-voltage direct current (HVDC) architecture for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.
The stock was trading at $1.91 on the day of the announcement, back on May 21, 2025. Navitas stock jumped to $6.50 on May 27, then reached a new 52-week high of $9.48 a few weeks later. So, it would be fair to say that the market took notice.
But this isn't where the story ends.
What could make Navitas stock grow?
Navitas' partnership with Nvidia can be considered both a proof of concept and a demonstration of trust. If successful, and I haven't seen any indication that it wouldn't be, the deal can serve as a blueprint for scaling GaN and SiC solutions across the broader AI and data center markets.
The company currently estimates that GaN and SiC technologies will be worth $2.6 billion by 2030. And with it at the forefront of the industry, there's an immense potential for it to take a large slice of that pie.
Even better, GaN and SiC power components are also experiencing a rise in demand in EV production, solar infrastructure, industrial applications, and energy storage systems.
And that's what's exciting about the company: If Navitas can scale and execute well, it wouldn't be tapping into just one booming market. It would be positioning itself to grow alongside multiple industries with soaring demands for efficient, high-performance power solutions. That's why I think the Nvidia deal is just the tip of the iceberg.
Currently, Navitas stock is trading at around $8, and over the last 52 weeks, the stock has traded between $1.52 and $9.48, implying above-average volatility in the stock price. A 60-month beta of 3.03 means Navitas stock is likely to move 3 times as much as the S&P 500. The risk is high, but so are the rewards, if it works out.
Verdict
So is it too late to buy Navitas? If you have a long-term time horizon, I don't think so. Again, the company's potential is already in the spotlight, and with today's soaring energy demands, I see a clear runway for Navitas to capture a significant market share.
Still, I'd time my entries during pullbacks or dips. I, for one, am excited for what Navitas has in store."

Investors have reaped massive rewards from this AI stock
Over the past five years, Nvidia shares would've turned a $500 investment into an unbelievable $6,800 today (as of Oct. 7). That's a 1,250% total return. Nvidia is now the most valuable business on Earth, with a colossal market cap of $4.5 trillion.
Nvidia is the top winner in the AI boom
It seems that companies have no desire to let up on the gas pedal, as they are investing copious amounts of capital in AI-related infrastructure. Nvidia has been a direct beneficiary; its customers have insatiable demand for its data center graphics processing units. Nvidia's revenue totaled $46.7 billion in its fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 27). This was a monster increase of 618% compared to exactly five years ago.
Wall Street analysts believe the top line will grow 149% between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2028. That's an exciting outlook. However, if there's any sign of a slowdown in AI spending, Nvidia's stock might experience a rapid sell-off."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-11T09:50:00,The Smartest Growth Stock to Buy With $250 Right Now,"AMD just scored a massive AI processor deal with OpenAI, giving the company a significant tailwind for more growth.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=273b28b4c33b4e86b3920f5d53908920d807f3271ab2258461f72a5de1ddb29c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-smartest-growth-stock-to-buy-with-250-right-no/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-smartest-growth-stock-to-buy-with-250-right-no/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/11/the-smartest-growth-stock-to-buy-with-250-right-no/,fool.com,200,,"If you've got $250 to put toward a stock purchase right now, there are some great options in the fast-growing technology sector. But not all tech stocks are growing at the same pace, and not all are successfully tapping into the massive artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity.
The good news is that even with $250, you can buy a share of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%). Doing so now could turn out to be a very smart move years from now, especially as the company just made a blockbuster deal with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.
Here are a few reasons to buy AMD stock right now.
AMD's deal with OpenAI could be worth billions
OpenAI recently announced a new partnership with AMD to deploy up to 6 gigawatts of the tech company's advanced GPUs for its AI-focused data centers. The first gigawatt of the deal will be delivered in the second half of 2026 and scale up from there as the companies work together to share expertise.
AMD issued a warrant to OpenAI for up to 160 million shares of its stock if certain goals are met. For AMD's part, the deal could be worth ""tens of billions of dollars,"" according to AMD CFO Jean Hu.
One Citi analyst estimates that the revenue potential for AMD could be as high as $90 billion if it reaches the full extent of the deal. That's an impressive amount on its own, but it's even more notable when you consider that AMD's 2024 data center revenue was $12.6 billion. That means the potential revenue from the deal could be many more times the company's current annual data center sales.
Having OpenAI as a customer could spur more deals from other clients
While nothing has been announced about new AMD clients, I think it's important to highlight that the company scoring a big graphics processing unit (GPU) deal with OpenAI could help bring in additional deals with other customers.
AMD has played second fiddle to Nvidia in the AI GPU space for a while. But the OpenAI partnership could convince other tech giants that if AMD's processes are good enough for a leading AI company, they're likely good enough for their AI data center needs as well. Before the OpenAI deal was announced, some estimates put AMD's AI chip market share at just 4% by 2030, compared to Nvidia's 67% in that same year. With the current partnership, I wouldn't be surprised if AMD's future market share ends up being significantly higher.
The OpenAI deal comes as companies are continuing to spend massive sums on their AI data center infrastructure. Nvidia's management estimates this spending could be between $3 trillion to $4 trillion between now and 2030. With AMD snagging such an important customer in OpenAI, some of this data center spending over the next few years could shift a little more to AMD.
AMD is a buy, but keep this in mind
AMD is still far behind Nvidia in the AI-specific GPU market, even with the new OpenAI deal. Nvidia has an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI data center processor market right now. It's unclear how much AMD will be able to carve into that lead. What's more, while the deal could eventually give AMD tens of billions of dollars, it's not guaranteed.
Still, that shouldn't keep you from putting $250 toward AMD stock right now. The company just scored a major partnership with one of the world's leading AI companies, and it could prove to be an important catalyst for the company over the coming years."

It requires a relatively small company that's offering a solution for a wide-ranging problem to capture nearly all of the market share. One of the best recent examples is Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), which turned a $10,000 investment a decade ago into more than $3 million.
Unfortunately, investors don't have a time machine to go back and buy shares of this massive winner before the jump. Still, we can examine what made Nvidia a winning stock pick and apply those observations to another stock. One area that has similar potential to Nvidia is quantum computing. There is obvious overlap here, as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most powerful classical computing units available. With the massive demand for AI computing power, Nvidia experienced monstrous growth.
However, if a viable quantum computing technology is developed, these GPUs could be replaced by quantum computing units, causing a quantum computing pureplay like IonQ (IONQ -5.85%) to exhibit a similar rise over the next decade.
So, can IonQ turn a $10,000 investment into $1 million? Let's take a look.
IonQ's computing accuracy is far better than its peers
IonQ's approach to quantum computing is different than its peers. Instead of the typical superconducting approach, which requires cooling the particle down to near absolute zero, IonQ uses trapped ion technology. The trapped ion approach allows for quantum computing calculations to be done at room temperature, reducing input costs. Additionally, trapped ion computing is inherently more accurate than superconducting quantum computing, and this is apparent in IonQ's world records.
IonQ holds world records in quantum computing accuracy in both one-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelity tests, a measure of how accurate a quantum computer is after a computing process occurs. IonQ's two-qubit gate fidelity is 99.97%, which is significantly higher than other quantum computing companies like Rigetti Computing, which has a 99.5% fidelity in two-qubit gates.
This advantage isn't without its drawbacks. The trapped ion approach has slower processing speeds than superconducting quantum computers, which makes the technology less desirable if the two technologies can achieve similar accuracy levels.
However, if IonQ can develop a commercially viable computer and establish a foothold in the industry faster than its competitors, it will be a significant achievement. Then it may have just enough of a first-mover advantage to win the quantum computing race. There's no guarantee of this, which makes IonQ a risky stock pick.
But if it does, is there enough of a market to provide 100x returns?
IonQ has the potential for massive returns
Right now, IonQ has a market cap of around $20 billion. That means IonQ would be a $2 trillion company if it delivered 100x returns. That would be an incredible rise and would rank IonQ among the largest big tech companies, but is that realistic?
IonQ believes the total addressable market for quantum computing will be around $87 billion by 2035. For reference, Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), which is worth $1.6 trillion, projects to generate around $63.3 billion in sales this fiscal year.
However, IonQ's projection isn't an annual value, so investors need to decrease their expectations. Rigetti Computing offers another market projection, where it believes the annual value for quantum computing providers will be around $15 billion to $30 billion between 2030 and 2040.
If IonQ could capture 100% of the market share ($30 billion in annual revenue), achieve 50% profit margins (similar to Nvidia's), and attain a 50 times earnings multiple (similar to Nvidia's), that would value the stock at $750 billion, well short of the $2 trillion needed to make the stock a 100-bagger. So, if we draw up the best-case scenario for IonQ, it likely won't be enough to achieve the 100x returns we're looking for.
However, this doesn't mean IonQ is a bad investment. Investors just need to adjust their expectations for this quantum computing stock. Furthermore, there are no guarantees that IonQ will have a winning quantum computing approach, and the stock could go to zero if a different company wins the quantum computing arms race. This makes IonQ a high-risk, high-reward stock.
As a result, investors should keep their position sizes relatively small; that way, if it flops, it won't be a big hit to their portfolio. But, if it hits it big and captures a large part of the market, it can still provide impressive returns; just don't expect it to make you a millionaire."

IREN Investment Narrative Recap
To own shares of IREN, you need to believe in its pivot from Bitcoin mining toward powering the AI compute boom, betting that its AI cloud expansion and advanced data centers will deliver dependable, high-margin growth. The latest series of multi-year cloud contracts for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs bolsters the primary short-term catalyst, securing substantial recurring revenues from new AI clients. However, the biggest risk remains the company’s rapid, debt-fueled buildout, which could test cash flows if AI demand growth or pricing wanes; the recent news does not materially reduce that risk at this stage.
Among recent announcements, IREN’s acquisition of 12,400 additional GPUs stands out, coming shortly before these latest customer wins and highlighting the company’s appetite for major capital commitments. These GPU purchases are central to supporting new contracts but also amplify the pressures around leverage and project execution, which tie directly to the short-term catalysts and risks facing the business.
Yet, as margin expansion continues to drive enthusiasm, investors should stay alert for signs that capital intensity...

Broadcom's stock price surged an impressive 91% in the past year, while Nvidia has respectable gains of 45%.
However, another important company that's playing a key role in boosting global AI adoption struggled on the market by comparison. Arm Holdings (ARM 1.33%) stock appreciated just 19% in the past year, which is less than the 30% gains by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index over the same period.
Still, there is reason to believe Arm stock could regain its mojo and skyrocket in the future. Here's why.
The share of Arm chips is set to increase impressively
Arm is a British company that doesn't make any chips of its own. Instead, it is known for providing its intellectual property (IP), architecture, development tools, and associated software to chip designers who use it to design central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and microprocessors.
Arm receives an up-front licensing fee from customers that develop chips using its architecture. Importantly, the company also receives a royalty from the shipment of each chip that's made using its IP. So it can build a strong stream of revenue and profits in the long run if more companies adopt its architecture.
And that's exactly what's expected to happen. Market research firm IDC projects that sales of Arm-based AI accelerator chips deployed in servers could rise from $32 billion in 2024 to $103 billion in 2029. And sales of non-AI Arm-based chips in servers are expected to rise from $14 billion last year to $31 billion in 2029.
So, the size of the Arm-based server processor market is expected to almost triple over the next five years. Broadcom and Nvidia are going to play a key role in driving this market's growth, and both chipmakers have been using Arm's designs to manufacture their AI chips.
Nvidia, for example, has built its Grace server CPU using Arm's IP. The chip giant has integrated this CPU with its popular Blackwell AI GPUs to create a rack-scale platform for AI training and inference. These systems have been in terrific demand from hyperscalers as well as cloud infrastructure providers as they are being deployed to power AI factories.
According to Nvidia, an AI factory is ""a specialized computing infrastructure designed to create value from data by managing the entire AI life cycle, from data ingestion to training, fine-tuning, and high-volume AI inference."" The company says that every enterprise is going to need an AI factory for enabling AI reasoning, and that's a reason why the chip designer believes that another $3 trillion to $4 trillion is likely to be spent on AI infrastructure by 2030.
What this means is that Arm's royalty revenue is likely to keep heading higher in the long run as more AI data center chips are made using its architecture. More importantly, Arm's AI catalyst extends beyond data centers. For instance, the company is also on track to capitalize on the deployment of edge AI devices, another fast-growing space where the share of its processors is expected to increase.
And as the shipments of Arm-based processors increase, it should ideally see an expansion in its margins and profits as well.
Higher royalties should translate into robust earnings growth
The company's earnings growth has substantially exceeded the improvement in its revenue in the past year and a half.
The company's AI-capable Armv9 architecture, which has been witnessing healthy adoption of late thanks to its advanced computing performance and efficiency, reportedly carries double the royalty rate of the prior generation architecture. What's more, the full-stack compute subsystems (CSS) powered by Armv9 carry even higher royalty rates since they are prebuilt templates that help customers accelerate their chip development cycles.
Management said on the previous earnings conference call that its ""first generation of CSS is now in market with five customers and is delivering double the royalty of Armv9."" As such, there is a good chance that Arm will be able to maintain healthy earnings growth in the long run.
Analysts predict a 33% increase in Arm's earnings in the next fiscal year, which will be significantly higher than the 14% average earnings growth that the S&P 500 index is expected to deliver. This trend of higher earnings growth is sustainable considering the points discussed above, which is why investors looking for a growth stock capable of winning big from AI should consider buying Arm before it steps on the gas."

But investors are currently focused on its data center business, where it sells a lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) specifically designed to power artificial intelligence (AI) development.
Nvidia has dominated the AI GPU market for the last few years, but AMD's chips are quickly catching up in terms of processing power, and some of the biggest data center operators are lining up to buy them.
In fact, on Oct. 6, AMD announced a deal with OpenAI to potentially supply the ChatGPT creator with millions of its most advanced GPUs from now through 2030. It's the biggest contract AMD has signed yet for its AI data center chips, based on publicly available information. So should investors pile into its stock right now?
Powerful new chips coming in 2026
AMD released its MI300X data center GPU in December 2023, more than a year after Nvidia launched its then-industry-leading H100, and tech giants like Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms were among its early adopters.
Nvidia continues to lead the data center market with new architectures like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, but AMD is no longer more than a year behind. The company is now shipping its MI350 series GPUs, which were built on its new Compute DNA (CDNA) 4 architecture. Those new chips' performance on inference workloads is a whopping 35 times faster than its prior-generation chips.
According to AMD, the MI355X delivers comparable performance to Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 GPU, but it can process up to 40% more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) in AI inference workloads for the same cost. Therefore, these chips are significantly cheaper to run, which is why data center giant Oracle is building a GPU cluster with more than 130,000 of them.
But all eyes are on AMD's MI400 lineup, which is scheduled for release in 2026. These chips will be paired with specialized software and hardware systems to create Helios, a fully integrated AI data center rack. According to CEO Lisa Su, this will make MI400 GPUs a staggering 10 times more powerful than the MI350s. Depending on what Nvidia rolls out next year, this could be the first time AMD's hardware takes the lead on performance.
OpenAI will start using MI450 GPUs in the second half of 2026, and it will continue buying future generations of AMD chips until it has deployed 6 gigawatts worth of capacity.
The OpenAI deal could supercharge AMD's data center business
AMD generated a record $7.7 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025. Its data center business -- led by AI GPU sales -- was the largest of its four segments, contributing $3.2 billion.
For some perspective, AMD's data center business generated just $1.3 billion in revenue in Q2 2023, when the AI boom was beginning to ramp up. But its 146% growth since then might pale in comparison to what's in the pipeline with the OpenAI deal.
According to semiconductor industry analyst Dr. Ian Cutress of the More Than Moore substack, 6 gigawatts of computing capacity could equate to between 3 million and 6 million MI450 GPUs. He estimates the value of the deal could be around $90 billion, so it could be rocket fuel for AMD's data center business.
There's a huge catch
As part of the deal, OpenAI will have the right to purchase up to 160 million AMD shares at a price of just $0.01 per share, as long as certain milestones are met by 2030:
- The shares will vest in tranches until OpenAI purchases the full 6 gigawatts of computing capacity.
- AMD shares have to meet certain price milestones, ending at $600 per share, which ensures existing shareholders benefit from some upside before they get diluted by the sale of such a large stake in the company.
But if OpenAI receives 160 million AMD shares and sells them at $600 each, it would make a whopping $96 billion. Therefore, assuming all of the terms and milestones of this deal are met, OpenAI's GPU purchases will be largely financed through the dilution of AMD's shareholders.
Of course, anyone who buys AMD stock at today's price of about $211 and holds on will accrue a 184% return if it reaches $600, so they would probably be happy with that outcome irrespective of any dilution.
These circular deals in the AI world are becoming more common because data center infrastructure is so expensive to build. Nvidia recently agreed to invest $100 billion into OpenAI at the same time that OpenAI announced it would buy 10 gigawatts of computing capacity from the chipmaker.
In summary, some of the sales growth AMD and Nvidia will report over the next few years won't necessarily be organic, which might cause some investors to reconsider the valuations they are paying for these stocks.
Nevertheless, the OpenAI deal is huge for AMD, and the terms do offer some protections for shareholders. Therefore, AMD stock is probably a good buy right now for investors who are willing to hold it for the long term."

Its technology is the heart and soul of most of the planet's artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, and AI itself is working to become one of the most revolutionary inventions of all time. That's why so many companies here and abroad continue buying as many of Nvidia's accelerators as Nvidia can sell them.
As could have been predicted, though, the company's near monopoly of the AI hardware market wasn't going to remain unchecked forever. Competitors like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices want to capitalize on the opportunity as well, while governments grow leery of their businesses becoming too dependent on a single supplier of any crucial technology.
That's certainly been the case in China, anyway. While Beijing was tolerant of the use of American-made AI processors when the industry was in its infancy, trade tensions and national security concerns soon prompted a homegrown response. No surprises there.
What's surprising is the organization leading China's AI hardware development effort. That's Alibaba Group (BABA 1.87%). Yes, China's e-commerce giant. Even more surprising is that the e-commerce powerhouse is doing a great job on the AI development front. It may even become the Nvidia of China.
And if that's what's in the cards, investors have much to gain.
Alibaba is leading China's AI charge
The bulk of Alibaba's revenue still comes from e-commerce. More than half of its Q2 2025 sales came from domestic e-commerce operations, while another 15% was driven by its international e-commerce efforts.
Alibaba is more than e-commerce, though. While still relatively small, the company's cloud computing arm -- which includes its nascent AI business -- accounts for another 15% of its total sales, and it was the second quarter's fastest-growing arm with a year-over-year improvement of 26%. If it continues expanding at its current pace, it could eventually become the company's biggest business.
This is possible, too, and even likely, given how far along the company now is on this front.
While Alibaba's been working on its T-Head parallel processing unit for a while now, the version of the processor chip unveiled last month is noteworthy. Namely, it almost perfectly matches the performance specs of Nvidia's flagship H20 GPU meant for export to overseas users. In theory, there is no reason for a Chinese firm to choose the H20 over Alibaba's silicon, particularly given that the latter costs about 40% less.
It's not just hardware, though. The software Alibaba is typically pairing with its AI solutions is at least as marketable as Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem, if not more so. That's because Alibaba is largely building its AI platforms in a way that makes it easy to use open-source software, which tends to be more flexible than closed-off systems like Nvidia's CUDA.
The company has also made clear to all potential customers that its cloud solutions and artificial intelligence solutions are meant to be purchased in tandem, with many of its tools being aimed at its existing cloud customers.
And given the opportunity that Alibaba has just within its home country and its near neighbors, don't be surprised if the company makes an Nvidia-size splash there.
Opportunity awaits
A recent analysis done by JPMorgan speaks volumes. As its researchers bluntly noted in response to China's recent AI development work, ""A sleeping giant awakens."" Quantifying the comment, JPMorgan's analysts believe China's AI industry could be worth $1.4 trillion by 2030, translating into a 52% return on investments made in this tech in the meantime.
This technology will, of course, be sold as a service outside China, but it will also be used within its borders to improve the nation's own business efficiency. Goldman Sachs expects that whatever gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate the nation was going to experience through 2030 will now be improved by 20 to 30 basis points thanks to China's growing adoption of AI.
Alibaba's processors won't be responsible for all of this expansion. Baidu (BIDU 1.33%) is working on its own AI processors, as is Huawei. Baidu's Kunlun processor was technically China's first domestically made AI silicon, in fact.
It's not quite a direct threat to Alibaba's eventual dominance, though. Baidu's Kunlun is a cloud-to-edge AI chip largely meant for the mobile market. It doesn't have the same sort of raw computing power of Alibaba's T-Head, which is expected to be able to handle heavier-duty inference work like figuring out how respond to a new query when there's no specific data or clear history to draw on. China's state-owned telecom outfit, China Unicom, already ordered a bunch of Alibaba's T-Head processors for a new data center in Qinghai, in fact, even before these chips officially entered mass production.
And this may be just a taste of the demand that awaits. Again, JPMorgan expects China's AI market to grow to $1.4 trillion by 2030, while the country's total GDP is a little less than $20 trillion right now.
It's no Nvidia, but it's still a buy, or will be soon enough
Will Alibaba replicate all the success that Nvidia has dished out over the course of the past three years, after the launch of ChatGPT set off an AI arms race? For that matter, will Alibaba stock reproduce the 1,400% gain that Nvidia's stock has made during this stretch?
The answer to both questions is probably not.
Don't lose perspective on the comparison, though. Nvidia was in the right place at the perfect time with the right product, further assisted by the fact that nobody saw such a phenomenon taking shape coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was more than a little bit of luck involved. Even if Alibaba does only half as well from here as Nvidia has, it will still be a fantastic investment.
And yes, it certainly looks like Alibaba could become the Nvidia of China, even if its net opportunity is measurably smaller. Analysts believe the company's top line is not only going to grow all the way through 2027, but also accelerate the whole time.
Just don't tarry too long if you're interested. Although Alibaba stock is a bit overheated right now and arguably due for a dip, it's unlikely that that dip is going to drag this ticker back down to its most recent major low. Take whatever decent-size discount you can get."

The truth, however, is much more complicated. The reality is that the adoption of AI has faced tough comps stemming from blistering early sales, leading to decelerating growth rates. That, combined with the natural ebb and flow of new technology adoption, has sown the seeds of doubt. Yet, taking a step back, the results are still robust by any measure.
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is a prime example. The company pioneered graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that provide the computational horsepower that underpins AI training and inference. Absolute demand for these AI accelerators remains high, but the relative growth rate has moderated.
The company's recent quarterly report was panned by investors, but Nvidia's consistently strong performance reveals a clear path for it to become a charter member of the $7 trillion club. Let's dig into the results and what it will take for the stock to reach these rarified heights.
A semiconductor superstar
By every measure, Nvidia has been a winning stock for investors. Those who were able to buy the stock immediately after the company's initial public offering (IPO) in early 1999 have notched total returns of 469,300%. For context, a $100 investment made 26 years ago is now worth $469,440 (as of this writing). Furthermore, the results aren't consigned to some dusty past. For example, over the past 10 years, the stock has gained 29,450%. That same $100 investment would be worth $29,550. In recent years, its growth has been driven by the onset of the AI boom.
During Nvidia's fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 27), the company delivered record revenue of $46.7 billion, up 56% year over year. This drove adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $1.05, which surged 54%. Fueling the results was robust demand for chips from the company's data center segment, which supplies processors used for data centers, AI, and cloud computing. Data center revenue climbed 56% to $41.1 billion on continuing demand for AI.
To be clear, this is a deceleration from the triple-digit growth Nvidia generated in fiscal 2025, but the initial surge in demand created tough comps. For context, management is guiding for third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, doubling what Nvidia made in all of its fiscal 2023, so demand is still off the charts.
This is likely still just the beginning. CEO Jensen Huang said, ""We see $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by the end of the decade."" Given its position as the market leader and gold standard for data center GPUs, Nvidia is well positioned to profit from these tailwinds.
The path to $7 trillion
Nvidia currently boasts a market cap of roughly $4.7 trillion (as of this writing). This means it will take stock price gains of just 56% to drive its value to $7 trillion. According to Wall Street, Nvidia is on track to generate revenue of roughly $206 billion in fiscal 2026, resulting in a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Nvidia would need to grow its revenue to roughly $308 billion annually to support a $7 trillion market cap.
Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth for Nvidia of 33% in 2027 and 18% in 2028 -- and 26% on average over the coming five years. If the company can surmount those relatively low hurdles, it could reach a $7 trillion market cap as early as 2028. However, Nvidia has a track record of sailing past Wall Street's consensus estimates, so I suspect the company will exceed that benchmark sooner.
Don't take my word for it. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse recently increased his price target on Nvidia to $300, up from $240, while maintaining an overweight (buy) rating. For those keeping score at home, that represents potential upside of 56% for investors, compared to Thursday's closing price, which would bring Nvidia's market cap to $7.3 trillion.
In a note to clients this week, Muse said the AI industry is ""moving at exponential speed."" He goes on to suggest that enterprises and neocloud companies will drive demand for years to come. ""Thus, this is not a bubble, and we are still in the early innings of this investment cycle,"" the analyst wrote. Perhaps as importantly, Muse predicted, we ""do not see a scenario where [Nvidia] does not secure at least 75% of the AI accelerator market over time.""
Finally, Nvidia stock is currently selling for roughly 30 times next year's earnings. While some will point out that's a premium, I'd argue it's an attractive price for the company poised to generate double-digit sales and profit growth through the end of the decade."

So why isn't she richer?,"Lisa Su has overseen a 7,000% rise in AMD shares as CEO, yet she has less than 1% of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's wealth.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ea98c7328012c7e47d13f3600590b0792f1742e8f9a6034d03dd61aaadfa39c0,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.businessinsider.com/amd-stock-lisa-su-wealth-ai-microchips-nvidia-jensen-billionaires-2025-10,https://www.businessinsider.com/amd-stock-lisa-su-wealth-ai-microchips-nvidia-jensen-billionaires-2025-10,https://www.businessinsider.com/amd-stock-lisa-su-wealth-ai-microchips-nvidia-jensen-billionaires-2025-10,businessinsider.com,200,,"- AMD CEO Lisa Su has overseen a 7,000% stock surge, boosting the chipmaker's value to $378 billion.
- Yet Su's net worth is $1.5 billion, a fraction of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's $167 billion fortune.
- Su isn't AMD's founder and only holds a 0.3% stake, which has limited her wealth gains.
Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has built one of the world's most valuable companies and made investors billions — but is barely a billionaire herself.
She has delivered a 70-fold increase in her company's stock price during her 11 years in charge, including a 41% surge this week to fresh highs thanks to its OpenAI partnership. The chipmaker's market value has soared to $378 billion, surpassing Home Depot, Bank of America, and Procter & Gamble.
Yet Su doesn't rank among the world's 500 richest people, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Forbes puts her net worth at $1.5 billion — less than 1% of the $167 billion fortune of her rival and distant cousin, Jensen Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia.
There is one big difference: Huang cofounded Nvidia, while AMD was established in 1969 by a group of engineers who had left Fairchild Semiconductor. One of them, Jerry Sanders, served as CEO until 2002.
AMD filings show Su has amassed about 4.7 million shares or a 0.3% stake, worth about $1.1 billion based on the company's stock price ahead of Friday's market open. Her compensation, including salary, bonuses, and stock options, totaled around $31 million last year, per the filings.
Su's small ownership stake is the main reason she's not worth more.
For comparison, Huang still owns close to a 4% stake in Nvidia, which is worth upward of $160 billion despite significant dilution over the years. Nvidia is also about 12 times larger than AMD, with an unmatched $4.7 trillion market capitalization.
Oracle's $847 billion market value is a little over double AMD's figure, but cofounder Larry Ellison owns nearly 41% of the enterprise-software giant — a roughly $350 billion stake that makes him the world's second-wealthiest man after Elon Musk on both Bloomberg and Forbes' rich lists.
The difference in size between Su's fortune and theirs underscores that founding a company, and retaining a large stake in it, is the most common path to enormous wealth.
Seven of the top 10 people on Bloomberg's list are founders, and another two, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett, shaped their companies, Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway, in their respective images as much as any founder.
Steve Ballmer, who joined Microsoft as Bill Gates' assistant in 1980 and later became CEO, is a rare exception because he parlayed a quirk in his contract into a sizable equity stake.
AMD stock has almost doubled this year as investors buy into Su's vision of building an AI hardware, software, and services ecosystem.
Su isn't likely to crack the top 10 of the rich list soon, but if her shares keep soaring, she could be worth billions more."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-10T21:51:50,"Why is Nvidia, the world’s leading AI chipmaker, entangled in the US-China trade war?",Tech giant Nvidia has been caught in the middle of international trade tensions as the standoff between the United States and China continues to escalate.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=668c3d508f3a309e5c504a38b8b6261aca2cf0c9a9af3158fe101e5faf22c66f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/10/business/nvidia-china-ai-trade,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/business/nvidia-china-ai-trade,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/business/nvidia-china-ai-trade,cnn.com,200,,"Tech giant Nvidia is the world’s leading artificial-intelligence chipmaker, but the company’s success has also put it in the crossfire of trade tensions.
The Santa Clara, California-based company, which is approaching a market capitalization of $5 trillion, has seen rapid growth due to its chips, which are predominantly used to power massive data centers used by other tech firms, like OpenAI, the creator of popular AI chatbot ChatGPT.
But Nvidia’s leading technology has been used as a negotiating tool in President Donald Trump’s trade spat with China, which was kickstarted by Trump’s sweeping tariffs in April and has escalated over rare earth mineral disputes.
It’s further complicated Nvidia’s relationship with China, where it was doing roughly 25% of its graphics processing unit sales, estimates Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. Nvidia’s popularity has also embroiled the company in a steep controversy for potentially allowing China to skirt around export restrictions as trade tensions continue.
“Nvidia has gotten caught in the middle of two very important things: a trade dispute between China and the United States … but more importantly, AI has become a matter of national security,” Luria said.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has argued that restricting sales of American AI chips will ultimately enable Chinese developers to create their own alternatives.
Who is Jensen Huang?
Huang, 62, was born in Taiwan, and at age 9 was sent by his parents to live in Tacoma, Washington. In 1993, the Oregon State and Stanford University grad co-founded Nvidia, which started as a graphics-based processing company.
Huang — who is worth $167 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — has been treated as a rockstar in Taiwan for his success in the AI chips race, and previously worked as a microprocessor designer at now-competitor AMD.
“It’s really unusual to have somebody who can go from starting what was at the time a very small tech startup and grow it to the extraordinary level of success that Nvidia has grown to,” John Villasenor, a nonresident senior fellow at Brookings Institution and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said of Huang.
What is Nvidia’s role in the AI chips race?
Nvidia powers the data centers that support AI technology and has been the go-to provider of those chips.
Nvidia essentially created the architecture for anyone who develops AI, leading to a surge in demand for its technology, according to Arun Sundararajan, a professor of technology, operations and statistics at NYU Stern School of Business.
The company said in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and provide it with data center chips as soon as late 2026.
Nvidia is competing with AMD for deals with partners like OpenAI, which said Monday it would use 6 gigawatts of AMD chips to power OpenAI’s data centers.
“The competition has undeniably arrived. Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world’s most popular commercial applications and open-source models. We’ll continue to work to earn the trust and support of mainstream developers everywhere,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNN.
Why is Nvidia involved in US-China trade tensions?
In recent years, the US government has sought to restrict Chinese access to American technology to slow Beijing’s progress on AI, thus allowing the United States to take the lead. Trump continued the trend in April, when he restricted China’s access to chips, including Nvidia’s H20, as part of his trade war.
Such restrictions on the sale of chips offended China, Luria said, and ultimately led to Beijing limiting the purchase of chips to their companies.
But the White House recently reversed their position.
“You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in July.
Trump in August greenlit sales of chips to China in an agreement with US chipmakers. Nvidia and AMD, Trump said, would give 15% of revenue from China sales to the US in exchange for export licenses. That includes giving China access to Nvidia’s H20 chips, which were released in 2024 to maintain access to the Chinese market following strict export controls.
But Beijing seemed unimpressed and trade tensions have only escalated since the start of a tit-for-tat trade war in April.
China has since increased import restrictions on US chips, including Nvidia’s processors. Trump said Friday on Truth Social that he would impose a 100% tariff on China “over and above any Tariff they are currently paying” beginning November 1 over export controls on rare earth minerals.
“Where this all gets resolved is unclear,” Luria said, because China believes “that stopping the sale of Nvidia chips into China creates some leverage on the US in the negotiation.”
Is Nvidia skirting international rules?
Commerce Department officials are investigating whether Nvidia’s customer, Singapore-based Megaspeed, is helping China sidestep export restrictions for access to Nvidia’s tech, according to a report from the New York Times. CNN has not independently verified the Times’ reporting.
“We have engaged with the U.S. government regarding Megaspeed, performed our own inquiry, and have not identified any reason to believe products have been diverted. NVIDIA visited multiple Megaspeed sites yet again earlier this week and confirmed what we previously observed—Megaspeed is running a small commercial cloud, like many other companies throughout the world, as allowed by U.S. export control rules. The Administration’s AI Action plan rightly encourages businesses worldwide to embrace U.S. standards and U.S. leadership, benefitting national and economic security,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNN.
And Nvidia’s H20 chips are widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood.
China could also gain access to the chips on the black market, since another country could buy Nvidia’s chips and resell them to China, Sundararajan said.
“The bigger issue is if we push harder to restrict global access to Nvidia’s products, can that be counterproductive? Because it forces these countries to speed up their own pace of innovation,” Sundararajan said.

This philosophy not only allows investors to capitalize on disruptive and secular growth trends but also helps them benefit from the power of compounding.
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is a classic example of what a smart growth stock can do for your portfolio. Anyone who bought just $200 worth of this semiconductor stock five years ago is now sitting on massive gains, as that investment is now worth $2,700. Nvidia is still a solid investment despite such outstanding growth in recent years.
Shares of Nvidia are now trading under $200 each (at around $185 as of this writing), thanks to the stock splits executed by the company in recent years. So if you have just $200 in investible cash, buying Nvidia with that money could turn out to be a smart move. Let's look at the reasons why.
Nvidia's AI-fueled growth isn't going to stop anytime soon
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the single most important catalyst for Nvidia's surge. As the world was wowed by the abilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) were working behind the scenes to train the large language model (LLM) powering the chatbot.
Since then, LLMs have been deployed for building not just chatbots, but also for other tasks such as language translation, text generation, text summarization, image generation, writing code, automating workflows, and content creation, among other things. Businesses and governments are using the help of AI models to improve their efficiency and productivity.
Nvidia is at the center of this AI revolution because its GPUs have been the go-to choice for hyperscalers and cloud infrastructure providers looking to tackle AI workloads. This is evident from Nvidia's commanding share of 92% in AI data center GPUs. Of course, competition from the likes of Broadcom and AMD could be a thorn in Nvidia's side in the future, but there is ample opportunity for all the players in the AI chip market to make a lot of money in the coming years.
Citigroup estimates that AI infrastructure spending by major technology companies is likely to exceed $2.8 trillion through 2029, with half of that spending expected to take place in the U.S. itself. That's a big jump from the investment bank's earlier forecast of $2.3 trillion. This massive spending is going to be fueled by the growth in AI compute demand.
The enterprise and sovereign demand for AI compute has been robust. According to a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, workers using generative AI applications are 33% more productive each hour.
Cloud computing capacity available at major hyperscalers and other infrastructure providers is greatly outpaced by demand. Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others are sitting on massive revenue backlogs of more than $1 trillion. So it can be safely said that AI spending over the next four years has the potential to hit Citigroup's $2.8 trillion mark.
Nvidia is expected to generate $206.4 billion in revenue in the current fiscal year, an increase of 58% from the previous year. So the company still has a lot of room for growth considering that the annual AI spending over the next five years is likely to clock a run rate of $560 billion, according to Citigroup's estimates. Analysts have therefore become more bullish about Nvidia's potential growth in the coming fiscal years.
The valuation makes the stock a no-brainer buy
The above chart tells us that Nvidia can keep growing at healthy rates despite having already achieved a high revenue base. Not surprisingly, the company's bottom-line growth is expected to exceed the broader market's.
For instance, Nvidia's projected earnings growth rates of 50% for the current fiscal year and 41% for the next fiscal year are much higher than the S&P 500 index's expected earnings growth rates of 9% and 14%, respectively. Given that Nvidia is now trading at 30 times forward earnings, investors are getting a good deal on this AI stock. It is available at a slight discount to the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 33.
All this makes Nvidia a smart growth stock to buy with just $200, as this company has the potential to witness a significant jump in its market cap over the next five years that could help multiply that investment substantially."

BOTHELL, WASHINGTON / ACCESS Newswire / October 10, 2025 / ReelTime Media, Inc. (OTCID:RLTR) today highlighted a striking market divergence as its stock continued to rise while many of the world's largest AI companies fell sharply. Investor confidence in ReelTime's flagship ""Reel Intelligence"" (RI) platform propelled ReelTime higher, even as global tensions and tariff anxieties triggered losses across the broader AI sector.
ReelTime's stock resilience stems from the unique independence of its RI platform. Unlike conventional AI systems that rely on specialized chips and massive data centers, RI is fundamentally chip-agnostic and globally distributed, meaning it is not tethered to any single hardware supplier, cloud cluster, or country's infrastructure. This strategic advantage has insulated ReelTime from the geopolitical headwinds currently battering its peers.

""While others scramble to navigate chip shortages, tariffs, and political crosswinds, RI thrives because it lives throughout the connected world,"" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of ReelTime Media. ""RI doesn't rely on a single chipset or server farm. It was built to operate everywhere, all at once, making it resilient where others are vulnerable.""
Industry analysts have taken note of RI's unconventional design and performance. In an update earlier this year, experts described RI as ""smarter, more capable, higher quality, more efficient, and significantly more environmentally friendly"" than any other AI on the market. Since its public launch in March, RI has surpassed industry-leading AI systems across multiple domains, from language fluency to image generation, music composition, and even 4K video creation, all while using only a fraction of the computing resources required by traditional models. These breakthroughs, achieved without the massive server farms or costly GPU clusters of rival platforms, reinforce why investors see ReelTime's technology as fundamentally different. Today's market action underscores that RI's hardware-agnostic, globally distributed approach is proving its value, as ReelTime extends its rally in the face of challenges that sent many big-tech AI stocks sinking.
Why Reel Intelligence (RI) Is Superior to Traditional AI Platforms
-
All-in-One Creativity: RI handles an array of tasks that typically require multiple AI tools, from natively generating 4K cinematic video and photorealistic images to composing Grammy-eligible music with vocals and even writing or debugging software code. This comprehensive capability outstrips siloed platforms that specialize in only text, images or code, positioning RI as a one-stop creative intelligence solution.
-
Self-Learning & Adaptive: RI continuously improves itself via proprietary real-time feedback loops, allowing it to evolve faster than competing models that wait for manual retraining. In practical terms, RI gets smarter and faster with each interaction, whereas traditional AIs remain static between big updates. This adaptive learning gives RI a growing performance edge over time.
-
Independent of Data Centers: Dubbed the ""greenest AI on Earth,"" RI runs without energy-draining centralized servers. Its lightweight, distributed architecture leverages existing connected devices for processing power instead of power-hungry data centers. By eliminating bulky server farms, RI dramatically reduces infrastructure costs and carbon footprint, all while delivering high-end AI functionality to users.
-
Globally Distributed Power: Rather than hinging on any single chipset or cloud facility, RI scales across a worldwide network of nodes, dynamically allocating work around the globe for maximum efficiency. This dispersed model means RI remains highly reliable and speedy even if one region faces hardware shortages or internet restrictions. In short, RI can tap computing resources ""everywhere"" - providing unparalleled resilience and uptime."

Palantir (PLTR -0.11%), with its artificial intelligence platform, has seen its stock rise by over 2,000% in three years. Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), the poster child for AI chipmakers, is up by more than 1,300% in the same period. And neo-cloud providers like Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%) and CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) have soared by triple-digit percentages since their IPOs.
If you had invested $10,000 in any one of these big winners ahead of their surges, you'd be well on the way to having a million-dollar holding in the long term, even if they produce merely average returns from here on out. But identifying which companies will be a new technology's big winners ahead of time is difficult. If it were easy, everyone would be rich.
If you'd like to profit from the ongoing growth of AI, you could put a little bit of money into a lot of different AI stocks, or you could buy an ETF that specializes in finding generative AI opportunities. That's what the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (CHAT 1.67%) does. Investors who are still trying to strike it rich with generative AI stocks may find it a compelling alternative to attempting to pick individual AI stocks themselves.
Looking under the hood
The Roundhill team is focused on building a portfolio of companies that are actively involved in the advancement of generative AI. Its holdings include companies developing their own large language models and generative AI tools, companies providing key infrastructure for training and inference, and software companies commercializing generative AI applications.
Since it's an ETF, investors can see exactly what the fund holds. Here are the largest holdings in the portfolio as of this writing.
- Nvidia
- Alphabet
- Oracle
- Microsoft
- Meta Platforms
- Broadcom
- Tencent Holdings
- Alibaba Group Holdings
- ARM Holdings
- Amazon
There aren't a lot of surprises in the list. Perhaps the biggest standout is Arm, which is relatively small compared to the other tech giants with large weightings in the portfolio. Still, its market cap comes in at a healthy $165 billion.
In total, the ETF holds 40 stocks and several currency hedges for foreign-issued shares as of this writing. That diversification gives it a good chance of holding a few companies that will be big winners from here, which may be all it takes to produce market-beating returns. Indeed, the portfolio includes some of the best-performing stocks of 2025, including Palantir.
Since its inception in 2023, the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF has returned an impressive 148% compared to a 66% total return from the S&P 500. And that's factoring in the drag of the ETF's 0.75% expense ratio.
Could $10,000 invested make you a millionaire?
In order to turn $10,000 into $1 million, the ETF would have to increase in value 100-fold. That may be difficult, considering the current sizes of its top holdings.
Nearly one-third of the portfolio is invested in companies with market caps exceeding $1 trillion, and the larger a company becomes, the more raw growth it takes to move the needle on its size on a percentage basis. For Nvidia to grow by even 25% now would be the equivalent of creating a whole new trillion-dollar business. And while such growth is certainly possible for some of those megacap companies, there's still a finite amount of money in the global economy.
Meanwhile, there are only a handful of relatively small businesses in the ETF's portfolio that could reasonably be expected to multiply in size significantly.
Additionally, many stocks in the portfolio have high valuations. Palantir shares trade for a forward P/E ratio of 280. Nebius trades for 54 times expected sales. Even CoreWeave's sales multiple of 12.5 looks expensive, given its reliance on debt to continue growing. That said, some of the best performers of the last few years also looked expensive a few years ago (including Palantir and Nvidia). Still, the expected return of stocks with such high valuations isn't going to be as high as those offering more compelling values.
As such, it seems unlikely the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF will produce returns strong enough to turn $10,000 into $1 million over a reasonable time frame. That doesn't mean that it's not worth owning. For investors looking to gain exposure to the generative AI trend without going all in on one or two stocks, buying the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF is a simple way to do that."

In a statement, SAMR said Qualcomm’s acquisition is suspected of violating the country’s anti-monopoly laws, though it didn’t provide any further details on what element of the deal broke monopoly laws or how.
In a statement, a Qualcomm spokesperson said, “We are fully cooperating with SAMR in this matter. Qualcomm is committed to supporting the development and growth of our customers and partners.” Qualcomm stock was down more than 4% in midday trade.
The announcement comes the same day President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that the Chinese government is seeking to tighten its control over rare earth minerals. Trump went on to threaten a “massive increase” in tariffs on Chinese goods.
Trump also said there’s no longer any reason for him to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping as the two leaders initially planned at the APEC Summit in South Korea.
Like Qualcomm, SAMR has also accused AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) of violating China’s anti-monopoly laws. In September, the regulator announced that it would conduct further investigations into the deal. Nvidia has denied any wrongdoing.
China has also called on companies to avoid using Nvidia’s products, and in 2024, a state agency called for an investigation into Intel’s chips for what China’s Cyberspace Security Association claimed were ""frequent vulnerabilities and high failure rates.""
The US and China are locked in a months-long trade fight that has seen the countries raise tariffs on shipments of their respective goods by more than 120% before lowering them again.

Technology and rare earth minerals are just two of the biggest pawns in the back-and-forth struggle between the two nations. Tech companies have had to maneuver their relationships with the countries, placating them to ensure they can continue to sell their products into both markets.
In the US, companies like Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM) have committed to building new facilities or otherwise sourcing components from American factories in an effort to win Trump’s approval and avoid potentially onerous tariffs.
Qualcomm relies on TSMC to build its chips, some of which come from the company’s manufacturing plants in Arizona."

A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after President Donald Trump threatened to impose 'massive' new tariffs on Chinese goods.
President Donald Trump's threat of ""massive"" new tariffs on Chinese goods sent shockwaves through the market, directly impacting chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD. Trump noted China's tightening controls on rare earth metals, which are vital components in many technology products from electric vehicles to defense systems. Compounding the pressure, Beijing has reportedly initiated its own countermeasures. These include tightening export controls on crucial raw materials such as rare earths and launching an antimonopoly investigation into chip giant Qualcomm.
Furthermore, reports indicate that Chinese customs officials are now conducting stringent checks on semiconductor shipments arriving at ports, specifically targeting certain high-end chips. This escalating back-and-forth creates significant uncertainty for the semiconductor industry, which relies heavily on complex global supply chains and access to international markets, leading to a broad sell-off across the sector.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Magnachip’s shares are very volatile and have had 27 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock dropped 2.8% as reports revealed tech giant Oracle is generating lower-than-expected margins in its cloud business and losing money on Nvidia chip rentals.
The news caused Oracle's shares to tumble over 5% and sparked a wider tech sell-off, pulling the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down. Investors are growing concerned about the actual strength and profitability of artificial intelligence demand, which has been a primary driver of the market's recent record-breaking run. Oracle's struggles suggest that the massive capital investments required for AI, such as acquiring expensive chips, may not be translating into immediate or guaranteed profits. This has led to broader anxiety that the AI boom's financial returns might be less certain than previously anticipated, causing traders to pull back from the sector."

- Nvidia shares hovered near their all-time highs Friday after setting a string of records this week on optimism about artificial intelligence demand.
- The shares recently broke out from a flag pattern on Thursday, signaling potential upside above the stock’s recent trading range.
- The measured move technique forecasts a price target of $204, while bars pattern analysis projects a potential move up to $255.
- Investors should watch major support levels on Nvidia's chart around $184 and $165.
Nvidia (NVDA) shares hovered near their all-time highs Friday after setting a string of records earlier this week on optimism about the artificial intelligence trade.
The AI chipmaker's stock climbed nearly 2% Friday to a fresh intraday high before pulling back in recent trading, after setting closing records Thursday and Wednesday. CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC Wednesday that AI demand has grown ""substantially"" in the last six months, and that he believes the AI boom is still in its early stages, leaving further room for growth. Sentiment for the stock also got a boost as Nvidia supplier TSMC (TSM) on Thursday posted a 30% year-over-year jump in third-quarter revenue.
Nvidia shares have surged nearly 40% since the start of the year, powering broader stock market gains and sending the company’s market value above $4 trillion, making it the first company in the world to achieve that feat. The stock continues to attract buying interest as its big tech customers spend billions to ramp up their AI capacity.
Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify major price levels worth watching out for.
Flag Pattern Breakout
Nvidia shares broke out from a flag pattern on Thursday, signaling potential upside above the stock’s recent trading range.
Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum. The indicator also sits well below its June and July peaks, suggesting the stock has further room to trend upwards. Looking ahead, investors could watch for rising trading volume, which would point to institutional accumulation of the chipmaker's stock.
Let’s apply technical analysis to Nvidia’s chart to arrive at two possible upside price targets worth watching, and also identify several major support levels to monitor during future retracements.
Measured Move Price Target
To project a price target using the measured move technique, investors would calculate the distance between the recent trading range’s two trendlines and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we could add $20 to $184, which would produce a target of $204, about 6% above Thursday’s closing price.
Bars Pattern Analysis Price Target
Investors can also arrive at a higher price target using bars pattern analysis. When applying this to Nvidia’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock’s strong uptrend from May to July and reposition them from the flag pattern’s breakout point. This generates a target of around $255, a move that implies 32% upside from yesterday’s close. We selected this prior trend as it followed an earlier comparable flag on the chart, possibly offering clues as to how a new move higher could take shape.
Major Support Levels to Monitor
During retracements in the stock, investors should keep tabs on the $184 level. Nvidia bulls would likely defend this location near the trading range’s upper trendline, potentially turning it from prior resistance into future support.
Selling below this major level opens the door for a rest of lower support around $165. Investors could seek entry points in this region near several lows that formed on the chart in July and September, which also mark the trading range's lower trendline.

On air, Dave Ramsey and his co‑host, John Delony, unpacked the emotional letter. Ramsey didn't hesitate.
""Legally, it's your money, period. No court's even going to look at this. They'd dismiss it in 30 seconds,"" he said. ""But if you truly believe it was a mistake — like an envelope mailed to the wrong address — then, morally, you give it to them.""
Ramsey walked through two possibilities. If the parents simply forgot to update their paperwork when the kids became adults, then the aunt could hand over the funds knowing she'd done the right thing. But if the couple intentionally named her — maybe because they trusted her more than their children — that's a different story. ""They're not entitled to it just because they're kin,"" he said. ""If Mom and Dad's intent was clear, you don't owe them anything.""

That's when Delony offered what he called Option 3. ""Maybe these kids are hurting,"" he said. ""They've been through a lot. Maybe their parents knew there'd be immaturity and wanted their aunt to make wise choices with this money — to love them through it.""
Ramsey nodded, suggesting that if the parents had wanted their sister to act as a caretaker of the funds, she could ""dole it out slowly, like a trust."" College tuition? Sure. Rent for an apartment? Maybe not. ""You decide what your sister and brother‑in‑law would've done,"" he told her.
Delony circled back a few minutes later, putting the dilemma in personal terms: What if it were his own family? ""If I had a niece and nephew — one doing great, one struggling — I might say, ‘Yes for tuition, but no for your next life mistake. I'll take care of you like your parents would have.'"" Ramsey agreed: ""That's loving your family well, even if they don't like it."""

“Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary suggests that you should not invest more than 5% of your portfolio in Bitcoin and more than 20% in the entire cryptocurrency sector.
“Don’t put the farm onto any one stock,” O’Leary said during a Wired Q&A released on Oct. 3. “In other words, don’t bet everything ever. My diversification strategy was taught to me by my mother. Never more than 20% in anyone’s sector, including crypto. Never more than 5% in any one’s stock or bond.”

O’Leary’s remarks came in response to a question from a viewer about the rationale for investing in Bitcoin. He said people did not have to invest in the leading digital asset. Still, he explained that he was an investor because he believed in the asset and digital payments.
“I do invest in Bitcoin ’cause I’m a believer in crypto and a believer in digital payment systems over time,” he said. “We have 11 sectors in the S&P, including real estate, which was recently added; it’s the most recent. Crypto is not yet a sector, but I believe it’ll become the 12th.”
Meanwhile, O’Leary’s cryptocurrency investment strategy also includes infrastructure plays. In May, he told CoinDesk that he held Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock.
“No matter what crypto is doing, up or down, the exchange is making money because it’s the infrastructure,” he said at the time.

O’Leary also said that he preferred stablecoins for yields over bank deposits. All of these, however, fall within his 20% allocation for the cryptocurrency sector. At the time, he told CoinDesk that he had 19% exposure to cryptocurrencies, just below the threshold.
Meanwhile, O’Leary last month urged investors seeking direct cryptocurrency exposure to stick to Bitcoin and Ethereum, warning against “irrelevant” tokens.
“You could own Bitcoin and Ethereum, and you would capture more than 90% of the alpha or price volatility of the entire crypto market,” he said.

University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment After the Open
Later on this morning, a preliminary Consumer Sentiment survey from the University of Michigan is due out. The October print is expected to be the third-straight down to 53.5 from 55.1 in September, though still off the 52.2 levels in April and May. The tariff environment is far less nebulous than it was back in the spring, but still uncertain how it will impact consumer prices in the medium-term.
Last month, inflation expectations among consumers in this survey actually ticked down a tad, perhaps indicating tariff realities are not as painful as some may have anticipated. These types of sub-headline numbers will be interesting to compare when today’s report comes out at 10am ET.
What to Expect from the Stock Market Today & Next Week
Aside from this University of Michigan survey, we were expected to also receive Monthly U.S. Federal Budget figures for September, but those will be mothballed while the federal government shutdown continues through Week 2. Next week was supposed to have provided Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) results, but they won’t either without an agreement on Congress’ budget resolution.

This aggressive investment underscores the company’s determination to expand its cloud infrastructure footprint and strengthen its position as a global cloud powerhouse. The bulk of the spending is directed toward revenue-generating equipment in new data centers, supporting Oracle’s surging Remaining Performance Obligations, which are expected to exceed $500 billion soon.
The plan includes building 37 new multi-cloud data centers, bringing Oracle’s total to 71 worldwide, with new sites under development in Texas and New Mexico. This expansion aims to meet rising demand from enterprise clients and hyperscaler partners, including OpenAI, NVIDIA, AMD and Meta, all of which rely heavily on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for AI workloads. OCI revenues grew 55% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, and management expects it to rise 77% this year to $18 billion, with long-term projections targeting $144 billion by 2030.
However, this massive capital spending is putting pressure on free cash flow and margins, with a negative $362 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, and Oracle has taken on additional debt to finance expansion. The Zacks model forecasts free cash flow to be negative $380.7 million throughout fiscal 2026, which would create liquidity concerns if growth slows.
Still, Oracle’s CapEx supports its expanding AI and multi-cloud ecosystem, powering products like Fusion and NetSuite with embedded AI capabilities. With the Zacks model predicting 16.5% revenue growth in fiscal 2026, the company's strategic bet looks set to pay off.
Oracle Faces Fierce Rivals in AI CapEx Race
Microsoft MSFT is accelerating its AI-driven cloud expansion with record CapEx. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, Microsoft spent over $24 billion, and it plans another $30 billion for first-quarter fiscal 2026 alone. Microsoft’s massive investments in data centers, AI chips and cloud infrastructure strengthen its leadership in Azure and enterprise software while positioning Microsoft at the forefront of global AI growth.
Amazon AMZN via AWS is intensifying its AI and cloud dominance with massive CapEx investments. In the second quarter of 2025, Amazon’s spending hit $31.4 billion, with annual investments projected to exceed $118 billion. Amazon’s unmatched scale, in-house AI chip innovation and vast data center network give it a powerful edge over Oracle. With AWS’ global reach and pricing strength, Amazon continues to reinforce its leadership in cloud and AI infrastructure."

Citigroup Inc.’s basket of 46 stocks most favored by non-professional investors, which includes companies like SoFi Technologies Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc., is up 30% since the start of September, beating the S&P 500 Index’s 4.3% gain. Meanwhile, retail trading volume has increased to an all-time-high, the bank’s equity trading desk wrote in a research note Tuesday.
“It’s been our contention for quite some time that the stock market gains have been largely propelled by a combination of FOMO and MOMO,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “At this point, every dip is perceived as a buying opportunity, and uptrends are something to be chased.”
Citigroup’s figures on trading activity defied weak October seasonality, with volume rising to the highest since the bank started tracking the data in 2018.
Data from other banks shows a big jump in volume as well. From Oct. 2 through the close of trading on Oct. 8, retail investors accelerated their weekly purchases of stocks to $7 billion, an increase from the of $5.3 billion per week over the past two months, JPMorgan equity and quant strategist Arun Jain wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.
The buying spree coincided with renewed optimism around artificial intelligence stocks, fueled by a series of corporate deals, bets on interest-rate cuts and expectations for resilient earnings. Indeed, AI-linked names remain the epicenter of retail enthusiasm. Dell Technologies Inc. drew its largest inflow in nearly five months, while members of the Magnificent Seven such as Tesla Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., but excluding Apple Inc., saw sizable buying, Jain wrote.
Risk-on sentiment is present in the options market as well. Over the last seven trading sessions, retail gamma supply — a gauge of how much investors are selling options and collecting premiums on short-dated calls and puts — jumped to an all-time high of $93 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The surge was led by growth-oriented names, with technology and communications stocks seeing the steepest pickup."

Cantor’s $300 price hike and Morgan Stanley’s trillion-dollar forecast tell the same story: Nvidia is still running up the score in AI’s early innings

Wall Street has a new national pastime: seeing how many innings the AI boom can have.
Suggested Reading
Cantor Fitzgerald just raised its price target on Nvidia to $300 (from $240), calling the company only “midgame” in the global race to build AI infrastructure, according to sites that saw the note. This is the most bullish call yet on a stock that’s already rewritten the record books — and a reminder that even trillion-dollar valuations haven’t satisfied investors’ appetite for GPUs.
Related Content
The firm’s analysts reportedly expect Nvidia to post roughly $8 in earnings per share by 2026 and $11 by 2027, arguing that the chipmaker’s dominance in data centers, sovereign AI projects, and hyperscale partnerships has made its hardware less a product than a utility. The thinking is simple: Even if the hype fades, the infrastructure spending won’t.
According to Yahoo, analyst C.J. Muse, who holds an Overweight rating on the stock, said the company is still in the early stages of a multitrillion-dollar AI build-out that’s reshaping global infrastructure. He reportedly expects Nvidia to keep about 75% of the AI-accelerator market to itself, with a growth runway that stretches comfortably into the next decade.
Over at Morgan Stanley, analysts reportedly came away from a meeting with Nvidia executives equally convinced that the runway is longer than it looks. In a client note viewed by others, the firm noted that most of Nvidia’s growth so far has come from cloud providers swapping CPUs for GPUs — a migration that’s still underway. The next wave, analysts said, will come from industries that haven’t yet gone through that shift: health care, legal services, industrial automation, and (eventually) robotics.
And that’s where the story gets bigger. Morgan Stanley reportedly estimates the total market for AI infrastructure could reach $3–5 trillion by 2030, as “new model categories” emerge to automate the physical world. That’s a bullish read not just on Nvidia, but on the idea that compute power itself is becoming the new capital stock.
Both firms reportedly waved off concerns about Nvidia’s vendor-financing push — the practice of helping partners pay for huge GPU orders — as a form of demand padding. Instead, they both essentially called it an accelerant: a way to speed up data-center capacity so new use cases can follow. In that line of thinking, the company’s tie-ups with CoreWeave and the U.K.’s sovereign investment fund are less about subsidies than about ensuring there’s always more compute to sell.
The chatter around Nvidia’s dominance can’t avoid AMD’s new deal with OpenAI. Morgan Stanley called Nvidia’s “full-stack” approach — its chips, software, and networking — the kind of ecosystem rivals can’t easily duplicate. Everyone else, they said, is still building around Nvidia, not against it.
Between Cantor’s record-high price target and Morgan Stanley’s insistence that the AI boom isn’t close to maturity, Nvidia has become Wall Street’s favorite Rorschach test.
So yes, Cantor is pushing a $300 target. Yes, Morgan Stanley thinks the AI boom barely shows up in the rearview mirror. These aren’t timid bets, but they speak to a shared confidence in a narrative that keeps expanding: Nvidia as the backbone of tomorrow, not just today. As long as that conviction holds, Nvidia might cross home plate before the rest of the market even picks up a bat. For a company perpetually stuck in the “early innings,” Nvidia seems awfully close to a title."

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) backed startup n8n has raised $180 million in new funding, valuing the Berlin-based automation company at $2.5 billion as investors bet on the growing use of AI agents across industries.
The Series C round was led by Accel, with participation from Meritech, Redpoint, Evantic, Visionaries Club, and Nvidia's NVentures. Existing investors including Sequoia, Felicis Ventures, Highland Europe, and HV Capital also took part. The new capital brings n8n's total funding to about $240 million.
Founded in 2019 by Jan Oberhauser, n8n builds no-code automation tools that let users link apps like Slack, Google Docs, and in-house systems through a simple drag-and-drop interface. Its platform connects to AI models from multiple providers including Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI giving companies flexibility without locking into a single ecosystem.
Oberhauser said that approach gives n8n an edge as the AI agent market heats up. Earlier this week, OpenAI introduced AgentKit, a toolkit for developers to create their own agents, adding new competition to the space. But investors see that as validation. OpenAI's move will likely expand the market and drive demand for platforms like n8n, said Accel partner Ben Fletcher.
The company plans to use the funds to expand its enterprise footprint and develop deeper AI integrations."

That amount is how much the average American spent on lottery tickets in 2023, according to research conducted by The Motley Fool using the most recent data available from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Winners of the Powerball jackpot in September took home nearly $2 billion. A shot at that kind of transformative income can make a $321 investment appear worthwhile.
How does that potential payout compare to putting money into one of the hottest stocks around -- semiconductor chip leader Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%)? Its shares are up around 40% this year alone as of Oct. 6. Comparing an investment in Nvidia versus the lottery can provide insights into how best to deploy your hard-earned cash.
The lottery dream in contrast to reality
The lottery's get-rich-quick allure makes the gamble seem like a no-brainer. Moreover, the prizes are expected to only increase in value over time. Lottery organizers are motivated to do so because they noticed Americans tend to spend more on tickets when the jackpots are larger.
This helped states with lotteries rake in a record $103 billion in 2023 ticket sales. But that doesn't necessarily translate into riches for you. Your odds of winning a life-changing Powerball jackpot are a microscopic one in 292 million.
This reality contributes to lottery organizers seeking to entice you with increasingly bigger jackpots. It allows them to grow revenue in exchange for handing out rewards to just a few winners.
How Nvidia stock stacks up against the lottery
If lottery players had put their $321 into Nvidia in 2023, how would that have panned out? This chart reveals what would have happened in hindsight.
As the chart shows, every person who invested $321 at the start of 2023 would have seen that total grow to thousands of dollars in just a couple of years. The result isn't life-changing, but it's far superior to no return for the vast majority of Americans who played the lottery.
While the future is uncertain, it's possible to see an Nvidia investment grow by buying more shares and holding on to them for the long term. The strategy makes sense with Nvidia since it's at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI).
AI technology is transforming industries from healthcare to finance. Governments around the world are pouring billions of dollars into AI. Nvidia is central to AI adoption because its chips are the key to delivering the computational power needed for AI systems to perform their jobs.
As a result, Nvidia's revenue in its fiscal Q2, ended July 27, soared 56% year over year to $46.7 billion. The company forecasted its sales to rise further in fiscal Q3, reaching $54 billion.
The Q3 prediction indicates the opportunity to invest in Nvidia isn't over. Adding to this is the company's blockbuster announcements of deals with Intel and ChatGPT creator OpenAI in September. These partnerships possess the potential for Nvidia to deploy millions of its AI chips in support of building out much-needed tech infrastructure, holding the promise of skyrocketing sales in the future.
The path to wealth accumulation
Putting money into Nvidia back in 2023 would have been a smart move, but of course, that's easy to say now. After all, not every stock is going to deliver that kind of outstanding return, and it's not a given which one will do so.
That's where investing in the stock market really shines. You don't need to choose a standout like Nvidia to see your investment grow.
Over the trailing 10 years, the stock market's total return was more than 250%. While the lottery's siren call of instant riches sounds compelling on the surface, the reality is that you have a much better chance of increasing your fortune on Wall Street.

Shares of automation software company UiPath (NYSE:PATH) jumped 12.3% in the afternoon session after the stock extended its positive momentum as the company announced a major push into advanced artificial intelligence through an expanded platform and several key partnerships.
UiPath revealed a shift from traditional Robotic Process Automation to what it called ""agentic"" automation, which uses AI agents to handle more complex tasks. To support this, the company announced a collaboration with OpenAI to build a ChatGPT connector, integrating the popular AI into business workflows.
Further strengthening its AI ecosystem, UiPath also detailed partnerships with Snowflake to improve automated data processing and with Google to use its Gemini models for voice-enabled agents. These moves aimed to help businesses deploy AI more quickly and effectively.

What Is The Market Telling Us
UiPath’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for UiPath and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 22 hours ago when the stock gained 4.3% as confidence in the artificial intelligence market was renewed, pushing both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new all-time intraday highs.
The rebound was led by chipmaker Nvidia, whose shares rose nearly 2% after its CEO confirmed that demand for computing has ""gone up substantially"" in recent months. These comments helped reassure the market that the AI boom is supported by genuine demand, calming fears that were sparked a day earlier by a report questioning the profitability of Oracle's cloud business. The rally was strong enough to put the information technology sector on pace for a fresh closing high. This upward momentum occurred despite potential headwinds from an ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which entered its second week.
UiPath is up 38% since the beginning of the year, and at $17.83 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of UiPath’s shares at the IPO in April 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $258.55.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

As of noon ET on Oct. 9, the chip designer's stock has gained 42% from last Friday's closing bell, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The fuel for this fire is no secret: AMD struck a chip-supply deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.
OpenAI's big AMD order
The companies announced their partnership in the early hours of Tuesday, Oct. 6. OpenAI will install enough AMD artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator cards to consume 6 gigawatts of electric power in a five-year deal, with several smaller phases. The first gigawatt on new systems will use the AMD Instinct MI450 graphics processing units (GPUs) in the second half of 2026.
The announcement also reminded investors that OpenAI has been using AMD Instinct MI300X and MI350X accelerators in the past. ChatGPT is not exclusively powered by Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) hardware.
As part of the deal, OpenAI will have the option of purchasing nearly 10% of AMD's stock in another multistage structure, based on stock warrants tied to AMD's stock price and OpenAI's order volumes. The final tranche would be unlocked by AMD's stock price reaching $600 per share.
AMD's stock closed 26% higher that day -- and continued to climb as investors and analysts digested the news.
It isn't the end of OpenAI's Nvidia relationship
AMD sees ""double-digit billions"" of annual sales going into this agreement, with the side benefit of encouraging other AI data centers to try AMD's solutions. The overall top-line impact could be ""well over $100 billion"" of previously unexpected AI revenue over the next five years.
To put that target in perspective, AMD reported $29.6 billion of total revenue over the last four quarters. That's a drop in the bucket next to Nvidia's $165.2 billion over the same period.
Of course, Nvidia remains OpenAI's chief hardware provider. The AMD deal followed two weeks after an even larger Nvidia-OpenAI contract, committing the ChatGPT developer to 10 gigawatts of Nvidia orders over several years."

The business sells powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) that have been incredibly popular among customers looking to expand AI training and inference, and manage other high-computing workloads.
Demand for the company's products has been spectacular, and that has fueled demand for the stock, which has driven its price higher by 1,300% in the past five years (as of Oct. 9). Given the monster gains already attained, should you buy Nvidia shares right now?
Nvidia's stock trades at a reasonable valuation
It might be crazy to believe that a stock that has climbed so much in such a short period of time still has upside. But this is the case with Nvidia.
That's because the valuation is far from being demanding. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30 (as of Oct. 9). The multiple's 35% premium to the S&P 500 is totally justified given how dominant the company has become.
The poster child of the AI boom
In recent years, Nvidia's revenue and profits have rocketed higher, thanks to the gargantuan sums of capital that are being invested to build out AI infrastructure. And analysts' forecasts strongly suggest the capital spending isn't going to slow down anytime soon.
It doesn't matter which company introduces the best AI-powered products and services and becomes the winner during this tech shift. Nvidia is already well-positioned as the leading AI pick-and-shovel opportunity."

China has been an important market for Nvidia, accounting for 13% of its sales in the company's 2025 fiscal year, so the loss was troubling for Nvidia shareholders.
However, the stock got a boost on Thursday when Bloomberg reported that the U.S. has now granted an export license for Nvidia to ship tens of billions of dollars worth of its top artificial intelligence (AI) graphics processing units (GPUs) to the United Arab Emirates.
The authorization stems from a May trade agreement that permits the UAE to buy up to 500,000 advanced Nvidia processors each year in exchange for committing to $1.4 trillion of investment in the U.S. over the next decade. Bloomberg reports that the AI accelerators being shipped to the UAE will be earmarked for American companies that have data centers in the UAE, rather than being used by G42, an Abu Dhabi-based AI company.
Nvidia stock was up more than 2% in morning trading.
What the deal means for Nvidia
These are chips that Nvidia already planned to sell -- the company and investors had anticipated the U.S. would issue the license. But clearing government red tape is always an important accomplishment, especially since some of the company's foreign sales were blocked in the past.
However, the impact of the sales is indisputable. Blackwell chips reportedly cost roughly $30,000 each, so selling 500,000 annually would mean $15 billion in annual revenue for Nvidia. That's significant, even for this company, which is expecting between $180 billion and $200 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year.
Nvidia will need such deals to keep its revenue and profits growing at levels that investors expect.
What the deal means for U.S. chipmakers
There's a bigger picture here, as well. As Bloomberg reports, the UAE deal allows the U.S. to have a foothold in the lucrative Middle East, where AI is expanding rapidly in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.
China's manufacturing is increasingly becoming a competitor with U.S. companies. Huawei topped Apple's position as the leading smartphone supplier, and Beijing's willingness to freeze Nvidia from China indicates the government is increasingly confident in its ability to develop its own technology infrastructure, including high-powered chips to run AI applications.
Washington's deal with the UAE is meant to give American companies an opportunity to compete in the Middle East, rather than ceding the region to China. The newly awarded export license, if successful, could serve to be a model for future deals."

What Is The Market Telling Us
Nvidia’s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago when the stock gained 2.3% on the news that several Wall Street firms raised their price targets on the stock and reports surfaced of a major deal involving its advanced AI systems.
The positive sentiment was fueled by a reported deal where cloud provider CoreWeave agreed to supply Meta Platforms with up to $14.2 billion in AI computing power using Nvidia's latest GB300 systems. This agreement highlighted the immense and sustained demand for AI infrastructure from major tech companies. Further boosting investor confidence, several financial firms, including KeyBanc, Barclays, and Citi, increased their price targets for Nvidia. Analysts pointed to an improving supply of key components and strong, continued spending in the AI sector as the primary reasons for their optimistic outlook, which helped push the stock to a record high.
Nvidia is up 40.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $194.05 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $14,100.

Shares of cannabis company Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) jumped 24.9% in the morning session after the company reported third-quarter financial results that topped analyst expectations.
For the quarter, Tilray announced revenue of $209.5 million, marking a 4.7% increase from the same period last year and beating Wall Street's forecasts. The company showed significant progress toward profitability. Its operating margin dramatically improved to 1%, a sharp turnaround from negative 18.3% in the prior year's quarter. Furthermore, adjusted earnings per share reached breakeven at $0.00, an improvement from a loss of $0.04 a year ago.
The company's cash burn also slowed considerably, with free cash flow improving to a loss of $10.86 million compared to a loss of $42.02 million in the same quarter last year. These positive developments overshadowed a slight miss on adjusted EBITDA, which came in at $10.18 million.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Tilray’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 78 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Tilray and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago when the stock dropped 7.9% on the news that signs of weakening consumer health and a cautious outlook for the upcoming holiday season emerged.
The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index fell more than expected in September, hitting its lowest level since April. This drop is fueled by growing pessimism among Americans regarding inflation and a softening job market. Compounding these concerns, a pre-holiday survey indicates that the vast majority of consumers plan to cut back on spending compared to last year, citing the rising cost of living. With shoppers expected to prioritize essentials, discretionary categories like luxury items and home goods could face significant headwinds, creating a challenging environment for retailers.
Tilray is up 47.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $2.16 per share, has set a new 52-week high.

Muse raised his price target on the AI juggernaut to a Street-high $300 per share.
The new price target would represent a market value of $7.3 trillion for NVIDIA, which is already the most valuable company in the world at $4.7 trillion.
The price target hike from Muse follows investor meetings in New York City this past week, which included CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and other Senior Executives.
While AI bubble talk is rampant on Wall Street, Muse said emphatically, “This is not a bubble."" He said we are just in the early stages of the AI investment cycle.
“We are still in the early innings of a multi-trillion AI Infrastructure build-out with just the Hyperscalers providing significant line-of-sight into hundreds of billions of demand for the next handful of years, never mind other drivers such as Neo-Clouds, Enterprise, and Physical AI,” Muse stated.
Muse said a key highlight of the trip was NVIDIA’s new partnership with OpenAI, which aims to establish OpenAI as a self-hosted hyperscaler. The goal is to eliminate margin stacking from server manufacturers and cloud providers, reducing the cost gap between NVIDIA and ASICs to about 15 percent. This is seen as a win for both companies and could add pressure to the ASIC market.
The company is also advancing its Extreme Co-Design initiative on an annual cycle to optimize the entire AI infrastructure. Customers want full-scale AI deployment, not just chips, and NVIDIA’s full-stack solution, including CUDA-X, supports that vision. Jensen Huang and his team remain intensely focused and highly competitive. As Huang put it, they are “getting things done,” and it is hard to see a future where NVIDIA does not hold at least 75 percent of the AI accelerator market, the analyst stated.
On EPS power, Muse said $8 per share in CY2026, versus the consensus of $6.26, is “very doable.” In CY2027, EPS could rise to $11, compared to the consensus of $7.36, the analyst states.
“On this front, we are raising our price target to $300 (27x expected $11 in CY26) from $240 (30x expected $8 in CY26) - suggesting near-term upside of 60+%, with eventual upside more meaningfully as the company continues to propel itself to stretch goal of $50 in EPS into CY30 (and $3-4T AI Infrastructure world),” the analyst added.
He concludes: “In the words of the Boss... Baby, NVDA was (and continues to be) Born to Run....”

Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose to a record high Thursday, up around 1.8%, after Bloomberg reported that the US government has approved for export several billion dollars' worth of the tech giant's chips to the United Arab Emirates.
The Commerce Department issued Nvidia its export license to the UAE after the federation solidified earlier commitments to making reciprocal investments in the US, Bloomberg reported, citing an unnamed US official. This marks the first time Nvidia has been allowed to ship its AI chips to the country since Trump became president.
The move follows the announcement of a massive AI infrastructure project called Stargate UAE during President Trump's visit to the country earlier this year. The project, unveiled in May, included a proposed 5 gigawatt data center hub in Abu Dhabi managed in part by OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and Oracle (ORCL), with infrastructure supplied by Cisco (CSCO) and Nvidia.
Trump's AI deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia have opened up new potential international markets for Nvidia as geopolitical tensions cloud its prospects in the Chinese AI market. Although the US government lifted a short-lived surprise export ban on sales of Nvidia's chips to China in exchange for a cut of its revenue from the region — a highly unusual arrangement that has yet to be finalized — China has now reportedly banned tech companies from buying Nvidia's chips.

Hyperscalers are Big Tech cloud providers, such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet-owned Google (GOOGL, GOOG).
Muse's view highlights the bull side of the AI bubble debate, which sees Big Tech as justifiably rushing to build data centers to meet unprecedented AI demand.
""Thus, this is not a bubble, and we are still in the early innings of this investment cycle,"" Muse wrote.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also added to optimism over the company in comments to CNBC on Wednesday, saying that demand for the company's technology is showing no signs of slowing down.
""Demand for Blackwell is really, really high,"" Huang said on CNBC. ""I think we're at the beginning of a new buildout, beginning of a new industrial revolution."""

SAN FRANCISCO, October 09, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elastic (NYSE: ESTC), the Search AI Company, today announced the Elastic Inference Service (EIS), a GPU-accelerated inference-as-a-service for Elasticsearch semantic search, vector search, and generative AI workflows.
Every generative AI and vector search application relies on inference, and Elastic now delivers these capabilities natively as part of Elastic Cloud. As volumes grow, managing infrastructure, testing models, and handling integrations creates operational overhead that slows teams down. This has created a need for GPU-acceleration and an integrated workflow to provide speed, scalability, and cost efficiency.
""Inference at scale is incredibly important for vector search, semantic search and GenAI workflows,"" said Steve Kearns, General Manager, Search at Elastic. ""The Elastic Inference Service meets that challenge by providing our customers with an API-based inference service using NVIDIA GPUs with our best-in-class Elasticsearch vector database for low-latency, high-throughput inference.""
Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR (ELSER) — Elastic’s built-in sparse vector model for state-of-the-art search relevance — is the first text-embedding model available on EIS in technical preview. Support for additional models for multilingual embeddings, reranking, and models from the recently announced Jina acquisition, will be available soon.
Some key benefits for developers who use EIS include:
-
Streamlined developer experience: No model downloads, manual configuration, or resource provisioning. EIS integrates directly with semantic_text and the Inference API for a seamless developer experience.
-
Improved end-to-end semantic search experience: EIS is compatible with sparse vectors, dense vectors, or semantic reranking.
-
Simplified generative AI workflows: AI features for ingest, investigation, detection, and analysis work out of the box, reducing the friction of contracts, API keys, and external services.
-
Backward compatibility: The Open Inference API gives users full flexibility to connect any third-party service, while existing Elasticsearch ML Nodes remain supported during adoption.
-
Enhanced performance: GPU-accelerated inference provides consistent latency and up to 10x higher throughput for ingest compared to CPU-based alternatives.
-
Easy to understand pricing: EIS provides consumption-based pricing similar to other inference services, charged per model per million tokens. It is also easy to get started and access support.
-
Peace of mind: Elastic also provides an intellectual property indemnity for all models provided on EIS."

Modern chips are far more complex than a decade ago, and design teams face growing pressure to deliver reliable silicon on tight schedules. LLMs offer promising assistance—from drafting RTL to explaining verification failures—but today’s capabilities vary widely across tasks. A common, transparent way to measure progress helps the entire ecosystem learn what works, compare approaches fairly, and focus investment where it matters. Benchmarks also make it easier for new participants to contribute, accelerating practical innovation while keeping expectations grounded. Although LLMs sometimes fall short of expectations—especially on corner cases, reproducibility, and rigorous verification—clear metrics and open evaluation can steadily improve outcomes. The LLM Benchmarking Coalition’s corporate and academic members will build upon the RTL design and verification benchmarks provided in CVDP by extending problems to cover new categories and design domains, monitoring a leaderboard of results, refining benchmarking methods and metrics, and providing an interpretation of the results.
Nate Pinckney, a senior research scientist at Nvidia, was elected by Coalition members to become the coalition’s first chair. His work covers high-level synthesis methodologies, low-power VLSI design, and cryptographic accelerators, with over 40 publications in these fields. Recently, his research has focused on evaluating large language models and AI agents, including co-creating the VerilogEval and the open-source Comprehensive Verilog Design Problems benchmarks.
Igor Markov, a distinguished architect at Synopsys and an IEEE Fellow, was elected by Coalition members to become the coalition’s vice chair. He previously worked at Meta on AI platforms and at Google on Search. As a professor at the University of Michigan, he performed research on EDA, coauthored a textbook on physical design and co-edited a two-volume EDA Handbook. He won best paper awards at several conferences and published over 200 peer-reviewed papers. At Synopsys, he leads the AI Disruption Task Force.
LBC vice chair, Igor Markov, said, ""Experience shows that rigorous benchmarking is the connective tissue between scientific validity and innovative progress. It ensures that claims are credible, comparisons are fair, and advances are real."""

That year, the S&P 500 fell by more than 19%.
It was the hype and excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) that led to a huge turnaround for the stock market. When ChatGPT was launched on Nov. 30, 2022, it wasn't long afterward that companies began promoting products and services that used generative AI capabilities.
Nvidia played a big role in AI with companies relying on its advanced chips for developing their own AI models and products. Since the launch of ChatGPT, the tech company's stock soared by 1,000%.
But as incredible as that is, there are three AI stocks that have performed even better over that time frame: AppLovin (APP 2.01%), Rigetti Computing (RGTI 0.46%), and Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%). Here's why they have skyrocketed thanks to AI, and how strong their returns have been since then.
AppLovin: up 4,270%
AppLovin is in the ad tech business, helping developers monetize their apps. With the help of AI, AppLovin has been able to do that incredibly well, and it has resulted in monstrous growth, to the point where it sold off its mobile gaming segment to focus solely on advertising.
Last year, advertising revenue grew by 75% to $3.2 billion, while revenue from its apps segment rose by just 3%, to $1.5 billion. Doubling down on ads makes the business less diverse, but it has made the stock a more attractive option for growth investors.
On Monday, Oct. 6, however, the stock fell as investors learned that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was looking into its data collection practices. Multiple short-sellers targeted the company in the past over its practices, saying that it violated app store policies.
The stock was already looking expensive, trading at around 93 times its trailing earnings before this news came out. It has been a hot buy in recent years, but its high valuation could make it vulnerable to a steep sell-off, especially if the SEC confirms any of the concerns short-sellers had about the business. I would be hesitant to buy the stock based on just its valuation alone, and these latest developments only add to the risk of owning the stock right now.
Rigetti Computing: up 3,220%
Quantum computing stocks didn't take off right away amid the ChatGPT-fueled excitement. But they have been scorching of late. Shares of Rigetti Computing have soared more than 5,400% in just the past 12 months.
The need for next-gen computing capabilities for AI led to investors rushing out to buy shares of quantum computing companies, in the anticipation that they may represent the next big growth opportunities in tech. And among the biggest winners has been Rigetti, with its market cap now sitting at more than $14 billion. In 2022, it finished the year with a valuation of just under $90 million.
But a big problem is that the hype has outpaced the company's actual growth and its financials. It is still in its early growth stages, and over the past four quarters, its revenue has totaled just $7.9 million, while it has accumulated losses of around $165 million.
Rigetti is the riskiest stock on this list because it could take years before quantum computers truly become prevalent. In the meantime, investors are already paying for this stock as if it's a sure thing and that it will be a big player in the space -- and that's a risky proposition. As a result, this is another stock that may be too hot to buy right now.
Palantir Technologies: up 2,000%
Data analytics company Palantir Technologies was quick to enhance its platform with AI, and it ran hundreds of so-called ""boot camps"" with customers to show them how it could transform their businesses. It won many of them over, and Palantir's financials have come a long way in a few years.
In the past 12 months, revenue has totaled $3.4 billion, which is 81% more than the $1.9 billion it generated in 2022. That was also the last year the company reported a loss ($373.7 million). Over the last four quarters, net income has totaled $763.3 million.
The business experienced strong growth in both commercial and government segments. And with CEO Alex Karp routinely hyping the company's huge growth opportunities, investors have continually been buying up the stock.
But like the other stocks listed here, I would be wary of investing in Palantir today. AI hype has driven its valuation to a staggering $435 billion, which is outlandish since it puts the stock at a price-to-earnings multiple of more than 600. Even based on analyst estimates of future profits, it's trading at a forward earnings multiple of over 200.
There's significant room for this stock to fall. If you've made a big profit on Palantir, you may want to consider cashing out."

1. Alphabet: The world's search engine
Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the largest search engine in the world. But it's a lot more than that, and it's moving AI forward with its Gemini large-language model (LLM) that brings the internet search to a new level. It also offers AI solutions for advertising clients to up their game and achieve greater success, putting more money in Alphabet's pockets, too, and its cloud computing clients benefit from the strength of the LLM in creating their own AI apps.
Companies like Target and Wayfair are using AI through Google Cloud to gather data, personalize the user experience, and improve cybersecurity.
Google has many businesses and varied revenue streams, including devices like smartphones, subscription services like storage, and self-driving cars. Revenue increased 14% year over year in the 2025 second quarter, demonstrating the power of its interconnected platform. But it has a long growth runway as advertisers are just touching the potential in AI-powered campaigns, and cloud users experiment with AI to build better businesses.
It's also highly profitable, and operating income increased 14% over last year with a 32.4% margin.
Despite its robust performance and long-term potential, Alphabet stock trades at a bargain price of 26 times trailing-12-month earnings.
2. Amazon: E-commerce and cloud rolled into one
Amazon is the leader in e-commerce, by far, but it's also tops in cloud computing. That's a combination that's nearly impossible to beat, and both of these industries continue to grow as companies make deeper inroads into these markets and use AI to improve in both spaces.
E-commerce is still less than a fifth of total retail spending in the U.S., but around 40% of that spending goes to Amazon. As e-commerce increases as a percentage of retail sales, Amazon will benefit organically. But the company is not waiting around for that to happen. It's spearheading the shift through its incredible value proposition, especially through the Prime program, which generates loyalty and volume. Fulfillment times keep speeding up, with the percentage of same or next-day deliveries up 30% year over year in the second quarter.
The generative AI business is largely within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud segment, and as of the second quarter, it had a $123 billion run rate. Yet, CEO Andy Jassy thinks it's still in its early innings.
""It's a very unusual opportunity that we're very bullish about,"" he said.
Amazon stock trades at a P/E ratio of 34. That's the highest on this list, but it's below its one, three, and five-year averages.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) produces the chips that make AI possible. When you hear of companies like Nvidia and its peers making chips, it's actually designing the chips and partnering with TSMC to bring them to life. That gives TSMC incredible exposure to AI, and gives investors access to many different AI stocks leading the charge.
TSMC has been around since well before the recent generative AI takeover of technology, and its other categories, like gaming and autonomous vehicles, are still an important part of its business, giving it more stability and protection. But the AI business has become its largest, accounting for 60% of the total, and sales increased 14% year over year in the 2025 fiscal second quarter (ended June 30).
Total revenue increased 44% over last year, and both gross margin and operating margin expanded significantly, to 58.6% and 49.6%, respectively.
To get around tariff issues and generally expand its global reach and cost-efficiency, TSMC is opening an Arizona production location, and the company is well positioned to keep supporting and benefiting from advances in AI.
Taiwan Semiconductor stock trades at a P/E ratio of 33, an attractive entry point for new investors."

Investing in emerging technologies is never for the faint of heart. These companies often trade more on potential than on current results, making them volatile and unpredictable. Breakthroughs in semiconductors, robotics, or new transportation platforms can send shares soaring. Missed milestones, regulatory delays, or cash burn can just as quickly send them crashing back down.
That boom-or-bust profile means these stocks aren't core holdings for most investors. But for those building well-diversified portfolios, taking a small position in promising names can offer exposure to massive long-term themes like artificial intelligence (AI), surgical robotics, and electric air mobility.
Here are three emerging tech stocks that could deliver outsize gains if their ambitious plans play out.
Power behind the AI boom
Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS 20.61%) designs gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors for AI data centers. The company addresses power delivery challenges as data centers scale to handle increasingly demanding AI workloads.
In May 2025, Nvidia selected Navitas to collaborate on its next-generation 800-volt HVDC data center architecture, which Nvidia says begins rolling out in 2027. The system converts grid AC power to 800-volt DC at the perimeter, then steps down to lower voltages needed for GPU and IT racks using Navitas chips.
The Nvidia partnership sent shares soaring 83.5% in the first half of 2025, but the company faces a significant execution challenge. Navitas generated just $83.3 million in revenue for full-year 2024 and remains deeply unprofitable.
To scale commercial production, the company brought in Chris Allexandre as CEO in September 2025, a semiconductor veteran who ran Renesas Electronics' $2.5 billion power management business and led its acquisition of GaN supplier Transphorm. If the 800-volt architecture gains adoption as expected, Navitas sits at the center of a multibillion-dollar infrastructure buildout.
Democratizing robotic surgery
SS Innovations International (SSII -1.21%) builds surgical robotic systems designed to make advanced procedures affordable and accessible globally. As of Sept. 30, 2025, the SSi Mantra has an installed base of 125 units across six countries, with more than 6,000 surgical procedures performed, including 60 telesurgeries and 310 cardiac operations.
The near-term catalyst is U.S. market entry. In September 2025, SS Innovations completed a human factors validation study at Johns Hopkins Hospital, meeting FDA requirements for usability and patient safety. The company plans to submit a 510(k) premarket notification in Q4 2025, targeting clearance in the first half of 2026 based on standard review timelines.
The challenge is competing against Intuitive Surgical, which dominates robotic surgery with its da Vinci system. SS Innovations positions itself as the affordable alternative, targeting underserved markets and price-sensitive hospital systems. The company remains unprofitable but points to thousands of procedures completed as validation of its technology and market traction.
Flying into urban mobility
Vertical Aerospace (EVTL -4.72%) develops the VX4, an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft designed to carry six passengers and a pilot at cruise speeds around 150 mph over ranges of approximately 100 miles. In July 2025, the company completed a piloted airport-to-airport flight, flying 17 miles from Cotswold Airport to RAF Fairford and reaching speeds of 115 mph at altitudes near 1,800 feet.
Vertical targets 2028 certification through the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority and European Union Aviation Safety Agency. The company has deepened its collaboration with Honeywell to certify critical flight control and avionics systems. Mudrick Capital is now the majority shareholder following a December 2024 agreement that converted $130 million of debt into equity and committed up to $50 million in additional funding.
The path forward requires demonstrating reliable transition flight between vertical lift and wingborne flight, scaling manufacturing, and securing regulatory approval. During its September 2025 Capital Markets presentation, Vertical stated that up to $700 million in additional funding is projected as needed to reach 2028 certification, with existing funds carrying operations through the end of 2025."

The technology has the potential to completely reshape the world we are living in, and it is still in the very early days of its development.
Let's look at three AI stocks to buy now.
Nvidia
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) saw where AI was headed very early in the game, and its decision to give away CUDA for free to universities and research labs paid off big by giving it one of the widest moats in the industry. Developers have built their foundational AI code on Nvidia's software platform, which has effectively locked them into its ecosystem. Even if a rival comes out with a slightly better chip, ripping out years of code and retraining engineers is a nonstarter for most companies, especially when it comes to training large language models (LLMs). That is why Nvidia still controls more than 90% of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market for AI workloads.
The company has also gone far beyond just selling chips. Its proprietary NVLink interconnect allows its GPUs to work as one massive unit, which is a critical edge as AI models get larger and more complex. Now Nvidia has made another big strategic move by investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI. This will give Nvidia insight into where AI models are headed, and the two companies will work together to help shape the future of AI.
CEO Jensen Huang has predicted that data center spending on AI could reach as much as $4 trillion over the next several years, and Nvidia looks positioned better than anyone to capture that spending.
Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) is positioning itself to become one of the biggest AI beneficiaries of the next decade. Its Gemini model has progressed rapidly to become one of the leading foundational models. It's helping power both its AI and search efforts, as well as its cloud computing unit.
The company developed a wide moat in search by becoming the default search engine on most devices on the planet. It did this by owning the popular Chrome browser and Android operating system, and then struck a search revenue-sharing deal with Apple. Now, as there is a shift toward AI, Alphabet has incorporated its Gemini model throughout its search platform with both AI Overviews and AI Mode, which lets people easily shift from AI-powered search to an AI chatbot with the click of a mouse. This is leading to more queries and helping the company generate more ad revenue.
Meanwhile, the company's cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, has been growing quickly, and it has an advantage as the only company with a fully integrated AI stack. In addition to its Gemini model, it has taken the lead with custom AI chips that give it cost and performance advantages, while also having leading data analytics and other services.
Meanwhile, longer-term bets like its Waymo robotaxi business and progress in quantum computing could turn into new growth drivers. Combined, all of this makes Alphabet a top AI stock to own.
Amazon
While most people think of Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) as an e-commerce company, behind the scenes, it is a leader in AI and robotics. The company created the cloud computing industry, which today is one of the industries benefiting the most from the AI boom.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is both the company's largest segment by profitability and its fastest-growing. Last quarter, AWS revenue jumped 17.5% to nearly $31 billion, with operating income topping $10 billion. The growth is being fueled by customers looking to use its services and infrastructure to help build and run their AI workloads. On the service front, its Bedrock solution lets customers tap into the top foundation LLMs and customize them, while SageMaker gives them a platform to build and train their own. It has also recently introduced an open-source framework for building AI agents, called Strands, and Agentcore, a secure environment to deploy them at scale. On top of that, Amazon has built its own AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which lower costs for customers and give AWS an efficiency advantage.
Amazon is also embedding AI across its e-commerce business to squeeze out more profits. It already has more than 1 million robots working in its warehouses, which are coordinated by its DeepFleet AI model. Amazon is also using AI to predict where to store items for faster delivery, optimize driver routes, and improve its advertising platform. These changes add up to a better operating margin. Last quarter, North American operating income surged 47% on just an 11% increase in revenue.
Overall, Amazon remains well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI over the next decade."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -When Tesla's board of directors offered Elon Musk the biggest executive pay package in corporate history in September, it reassured investors that he would have to achieve the equivalent of “Mars-shot milestones” to earn $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years.
The board’s proposal said Musk would have to “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” in robotics and autonomous driving as well as stock value and profits. Conversely, Musk would get “zero” unless he meets those “incredibly ambitious” goals.
Yet Musk could reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of those targets, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance goals and more than a dozen experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends including autonomous driving.
He could collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the board’s easier goals that won’t necessarily revolutionize Tesla’s products or business, the Reuters review found.
Even hitting just two of the easiest targets, along with modest stock growth, would net Musk $26 billion, more than the lifetime pay of the next eight best-paid CEOs combined, a group that includes Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Apple's Tim Cook, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, according to an analysis for Reuters by research firm Equilar.
Musk’s vehicle sales goals are exceptionally easy to achieve, according to four automotive experts. If Musk sells 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, on average, he earns $8.2 billion in stock if Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion in 2035, well under long-term market-average growth. That’s a half-million fewer cars per year than Tesla sold in 2024.
On Tuesday, Tesla unveiled lower-cost versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan to reverse falling sales.
Three other product-development goals are written in vague language that could provide Musk hefty payouts without significantly boosting profit, according to six robotics or autonomous-driving industry experts who reviewed Musk’s goals for Reuters.
Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Tesla board said: ""The proposed pay package is actually worth zero to our CEO unless and until the shareholders see the value of the company nearly double and an operational milestone is met.""
The board’s pay proposal requires Musk to remain a Tesla executive for at least seven-and-a-half years to collect any stock compensation. Musk, however, would get the voting rights associated with the share awards as soon as he earns them."

- Recent deals from the likes of Nvidia and OpenAI have raised eyebrows on Wall Street and drawn comparisons to the vendor financing arrangements that fueled the Dotcom bubble of the late 1990s.
- Experts note these deals account for a relatively small share of AI investment, which, unlike during the Dotcom bubble, has mostly been funded by extremely profitable tech businesses.
- Some warn of early bubble warning signs, including big tech's increasing reliance on debt and an IPO frenzy.
A spate of unusual deals within the AI ecosystem has recently fueled concern that the AI boom is actually an AI bubble, but some professional market watchers say this isn't 1999—at least not yet.
OpenAI has vowed to spend hundreds of billions on Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips; in exchange, Nvidia will invest in OpenAI, and OpenAI will invest in AMD. Nvidia has invested in cloud providers Nebius (NBIS) and CoreWeave (CRWV), both of which buy its chips, and agreed with the latter to buy all of its unused computing capacity through 2032. These deals are just a few threads in a growing web of entanglements connecting chipmakers, cloud providers and AI model makers.
Why This Is Important
Artificial intelligence excitement has been the main driver of stock market returns for the past three years, increasing the weight of big tech stocks in most portfolios. Until companies can demonstrate AI is contributing to the bottom line, the AI rally will depend on investors remaining optimistic about future returns.
Skeptics warn these circular deals are evidence of an artificial intelligence bubble forming. They argue that Nvidia, through investments in the companies buying and renting its chips, is subsidizing the AI build-out, and artificially overstating the strength of AI demand in the process.
But many on Wall Street disagree, including analysts at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, who cast doubt on the bubble narrative in notes published Wednesday.
Circular Deal Concern 'Overstated,' Says BofA
“We believe the recent concerns re AI financing are highly overstated,” wrote BofA semiconductor equity analyst Vivek Arya, who doesn’t expect circular deals to account for more than 5% to 10% of the $5 trillion that is likely to be spent on AI by 2030.
Though, it’s worth noting that by BofA’s calculation, OpenAI will have to spend between $500 and $600 billion on infrastructure as part of its Nvidia deal alone; add in its commitments to AMD and Oracle (ORCL), and the startup has agreed to spend about $1 trillion on cloud computing in the coming years.
OpenAI’s centrality to the recent spate of deals has concerned some onlookers. The ChatGPT maker recently became the world’s most valuable startup, valued at $500 billion, and is in the process of becoming a for-profit company. Still, it anticipates burning through $115 billion on the road to profitability, which isn’t expected to happen until the end of this decade at the earliest.
However, Arya notes that OpenAI, while a big player in the AI boom, is “only one of multiple (5-10) ecosystems including the four large US hyperscalers, Tesla/xAI, multiple sovereign buildouts (Middle East, Asia), 100+ neoclouds that do not require or have disclosed minimal vendor financing.”
No Bubble... Yet, Goldman Says
Skeptics have repeatedly pointed to the stock prices of the Magnificent Seven—Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—as evidence of a burgeoning bubble. The ten largest companies in the U.S., including all of the Mag 7, cumulatively account for a quarter of global equity market value.
“This degree of concentration is, in our view, unsustainable,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Wednesday, “but this is not the same as saying that we are experiencing a bubble.”
Related Education
Goldman identifies three common components of financial bubbles: “rapidly rising asset prices, extreme valuations and rising significant systemic risks driven by increased leverage.” While the Mag 7 stocks have soared over the past three years, Goldman notes that their valuations remain modest compared with the lead up to the Dotcom bubble, in part because their stock prices reflect “powerful and sustained profit growth rather than excessive speculation about the future.”
Another difference between then and now is that the companies fueling the AI boom with their spending have unusually strong balance sheets, cash flows and hugely profitable businesses not tied to AI. That has allowed them to fund their buildouts with existing revenue streams rather than equity and debt, which reduces the risk that a sudden shock to the AI ecosystem halts AI investment, forces a sharp revaluation of related assets, and ripples through the broader economy.
Though, Goldman concedes that, while we’re not currently in a bubble, a few developing trends suggest we’re headed there. Big tech’s debt issuance picked up this year as cash reserves dwindled, suggesting systemic risk may be increasing.
More companies have gone public to cash in on the AI frenzy, and investors have eaten the new offerings up. “The starting day premiums for new issues has reached an average of 30% in the US,” the highest since the Dotcom bubble, according to Goldman."

finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-09T09:30:00,Prediction: These Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Could Outperform Nvidia by 2030,Nvidia has become one of the defining megacap players of the artificial intelligence boom over the last three years.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=08276bf6ac476df57d5aac6ea07ff699a5ac081ff99de0a42bd7c5fe42ce7590,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-these-ai-stocks-could-outperform-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-these-ai-stocks-could-outperform-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/prediction-these-ai-stocks-could-outperform-nvidia/,fool.com,200,,"Over the past few years, Nvidia has become synonymous with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Its GPUs power everything from ChatGPT to self-driving cars, and its market capitalization surged past $4 trillion, firmly establishing the chipmaker as the largest company in the world.
Yet as the AI race matures, the next decade may not belong to Nvidia alone. Two companies -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.96%) and Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) -- are quietly positioning themselves to challenge its dominance from distinct but equally powerful angles.
Nvidia's rise has largely been fueled by its high-performance chips, but the broader AI ecosystem relies on companies that supply crucial infrastructure and integrated platforms enabling this revolution. By 2030, investors may look back and realize that the true winners of the AI boom were those laying the foundation of the intelligent economy.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: The ultimate pick-and-shovel AI stock
While Nvidia specializes in designing GPUs, its Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) that brings this hardware to life. As the world's largest chip manufacturer by revenue, it produces cutting-edge 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer chips that power not only Nvidia's products, but also those of Advanced Micro Devices and Apple's M series processors. In many ways, TSMC is the pillar supporting the broader semiconductor industry.
As global demand for AI computing accelerates, the company's value proposition grows increasingly compelling. Its dominance in advanced node manufacturing should drive sustained revenue growth and expanding profit margins, backed by industry-leading pricing power.
Moreover, TSMC's strategic investments to diversify its geographic footprint beyond Taiwan -- including new production facilities in the U.S. -- are helping mitigate geopolitical vulnerabilities while deepening relationships with key customers. For investors looking for an infrastructure-first way to participate in the AI revolution, it represents the ultimate pick-and-shovel opportunity.
2. Alphabet: Building a complete AI ecosystem
Over the past several years, Alphabet has methodically constructed a vertically integrated AI ecosystem.
At the infrastructure layer, Google Cloud's tensor processing units (TPUs) provide a powerful alternative to Nvidia's GPUs for both training and inference workloads. Layered on top of this hardware foundation are Alphabet's growing ambitions in quantum computing, anchored by its custom Willow chip.
On the software side, the company has introduced Cirq, an open-source quantum programming framework that complements the company's hardware advances. Meanwhile, DeepMind, the company's in-house AI research lab, is helping push the frontiers of next-generation machine intelligence. Taken together, these assets position it at the intersection of classical computing and quantum AI.
Crowning this ecosystem is Gemini, Alphabet's large language model (LLM), which competes directly with OpenAI's ChatGPT (via Microsoft Azure) and Anthropic's Claude (via Amazon Web Services). By combining infrastructure, research, and software under one roof, Alphabet has quietly built one of the most diversified and formidable AI suites in the world.
The next AI winners might already be hiding in plain sight
While Nvidia will likely remain a cornerstone of the AI narrative, investors seeking durable, long-term growth may find greater opportunity in companies that enable and scale up AI rather than those centering on a single product line.
TSMC stands to benefit from continuous chip upgrade cycles regardless of which company's designs are in demand, while Alphabet is embedding AI into every layer of its business: search, advertising, streaming, Android, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and autonomous systems.
In many ways, Taiwan Semi and Alphabet represent two sides of the same coin: One company powers the physical infrastructure of the AI era, while the other drives its digital intelligence.
By the end of this decade, both TSMC and Alphabet could quietly -- yet decisively -- outperform Nvidia, reminding investors that the true winners of technological revolutions are rarely those that perfect a single product category, but rather the ecosystems and enablers that make these products and services a crucial feature of everyday life."

On the one hand, they represent the very best companies available. Their gargantuan market caps prove their track record of value creation. On the other hand, the larger a company is, the harder it is for it to generate impressive growth in the future. Blue-chip stocks carry the risk that their best days are behind them, and new investors have missed out on most of the fun.
With a market cap of $4.5 trillion, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is the largest company in the world and an excellent example of this predicament. Let's dig deeper into the pros and cons of the stock and discuss what it might take for the technology giant to hit $10 trillion by 2030.
A bet on the AI industry
While Nvidia has historically enjoyed a diversified business model with meaningful exposure to video gaming and other verticals, this is no longer the case. Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, the stock has become an all-or-nothing bet on artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. In the fiscal second quarter, its data center segment represented a whopping 88% of total revenue, mainly driven by sales of advanced AI chips, like the Blackwell used to train the most advanced large language models (LLMs).
While AI exposure has boosted Nvidia's growth, it also makes the company vulnerable to potential challenges in the industry. The most significant risk is that AI might not live up to analysts' expectations. In August, an MIT study suggested that 95% of corporate AI pilots failed to generate meaningful returns for clients, pouring cold water on earlier assumptions that this technology would rapidly transform the world.
The good news is that generative AI is improving rapidly, helped in large part by better hardware. Furthermore, as an infrastructure provider, Nvidia operates on the ""picks and shovels"" side of the industry, which helps protect it from the uncertainties and frequent failures on the software side of the industry.
For now, at least, Nvidia's clients continue to stockpile its chips at immense markups. Q2 revenue soared 56% year over year to $45.74 billion, while the company maintains a gross margin of 72.4%.
Could future technologies play a role?
Nvidia's best chance to hit $10 trillion would involve diversifying outside of generative AI. Two compelling candidates could be robotics and automation (particularly for self-driving cars). Cathie Wood's Ark Invest optimistically believes the market for automated ""mobility-as-a-service"" could exceed $10 trillion in sales by the early 2030s. Nvidia could benefit from this potential growth by positioning itself on the picks-and-shovels side of the opportunity, just like with generative AI.
The company recently announced a new software platform called Nvidia Drive, designed to help developers use its hardware for autonomous vehicle development. Its chips are already widely used in many third-party robotics platforms, such as Tesla's Optimus humanoid, which uses them for model training. While automotive and robotics remain a small part of Nvidia's overall business, the segment grew 69% year over year to $586 million. Investors should expect growth to potentially accelerate over the next five years and beyond.
What will it take to hit $10 trillion?
From its current market cap of $4.5 trillion, Nvidia would have to add $5.5 trillion in value to hit $10 trillion. This sum would represent a total growth of 122%, or a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of just over 17% per year. While this is significantly faster than the S&P 500's average return of 10%, it is not outlandish for a company with exposure to massive growth opportunities like AI, self-driving, and robotics.
That said, it's never fun to buy a stock already trading near all-time highs. Investors with thoughts of a $10 trillion market cap may want to wait for more clarity about the software side of the AI industry before considering a position in Nvidia stock."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-09T09:15:00,AI Infrastructure Spending to Hit $490 Billion in 2026 -- Here's Who Wins and Who Loses,Spending on AI infrastructure shows no signs of slowing down. Two companies are leading the pack while one is playing catch-up.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=eecfb6ddee0c0d76acfe129b11ee386a330f6075c3ce71c393493e57f85ecdc7,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/ai-infrastructure-spending-to-hit-490-billion-in-2/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/ai-infrastructure-spending-to-hit-490-billion-in-2/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/ai-infrastructure-spending-to-hit-490-billion-in-2/,fool.com,200,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) spending soared over the past few years, and nowhere has it likely grown more than for data center infrastructure. Companies are spending piles of cash for the high-powered servers used to train new AI models and keep existing ones running, with recent estimates putting AI infrastructure spending as high as $2.8 trillion through 2029 -- with $490 billion spent in 2026 alone.
The initial influx of spending by tech companies has the ultimate goal of getting a leg up on the competition and outpacing rivals over the coming years. So, which AI stocks look like winners right now and which are coming up short?
Two AI stocks that could be winners for years
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is benefiting immensely from the massive uptick in AI infrastructure spending. The company's GPUs are some of the best on the market for processing and training AI, making Nvidia's chip designs the go-to choice for tech companies, and giving the company an estimated 70% to 95% market share for AI data center chips.
The result is that Nvidia's sales and earnings are surging higher. For example, the company's earnings jumped 147% in fiscal 2025 to $2.94 per share, and revenue popped 114% to $130.5 billion. Of course, that's caused Nvidia's share price to rocket higher -- with its share price returning 1,300% over the past three years. As AI spending continues over the next few years, Nvidia is likely to benefit. Its processors are used by Meta Platforms, Microsoft, OpenAI, Alphabet, and many others, which means that no matter who is spending on infrastructure, a significant portion of it is going to Nvidia.
Another big winner from this uptick in spending is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.96%) -- which is one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers and a leader in advanced processors. Taiwan Semiconductor, also referred to as TSMC, makes an estimated 90% of the world's most advanced processors and is steps ahead of the competition.
The key to TSMC's success has been its ongoing development of new, more advanced manufacturing processes, with its latest being the development of its 2nm node, which allows for far more transistors on a single chip than even the company's 5nm node. Rivals are having a hard time keeping up with TSMC, with a recent Citi analyst noting that Intel is years behind the company.
With TSMC's lead in advanced processor manufacturing and the company already having a dominant lead in the space, Taiwan Semiconductor will likely benefit from more AI spending over the next few years.
This semiconductor company is a few steps behind
Of course, any time there's a massive ramp-up in competition, there are bound to be some losers in the fight. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Samsung (SSNL.F 9.01%) is out of the race, but it's certainly a few steps behind rival Taiwan Semiconductor.
Samsung is a semiconductor manufacturing behemoth -- the second-largest by revenue -- but it's failed to benefit from the AI boom in the same way that TSMC has. For one, Samsung's tech doesn't quite match TSMC's advanced manufacturing. TSMC's advanced 3nm chip manufacturing process has 90% yield rates, making its production very reliable and efficient, while Samsung's is around 50%.
Samsung's vice chairman of its semiconductor business, Jun Young-hyun, apologized last year for the company falling behind, saying, ""We have caused concerns about our technical competitiveness, with some talking about the crisis facing Samsung.""
There's some evidence that Samsung is trying to carve out a bigger space in AI infrastructure, with the company winning a $16.5 billion contract with Tesla recently to manufacture advanced processors for the company.
Still, Samsung doesn't match TSMC's manufacturing prowess or deal-making. If investors are looking for clear winners in the AI race right now, putting some money toward Taiwan Semiconductor or Nvidia would be a better move than betting on Samsung catching up."

Shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) rose 2.2% on Wednesday and were up another 1.2% in pre-market trading on Thursday, following the latest reports of its investment in AI.
Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's startup xAI is seeking to raise its ongoing funding round to $20bn (£14.9bn), with Nvidia (NVDA) said to be investing as much as $2bn in the equity portion of the asset-backed transaction. Spokespeople for xAI and Nvidia had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.
Speaking to Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, DVx Ventures CEO and VistaShares co-founder Jon McNeill said: ""I think what it says is that Nvidia and Jensen [Huang] are deploying their balance sheet in very productive ways.

""I think there's a lot of VCs that would love to have Jensen's returns right now I think he's up like five or 6X on CoreWeave (CRWV). He's up similar amounts in their investments into OpenAI.""
Nvidia (NVDA) recently announced that it would be investing up to $100bn in OpenAI, as part of a strategic investment with the ChatGPT developer.
McNeill said Huang and Nvidia (NVDA) were ""building a kind of an envious portfolio that's generating the combination of great returns for their balance sheet, but also really seeding customers purchasing ahead of where their demand is.""
TSMC (2330.TW, TSM)
Another chipmaker in focus on Thursday was TSMC (2330.TW, TSM), after the company reported stronger-than-expected sales in the third quarter.
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, reported September revenue of 330.98 billion Taiwan dollars (£8.12bn). This took its total revenue for the third quarter to NT$989.92bn, according to Yahoo Finance UK's calculations.
This was ahead of an LSEG Smart Estimate of NT$973.26bn, based on forecasts from 22 analysts, according to a Reuters report. Converted into US dollars (USD) the third quarter figure came in at $32.43bn, which would be around the middle of TSMC's guidance for the period of $31.8bn to $33bn, which it gives in USD.
Steve Clayton, head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, said TSMC (2330.TW, TSM) was ""benefitting hugely from the boom in AI demand"".
""TSMC (2330.TW, TSM) is the most technologically advanced manufacturer of the chips that designers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) are creating to power AI technology,"" he said. ""Robust demand from these clients and others saw TSMC report revenue growth of 30% in the latest quarter compared to the same period a year ago."""

The platform was a haven for highly speculative trading at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, particularly in meme stocks like GameStop, but Robinhood itself has become a meme-like stock with a staggering 288% gain this year (as of Oct. 7).
It's currently outperforming some of the best artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in 2025, including Nvidia, which is up 38%, and even Palantir Technologies, which has soared by 143%.
Investors are enthusiastic about Robinhood's recent pivot into NFL and college football prediction markets in partnership with Kalshi. Its stock also received a boost when it was added to the S&P 500 in September. But its business is facing some structural challenges that could disrupt its momentum heading into 2026.
Sports betting is a growing opportunity in the U.S.
Platforms like Kalshi don't offer sports betting in the traditional sense. Instead of placing a wager on a binary outcome, like the winner of a National Football League game, prediction markets allow users to trade in and out of contracts (or shares) that represent the likelihood of a particular event. The odds constantly change based on market activity, which differs from traditional sports betting platforms where a bookmaker can adjust the odds when they need to balance their ledger.
With that said, prediction platforms are certainly trying to eat the sports betting industry's lunch. According to Grand View Research, this could be a $20 billion opportunity in 2025, which will grow to more than $33 billion annually by 2030. Kalshi operates one of the biggest prediction platforms, but the company was recently valued at just $2 billion based on a private funding round, which leaves plenty of room for growth.
The U.S. financial securities brokering industry is about 10 times larger than the sports betting industry, so Robinhood's recent partnership with Kalshi might not sound like a game changer. However, the company could capture a significant share of the budding prediction industry since it's an early entrant, whereas it faces stiff, entrenched competition in the securities brokering space.
Robinhood's core business faces headwinds
Robinhood ended 2024 with a record $672 million in transaction revenue in the fourth quarter, which is the money the company earns from processing stock, option, and cryptocurrency trades for clients. Crypto trading revenue made up more than half of that figure alone, coming in at $358 million.
Unfortunately, crypto revenue fell 55% in the second quarter of 2025, to just $160 million. The sharp decline has dragged Robinhood's total transaction revenue lower on a sequential basis for two straight quarters, even though other important revenue sources like options trading continued to grow.
Many popular cryptocurrencies have declined significantly from their recent peaks, which is pushing many investors onto the sidelines. Dogecoin is down 48% from its 52-week high, Shiba Inu is down by 64%, and even XRP has declined by 21%. This doesn't bode well for Robinhood's crypto trading revenue as we head toward the new year.
Long-term Robinhood investors might be feeling a sense of déjà vu right now. The company's crypto revenue soared by 4,560% year over year during the second quarter of 2021, and accounted for half of its total transaction revenue. But by the second quarter of 2022, its crypto revenue was down by a staggering 75%.
The crypto bust in 2022 contributed to a peak-to-trough collapse in Robinhood stock of more than 90%, which is something for investors to keep in mind.
Robinhood stock is trading at a sky-high valuation
The eye-popping surge in Robinhood's stock price this year doesn't exactly align with the current state of its business, considering its revenue is shrinking sequentially. Robinhood's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is now more than 37, so this is the most expensive the stock has ever been since it went public in 2021.
In fact, Robinhood's P/S ratio is now about 3.6 times higher than its long-term average of 10.3. The stock would have to decline by more than 70% from here just to return to that average valuation, unless the company generates significant revenue growth in the near future, which doesn't seem likely based on its results in the first half of 2025.
It's possible Robinhood's deal with Kalshi becomes an important source of revenue over the long term, but prediction markets don't appear to be big enough to make a tangible difference to its business just yet.
As a result, I don't think Robinhood stock is a good buy heading into 2026. I actually believe it's more likely to head lower in the short to medium term."

Sure, larger companies are often less risky than smaller ones. But with greater risk, there's usually a higher potential for reward.
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) ranks as the biggest stock on the market right now based on market cap. It's probably not the best stock to buy, though. Should you forget Nvidia and instead buy two potential millionaire-maker stocks?
A rising star in quantum computing
If there's any new technology that offers the promise to make millionaires out of some early investors, it's probably quantum computing. IonQ (IONQ -5.85%) stands out as one of the brightest rising stars in the sizzling-hot space.
Quantum computing and networking could have a total addressable market of $87 billion by 2035. That's just the tip of the iceberg, though. These technologies could create economic value of up to $880 billion by 2040 and be used in a wide variety of applications, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cryptography, logistics, risk management, simulation, and more.
IonQ's trapped-ion architecture offers several competitive advantages, notably including high fidelity, better error correction, and lower system costs. The company's recent acquisition of Oxford Ionics could enable it to pack more qubits on a chip than rivals.
Airbus (EADSY -0.20%), AstraZeneca (AZN -0.35%), General Dynamics (GD -1.03%), and Hyundai are just a few of the big customers that have already signed up to use IonQ's quantum computers. The company's partners include Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), Alphabet's (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) Google Cloud unit, and Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%).
IonQ has delivered an impressive revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 175% since 2021. It also has an ambitious product roadmap through the end of the decade that could keep this momentum going.
An AI hyperscaler that's competing with titans
AI is creating huge opportunities for investors to make a lot of money, too. Running AI models requires massive processing capabilities. Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%) ranks among the few AI hyperscalers that have the expertise and scale to meet the rapidly growing AI infrastructure demands.
You might be wondering if a relatively small company like Nebius Group, which has a market cap below $30 billion, can really compete against the cloud titans -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. I think Nebius' financial performance provides the answer. The company's revenue skyrocketed 625% year over year in the second quarter of 2025 and more than doubled from the previous quarter.
Unsurprisingly, Nebius Group has been one of the stock market's biggest winners this year. Its share price has jumped more than 6x. That makes Nvidia's year-to-date return of almost 50% seem lackluster.
Can Nebius Group keep up its winning ways? CEO CEO Arkady Volozh said in the company's Q2 update, ""Demand for AI infrastructure -- compute, software, and services -- is only going to get
stronger as use cases multiply."" I think he's right.
One of the biggest challenges for Nebius Group, though, is having the electric power it needs to meet demand. The good news on this front is that the company is working to secure more than 1 gigawatt of power by the end of 2026.
Better picks than Nvidia?
Are IonQ and Nebius Group better picks than Nvidia? Probably the best answer is... maybe.
Both stocks are riskier than Nvidia. Neither IonQ nor Nebius Group is profitable at this point, while Nvidia is rolling in money. These two smaller companies also face significant competition. Nvidia does, too, of course. However, its GPUs continue to dominate the AI chip market.
On the other hand, IonQ and Nebius Group arguably have more room to run than Nvidia. It's a lot easier for a stock to double when its market cap is under $30 billion than it is when the market cap hovers around $4.5 trillion.
I think that IonQ and Nebius Group might be bigger winners than Nvidia over the next 10 years. But my view is that Nvidia is the safer choice."

They currently dominate different segments of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, which has accelerated their returns.
In fact, since the AI boom started gathering momentum at the beginning of 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks have delivered a median return of 178%. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained just 74% over the same period:
That means investors who don't own these powerhouse stocks have probably underperformed the broader market over the last few years, but I have some good news: There's a simple way to buy them all right now.
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK 0.59%) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests exclusively in America's largest companies, and a whopping 59.3% of the value of its entire portfolio is parked in the Magnificent Seven stocks alone.
The Magnificent Seven, with a splash of diversification
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index, which covers 70% of the market capitalization of the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index. That means if we ranked all 3,508 companies in the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index by size, from the largest to the smallest, the Mega Cap Growth Index would start at the top and work its way down the list until it captured 70% of its total value.
The Vanguard ETF holds just 69 stocks, which shows the U.S. corporate sector is extremely concentrated. To put it another way, just 69 companies represent 70% of the value of all 3,508 companies listed on American stock exchanges. That leaves the remaining 3,439 companies accounting for the other 30%.
Since the Magnificent Seven stocks have a combined value of $20.7 trillion, it's no surprise they collectively have such a dominant weighting in the Vanguard ETF.

Nvidia supplies the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are the main chips used in AI development. Demand is outstripping supply for the company's latest Blackwell Ultra chips, which could fuel significant revenue growth from here.
Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are three of Nvidia's biggest customers. They each develop AI models and software for their own purposes, but they also operate cloud platforms where they rent data center capacity to businesses that use it to deploy their own AI projects.
Social media giant Meta Platforms is another one of Nvidia's top customers. It integrated AI into its content recommendation engine to keep users on Facebook and Instagram for longer periods of time, but it also developed the world's most popular family of open-source large language models (LLMs) called Llama, which power new features like Meta AI.
Apple launched its Apple Intelligence software last year, introducing powerful new AI features for its iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. With 2.35 billion active devices worldwide, this company could be one of the biggest distributors of AI software to consumers. Then there is Tesla, which is a leading developer of AI-powered autonomous driving and robotics technologies.
Despite its substantial exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks, the Vanguard ETF does offer a splash of diversification. Non-technology megacap stocks like Eli Lilly, Visa, Costco Wholesale, and McDonald's are among its top 20 holdings.
The Vanguard ETF can help investors accelerate their returns
The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 13.8% since its inception in 2007, and an accelerated annual return of 18.9% over the last 10 years, specifically. However, given its high degree of portfolio concentration, investors shouldn't put all of their eggs into this ETF alone.
Instead, the fund could be an ideal addition to any diversified portfolio that has little or no exposure to the Magnificent Seven already. Let's say, for instance, an investor parked $20,000 in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF 10 years ago, which is arguably the most diversified fund money can buy because it holds 3,500 stocks. That $20,000 would have grown to around $78,825 today.
However, had the investor split the $20,000 by placing $10,000 in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF and the other $10,000 in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, they would be sitting on $95,882 today instead.
This approach aims to ensure that investors aren't overexposed to volatile trends like AI, helping to protect them against steep losses if the technology fails to live up to expectations in the long run."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-09T08:10:00,CoreWeave vs. Nebius: Wall Street Expects Double-Digit Gains From Only One of These AI Players,These AI stocks have surged in the triple digits this year.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=57f1dacac9f377a8398f074f0fd92f1ea1240597a5a3f180c816d3dbb582f530,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/coreweave-vs-nebius-wall-street-expects-gain/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/coreweave-vs-nebius-wall-street-expects-gain/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/coreweave-vs-nebius-wall-street-expects-gain/,fool.com,200,,"Investors have piled into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent years, buying shares of companies involved in various areas of the technology -- from chip designers to players in fields like voice AI. The industry offers investors a wide range of choices, and many of these have already delivered significant gains. For example, chip designer Nvidia and voice AI player SoundHound AI have advanced 1,300% and nearly 400%, respectively, over three years.
One area of AI that's emerged as a winning one is cloud infrastructure, most specifically the GPU-as-a-service (GPUaaS) space. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are the key chips driving crucial processes like the training and inferencing of models, so they are in great demand. GPUaaS companies allow customers to rent this compute as needed rather than going out and buying their own chips.
Two companies that have emerged as current and potentially future winners are CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) and Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%). Their stock prices have soared more than 200% and 300%, respectively, so far this year. Wall Street is optimistic about the future of these players, but expects double-digit gains from only one in the coming 12 months.
The CoreWeave story
CoreWeave's cloud offerings differ from those of major cloud providers because it specializes in AI workloads. Customers don't turn to CoreWeave for general cloud services but instead for top Nvidia GPUs to run their AI projects. Since CoreWeave focuses on this, it's able to optimize its offering to favor efficiency for its customers.
Another plus is that CoreWeave has a particularly close relationship with Nvidia. Nvidia owns 7% of CoreWeave stock, signaling the chip giant's confidence in this business. And CoreWeave has been the first to launch Nvidia's latest platforms, such as the Blackwell architecture. This is important because every day counts for customers aiming to run their workloads -- the sooner they can get their projects going, the sooner those projects can bring in revenue.
All of this has translated into explosive revenue growth for CoreWeave, with revenue advancing more than 400% year over year in the first quarter and revenue tripling year over year in the second quarter.
The Nebius story
Nebius, like CoreWeave, rents out compute to customers as well as access to managed services that they can use across their AI platforms. The company emerged last year after a reorganization of Russian technology company Yandex. Yandex businesses operating outside of Russia were kept and renamed Nebius, and the company's focus shifted to AI.
Nvidia also has a stake in this up-and-coming cloud company, holding 1,190,476 shares, representing about 1.5% of Nvidia's investment portfolio, while CoreWeave accounts for 91% of Nvidia's holdings. Still, any investment from the chip giant is positive as Nvidia has what it takes to clearly assess the AI story ahead and may be well positioned to select winners.
Like CoreWeave, Nebius has seen demand surge. In the company's latest earnings report, it said quarterly revenue climbed more than 600% to $105 million. And it increased its annual run rate revenue guidance to the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion -- up from an earlier forecast of $750 million to $1 billion.
What Wall Street predicts
Both of these stocks have roared higher recently. And now, a look at Wall Street's price forecasts shows the average prediction is for CoreWeave to advance 6% over the next 12 months and Nebius to climb 23%.
These are just the average predictions. The most optimistic analyst forecasts a 75% gain for CoreWeave and a 66% increase for Nebius.
Considering this, which stock should investors favor? Is one better than the other? Not necessarily.
Wall Street estimates aren't an exact science, so it's possible CoreWeave and Nebius may not perform as predicted over the coming months. And 12 months is a pretty short term, so this period is unlikely to define a stock's full potential.
It's better to take a long-term view, and here, we can see that both players could deliver revenue and stock performance thanks to demand for GPUaaS. Of course, there are risks involved in this newish market, so these stocks are better left to aggressive investors. But if you fall into this category, CoreWeave and Nebius both could make excellent additions to your long-term AI portfolio."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-09T07:30:00,Where Will Nvidia Be in 5 Years?,The company could see huge gains in market value.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=562a2aabaf1ba753d22327385ee92a11b08b7132b224344404068c32d1251f3d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/where-will-nvidia-be-in-5-years/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/where-will-nvidia-be-in-5-years/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/09/where-will-nvidia-be-in-5-years/,fool.com,200,,"The past five years have been big for Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). The company saw revenue explode higher, advancing more than 600% over that time period, and the stock price followed as it increased a mind-boggling 1,200%. The reason for this performance is clear: Nvidia got in early on a market that is worth billions of dollars today and may reach the trillion-dollar mark by the end of this decade.
I'm talking about the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Nvidia designed its graphics processing units (GPUs) to suit the needs of AI -- and those high-performance chips so far have been unbeatable. Meanwhile, Nvidia expanded its offerings into other products and services for AI customers to truly accompany them along the entire AI path.
So now the question investors might ask, especially at a time when everyone is talking about the scale-up of AI infrastructure, is: Where will Nvidia be in five years? Let's find out.
Fueling major AI tasks
Nvidia spent the past five years building up its AI strengths and its reputation as the place to go for the fastest GPUs around -- speed and general efficiency are important to customers because the faster they complete their AI projects, the sooner they can benefit from them. This has prompted customers, especially big tech players, to pile into Nvidia GPUs. These chips fuel major AI tasks, like the training and inferencing of models, so they are a critical part of any AI data center.
And this brings me to the subject of the infrastructure scale-up -- we're seeing this phase now and it should last into the next few years. In fact, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang expects AI infrastructure spending to reach as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade. And since data centers need GPUs, Nvidia is likely to win big as companies from Alphabet to Meta Platforms pour more investment into the AI buildout. (Both of these tech giants recently said they were increasing capital spending this year to support their AI investments.)
A commitment to innovation
While Nvidia is serving this demand, it will also do something that's key to maintaining its dominance, and that's releasing GPU updates, from the Vera Rubin system set for release next year to others to follow on an annual basis. This commitment to innovation should make it difficult for rivals to get in the way -- and customers' interest in accessing the most powerful chips available should keep them coming back to Nvidia.
At the same time, other significant projects might unfold. For example, Nvidia's work in robotics may progress, opening the door to what Huang has called a trillion-dollar market.
One of the first significant uses for Nvidia chips in robotics will be in the area of self-driving cars, according to Huang -- Nvidia's chips would train the software and power features in the car. Nvidia is steadily progressing here as it's signed on automakers from Mercedes-Benz to Toyota for its self-driving platforms.
A $10 trillion market cap
All of this could power Nvidia's earnings and share price higher -- even driving this company to $10 trillion in market value as I recently predicted. As I mentioned in that article, Nvidia would have to generate about $380 billion in annual sales in 2030 to keep its price-to-sales ratio in line with today's level.
This is something Nvidia clearly could accomplish, even if growth slows from the pace we've seen in recent quarters. In the latest quarter, revenue climbed 56%, and gains have been in the double- or triple-digits over the past few years. Considering the strong demand right now for Nvidia's GPUs as well as forecasts for AI infrastructure spending, it's unlikely that any slowdown in growth would be extreme.
So, with all of this in mind, where will Nvidia be in five years? I expect the company will continue to see double-digit growth in revenue thanks to its GPUs and related products, and Nvidia may even see significant progress in new growth areas like robotics. All of this could maintain its position as the world's biggest company and push it to a $10 trillion market cap five years from now."

In early July, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang appeared on news platform CNN to warn that while artificial intelligence would significantly boost workplace productivity in the coming years, it could lead to job losses if industries lacked innovation. NVIDIA provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Huang said he believed that as long as companies came up with fresh ideas, there was room for productivity and employment to thrive. But without new ambitions, productivity drives down, he said, potentially resulting in fewer jobs. Nvidia, which briefly reached $4 trillion in market value, is among the companies leading the AI revolution. The technology employed by the chipmaker has been used to power data centers that companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google use to operate their AI models and cloud services.
An analyst from Goldman Sachs recently raised the price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock to $210 from $200 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. He updated the company’s model to reflect its strategic investments and partnerships with OpenAI and others. He also sees significant upside to 2026 estimates for Nvidia. The company has a strong runway of growth from core customers, plus upside from non-traditional customers, contends the analyst.

In 2005, the two largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., when measured by market cap, were energy giant ExxonMobil at $392 billion and industrial bellwether General Electric worth $375 billion. Now, just 20 years later, technology companies spearheading advances in artificial intelligence (AI) rule the roost.
Four household names top the list. AI chipmaker Nvidia is the frontrunner at $4.5 trillion (as of this writing), regularly climbing to new heights. Cloud and software provider Microsoft takes up second place, worth $3.9 trillion. iPhone maker Apple is nipping at Microsoft's heels at $3.8 trillion, and search pioneer Alphabet rounds out the top four at $3 trillion.
With a market cap of nearly $2.4 trillion, it seems almost a foregone conclusion that Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) will soon join the fold. The company has numerous growth drivers that continue to defy detractors, and the vast opportunity represented by AI will likely take the company over the finish line into the $3 trillion club.
A rare triple threat
What sets Amazon apart from the competition is its triad of successful businesses. While it's impressive for a company to have even one industry-leading business, Amazon has two and a third that's a strong contender in its field.
First up is Amazon's flagship e-commerce platform. The company made its fortune as a pioneer in the nascent e-commerce space in 1994, before ultimately earning the moniker of ""Everything Store"" and becoming the world's largest online retailer. Amazon is also the world's second-largest retailer, behind just Walmart.
Results from the second quarter help illustrate the overall magnitude of the company's success. Net sales of $167.7 billion increased 13% year over year, with 61% of the topline coming from digital retail or third-party seller services. This fueled net income of $18.2 billion, up 35%.
Amazon's second industry-leading business -- and by far its most important segment -- is Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud infrastructure services business. AWS provides on-demand computing solutions, software applications, AI, and more.
The company continues to dominate the space it pioneered in 2002, with an estimated 30% of the market, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, with 20% and 13%, respectively, according to Statista. Furthermore, the cloud segment continues to grow at a respectable clip, up 17% year over year in the second quarter. AWS generated 19% of Amazon's revenue and 58% of operating income for the first six months of 2025, helping to fund the company's other growth initiatives.
Last but certainly not least is Amazon's fast-growing advertising business, which is fueled by its valuable product search, as well as Amazon Prime Video, live sports programming, Fire TV, and the company's live-streaming gaming platform, Twitch. Advertising revenue of $15.7 billion increased 23% year-over-year in the second quarter, accounting for 9% of total revenue. These statistics place Amazon third in the race for digital advertising dominance, behind only Google and Meta Platforms.
If that trio of successful businesses wasn't enough, Amazon is also one of the foremost authorities on AI, with more than 1,000 generative AI services and apps in development or already available for its cloud customers, and plans to offer many more. ""AI will be a substantial catalyst,"" according to CEO Andy Jassy.
The path to $3 trillion
Amazon has a market cap of roughly $2.35 trillion (as of this writing), so its stock price will only need to increase by roughly 27% to reach $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Amazon is expected to generate revenue of $708 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Amazon would need revenue of roughly $902 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.
Wall Street is currently predicting Amazon's growth will clock in at roughly 10% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2028. However, given its history of strong execution, that target us likely conservative and I predict the company will make the grade sooner.
Finally, at 34 times earnings, Amazon trades at a premium compared to a multiple of 31 for the S&P 500. That said, the company has delivered stock price gains of 712% over the past decade, far exceeding the 239% gains S&P 500. This helps illustrate why Amazon represents a compelling opportunity as it marches toward $3 trillion."

The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security recently issued the Nvidia export licenses under the terms of a bilateral AI agreement hashed out in May, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity so they could discuss a sensitive issue.
The people declined to specify all the customers, but did say that the approved shipments are for American companies — including Oracle — operating facilities in the Gulf nation. Permits were not issued for Nvidia shipments to local customers such as Abu Dhabi AI juggernaut G42.
The US licenses came after the UAE made concrete plans for a reciprocal amount of investment on American soil, a US official said. The official declined to specify the exact value of the approved chip shipments and Emirati investment.
Nvidia shares rose 1.8% in US trading to a record high.
Representatives for the UAE and G42 did not respond to requests for comment, while Nvidia declined to comment. “The Commerce Department is fully committed to the transformational US-UAE AI partnership deal,” an agency spokesperson said. Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The licenses mark the first permits for Nvidia AI chip sales to the Gulf nation since Trump took office. They are a tangible sign of progress on an agreement announced nearly five months ago, centered on a massive 5-gigawatt data center in the Gulf nation’s capital that counts OpenAI as an anchor tenant. Other companies involved in that project include Oracle, Cisco Systems Inc., Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. and G42.
The UAE accord has been the source of significant consternation in Washington, where some officials in the Trump administration and on Capitol Hill have questioned the wisdom of building such a large site outside the US, especially in a place where Beijing has developed significant business and economic ties. Some in Washington have also expressed concerns about AI partnerships in Saudi Arabia, which were announced in May while Trump was touring the region.
Securing the permits is a priority for the UAE, where some officials have grown frustrated with what they see as a slow pace of US approvals. The Gulf nation is spending massively on AI infrastructure at home and overseas.
Underpinning the AI deal is an Emirati promise to invest a whopping $1.4 trillion on American soil over the next ten years, a pledge the Gulf nation has not broken down into specific projects. The US, meanwhile, planned to approve up to 500,000 advanced American AI chips annually, with a fifth slated for G42.
It’s unclear when additional licenses may be issued, the people said. The timing of permits will depend in part on how the UAE’s specific investment plans unfold. Under the accord, the oil-rich UAE will match in investment what it receives in chip shipments, on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
The Persian Gulf has major AI appetite and the money to back it, making the region among the world’s most important markets — and financiers — for technology giants like Nvidia and OpenAI. Gulf nations including the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been subject to US restrictions on advanced AI chip shipments since 2023, over concerns that the technology could be diverted to China, which is subject to more sweeping semiconductor controls.
Under President Joe Biden, US officials significantly slowed those license approvals, as they worked on a global framework that ultimately capped the volume of chip sales to many nations including the UAE. Under that policy, which Trump’s team is not enforcing and has said it will formally rescind, companies could bypass national limits in exchange for security commitments.
Biden’s team issued some licenses for chip shipments to the UAE toward the end of his term, people familiar with the matter said. Also under his administration, G42 struck a partnership with Microsoft Corp., based in large part on the Emirati firm’s promise to unravel ties with China’s Huawei Technologies Co.
Trump’s team, meanwhile, wants to go bigger. The Abu Dhabi data center was one of a spate of AI announcements to emerge from Trump’s trip to the Middle East in May. Officials have said the strategy is about both winning significant investment in the US and ensuring that Chinese companies such as Huawei don’t capture overseas customers in the AI race between the world’s two largest economies.
“President Trump’s policy boxes China out of the Middle East whereas the previous administration’s policy forced these countries into China’s arms,” White House AI czar David Sacks said this week.
Huawei has tried to woo customers in the UAE, Bloomberg reported in July, though it had gained little traction at the time. The company was offering potential clients a few thousand of its Ascend 910B AI chips, a generation-old model, plus remote access to more advanced systems located in China.
While Sacks and others have argued that’s a reason for the US to move faster, some Trump officials saw the small size of Huawei’s pitch as evidence that the Chinese hardware giant has a limited capacity to compete.
Prior to Trump’s trip, the US plan at one point had been to approve up to about 100,000 advanced AI chips annually, people familiar with the matter said. That later became up to 500,000 chips each year — an increase for which some officials feel the US did not get enough in return, particularly with regard to China-related issues. The officials believed that the bilateral accord from May lacked sufficiently detailed security conditions for the chip shipments, headed to a place with close ties to Beijing.
Sacks previously said the “vast majority” of advanced chips in the UAE “will be owned and operated by American cloud companies” — in line with the arrangement for G42 to get a fifth of the total shipments to the country.
But when local companies like G42 might secure those licenses, and under what conditions, remains an open question. Just a few weeks after Trump’s trip ended, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told lawmakers that “we are going to allow our allies to buy AI chips, provided they’re run by an approved American data center operator, and the cloud that touches that data center is an approved American operator.”

On Tuesday, Jim Cramer reflected on his early conviction in Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), calling CEO Jensen Huang one of the most visionary leaders in tech history as the chipmaker's meteoric rise continues.
Jim Cramer Says Jensen Huang Saw The Future Before Everyone Else
Appearing on CNBC's Closing Bell Overtime, Cramer revisited his first recommendation of Nvidia back in 2009 — when shares were trading for just a fraction of today's price.
He said Huang, whom he first interviewed in 2010, had a 20-year view of the world that investors initially failed to understand.
""I thought that Nvidia was a gaming chip company,"" Cramer said. Later, he realized it was powering some of the most advanced systems in the world — cars, robotics, AI.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
He recalled visiting Nvidia's headquarters years ago, where Huang demonstrated early robotic experiments.
""He’s a Socratic teacher. And you started realizing, maybe I’m just in the presence of someone very different who’s got a view 20 years ahead,"" Cramer recalled.
From Gaming To AI Powerhouse: The Stock That Minted Millionaires
Since Cramer's 2009 call, Nvidia has surged tremendously. Just in the past five years, Nvidia's stock price has risen by 1,244.77%, according to Benzinga Pro.
The company's market cap has ballooned to more than $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable firm.
At a meeting of his CNBC Investing Club earlier in the day, Cramer said Huang personally thanked investors who held onto Nvidia for the long haul. ""He’s a gracious, terrific person and he just wanted to thank people for owning it, not trading it.""

Cramer Warns Against Hot Stock Mentality Amid AI Boom
Despite Nvidia's rise, Cramer cautioned investors against chasing the stock blindly during what some call an AI bubble.
He urged investors to focus on conviction rather than hype, saying if investors believe in what Huang's building — a $4 trillion company that no one thought could be worth $1 trillion — then they'll sleep well at night.
Earlier in the day, during a conversation with Cramer, Huang said that longtime competitor Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) spent over 30 years “trying to kill” his company — yet the two chip giants have now joined forces in a $5 billion partnership."

Schneider Electric Investment Narrative Recap
Investors in Schneider Electric typically share a belief in the company's strong positioning within digital infrastructure and energy management, underpinned by accelerating demand for AI and data center solutions. The recent announcement of advanced AI data center reference designs with NVIDIA could bolster Schneider’s short-term catalyst of capturing a larger share of the fast-growing AI infrastructure market, though risks such as persistent margin pressure due to heavy R&D spend and market mix remain front of mind for shareholders. The impact of this news is positive for near-term growth outlook, although the ongoing margin pressure, especially related to Systems growth and integration costs, is a key risk that may temper some of the enthusiasm in the short run.
Among recent announcements, Schneider's acquisition of Motivair and the integration of liquid cooling technology stand out as highly relevant, directly complementing these new NVIDIA-driven data center solutions. This positions Schneider Electric to address rising energy and cooling demands in next-generation AI deployments, which supports the company’s most important catalyst of data center-led growth.
However, it is important for investors to remain vigilant since ongoing R&D and expansion expenses could pressure margins if expected infrastructure demand fails to materialize as quickly as hoped...

At nearly the same moment as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was expressing surprise over OpenAI’s multibillion-dollar deal with competitor AMD — shortly after his company agreed to invest up to $100 billion into the AI model maker — Sam Altman was saying that more such deals are in the works.
Huang appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Wednesday. When asked if he knew about the AMD deal before it was announced, he answered, “Not really.”
As TechCrunch previously reported, OpenAI’s deal with AMD is unusual. AMD has agreed to grant OpenAI large tranches of AMD stock — up to 10% of the company over a period of years contingent on factors like increases in stock price. In exchange, OpenAI will use and help develop the chipmaker’s next-generation AI GPUs chips. This makes OpenAI a shareholder in AMD.
Nvidia’s deal is the reverse. Nvidia has invested in the AI model-making startup, making it a shareholder in OpenAI.
While OpenAI has been using Nvidia gear for years through cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Oracle OCI, and CoreWeave, “This is the first time we’re going to sell directly to them,” Huang explained. He added that his company would still continue to supply gear to the cloud makers, too.
These direct sales, which include AI gear beyond GPUs like systems and networking, are intended to “prepare” OpenAI for the day when it is its own “self-hosted hyperscaler,” Huang said. In other words, when it’s using its own data centers.
But Huang admits that OpenAI doesn’t “have the money yet” to pay for all of this gear. He estimated that each gigawatt of AI data center will cost OpenAI “$50 to $60 billion,” to cover everything from the land and power to the servers and equipment.
So far, in 2025, OpenAI has commissioned 10 gigawatts’ worth of U.S. facilities through its $500 billion Stargate deal with partners Oracle and SoftBank. (Plus, it penned a $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle.)
Its partnership with Nvidia was for at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. Its partnership with AMD was for 6 gigawatts. Plus its “Stargate UK” partnership involves expanding data centers in the U.K., and it has other European commitments. By some estimates, OpenAI has this year inked $1 trillion worth of such deals.
Similar to the AMD deal, Nvidia’s deal has been criticized for being “circular,” Bloomberg reported. The critics say Nvidia is essentially underwriting OpenAI’s purchases, getting the AI startup’s stock for its efforts.
Altman to the world: Expect more

- Grant Cardone views Bitcoin as a superior store of value to gold.
- Hedge fund innovator Ray Dalio has urged investors to own a combination.
- The precious metal has outperformed Nvidia this year.
Investors may see opportunity in gold’s historic rally, but they shouldn’t be selling Bitcoin to latch onto the precious metal, according to real estate investor and entrepreneur Grant Cardone.
Although gold’s price has increased more than 50% this year, while outperforming Wall Street darlings like Nvidia, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization remains a superior store of value and has better long-term prospects, he told Decrypt in an interview.
“Don’t be stupid,” Cardone said on Wednesday. “I wouldn’t be chasing this thing right now. For every Bitcoin you sell, you’re going to cost yourself a million dollars.”
Cardone’s assessment comes as investors are piling into alternative assets as a way to shield themselves from a potential slump in the U.S. economy and accompanying drop in the U.S. dollar, a dynamic that analysts and onlookers have dubbed the debasement trade.
On Wednesday, gold’s price crossed the $4,000 an ounce level for the first time. A day before, Bitcoin’s price set an all-time high of $126,000, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.
A Myriad market found that 60% of respondents believe Bitcoin is more likely to ascend to $140,000 than dip to $110,000. Myriad is part of Dastan, the parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.
Today, Bitcoin’s price may be more volatile than gold’s, but Cardone thinks that technological innovations will dull the precious metal’s luster in years to come. He said automation could negatively affect gold’s scarcity, pointing to reduced labor costs inherent in robots.
“Once Elon’s Optimus works, you can dig 24/7, 365 with no payroll,” he said, referring to the billionaire tech CEO’s robotics push at electric carmaker Tesla. “The amount of gold we mine is limited to the number of people that can mine it.”
That’s distinct compared to Bitcoin, which has a total supply of 21 million, and real estate, which faces geographical constraints, he added. Projections suggest that 2093 will be the year that the penultimate Bitcoin will be mined, based on the network’s current rules.
Investors may seek exchange-traded funds that are backed by gold, but Cardone argued that they are effectively investing in paper. In order for them to truly own gold. They have to manage the asset’s custody, while running the risk that it’s stolen, Cardone said.
For investors holding Bitcoin in self-custodial wallets, the same principles apply. But Cardone noted that Bitcoin doesn’t require a physical vault, while also being easier to spend.
Cardone may prefer Bitcoin to gold, but other entrepreneurs have advocated for a combination of both, including star hedge fund investor Ray Dalio. In late July, when gold was changing hands around $3,300 an ounce, he urged investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to them.
At the time, he said rising government debts hadn’t been priced into global markets, and was “strongly preferring” gold. Last month, he echoed that sentiment, saying the U.S. risks a “debt-fueled heart attack” if the government doesn’t reign in spendthrift habits.
The Bridgewater Associates founder has argued that Bitcoin is unlikely to be adopted by central banks as a reserve currency because it lacks privacy. He also raised doubts about whether changes to Bitcoin’s codebase could make it a “less effective” store of value.
This week, investment firm VanEck estimated that Bitcoin could capture half of gold’s $26 trillion market capitalization, but that could take several years. Bitcoin is currently valued at $2.4 trillion compared to $1.2 trillion a year ago.
This year, Cardone began mixing real estate and Bitcoin in funds offered to accredited investors through Cardone Capital, which manages a $5 billion portfolio. As tenants living in commercial properties pay rent, those funds are allocated to Bitcoin over time.
Even then, Cardone said he’s encouraged several curious Bitcoiners to stand pat.
“I’ve had people come to me and say, ‘Hey, I want to invest Bitcoin into your projects.’ And I'm like, ‘Why would you do that?’” he said. “Why don’t you just keep your Bitcoin and convert some of your cash? I don’t know why someone would get rid of that asset.”"

Big money pouring into AI, and this time, it's Elon Musk and Nvidia at the center of it. Bloomberg is reporting that xAI is raising up to $20 billion with Nvidia investing as much as 2 billion into Musk's AI startup. For more, we want to bring in here John McNeil, DBX Ventures CEO, co-founder of Vista Shares and former president at Tesla. John, uh good to see you. So reports showing Jensen Wong, uh doing more investing. John Nvidia apparently investing 2 billion in xAI.
What what do you make of that, John, that headline and what if anything does it tell you about that mega AI trade and trend?
Hey Josh, I think what it says is that uh, Nvidia and and Jensen are deploying their balance sheet uh in in in very productive ways. I think there's a lot of VCs that would love to have Jensen's returns right now. I think he's up like five or 6X on Core Weave. Uh, he's up similar amounts in his in in their investments into OpenAI.
Uh they've invested into xAI along the way uh and uh wave, Anthropic, others. So he's he and Nvidia are building a uh kind of an envious portfolio uh that uh that's generating um the combination of great returns for their balance sheet, but also, uh also really seeding uh customers uh purchasing ahead of uh ahead of where their demand is.
Let me ask you, John, with all this money Musk is raising here, does it change at all the competitive landscape, you know, with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google?
I think what what's happening is that with the large large, large language model producers, uh, so OpenAI, Anthropic, uh X AI, they are kind of each of them uh in a race that kind of gets rescored monthly as to to who's at the top of the leaderboard. But they're all generating very similar now uh results across general uh areas uh of expertise. But when you look
particularly into specific verticals like coding. Uh, XAI is is making dramatic gains and and are coming up at the top of a lot of folks's leaderboards. So, uh I think the the main story here, it doesn't change. It takes a lot of capital to train these large models. Uh and we're seeing some parity now amongst uh the very, very largest of these large language model companies."

Uh, a deal like this, Lisa, doesn't happen overnight. You don't wake up Sunday thinking, all right, we're going to announce this on Monday. When did you start working on it and how what was it like working with a with a Sam Altman to to get this through uh the finish line?
Well, um, the key, Brian, and I've I've told you this before, the key in our uh world is it's all about roadmap. It's all about the technology. It's all about ensuring that we're meeting uh the performance capabilities for the most demanding um foundational models. And that's what OpenAI has. I mean, they have, um, you know, brilliant engineers, their models are used everywhere. And so this has been a process. It's been, you know, several years in the making. Um, it started with them testing our MI 300 and doing some early work on MI 300, uh that moved to MI 350. We've done a lot of work on software.
And, you know, it's culminating in, you know, they've given us feedback on what they believe best in class is. And MI 450, which we have coming next year is absolutely that. It's best in class, you know, AI computing and, you know, the fact is, um, having a, a team that is, you know, so much at the center of the global AI AI buildout, being super excited to be a lead customer for MI 450. I think it's a great thing for us. It'll push us, uh, to get the technology out even faster. And uh, yeah, it's it's been, um, a couple, a couple of years in the making, but, um, we're super excited to be able to talk about, you know, sort of the the breadth and the depth of, uh, this relationship, you know, as it relates to our overall AI capabilities in the AI business.
Lisa, I'm trying hard to make sure I got all these these terminologies down correct. So bear with me if I get one wrong. So what would deploying 6 gigawatts, how does that change the future of AI and what does that mean to the average person who's only now starting to come across AI agents on various platforms?
Well, uh, Brian, it's a great question. I mean, I think we've all experimented with AI, you know, people, you know, think about chat GPT and Gemini and asking it questions. Um, but what we're seeing is this is really only the very beginning of people, uh, taking AI and using it, uh, for um, improving businesses, for improving research, for improving, um, you know, all kinds of capabilities. And what we see is, you know, to get more capability, you need more compute. So the work that we're doing is building the foundation of this AI world. And, you know, what we want is to make sure, like every time you have something that you want to use AI for, there needs to be able to have enough compute on demand. And that's why we're talking about building multiple gigawatts. I mean, it is, you know, once you build out all 6 gigawatts, I mean you're talking about millions of GPUs and that millions of GPUs will go towards every user having, you know, sort of intelligence at their fingertips.
How difficult is it to build out this type of infrastructure?
It's incredibly difficult. Let me say, Brian, it is incredibly difficult. Uh, but we have been working on this for years. And, you know, sort of our technology is really around the chips about ensuring that, um, you know, we are constantly looking for pushing the envelope, um, on sort of the next generation. So we're really excited about our MI 450 uh generation. It has um 2 nanometer technology, so the most advanced fabrication uh capability, it has, you know, rack scale solutions. So we're really putting all of these, um, you know, compute elements together. And the way to think about it is it takes a village to build this all. So, you know, we are, of course, very, you know, proud and focused and dedicated on our piece of it. Uh, but it's us, it's our cloud service partners, um, it's obviously open AI and the model users. We all need to come together, you know, plan this infrastructure together, make sure there's enough power in the world, uh for all of this AI compute. And once we put it all together, uh, you know, we deliver just, you know, fantastic capability to the world.
Is there enough power?
There is not enough, but we are actively building everywhere. I mean, this is, you know, all about uh, ensuring that there's enough power, certainly in the United States. I think there has been tremendous focus uh by this administration of ensuring that, you know, AI is top of bind and uh that's super important. Um, it's ensuring that we have enough manufacturing capacity uh to do this. It's all of the above. And so I would say that the industry is coming together. I mean, this is one of those points in time where you need every part of the, the food chain to come together and say, um, we want to do this, you know, we want to build fast, we want to build big. And uh, we're all putting our best efforts, um, you know, towards this, uh, towards this big vision.
So much has happened, uh, since I last talked to you, Lisa. I mean, of course, this deal is is very much front and center. We have, uh, the US government now has a stake in Intel, which wasn't on my bingo card coming into this year. Uh, some would say these tie ups are causing risks to the AI industry or even the, the tech industry. What do you say to those critics?
You know, Brian, I would say that that's probably thinking too small. Um, I mean, you have to really look at, you know, what the power of this technology can do for the world. And if you think about all of the applications that can take advantage of AI and computing and, you know, sort of the, the massive investments that will have, you know, significant returns on the other end, um, it takes time to build all this out. So yes, you know, there are, you know, we are investing heavily, some might say investing ahead of the curve. I actually say investing, um, at the right pace because we want to accelerate. You know, this is a place where when, you know, companies and and uh partners make bold moves, um, it will be rewarded because we will do things that you previously thought weren't possible. We're actually bringing the industry ecosystem together so that we're actually, you know, getting the best of each of our teams so that we can actually accelerate the rate and pace of um deployment and and AI innovation.
So, you know, I really believe that this is the beginning of a, you know, 10-year kind of super cycle and we're very in the very early innings of this. Um, I think Brian, you know, I used to say that I thought the AI tam just for, you know, silicon accelerators sort of our piece of the business was going to be, you know, 500 billion dollars and some people thought, boy, that was a big number. And and now maybe I've underestimated that number and we have a lot of clear, um, you know, demand across the world, you know, for this um infrastructure."

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) received a fresh boost from Wall Street after Goldman Sachs raised its price target to $210, up from $200, citing stronger profit outlooks and strategic upside from its expanding role in artificial intelligence partnerships.
Goldman maintained its Buy rating on the stock, applying a 35-times price-to-earnings multiple to its updated normalized earnings estimate of $6 per share, up from $5.75. The analysts said Nvidia's equity stakes and supply deals with AI developers including OpenAI reinforce its market position and strengthen its CUDA software ecosystem.
The bank noted that investors are debating the structure of Nvidia's recent equity-linked transactions, where funds invested in AI companies could be recycled into GPU purchases from Nvidia a setup analysts called circular revenue. Goldman said such dynamics may weigh slightly on valuation multiples but viewed the partnerships as strategically beneficial over the long term.
Goldman estimated OpenAI's infrastructure spending could reach as much as $75 billion in 2026, supported by equity and debt financing from partners such as Oracle, which recently raised $18 billion to fund its AI initiatives.
The firm said it remains confident in Nvidia's growth prospects, expecting circular deal revenue to represent less than 15% of total sales by 2027, with strong demand continuing from both traditional data center clients and new AI entrants."

That’s the question GOBankingRates reader Betty recently shared with our Top 100 Money Experts series.
We knew just who should answer it: Dr. Preston D. Cherry, a financial planner who calls himself “a life designer in the world of wealth.” He’s also the founder of Concurrent Wealth Management and author of “Wealth in the Key of Life.” His experience enables him to guide people like Betty through major decisions about how to build wealth.

“When people ask where to put $50,000, they often expect a hot tip: ‘Buy Nvidia,’ ‘Put it in gold,’ or ‘Go all in on Bitcoin,'” he said. “The truth is, the right answer depends on your financial foundation, your life stage and your long-term goals.”
While Betty didn’t specify a timeline, we’ll use a 10-year horizon as an example of how someone might grow $50,000. The principles Cherry outlines still apply — the timeline simply shapes how much risk you can take on and how you should balance your investments.
For Cherry, the answer to Betty’s underlying question — how can she maximize growth on that $50,000? — goes far beyond what type of account she should use. Using his “Alignment Sequence,” a framework for directing your money wisely, he offered her more holistic advice.
Start by Thinking of Your Broader Financial Stability
Cherry wants Betty to begin her investment journey by asking a few key questions to assess her financial stability:
-
Does she have three to six months of emergency savings?
-
Does her core insurance plan offer adequate coverage?
-
Is her high-interest debt under control?
If the answers are yes, she has a solid foundation to begin investing.
Once she’s financially secure in the present, Cherry recommends turning her focus toward the future — specifically, her retirement readiness.
“$50,000 is powerful, but it only works if it’s built on a solid foundation,” he said.

Factor in Your Stage in Life
Betty may be wondering whether to invest in a tax-advantaged account or a brokerage account. According to Cherry, that decision should depend on her stage in life and financial goals.
“If retirement is the goal and you’re eligible, a Roth or traditional IRA can be the best home because of tax benefits,” he said. “If you’re employed, a 401(k) with an employer match and tax deferral may fit.”"

- The 6GW agreement gives OpenAI the option to buy up to 160 million AMD shares while securing Instinct MI450 chips—its boldest hedge yet against Nvidia’s dominance.
- AMD’s software gap may still haunt the deal, but the equity tie makes OpenAI a partner in fixing it.
- Wall Street cheered, sending AMD shares skyrocketing as Nvidia slipped and the GPU arms race reached new extremes.
AMD struck its biggest AI deal yet Monday morning, securing a 6 gigawatt GPU contract with OpenAI. The partnership gives OpenAI the option to acquire up to 160 million AMD shares—roughly 10% of the company—while AMD commits to delivering its next-generation Instinct MI450 chips starting in late 2026.
The deal comes just two weeks after Nvidia announced its own $100 billion partnership with OpenAI for 10 gigawatts of compute capacity. OpenAI's dual-supplier strategy reflects a calculated hedge: The ChatGPT maker needs 16 gigawatts total to power its infrastructure ambitions, and relying solely on Nvidia carries too much risk in a market where GPU shortages have become routine.
AMD CEO Lisa Su called it ""the world's most ambitious AI buildout,"" projecting tens of billions in revenue over the next four years, according to CNN. The warrant structure ties AMD's payoff directly to execution—shares vest as OpenAI scales from one gigawatt to the full six, with additional triggers linked to AMD hitting specific stock price targets that climb as high as $600 per share.
Wall Street's reaction was immediate. AMD shares opened at $226 in Monday trading, up from Friday's close of $164.67 while hitting its highest price in at least a year and a half. At the current price of $207, it's up more than 25% on the day.
Nvidia, on the other hand, fell 1% on the news.
The hardware battle is won with software
OpenAI is burning through capital at an unprecedented rate, with projected losses hitting billions despite expected revenue of $12.7 billion in 2025 according to Bloomberg. The company needs cheaper alternatives to Nvidia's premium-priced chips, which currently controls roughly 70%–95% of the data center AI accelerator market according to estimations.
AMD's MI450 series promises competitive specs—greater memory capacity than Nvidia's Blackwell chips and comparable performance on large language model benchmarks. But hardware is only half the equation. AMD's ROCm software platform, its answer to Nvidia's CUDA, remains the company's Achilles heel.
CUDA has spent 18 years becoming the industry standard, with five million developers and seamless integration across PyTorch, TensorFlow, and every major AI framework.
ROCm, despite being open-source, suffers from a broken out-of-the-box experience which AI developers don’t want to deal with. For example, recent testing by SemiAnalysis found AMD's MI300X chips couldn't run standard models without extensive debugging, with researchers calling the software ""riddled with bugs.""
The software gap explains why AMD is practically giving away equity to land this deal. While Nvidia commands premium prices based on CUDA's reliability, AMD has to sweeten the pot with warrants and promises of joint development.
The broader chip wars are intensifying. Elon Musk's xAI plans to spend $12 billion on Nvidia GPUs for its Memphis supercomputer. Google continues developing its TPUs. Amazon pushes its Trainium chips. And OpenAI itself is reportedly working with Broadcom on a $10 billion custom ""Titan XPU"" chip for inference, targeting production in 2026.
The economics driving this shift are stark. A single Nvidia GB300 NVL72 rack costs roughly $3 million. OpenAI's infrastructure roadmap calls for 23 gigawatts of capacity, translating to hundreds of billions in hardware costs. Custom chips and alternative suppliers like AMD offer potential savings of 30-50% per compute unit.
For AMD, landing OpenAI validates its AI ambitions after years of playing catch-up. The company's data center revenue hit $3.24 billion last quarter, up 14% year-over-year. But until ROCm matches CUDA's stability, AMD will struggle to convert this marquee win into broader market share.
This, of course, can be easier to achieve now that OpenAI is sitting at the table with AMD executives, owning 10% of the company. OpenAI's engineering resources can help close that gap, but most customers won't have that luxury.
Meanwhile, Nvidia keeps its 80% market share and premium pricing—for now."

OpenAI is a private company, but investors can leverage the ChatGPT maker's growing list of publicly traded business partners

November marks the third anniversary of OpenAI’s ChatGPT release. ChatGPT ushered in a new consumer-driven era for generative artificial intelligence and was an immediate hit, gathering 100 million users in its first month.
Fast forward to late 2025, and the ChatGPT large language model is attracting 800 million weekly users, most of whom use the platform to answer queries, write emails, and help with software coding, among other benefits.
With ChatGPT as its cornerstone, OpenAI has become an industry leader in the AI space, partnering with technology companies, building foundational ties with world governments, and generating hundreds of billions of dollars in the process. As of October 2025, the startup is valued at a staggering $500 billion, a number that has Wall Street mesmerized but limited in capitalizing on the company's growing wealth.
OpenAI announced a sweeping deal Monday with chipmaker AMD to secure processors for artificial intelligence systems, an agreement that could give the ChatGPT maker a 10% stake in AMD and further speeds up its trillion-dollar infrastructure push. It was the latest in a string of infrastructure deals for OpenAI. The company has pledged roughly $1 trillion in the last two weeks to expand its computing base, including a dedicated supply agreement with Nvidia.
As a private company, OpenAI doesn’t have a stock symbol and cannot be traded on public exchanges. There is, however, a loophole or two that enable investors to leverage OpenAI’s growing list of publicly traded business partners and buy their shares of stock.
Which OpenAI-linked stocks make the most sense right now, especially for investors not used to mixing and matching a nonprofit technology powerhouse with its publicly-traded partners?
These three AI-themed and OpenAI-connected stocks (and one fund) should fit the bill.
Applied Digital (APLD)
Year-to-date performance: +268.0%
Often, the OpenAI link comes with more than two dance partners, and Applied Digital is a good example.
“CoreWeave has leased significant data center capacity from Applied Digital,” said Mark Klein, chief executive officer at SuRo Capita, a publicly traded investment fund company. “As a result, APLD’s stock has experienced meaningful movement, benefiting indirectly from OpenAI’s scale-up via CoreWeave.”
Corning (GLW)
Year-to-date performance: +79.6%
In the glass and fiber sector, Corning has emerged as a dominant supplier of fiber optics for AI data centers.
“They’re benefiting from decades of glass research and development,” Klein said. “As data center growth continues, so too will the demand for these solutions.”
AMD (AMD)
Year-to-date performance: +72.7%
This week, AMD announced a new deal with OpenAI that sees the semiconductor giant providing a 6-gigawatt agreement to power OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure across multiple generations of AMD Instinct GPUs. According to the announcement, the first 1-gigawatt deployment of AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2026. Additionally, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock to support the deal.
“Our partnership with OpenAI is expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD while accelerating OpenAI’s AI infrastructure buildout,” said Jean Hu, chief financial officer and treasurer at AMD, in a statement. “This agreement creates significant strategic alignment and shareholder value for both AMD and OpenAI and is expected to be highly accretive to AMD’s non-GAAP earnings-per-share.”
Market experts say that while Nvidia is the market leader for AI chips, the AMD-OpenAI deal illustrates that OpenAI has a significant amount of confidence in the performance of the firm's chips.
“Nvidia has indicated that demand is far outpacing supply, but it is not clear whether the company could have fulfilled an expanded order from OpenAI,” said Dave Novosel, senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, in Orland Park, Illinois. “The lead time is extensive as the order will not be filled until next year. Furthermore, the warrants provide the opportunity to share in the upside of AMD’s success as measured by the share price.”
. . . and one fund
Main Street investors can also invest in OpenAI, at least indirectly, via the Fundrise Innovation Fund.
While the fund is privately held, regular investors can invest in the Innovation Fund via the company’s website. The fund holds positions in 16 technology-themed companies, including OpenAI, which will be visible once you sign up for the fund. One word of caution; the fund comes with a hefty 1.85% management fee, which is significantly higher than most investment funds, especially exchange-traded funds.

The companies announced the plan to develop AI data centers that the chipmaker said would bring in tens of billions of dollars in new revenue over the next five years.
AMD's share price surged 35 percent when markets opened on news of the agreement that would see the company deliver six gigawatts worth of chips to the ChatGPT-maker.
OpenAI sits at the center of an AI investment bonanza to power the promised artificial intelligence revolution.
It oversees the Stargate project, which has secured $400 billion of the $500 billion planned by 2029 for giant data centers in Texas, New Mexico and an undisclosed site in the US Midwest.
The deal with AMD follows a contract with Nvidia for more than $100 billion in equipment intended to increase OpenAI's generative AI capabilities.
Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are by far the dominant player in the AI field, with its products integrated into the company's software ecosystem, making it harder for rivals to compete.
""We need as much computing power as we can possibly get,"" OpenAI President Greg Brockman said Monday on CNBC following the announcement.
""What we're really seeing is a world where there's going to be absolute compute scarcity, because there's going to be so much demand for AI services and not just from OpenAI,"" he added.
California-based AMD generates the bulk of its revenue from CPU sales -- processors used for personal and business computers that are less powerful than GPUs.
OpenAI last week also signed a chip deal with South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix.
Data server giant Oracle, a major partner of the Stargate program, also saw its share price skyrocket by 35 percent last month when it announced its own deal with OpenAI.
It was not immediately clear how OpenAI would finance the deals.
OpenAI is years away from turning a profit, with the costs of computing needed to power the company's AI needs far surpassing revenue from paying customers of ChatGPT and other products.
However, Wall Street's faith in the future of AI remains strong, and OpenAI is now the world's most valuable private company, surpassing Elon Musk's SpaceX, worth $500 billion, with investment still pouring in.
Monday's announcement shows OpenAI moving to diversify its supply of semiconductors so that it does not depend solely on US powerhouse Nvidia for the GPUs that are key to the development of generative AI."

The increasing demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) that can handle the rigors of AI has been unparalleled, but not all AI chipmakers are created equal.
There's no denying that Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has been the biggest beneficiary of the accelerating adoption of AI, given its status as a market share leader in the data center space, where most AI processing occurs. Nvidia has ridden this unprecedented demand to new heights, becoming the largest publicly traded company in the world when measured by market cap.
While Nvidia stock has soared 1,180% since the dawn of AI, AMD stock has only risen 154% during the same period (as of market close on Friday). The company has been working diligently to stake its claim in the windfall that is AI.
Shareholders were elated when AMD announced a groundbreaking deal with OpenAI that could be a game changer. As a result, the stock gained 30% Monday morning (as of this writing) -- and that could be just the beginning.
Far-reaching strategic partnership
OpenAI is largely credited with kick-starting the AI revolution, thanks to its development of ChatGPT, the generative AI system that took the technology to the next level. In a press release that dropped Monday morning, AMD announced a far-reaching strategic partnership with OpenAI.
Under the terms of the multiyear, multigenerational agreement, OpenAI will install 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs. The rollout will begin with 1 gigawatt of AMD Instinct MI450 series chips and rack-scale AI solutions in the second half of 2026. Beyond simply supplying GPUs, AMD will work side by side with OpenAI as a ""core strategic compute partner"" to create future generations of AI chips optimized for AI applications.
The companies noted that the partnership began with the MI300X and continued with the MI350X series of chips. Many experts believe these processors are a competitive alternative to Nvidia's advanced AI chips at a lower price, making them ideal for use with the large language models that underpin generative AI.
Perhaps the most eye-opening development is that, as part of the agreement, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant to purchase up to 160 million shares of AMD stock -- equal to a roughly 10% stake in the company -- contingent upon the company achieving specific share price targets and OpenAI reaching certain technical and commercial milestones.
The first tranche is scheduled to vest on the completion of the deployment of the first gigawatt of GPUs, with additional milestones at the completion of each successive gigawatt.
Is this deal a game changer?
In many cases, saying a deal is a game changer is hyperbole, but in this case, I don't believe it's an exaggeration. In its recent financing deal, OpenAI was valued at roughly $500 billion, making it the world's most valuable start-up. Furthermore, the company has quickly ascended the ranks to become one of the largest buyers of high-end AI-centric chips as it works to development its next-generation AI systems.
Assuming things go as planned, this deal provides AMD with a relatively secure revenue stream that the company estimates will be worth tens of billions of dollars. For context, the company generated revenue of nearly $26 billion in 2024, which helps to illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity.
Furthermore, this deal acts as a ringing endorsement for AMD's processors. For potential buyers of AMD chips sitting on the fence, this could be the catalyst for taking the plunge and adopting the company's AI solutions.
Some investors have been concerned that the adoption of AI will hit a wall, but there's simply no evidence to support these assertions. Furthermore, estimates regarding the addressable market for generative AI continue to climb. Big Four accounting firm PwC estimates the market could be worth as much as $15.7 trillion annually by 2030.
If AMD can carve out just a small piece of that massive opportunity, today's stock price move could be just the beginning. Furthermore, at roughly 35 times next year's sales, AMD stock is attractively priced relative to the burgeoning opportunity."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-06T17:35:00,3 Reasons You'll Regret Not Buying Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Before 2025 Is Over,Taiwan Semiconductor is a top AI investment.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1aa47ae4e57ff04c76e10a8bc01455bcc8d9c4c95372c3276916fae32bc0a162,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/3-reasons-youll-regret-not-buying-taiwan-semicondu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/3-reasons-youll-regret-not-buying-taiwan-semicondu/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/06/3-reasons-youll-regret-not-buying-taiwan-semicondu/,fool.com,200,,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.22%) has had an excellent 2025 so far, up nearly 50% this year. However, I still think the stock has more room to run through the end of this year and into 2026.
I've got three reasons why Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is an excellent buy, and investors would be wise to take action now and scoop up shares before the rest of the market does.
1. Increasing chip demand
One of Taiwan Semiconductor's largest clients is Nvidia. Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures chips for its clients because they don't have the ability to do it themselves. So, when a client like Nvidia talks about massive growth, it will benefit TSMC.
During Nvidia's Q2 conference call, Nvidia's management noted that they expect global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's monster growth, and if it pans out, it translates into massive growth for Taiwan Semiconductor.
That's not the only trend that's benefiting Taiwan Semiconductor.
If you look at other promising technologies, like autonomous driving, quantum computing, and humanoid robots, all of those technologies require advanced chips, which are likely sourced from Taiwan Semiconductor.
An investment in Taiwan Semiconductor is a bet that we're going to use more advanced chips in greater quantities, which seems like a no-brainer prediction to me. As a result, Taiwan Semiconductor appears to be a genius buy based on demand alone.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor is investing a ton of money in its U.S. facilities
Taiwan Semiconductor is also expanding outside of its base island to stand up facilities in multiple other countries, including the U.S. While some may point to U.S. tariff policies as the reason, investors should be cheering on this expansion. One of the biggest risks in investing in Taiwan Semiconductor is the fear of a mainland China takeover. This would sink the stock price, but if Taiwan Semiconductor had facilities in other parts of the world, it would soften the blow.
Taiwan Semiconductor has invested $165 billion in new chip facilities in the U.S., and that could be just the beginning if the company finds out that it hasn't built out enough capacity to satisfy U.S. demand. At its existing U.S. facility, Taiwan Semiconductor had reportedly sold out chip capacity through 2027, so there's clear demand for U.S.-produced chips.
Increased U.S. production is a good thing for U.S. companies and Taiwan Semiconductor alike, and I think it makes it a compelling stock to invest in.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor is always innovating
One of the reasons why Taiwan Semiconductor has become the top chip foundry is its culture of continuous improvement and innovation. Although TSMC has leading 3nm (nanometer) chip nodes, it's developing more advanced ones with impressive feature sets. This year, Taiwan Semiconductor is slated to launch its 2nm chip.
This chip node has an impressive improvement: When configured to run at the same speed as a 3nm chip, it will consume 25% to 30% less power. With how big of a deal data center energy consumption is becoming, this innovation will drive clients to upgrade their chip technology to realize energy savings. Taiwan Semiconductor isn't stopping there, either. Next year, it plans to release its A16 chip node, which will provide a 15% to 20% power consumption improvement over the new 2nm node.
Taiwan Semiconductor's commitment to always developing the most advanced technology possible and not resting on its laurels is one of the reasons it has become the most popular semiconductor foundry to partner with. I think this also makes it a strong buy, as advanced chips will cost more than their predecessors, boosting Taiwan Semi's revenue and profits along the way."

Shares of AMD surging on the deal. It's the latest sign of activity in the AI space that comes just a week after Nvidia invested in Open AI. Joining me now, Mary Bo Lopez, Lopez Research founder who tracks the tech space. Mary Bo, what's your um, reaction to this latest news this morning and the sort of broadening of this um, open AI ecosystem?
I think it's great for AMD. I think everybody's noticed that. Um, I think the thing that's really interesting about the space right now is the circular economy flow we're having. It's basically all tides are rising all the boats at the moment. They're all investing in each other. They're all committing to uh large purchases and large capital infrastructure build outs. And I think there was some hesitation in the market uh for actual dollars being spent on all this CAPEX to build these facilities. So now we're starting to see some really creative uh investment deals between the companies. So this is just the latest in that. What I think is really interesting about this is it's really actually picking up on something that not too many people have talked about and that's that enterprises are starting to move into AI. when they do that, they're looking at inferencing technology. AMD is really good right now at inferencing technology and Open AI has made an investment in that. So we've got a high end to the GPU market and a mid to the low end in the GPU market and really open AI is basically placed bets so that they can service all the demand that's going to come moving forward with a combination of Nvidia and AMD and keeping Nvidia a bit honest, I might add.
Yeah, I mean, so it doesn't sound like this is necessarily negative for Nvidia then.
No, absolutely not. I mean, frankly, Nvidia will continue to sell everything that they produced for the coming several years. So I'm not really worried about Nvidia. Where I think the worry comes in in the longer term picture is that um Nvidia can't just sell at the high end of the chip market. It's going to have to sell at a broader end of the stack. It's going to have to win inferencing workloads. We originally thought those inferencing workloads were going to go to Intel, then they're that became suspect. We then moved into thinking about AMD, but also we have platforms for Nvidia that are good for inferencing as well. So the question is will AMD eat into what we thought would have been that upside for Nvidia. And there's a good chance that um at least people are investing to make sure that they have a solid alternative to Nvidia on that market."

The company’s stock jumped 28% in midday trading on the news of the multiyear deal, which could generate tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue for AMD over time and marks one of the largest AI infrastructure commitments that’s not based on processors from industry leader Nvidia.
The AMD deal arrived on the heels of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s Asia tour last week, during which OpenAI inked memory chip agreements with Samsung and SK Hynix and reportedly held discussions in Taiwan with TSMC, the world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips. The moves suggest OpenAI is aggressively diversifying its chip supply chain beyond Nvidia—a shift that could complicate OpenAI’s relationship with Nvidia, whose GPUs still power much of OpenAI’s training infrastructure.
Perhaps in consideration of that issue, Altman posted a statement on X that the AMD deal “is all incremental to our work with Nvidia” and that OpenAI plans to increase its Nvidia purchasing over time. “The world needs much more compute,” he wrote.
Nvidia, which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom since ChatGPT debuted in November 2022, still dominates the market for “training” AI models—the compute-intensive process of teaching systems like ChatGPT from massive datasets. But “inference,” or running those models in real-world applications, can use a wider range of chips. AMD and Intel, as well as newer players such as Cerebras, SambaNova, and Groq, see an opening to win business and (no pun intended) chip away at Nvidia’s dominance.
As part of the agreement, OpenAI will use AMD’s next generation of AI GPU chips in massive data-center deployments starting in 2026. To strengthen the alliance, AMD also granted OpenAI a performance-based stock warrant that will vest as specific rollout milestones are met, which could give OpenAI up to a 10% stake in the company.
The deal underscores how Big Tech and leading AI developers are broadening their supply chains to reduce dependence on Nvidia, whose GPUs have so far dominated the market for AI chips.
“This is a major win for AMD and shows that it has been putting the right strategy in place to take advantage of the AI mega-wave with its advanced GPUs,” said infrastructure analyst Jack Gold in an emailed note. “It’s also an endorsement that AMD has become competitive with Nvidia processing power, as well as enhancing its software strategy to compete, much as it did in the data center market earlier against Intel.”"

SponsoredOpenAI’s AMD Deal
This morning, OpenAI announced a massive deal with AMD, a US chip manufacturer, to deploy 6 gigawatts of its GPUs. This arrangement brought a huge boost to AMD’s stock, causing some observers to speculate that it caused a major Robinhood outage.
At this rate, the company may break impressive stock trading records:
However, some analysts have looked a little deeper into this deal. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the AMD deal “a major step” in “[realizing] AI’s full potential,” but there may be an unspoken motive too.
AMD and Nvidia have been competing for years in the US chip industry. Is OpenAI trying to keep Nvidia’s competitor viable?
SponsoredNvidia On the Rise
Specifically, less than two weeks ago, the AI company announced a $100 billion deal with Nvidia, boosting its market cap by around $177 billion. The chip maker has also been making crucial inroads with other partners in the AI space, aiming to dominate the sector long term.
Nvidia is one of the famed “Magnificent 7” stocks, while AMD’s share price has been stagnating for the past month. That is, until OpenAI juiced its valuation with a major partnership:
In other words, OpenAI’s investment may be a much-needed boost to AMD, preventing Nvidia from outcompeting it. Sure, the chip maker has been working steadily, but it needs a healthy share of the astronomical AI capex to stay relevant in today’s market.
Dangers of a Monopoly
Furthermore, Chinese chip manufacturers have been making hardware breakthroughs, pushing Nvidia entirely out of China’s domestic market.
If the American chip industry approaches monopoly-like conditions, failure to innovate could have catastrophic consequences for the AI supply chain.
In other words, OpenAI’s investment in AMD can help prevent that scenario. The AI firm will not be reliant on one company for its hardware requirements, and this industry can maintain fierce competition within the US. Although there is a lot of speculation about a dangerous AI bubble right now, OpenAI might have defused a trigger to pop it."

Shares of ride sharing and on-demand delivery platform Uber (NYSE:UBER) jumped 3.5% in the morning session after California's governor signed a new bill that grants ride-hailing drivers the right to unionize while also significantly cutting the company's insurance requirements in the state.
The new law allows over 800,000 drivers for companies like Uber to join a union and bargain for better wages and benefits, while still being classified as independent contractors. In exchange, the legislation included a measure that lowered insurance requirements for accidents involving underinsured drivers. This change was expected to provide a major financial benefit.
For instance, rival company Lyft's CEO said the new rates were expected to save that company $200 million and could help reduce fares. Uber had previously stated that nearly one-third of every ride fare in California went toward paying for state-mandated insurance, highlighting the importance of the cost reduction for the company's operations.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $99.86, up 3.4% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Uber’s shares are quite volatile and have had 15 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago when the stock gained 3.3% on the news that the company announced a strategic partnership with Israeli drone company Flytrex to launch a drone-based delivery service.
This move marked Uber's return to aerial delivery. The agreement meant Uber Eats would pilot the service in certain U.S. markets before the end of 2025. Unlike a previously abandoned attempt, Uber now benefited from Flytrex's experience and existing FAA approval for its drones, which had already completed more than 200,000 suburban deliveries. The service promised faster drop-offs and less road congestion. In other news, Uber also prepared to launch luxury helicopter hops on the French Riviera through a partnership with Joby Aviation. This wave of positive developments helped push the company's shares past $100 for the first time since its public offering.
Uber is up 58.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $99.86 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Uber’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,754.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Intel had already experienced a momentous month in August after the U.S. government converted its CHIPS Act grant money into roughly a 9% equity stake, while Japanese tech giant Softbank invested another $2 billion.
Those investments, while notable, were dwarfed in significance by last month's $5 billion investment from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), which also came along with an announcement of two key product partnerships.
Attracting the investment of arguably the world's most important AI company sent beaten-down Intel's stock soaring in September.
The ins and outs of the Nvidia-Intel partnership
There were three major components to the Nvidia-Intel announcement: two product partnerships, along with Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel stock at $23.28 per share -- good for about a 4% ownership stake.
On the product-level partnership, Intel will integrate its data center CPUs more tightly with Nvidia's leading AI GPU server ecosystem, while Nvidia will more closely integrate its graphics GPU technology with Intel's leading CPU architecture for PCs, where Intel still holds a large market share.
In order to make fully integrated AI servers, which still require a CPU, Nvidia has developed its own internally designed ""Grace"" CPUs based on the Arm Holdings architecture in recent years. However, Arm CPUs are generally known for their power efficiency, not performance. Meanwhile, most enterprise data center servers are still tied to the x86 CPU architecture, not Arm. As such, Intel's performance-optimized Granite Rapids Xeon 6 CPU, which came out last year, became the reference design as the ""host"" CPU in Nvidia's new DGX B300 server systems.
The two companies will now bring Nvidia's GPU and Intel's x86 CPU architectures even closer together, with Intel giving Nvidia the ability to customize its own CPU design on Intel's x86 CPU architecture for future AI systems.
And while Nvidia dominates AI servers, Intel, despite having lost its near-monopoly from a decade ago, still commands over 76% of the consumer PC market. Nvidia already sells discrete RTX graphics chips to the high-end gaming PC market, but has been somewhat left out of a large part of the PC market that demands close integration of graphics and central processing units on the same system-on-chip (SOC).
While Intel also has its own line of Arc graphics chips, Intel will now integrate Nvidia's RTX graphics chiplets directly into Intel's x86 SOCs for the part of the PC market where integrated SOCs are required. The tie-up will thus expand Nvidia's addressable market in PCs, while Nvidia's premium graphics brand and IP should help Intel win back market share.
Why Intel took off so much on the news
As was the case with the U.S. government's investment, Intel's stock took off on the news, despite the effects of shareholder dilution. This is likely due to the halo effect of being in league with Nvidia, which is currently seen as the gold standard in graphics and AI. Intel has suffered from a crisis of confidence and market share losses in recent years, so to get a vote of confidence from Nvidia at this time goes a long way.
And while some analysts were skeptical there was no announcement for Nvidia to use Intel's nascent foundry manufacturing services, the lack of an announcement today doesn't mean there couldn't be a foundry deal for Nvidia chips down the road. Meanwhile, Nvidia's investment indicates confidence in Intel's technology roadmap and future, which includes its foundry efforts.
On that note, Intel is currently hosting tech and financial analysts at its new 18A fabs in Arizona this week, and is set to formally introduce its Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest chips on Thursday, Oct. 9. These will be the first internal products made on Intel's new 18A process node, which Intel believes could bring it back to semiconductor technology leadership once again."

This checks out, as it's where a massive amount of capital is getting invested to build out computing infrastructure and train models. Although it seems like AI has been the prevailing market theme for some time, there are multiple indications that this will persist for several more years, making AI a great place to invest today.
I've got a list of four great buys in October, and investors should scoop up some shares as soon as possible.
Computing hardware: Nvidia and Broadcom
Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the massive AI spending spree is Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which excel in workloads that require massive computing power due to their ability to process multiple calculations in parallel. Nvidia powers the majority of AI models available right now, making it an important company to listen to when management offers market predictions.
During its second-quarter conference call, Nvidia projected that data center capital expenditures will reach $600 billion this year, but expand to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's monstrous growth, and Nvidia would be well positioned to capitalize on this growth if it occurs.
However, one company vying for a slice of this pie is Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), which is partnering with end users to develop custom AI accelerators. While Nvidia's GPUs are the undisputed king of computing units meant for arduous workloads, some of that flexibility isn't required when the computing unit is only going to run one type of calculation for its entire life. That's where Broadcom's custom AI accelerator chips come into play.
Broadcom is designing these chips with the end user to ensure they're optimized for the one type of workload they'll see during their operating life. That way, Broadcom can squeeze every ounce of performance available at a cheaper price point than an Nvidia GPU.
There's still plenty of room for both chips moving forward, by looking for Broadcom to rise a bit quicker than Nvidia over the next few years. I still think both are excellent investments, and that October is a great time to scoop up these stocks in anticipation of record-setting data center capital expenditures for 2026.
Chip manufacturers: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and ASML
Neither Nvidia nor Broadcom can manufacture their own chips, so they outsource that work to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.96%). TSMC is the world's leading contract chip manufacturer and has clients in multiple industries. This makes it a bit less concentrated in the AI investment realm, and also gives it exposure to other important trends like autonomous driving, vehicle electrification, and a smartphone refresh cycle.
All of these movements require more advanced chips in greater quantities, making TSMC a no-brainer investment option this month. Additionally, it's slated to launch its next chip generation, 2-nanometer chips. These chips are expected to significantly reduce power consumption when configured for the same processing speed, which could decrease the already strenuous energy load. Management has already stated that demand is far higher for these chips than in previous generations, which means TSMC could have a new growth catalyst emerging over the next few months.
Creating these advanced chips requires specialized equipment. Perhaps the most specialized is the extreme ultraviolet lithography machines procured from ASML (ASML 2.69%). ASML is the only company in the world to build these machines, giving it a technological monopoly. This is extremely rare with how intense competition is, and whenever investors have the chance to own shares in a company with this status, they'd be smart to do so.
ASML will benefit from increased chip demand because it will require more factories to produce these chips. With TSMC building several new fabrication facilities worldwide, ASML stands to benefit.
ASML's stock has had a strong few weeks, but that rally could continue for multiple years if demand for its products stays strong (which it should, considering the massive amount of money that's being spent on AI infrastructure)."

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks Wall Street is watching.
Chris Rolland from Susquehanna said during a program on CNBC last month that Nvidia’s growth will eventually slow down and hit a “wall.” However, the analyst remains bullish on the stock and praised the company’s recent quarter numbers.
“I think eventually we will hit some sort of a wall when it comes to this deceleration. I don’t know if it’s next year, but eventually we’re going to have a flat year and everyone’s going to freak out and think that the P multiple might even be too high. It’s been a meteoric rise. I’m not getting off the train just yet. There’s still a lot of growth here. Whether you’re talking about hyperscale capex, we’ve seen incredible improvement, but there’s probably still another 20 or 30% to go there over the next few years. We have sovereign ahead of us. We have China ahead of us. There’s still some opportunity here.”
The current AI boom cycle stems from spending by major tech companies, and Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of this spending. In Q2 FY2026, three direct customers accounted for 23%, 19%, and 14% of NVDA’s accounts receivable. Almost all of the company's revenue comes from AI-related infrastructure spending. In the latest quarter, $41.3 billion of the $46.7 billion revenue came from these clients. The music could stop for Nvidia if these major companies decide to slow down their spending amid a lack of ROI. If investors sense a weakness in CapEx spending, and the market begins to waver, NVDA stock price would be the first to see its impact.
Baird Chautauqua International and Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported first quarter results that were extremely solid. The company took a write-down on China-specific datacenter products and flushed out any future China contributions from their guidance, following the new export restrictions introduced in April. Demand commentary ex China was extremely encouraging—Nvidia is outgrowing expectations despite supply constraints and outgrowing competing ASIC products by a large margin. We have been underweight Nvidia relative to the benchmark, which was up 46% in the quarter, given our short-to medium-term concerns that the feverish AI datacenter build may be resulting in overcapacity, which has not come to bear.
While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Imagine a future where the biggest US stocks like Tesla (TSLA) or Nvidia (NVDA) can be traded around the clock, with the transactions settled in seconds.
Momentum is building toward that vision. The crypto industry, along with Wall Street heavyweights, wants to bring tokenized stocks, or digital versions of traditional shares that are recorded on a blockchain's digital ledger, into the mainstream.
Last month Nasdaq (NDAQ) asked regulators for permission to allow listed stocks to trade in tokenized form on its exchange. If the request is granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it would mark a pivotal step toward merging traditional finance with blockchain. The SEC opened the proposal for public comments in September, with a decision expected within 45 to 90 days of publication.
“Tokenization is like a freight train. It can’t be stopped, and eventually it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Robinhood (HOOD) CEO Vlad Tenev said at a crypto conference in Singapore on Wednesday. Over the summer, the trading platform launched more than 200 US stock and ETF (exchange-traded fund) tokens in Europe.
Meanwhile, Wall Street firms ranging from Goldman Sachs to asset manager BlackRock have already rolled out tokenized money-market funds. BlackRock is also reportedly exploring the launch of tokenized ETFs.
""Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,"" BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said in the company's annual newsletter in July. ""Markets wouldn't need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds.""
Supporters argue that tokenized stocks make trading more accessible to investors, enable exchanges of assets in just one blockchain transaction, and expand their use in lending or as collateral.
“These are financial tools that the retail investor is not used to,” said Kevin Rusher, founder of real-world asset borrowing and lending firm RAAC. ""It lowers the barrier to entry.""
The market for tokenized real-world assets, which include stablecoins, bonds, real estate, and commodities, could swell from about $600 billion in 2025 to nearly $19 trillion by 2033, according to Boston Consulting Group and Ripple.
The rollout of some tokenized equity products abroad have had a rocky start.
Tokens tracking popular stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) in Europe have struggled with thin liquidity, leading to prices diverging from those of actual stocks.
Concerns about third-party issuers have also surfaced."

But while it's a tough situation for those impacted, shutdowns tend to end relatively quickly and markets usually take them in stride. What I briefly want to remind investors is that unlike government shutdowns, tariffs won't be going anywhere.
Remember those tariffs from the Trump administration? The same tariffs you have shaken off, especially with various economic data releases showing minimal impact so far? I get it, why bother worrying about tariff side effects when your 10 shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are moving up almost every day and second quarter GDP rises an impressive 3.8%?
But after spending much of the week on the road, I return to report that tariffs are beginning to have some real negative economic consequences. They aren't appearing in macro data yet, or even corporate earnings to a sizable degree — though I would say there's more of a groundswell of negativity building that could surprise investors heading into 2026.

A few nuggets following my Detroit trip to interview a bunch of CEOs and politicians....
-
Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley on tariff impact: ""I mean, it's frustrating because we're the most American auto company, and we export the most, and yet, we have this $2 billion headwind, which prevents me from investing even more in the US,"" Farley told me. Farley added that imported parts — such as wiring looms, fasteners, sensors, and brake components — are sourced from countries like China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea. Tariffs on these parts are driving up costs, including for Ford's popular F-150 truck.

Union Pacific (UNP) CEO Jim Vena on state of economy: ""So it's interesting in that the consumer from everything we see is still strong at this point. They are still out there spending, they're still out there moving. We've seen some products being a little bit less [in demand], homes are not selling at the same rate as they were before. But overall, our business is up. Our volume is strong year over year, it's up by a few percentage points. So far we have not seen the impact that some people claim that we were going to have with the economy. In specific segments [you are seeing a slowdown].""

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan on tariff impact: ""So in Detroit, we have three assembly plants, two Jeep plants, and a GM truck plant. Ontario, as you know, is right across the river. A lot of the parts supplies come from Canada. So when you put a tariff on Canada, you're putting a tariff on cars made in Michigan. And we're starting to feel that, and I hope the president gets that sorted out."" Duggan added, ""Our corporate income taxes are down because they’re off of corporate profits. The tariffs have hit them."""
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-05T12:05:00,2 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now,These industry leaders in semiconductors and cloud computing could make solid investments.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c9936f9b5c3255171ce48fbca9b60812229647c130cb2c58c43e35d490109c38,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-buy-right-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/2-no-brainer-ai-stocks-buy-right-now/,fool.com,200,,"AI is accelerating demand for chips and cloud computing services. The AI chip market is expected to grow 29% per year through 2030, according to Grand View Research, while the cloud computing market is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 20%.
For investors looking for quality growth stocks to cash in on this opportunity, here are two no-brainer choices.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Demand for AI chips is driving robust growth for the leading chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). TSMC, as it's also known, makes chips for other designers, including Nvidia, Apple, and Advanced Micro Devices. It controls more than 65% of the global foundry market, according to tech market researcher Counterpoint.
TSMC has invested for decades building expertise in cutting-edge chipmaking processes, which allows its clients to focus on what they do best, which is designing the most powerful chips in the world. The relationship TSMC built with its clients over the years is a competitive advantage. Its moat is so wide that even Intel has not been able to make headway against TSMC despite recent investments to build its own foundry business.
Demand for AI semiconductors and other high-performance chips pushed TSMC's revenue up 44% year over year in the second quarter. Its competitive lead allows it to earn a high net margin of over 42%.
As more investment goes into building more advanced AI, the company should continue to report stellar financial results. Developing smarter AI requires growing amounts of computational power, which is a catalyst for TSMC. The company is investing to expand manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and elsewhere to mitigate the risks of higher costs from tariffs and to be able to meet growing demand.
Despite its commanding lead in the foundry market, the stock looks undervalued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28. Analysts expect earnings to rise at an annualized rate of 21% in the coming years. Assuming the stock continues to trade at the same valuation, that is enough growth to double the share price within the next four years.
2. Oracle
AI is a major catalyst for growth in the cloud computing market, since businesses can use AI in the cloud to get better insights from their data. Oracle (ORCL 1.45%) might be the best cloud stock to buy based on its leadership in enterprise database services and its extensive data center infrastructure that is optimized for AI.
Oracle's total revenue grew 12% year over year last quarter, but that doesn't tell investors about the real momentum happening in the business. The stock is soaring on the accelerating growth in its cloud infrastructure business, where the company is signing deals with major tech companies. In the second quarter, its remaining performance obligations (contracted revenue not yet realized) surged 359% year over year.
This impressive growth shows Oracle is becoming the preferred choice for AI workloads in the cloud. It can bundle its industry-leading database services with top AI models.
It also benefits from offering cloud customers integrated services across other cloud platforms like Amazon, Alphabet's Google, and Microsoft. This is clearly attractive to its customers -- Oracle's multi-cloud revenue jumped 1,529% last quarter.
Management expects the momentum to continue, as more workloads shift from AI training to inferencing, where models learn to make forecasts from new data. Its cloud infrastructure revenue is expected to grow 77% for the full year.
The stock is soaring because the robust demand in cloud infrastructure will grow its total revenue by 16% in fiscal 2026 on a constant-currency basis, indicating accelerating growth. This justifies the stock's high P/E multiple. AI is creating a more sticky relationship with Oracle's cloud database customers, setting up excellent return prospects for investors."

All types of vehicles, including those with combustion engines, are incorporating these features. However, electric vehicles (EVs) are uniquely suited for advanced technology, as they're built on software systems.
That's creating a huge opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). The company has been building automotive tech solutions for years, and as electric vehicles become more commonplace, a massive opportunity is coming into focus for Nvidia's artificial intelligence tech to power the next generation of EVs.
How Nvidia's powering next-gen vehicles today
For years, Nvidia developed technology platforms and systems for vehicles in anticipation that one day they'd become an integral part of advanced vehicle systems. Those days are already here.
Nvidia's artificial intelligence platform DRIVE AGX and its AI vehicle processors DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Thor are being used by leading electric-vehicle companies to enhance in-vehicle software, safety systems, and semi-autonomous capabilities.
For example, the world's largest EV maker, BYD, partnered with Nvidia several years ago to use Nvidia's centralized computing platform to bring ""safe and intelligent vehicles to market."" Similarly, China-based Xiaomi EV built its SU7 sedan with Nvidia's DRIVE Orin configuration for highway driving functions and uses AI to make navigation decisions in unknown driving environments.
American companies are tapping into Nvidia's DRIVE technology, as well. Electric-vehicle specialist Rivian uses it to enhance its safety features and driving technology, and also uses Nvidia's RTX Pro GPUs to power artificial intelligence and virtual reality for vehicle design.
Most recently, General Motors announced a new partnership with Nvidia, saying that it has used the tech giant's graphics processor for AI training in the past -- and is now expanding its partnership to include in-vehicle hardware and even assisting with the design of automotive plants and operations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said of the partnership, ""The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we're transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they're made.""
This is just scraping the surface of Nvidia's hardware and software integration into electric vehicles and semi-autonomous safety systems. In all, more than 20 automakers use Nvidia's processors and DRIVE platform to help power their next-generation vehicles.
The next-gen vehicle opportunity is massive for Nvidia
One of the biggest opportunities for Nvidia from next-gen vehicles is for automakers to increasingly use it to power autonomous vehicles. GM made this point clear when talking about its future vision for its own vehicles and its expectation to launch personal autonomous vehicles, or PAVs, in the future.
GM's senior VP of Software and Services Engineering Dave Richardson said, ""The work we're doing with companies like Nvidia adds agility to our already highly sophisticated vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing processes.""
Nvidia announced a new full-stack DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform that's in full production now, with plans to deploy into intelligent transportation systems soon. In short, Nvidia's tech could help make these new autonomous systems a reality. And the opportunity is massive.
""We believe automotive is a trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia,"" said Ali Kani, Nvidia's vice president and general manager of automotive.
The company's not quite there yet. Its automotive revenue was just $586 million in Q2, though it did improve by an impressive 69% from the year-ago quarter. But some estimates put the projected revenue for autonomous vehicle platform providers near $2.6 trillion globally by 2030 -- making this a huge opportunity for Nvidia.
Worth the wait
Most new vehicles, electric and otherwise, have some level of semi-autonomous systems built into them these days. As these features become more commonplace and companies expand their in-vehicle technologies for EVs, Nvidia's current partnerships and tech make it well-positioned to benefit from the growth.
Considering that Nvidia is already a dominant artificial intelligence company that's tapping into huge demand for AI data centers, investors can benefit from owning Nvidia stock now -- while they wait for the company to benefit from powering next-gen vehicles in the coming years."

Strong results and guidance ultimately led the stock even higher to close out September. Micron stock gained 40.6% last month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, largely thanks to booming demand for artificial intelligence data centers.
Scrambling for AI computing capacity
Two things related to AI are happening within the memory chip market. First, demand for high-bandwidth memory, a special type of dynamic random-access memory critical for AI accelerators, is exploding. Mega-deals involving OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, and other tech giants to build massive AI data centers will require equally massive quantities of HBM chips.
Micron sold $2 billion worth of HBM chips in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on Aug. 28, and it's working on bringing its next-generation HBM4 chips to market. Nearly all of its HBM3 chip supply for calendar 2026 is spoken for, and the company is talking to customers about HBM4 commitments. For the time being, Micron is easily selling every bit of HBM that it can make.
The second development is related to standard DRAM memory chips. While AI data centers also need commodity server DRAM chips, manufacturers including Micron are aggressively prioritizing HBM production. Even with somewhat weak demand for PCs and smartphones, which both require DRAM chips, overall supply is now tight. This situation has pushed up prices, boosting Micron's bottom line further.
Together, these trends pushed up Micron's revenue by 46% year over year in the fourth quarter to $11.3 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded by more than 9 percentage points to 45.7%, and adjusted earnings per share more than doubled.
Micron expects both trends to continue into fiscal 2026. The company expects to generate around $12.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter, along with a non-GAAP gross margin of roughly 51.5%. That gross margin is historically high for Micron.
Micron stock looks cheap, but be careful
Based on the average analyst estimate for fiscal 2026 adjusted earnings per share, Micron trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just above 11. That may look incredibly inexpensive for a company growing so quickly and benefiting so greatly from the AI boom, but investors need to be careful.
The memory chip market is cyclical, and pricing is largely determined by supply and demand. Every single boom, marked by demand outpacing supply, has been followed by a bust. Micron makes a lot of money during booms, but the bottom line can plunge deep into negative territory during severe downturns.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos called AI a bubble on Friday, joining a chorus of high-profile voices warning of overexuberance. If AI infrastructure is overbuilt, which looks likely given the massive investments being made, demand for memory chips could fall off a cliff once the reckoning arrives. That's the big risk with Micron stock. Despite how amazing things look right now, a downturn is always coming."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-05T11:15:00,Nvidia vs. Microsoft: Which Stock Is the Better Buy After Their OpenAI Investments?,Both companies should continue to benefit from their OpenAI investments.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6b6f557d9a4e19ae017e6317923ff5ae0044e23e741a992b01520ff8d3ec5c96,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/nvidia-vs-microsoft-which-stock-is-the-better-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/nvidia-vs-microsoft-which-stock-is-the-better-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/nvidia-vs-microsoft-which-stock-is-the-better-buy/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.15%) both made big bets on OpenAI, but they are coming at the opportunity from very different directions. Nvidia's move is about keeping its chips at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout and expanding into the software side, while Microsoft's early investment let it weave OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) into its cloud computing and software businesses.
The question, though, is which stock is the better buy after their OpenAI investments.
Nvidia's big AI investment
Nvidia's plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI is not just about buying a stake in a hot AI company. It also gives one of the companies that are leading the charge in AI infrastructure buildout financing, which it will then likely funnel back to Nvidia by buying or renting its graphics processing units (GPUs). This gives Nvidia a massive, long-term, guaranteed customer for its chips.
Locking that in helps solidify Nvidia's position as the essential infrastructure provider for the AI industry. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom are fighting to break into the AI chip market, but by partnering closely with OpenAI, Nvidia helps solidify its position as the market leader. The deal also gives Nvidia financial exposure to OpenAI's software business. CEO Jensen Huang has said OpenAI could become the world's next multitrillion-dollar company.
Another underappreciated angle is that the two companies will work together at the chip, software, and systems level. That collaboration gives Nvidia a first look at the computing needs of the most advanced AI models, letting it shape future chips to match those workloads. That would give the company yet another edge.
Nvidia also has advantages that it built long before it invested in OpenAI. Its CUDA software platform, launched in 2006, locked in most AI developers since so much of the foundational code was written for it. Its NVLink interconnect, meanwhile, lets its GPUs operate as one giant unit. With OpenAI expected to lead the charge in AI data-center spending in the coming years, Nvidia looks as well positioned as any company to be a big winner.
Microsoft's early and smart AI play
Microsoft's investment in OpenAI was smaller in dollar terms, but it was transformational. It got in early when OpenAI's ChatGPT was starting to go mainstream, and that early move gave it preferred access to its models. That alone was a game-changer because it was able to become the growth driver behind its cloud computing unit, Azure.
The partnership helped create the Azure OpenAI Service, which lets Microsoft's enterprise customers tap into OpenAI's most advanced models using its infrastructure. That initial exclusive access to OpenAI's models drew in customers looking to use them to power their AI workloads. Azure growth has been skyrocketing, including last quarter when it soared 39% despite running into capacity constraints.
Microsoft also integrated OpenAI's technology directly into its software, using its models to create its Copilot AI assistants. Its Copilot can do many things, from simply summarizing a document to allowing someone to use Python in Excel using only natural language. The bottom line, though, is that it can help workers be more productive, and at $30 per user per month, it's an affordable way for companies to help increase worker efficiency, while also being a nice growth drive for Microsoft.
Another advantage of Microsoft's OpenAI investment is that it gives it early access to OpenAI's newest technologies, which cuts its own development risk and cost. By being first in, Microsoft secured a preferred-partner status that its competitors still don't have.
The better investment versus the better buy
Microsoft clearly made the better OpenAI investment by getting in early. Its initial investment is now worth way more than it was just a few years ago. At the same time, that relationship has been critical in helping drive the company's own growth.
Nvidia's investment is coming much later, but it locks in massive chip sales and helps cement its role as the backbone of AI infrastructure. It also gives it exposure to OpenAI's potential upside and to work together to advance the future of AI.
If you're judging by who got the better deal on OpenAI, that was Microsoft. But if you're looking at the stocks today, Nvidia looks better positioned moving forward, given the massive opportunity still ahead of it, helped by its OpenAI investment."

A $6.3 billion agreement between red-hot CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) and the company at the very heart of the AI boom, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), sent both stocks higher. So what exactly is a backstop, and what does this latest announcement mean for both CoreWeave and Nvidia?
What is a backstop?
A backstop agreement is a safety net -- a guarantee that a company will step in as a buyer of last resort if things don't go according to plan. Many of these deals have involved the guarantee of a lease. If, say, Microsoft agreed to provide a $1 billion backstop for a lease between a data center operator and a cloud provider, the data center operator will be made whole if the cloud provider fails to pay its lease (up to a maximum of $1 billion).
Much like a cosigner on a loan, these backstops from large, successful companies allow smaller companies to access significantly more credit at better rates than they could otherwise.
In CoreWeave's deal, Nvidia is obligated to pay the company up to $6.3 billion through 2032 if the cloud provider has unsold capacity. The agreement was actually signed in 2023, but was only publicly revealed in an SEC filing this month.
CoreWeave needs Nvidia's guarantee
The benefit to CoreWeave is pretty straightforward. Building AI data centers is extraordinarily expensive. There are few companies that have cash flows large enough to pay for substantial data center capacity outright. CoreWeave is using debt -- a lot of it -- to build its data centers and acquire capacity from existing infrastructure providers.
CoreWeave needs money, and Nvidia's backstop allows it to access the capital it needs. Lenders are much more likely to agree to favorable terms -- or extend credit at all -- when they know one of the most successful companies on the planet is on the hook for billions of dollars.
Since the agreement is not new, its public revelation won't really change anything for CoreWeave's ability to access financing. However, it does help quell growing concerns from investors over the sustainability of its business model. That's great for its stock price.
Nvidia has a lot to gain, too
While CoreWeave's benefits are more readily apparent, Nvidia wins as well. CoreWeave serves an important role in Nvidia's ecosystem -- a role that extends well beyond being just another customer.
CoreWeave lowers the friction for companies that can't afford or justify massive, upfront graphics processing unit (GPU) purchases. Wider access means more sustainable demand. It means more AI workloads inside the CUDA software ecosystem -- a key element of Nvidia's moat -- reinforcing developer lock-in.
It also gives Nvidia a buffer and offloads risk. Nvidia gets to reap the benefits of supplying the AI data center build-out without directly spending its own money to build capacity and drive demand. It lets CoreWeave do so instead. That means it's CoreWeave that is spending enormous amounts of its cash -- and the cash it has borrowed -- to build capacity.
If AI demand drops sharply, obviously, it would be bad for Nvidia, but it could be disastrous for CoreWeave. Nvidia's obligation to creditors is capped at $6.3 billion. It's CoreWeave that's on the hook for the full amount of its debt.
Critically, the deal is structured so that Nvidia gets to use the unsold capacity it is paying for.
Who wins?
In the short term, both companies get what they need. Over the long term, however, Nvidia is the clear winner. If AI demand continues at the levels we are seeing today, both companies win. If AI demand cools, however, CoreWeave is in a tight spot.
CoreWeave is walking a tightrope, and its success requires AI demand to stay hot. I'm not sure that will happen. It's entirely possible that even if AI succeeds over the long term, there will be a period of retraction. This could prove fatal to CoreWeave given its enormous -- and expensive -- debt load."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-05T10:00:00,3 Top Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in October,Quantum computing investing encompasses a wide variety of businesses.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=46438408661446e329517816d478250754bc45abe53ade1b7711cb495f2e8c60,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/3-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/3-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/3-top-quantum-computing-stocks-to-buy-in-october/,fool.com,200,,"The quantum computing space is really starting to heat up. Many of the top picks surged during September, leaving investors wondering if there's still room for these stocks to run during October and throughout the end of the year. I think there's a high likelihood of this occurring, as quantum computing is shaping up to be a huge theme in the market during 2026.
I've got three top quantum computing stocks investors will want to pick up during October, and they cover a broad range in the quantum computing industry.
IonQ
IonQ (IONQ -5.85%) is one of the most popular quantum computing stocks on the market. It received a bit of fame by being the first quantum computing pure play to go public, and the stock has been a massive success. Since its IPO, it's up nearly 500%.
However, a large chunk of that performance has come recently, as it's starting to announce increased breakthroughs in quantum computing. Its most recent innovation, which it announced on Sept. 25, was meeting the milestone of #AQ 64, which means that the system is capable of 18 quintillion (2 to the 64th power) possibilities. This achievement brings IonQ one step closer to achieving commercial relevance, which it must do before it becomes a successful investment.
IonQ has a lot of hype building around the stock, but it's far from profitable, and its quarterly revenue only comes from research contracts. That could flip in the near future if a large-scale commercial client sees value in its technology over traditional computing methods. Most quantum computing companies point to 2030 as the date when that might occur. Still, if IonQ can continue innovating at this rate (it crossed the #AQ 36 milestone only nine months ago), quantum computing could become viable much sooner than that.
IonQ is a risky bet in the quantum computing space, but if it works out, it could make investors a ton of money.
Alphabet
Another quantum computing competitor is Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%). Alphabet initially kicked off the quantum computing investment rush last December when it announced that its Willow quantum computing chip had completed a task that would have taken the world's most powerful supercomputer 10 septillion (10 to the 25th power) years to complete.
Quantum computing is an incredibly important technology for Alphabet to develop, as it would allow Alphabet to increase the profitability of its cloud computing division. Currently, Alphabet purchases computing units from a few vendors, which means it must pay for that company's profits. If Alphabet develops in-house quantum computing capabilities and doesn't need to purchase computing units from a supplier like IonQ, it will become far more profitable.
Even if Alphabet doesn't win the quantum computing race and must continue buying quantum computing units from a supplier like IonQ, most quantum computing usage will likely come over the cloud, which will boost Google Cloud's revenue.
This makes Alphabet a win-win investment in the quantum computing realm, and with Alphabet's massive resources, I'm willing to bet it will develop a viable quantum computing device internally.
Nvidia
Lastly, there is Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), which currently makes the most powerful computing units that utilize traditional computing methods. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and there are countless GPUs in service today, training and operating AI models. Replacing the existing computing infrastructure with a quantum-based one isn't possible, and the best use for quantum computing appears to be deploying it in traditional computing scenarios in a hybrid approach.
Nvidia is working to bridge the gap in that hybrid computing architecture, adopting its leading CUDA software to quantum and renaming it as CUDA-Q. By ensuring that its GPUs will be used alongside quantum processing units in a hybrid approach, Nvidia will cement its role in the next phase of computing, allowing it to continue its dominance.
An investment in Nvidia allows quantum computing investors to bridge the gap between what's currently popular and what may be popular in five to ten years. However, if quantum computing turns out to be a flop, then Nvidia's GPUs will still be the most powerful computing unit available, making the stock a must-own for the foreseeable future."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-05T09:18:00,UiPath Stock Jumps on Collaboration With Nvidia and Others. Is It Time to Buy the Stock?,UiPath stock could have a strong upside if these partnerships can help reaccelerate revenue growth.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=d95fb01ddc9d3564a818a0b7609a69d1b7d382e36f8c39d6905300509042393c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/uipath-stock-jumps-nvidia-collaboration-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/uipath-stock-jumps-nvidia-collaboration-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/uipath-stock-jumps-nvidia-collaboration-buy/,fool.com,200,,"UiPath (PATH 1.27%) finally gave the market something to get excited about. The stock popped after the company laid out a series of new collaborations with Nvidia, Alphabet, Snowflake, and OpenAI. For a business that has been slogging through a multiyear turnaround, this was great news, as it shows a company ready to play a central role in how enterprises actually use artificial intelligence (AI).
Going down a new path
UiPath is no longer trying to be just a robotic process automation (RPA) company that uses software bots to automate rule-based tasks such as data entry. Instead, it is shifting to agentic automation, where its AI agent orchestration platform can coordinate how humans, bots, and different AI agents all work together. These new partnerships are about pushing that vision into the real world.
The deal with Nvidia focuses on industries that have little room for error. UiPath will use Nvidia's Nemotron models and NIM microservices to power agents that can run on-premises in regulated environments like healthcare and fraud detection, where data can't leave secure systems. Meanwhile, it will bring Alphabet's Gemini models into its platform, so people can use automation with voice commands.
In addition, by linking up with Snowflake, it will tie Snowflake's Cortex AI to its orchestration platform to help customers act on data insights in real time. And finally, its OpenAI partnership adds a ChatGPT connector that lets customers weave advanced large language models (LLMs) right into their workflows without rebuilding everything from scratch.
When you look at these moves together, UiPath is trying to position itself as the Switzerland of enterprise AI agents: integrating with everyone and letting customers pick whichever models they want without locking themselves into a single vendor. That pitch resonates because companies are wary of vendor lock-in, and having one orchestration platform that can handle all these AI agents could become a valuable advantage. The collaboration with Snowflake looks particularly compelling because the combination should be able to offer an alternative approach to Palantir that can deliver similar data-driven automation and real-world insights using a customer's data that is already warehoused inside Snowflake servers.
Meanwhile, even before announcing these partnerships, UiPath was already seeing early signs that its turnaround was starting to take hold.
In its most recent quarter, the company's annual recurring revenue (ARR) climbed 11% to $1.72 billion, beating the high end of guidance. Cloud ARR jumped 25% to cross the $1 billion mark, proving that the migration to the cloud is moving along. Net revenue retention stabilized at 108% after several quarters of slippage, which is important because it suggests existing customers are still spending more. Its public sector business, which had been frozen earlier in the year, is starting to come back, and adjusted operating margins jumped to 17% as the company's past cost cuts and restructuring efforts began to show up in its numbers.
Is the stock a buy?
While UiPath still has plenty to prove, there are other encouraging signs. The return of founder Daniel Dines as CEO has given the company a steadier hand and clearer focus on its agentic automation vision. More than 450 customers are already building AI agents on its platform, and 95% of new customers are adopting its core automation products too, suggesting the new AI tools are complementing rather than replacing its traditional offerings.
Trading at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 4.1 times expected 2026 revenue, the stock's valuation is inexpensive for a business with improving fundamentals. If these partnerships can further help accelerate growth, UiPath's stock could have plenty of upside ahead.
That said, this is not a low-risk story, and there will likely be bumps along the way. However, for investors willing to bet on a company that looks like it is getting its act together and has some powerful partners lined up, the stock looks like an interesting buy."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-05T09:15:00,Is CoreWeave a Better Investment Than Nvidia?,CoreWeave announced several massive deals over the past few weeks.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=86e2127051f9bb14baf2da40d94370fb8a5a442537cb89a0c1866b7efb35abe3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/is-coreweave-a-better-investment-than-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/is-coreweave-a-better-investment-than-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/is-coreweave-a-better-investment-than-nvidia/,fool.com,200,,"CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) is making some big moves. Recently, it signed a deal to rent out $14 billion of its computing capacity to Meta Platforms (META 1.20%). It also expanded its agreement with OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, by $6.5 billion. These monster deals are pushing the stock higher, and CoreWeave's stock is up almost 34% since September started.
CoreWeave's business goal is to become the artificial intelligence (AI) cloud king. To do that, it will need to buy a lot more computing capacity, including chipsets from Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). That leads to the question: Is it better to buy CoreWeave stock, or are you better off owning Nvidia? Let's take a look.
CoreWeave's servers are filled with Nvidia GPUs
As mentioned above, CoreWeave's goal is to become the go-to cloud computing platform for artificial intelligence computing. This is an attractive business model for CoreWeave and clients alike. While most clients are building out their own computing infrastructure, having some flexibility to run workloads on CoreWeave's servers when demand is higher or not needing to build out AI computing capacity all at once is a smart move. On CoreWeave's side, the business model is fairly simple: Rent out the computing power for more than it costs to replace and operate the equipment.
For Nvidia, its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most flexible computing units available and are a top option for AI companies to run workloads on. However, custom AI chips are starting to increase the competition that Nvidia has to deal with, but it's still the most commonly used computing unit due to its flexibility. Nvidia sells its GPUs to cloud providers like CoreWeave or its competitors because they have no idea what type of workload their computing units will see. AI hyperscalers can purchase their own custom AI chips because they know what workload will be run across them. This is a key distinction for Nvidia, so it's crucial for its success that CoreWeave and other cloud competitors continue buying up Nvidia's GPUs to meet capacity.
In a way, both companies are critical for each other's success, but there's one option that stands out as a much better pick.
CoreWeave isn't profitable during a once-in-a-lifetime boom
CoreWeave is growing at a rapid rate as demand for AI computing capacity explodes. During its most recent quarter, CoreWeave's revenue rose 207% year over year to $1.2 billion. Considering CoreWeave signed a $14 billion agreement through the end of 2031 with Meta and the total value of the OpenAI contract (which runs through 2029) is now $22.4 billion, there's a massive backlog for CoreWeave to churn through.
However, what remains unclear is what will happen after those contracts expire. Both Meta and OpenAI are building out internal computing capacity to meet AI demand. If they build out enough to satisfy capacity, using CoreWeave as a third-party cloud provider may be unnecessary. This would cause CoreWeave to lose substantial business.
For Nvidia, a complete AI computing capacity buildout may sound scary, but it really isn't. GPUs utilized for AI computing are run incredibly hard and can have lifespans of one to three years. This means that current computing capacity must be replaced every couple of years, which will allow Nvidia to maintain a strong revenue base. CoreWeave has no similar guarantee, and I think that's a key point investors must understand.
Furthermore, right now is about as good as it's going to get for CoreWeave. Demand for AI computing capacity is high, and although it's still growing, it's hard to imagine this growth lasting over the long term, say five to 10 years out. The current problem is that CoreWeave isn't profitable. It posted a net loss margin of 24% during Q2. CoreWeave losing money during arguably its best time to be making profits is a huge red flag, and it makes sense why companies like Meta and OpenAI are renting computing capacity from them; they can likely rent it from CoreWeave for cheaper than they can build it. If CoreWeave increases prices to become profitable, this may no longer be the case. At that point, customers will likely build their own.
This makes the future precarious for CoreWeave, and I'd much rather own Nvidia stock than CoreWeave as a result."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-05T09:00:00,AI Spending Could Reach $4 Trillion by 2030. Here Are 3 Must-Own Stocks if It Does.,Nvidia believes data center capital expenditures could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2d51742bcd188b9da2440741cf1599e0071bd71539d79769cc646a5dc72d780f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/ai-spending-could-reach-4-trillion-by-2030-here-ar/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/ai-spending-could-reach-4-trillion-by-2030-here-ar/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/ai-spending-could-reach-4-trillion-by-2030-here-ar/,fool.com,200,,"During Nvidia's (NVDA -0.17%) Q2 conference call, it made a jaw-dropping market projection: Management believes global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's a ton of money being spent on AI infrastructure, and if it's right, investors should be racing into AI stocks to capitalize on this spending.
However, I'm not referring to companies that are spending the money on AI infrastructure; I'm investing in the companies that are providing the infrastructure. I think Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.22%), and Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) are among the best buys in the market right now, and if this projection is correct, they will make investors a ton of money over the next five years.
Nvidia's projection isn't as aggressive as one may think
At first, this projection may seem outlandish. However, it isn't as far-fetched as it seems when you break it down. During its Q2 conference call, Nvidia stated it projects 2025's data center capital expenditure figure to total $600 billion (originally, CEO Jensen Huang stated that this was the big four AI hyperscalers, but was later corrected to be all AI data centers). So, global data center expenditures are expected to rise $600 billion to $4 trillion by 2030, which would require a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46%. That's huge growth, but is it realistic?
While AI hyperscalers are currently spending a lot on this infrastructure, all of them have stated that they expect substantial increases in capital expenditures in 2026. I'd expect this trend to continue, as many of the data center projects that were announced in 2025 will begin construction in 2026 and be outfitted with computing equipment in 2027 or 2028. This stretches out the record-breaking capex spend over multiple years.
Additionally, the U.S. isn't the only area where the AI revolution is ongoing. Chinese-based AI companies will also be spending a ton of money on AI, and it's unlikely that their American counterparts will vastly outspend them. Europe is just now getting into the AI game, and it has massive resources that could rival the U.S. or China when combined.
While the $4 trillion high end of this estimation is still incredibly optimistic, it underscores that there is still a ton of spending left to realize in the AI arms race. This makes a handful of stock genius investments, and I think investors need to ensure their portfolio has exposure to Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Broadcom.
This trio is set to cash in on massive AI spending
Nvidia has been the king of AI investing since the start of the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the computing unit of choice for training AI models due to their incredible flexibility and best-in-class performance. Nvidia is one of the companies most likely to benefit from increased AI spending, and if you don't own shares of Nvidia, now is not too late.
Broadcom is starting to challenge Nvidia in the AI computing unit field. While Nvidia's GPUs can be adapted to nearly any computing situation, Broadcom's computing units couldn't care less about that. Instead, they're partnering with an AI hyperscaler to design custom AI accelerator chips that excel in only one type of workload. Because the hyperscalers know what their AI workloads will look like, they can purchase chips through Broadcom that have better performance and cost less than an Nvidia GPU, but can only be used for one purpose. I think this option will become far more popular in the next few years, making Broadcom a worthy competitor to Nvidia.
Lastly, there is Taiwan Semiconductor. Neither Nvidia nor Broadcom has the capabilities to produce their own chips. So, they farm that work out to the world's leading semiconductor manufacturer. Because Taiwan Semi is acting as a fabrication company that's not trying to compete directly in the AI arms race, it is positioned nicely to benefit from any increased AI spending. Odds are high that any chip being used in the AI arms race originated from a TSMC facility, making it a winner as long as data center capital expenditures are increasing.
All three of these companies are promising and can continue their dominant run over the next five years. If you don't own shares now, it's not too late to buy, as there could be incredible upside if Nvidia's management is correct on the general market trend."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-05T08:02:00,3 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency,"These companies are superior to crypto because they sell real products, not speculation.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7fe8dd11f0a46f061cfc357cb24471b879bc4c99951ee380c5ec6cbf9afd5fb3,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/3-tech-stocks-with-more-potential-than-any-cryptoc/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/3-tech-stocks-with-more-potential-than-any-cryptoc/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/05/3-tech-stocks-with-more-potential-than-any-cryptoc/,fool.com,200,,"Cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, but they still have the same issues they had when they came on the scene. Most cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile because they aren't based on fundamentals such as earnings, cash flow, or a viable product.
Like meme stocks, social media buzz can move cryptocurrencies wildly and rapidly. And if you're an investor, you need to be prepared to hold on for dear life and hope you don't take a big loss.
If you want huge gains that some cryptocurrencies offer, a better play is to look at some dynamic tech stocks. These names have crazy valuations, of course, and can also be volatile. But if you are considering crypto versus stocks, I think these names are far superior to cryptocurrencies because they're actually based on something more than speculation and hype.
Here are three tech stocks that can give you amazing gains that crypto traders can only dream about.
1. Nebius Group
Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%) is a new player on Wall Street and is only trading here because of some global intrigue. It was part of a Dutch holding company, Yandex N.V., that included the Russian internet company Yandex. The parent company traded on the Nasdaq until 2022 when the index halted trading and eventually delisted Yandex because of sanctions against Russian companies for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Yandex N.V. dumped its Russian assets and rebranded itself as Nebius, an artificial intelligence (AI) cloud provider that began publicly trading on the Nasdaq nearly a year ago.
Nebius' business model leans heavily into today's push of AI applications. It operates data centers that are specifically designed for operating AI technology. Customers rent graphics processing unit (GPU) computing power from Nebius rather than building their own costly data centers or using a public cloud.
Revenue in the second quarter was $105.1 million, up 625% from the previous year and 106% from Q1. The company posted a $91.5 million net loss in the quarter as it's spending heavily to build infrastructure in Europe, North America, and Israel.
Shares are up 320% this year, an astonishing gain. And while that growth rate can't be sustained, Nebius has an actual product and is by far a better play than any meme coin you'll stumble across.
2. Nvidia
There's no cryptocurrency that can duplicate what Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has done in the last three years or where it's headed. The semiconductor chip company rules the GPU space and continues to put up massive numbers every quarter. Its market cap of $4.5 trillion is unmatched, having risen 1,400% in the last 36 months.
Nvidia's revenue for fiscal 2026's Q2 (ending July 27, 2025) was a record $46.7 billion, up 56% from a year ago. The company saw data center revenue of $41.1 billion, up 56% from last year, and enjoyed non-GAAP net income of $25.78 billion, up 52% from a year ago.
Despite those insane numbers, it appears that Nvidia is just getting started. The company is projecting AI infrastructure to be an opportunity valued at between $3 trillion and $4 trillion. Considering that Nvidia gets anywhere from 75% to 90% of data center revenue right now, the potential of Nvidia stock is staggering.
3. Palantir Technologies
There are those who would surely argue that Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%) is as volatile and risky as any cryptocurrency. And maybe they're right. The data mining company is growing fast, but the company's valuation is a huge red flag. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 603, with a forward P/E of 204 and a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 130. Those numbers are just eye watering.
So how does Palantir set itself apart from crypto? It has an actual product -- a game-changing product that can't be duplicated by anyone. Palantir operates a massively complex and productive AI-powered platform that draws in data points from hundreds of sources, including satellites, incorporates them with AI, and draws conclusions to help companies, the military, and intelligence agencies make real-time decisions.
Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is in high demand. The company's revenue in Q2 jumped to $1 billion, up 48% from a year ago. Palantir closed 157 deals in the quarter valued at more than $1 million each, with 42 of them valued at more than $10 million.
U.S. commercial revenue in the quarter grew 93% to $306 million, and U.S. government revenue rose 53% to $426 million.
Palantir stock rose more than 2,100% in the last three years, including a gain of 139% so far in 2025. While there are detractors who say the stock is destined to fall, it's clear there is huge demand for Palantir's product and a big runway for the stock -- something that you can't say for any cryptocurrency."

In mid-August, the chipmaker secured a $2 billion investment from SoftBank, just ahead of an $8.9 billion investment from the U.S. government. In September, Intel added Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) to its growing list of stakeholders. The GPU maker is investing $5 billion in the company and partnering on new CPU designs for data centers and PCs.
With the influx of capital, backing from some of the biggest tech investors in the world, and the financial interest of the U.S. government, Intel has seen its stock price soar. However, the stock's valuation is now far less attractive than the prices those big investors paid for it. And despite Intel's relationship with SoftBank, Nvidia, and the U.S. government, this rival semiconductor stock still looks like a better investment.
The missing piece from Intel's deals
The big investments have created significant optimism about the future of Intel. Indeed, with Nvidia as a partner in chip design, it could help Intel win a bigger share of data center CPUs going forward.
But while Nvidia agreed to partner with Intel on new designs, it's notably won't use Intel for manufacturing its chips. That task remains with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%), known as TSMC.
During a press interview announcing the Nvidia-Intel deal, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised TSMC, saying, ""I just can't overstate the magic that is TSMC."" He noted there are no plans for Nvidia to stop working with the Taiwanese company anytime soon.
That's notable because Intel is still considering winding down its foundry operations if it can't secure a major customer contract for its 14A node process. Nvidia supposedly evaluated the process and decided to stick with TSMC. If Intel shuts down its foundry business, that would be a huge win for TSMC, as it will further secure its position as a leading-edge semiconductor manufacturer.
There's speculation that the U.S. government's involvement with Intel could nudge some chipmakers to favor the U.S. company's foundry services over those of foreign manufacturers. TSMC is working to combat that by building out production facilities in the U.S. And while Intel now has a lot of cash to pour into the foundry business, it'll be hard-pressed to catch up to TSMC's technology and capacity.
Intel raised about $16 billion from its stock sales over the last two months. For reference, TSMC is investing over $7 billion per year in research and development. On top of that, it's building a massive new R&D center in the United States. The company's total capital expenditures will come in close to $40 billion in 2025, ensuring it has the capacity and tooling it needs to fill the growing demand for leading-edge chips. It's doing all this while generating tens of billions in free cash flow.
In other words, TSMC has a huge advantage over Intel, and it has the ability to spend enough to stay well ahead of it.
The stock is attractive, especially compared to Intel
While TSMC has seen its stock price soar amid the booming demand for its chip manufacturing services, its valuation is still attractive. Shares of the company trade for about 28 times expected earnings. Considering TSMC's management expects sales to climb at a 20% compound annual growth rate between 2025 and 2029 while maintaining a strong margin profile, that's a great price to pay for the stock.
Meanwhile, Intel is seeing its profits dragged down by its foundry business, which produced a $3.2 billion loss in operating income last quarter. And this isn't the only recent quarter it's been losing money. But with CEO Lip-Bu Tan focused on cutting costs, combined with recent developments, analysts expect earnings to improve, rising to $1.20 per share by 2027.
However, that puts the stock's current price at 28 times its 2027 earnings. That compares to a 21 times multiple for TSMC's 2027 earnings expectations.
While those estimates may change if Intel secures a big customer for its foundry business and its 14A process, the odds of that happening seem slim, even as Intel seeks investments from more big tech companies."

The company known also as Foxconn reported revenue of NT$2.06 trillion ($67.6 billion) for the three months to September, generally in line with analysts’ projections. It also projected a rise in sales this quarter from the previous three months, citing strong AI demand.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Hon Hai’s results may lend weight to bets on the sustainability of a post-ChatGPT boom in AI infrastructure construction that’s swept up big tech firms like Meta Platforms Inc. and startups including OpenAI. Globally, investors have poured capital into the suppliers of that rollout, from chipmakers and networking firms to companies like Hon Hai that make servers to house Nvidia chips. Still, some investors have warned that valuations are unsustainable until AI services truly go mainstream.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Hon Hai’s unaudited 3Q25 revenue rose 11% YoY to a record for the quarter, driven by the strong cloud and networking segment amid surging AI infrastructure demand. This momentum should carry into 4Q and help offset softer consumer electronic revenue, which rose sequentially in 3Q on the iPhone 17 launch but still dipped YoY on currency impact.

The Taiwanese company has said it expects revenue from servers to have more than doubled in the September quarter while its consumer electronics business stagnates. It’s poised to gain from its role in OpenAI’s Stargate AI infrastructure project: Last month, the world’s most valuable startup unveiled plans to invest about $400 billion in five new US data center sites in partnership with Oracle Corp. and SoftBank Group Corp.
Foxconn still depends on Apple Inc. for a sizable portion of its revenue by assembling the US client’s gadgets including iPhones. But as those sales plateau, it’s grown increasingly reliant on the AI boom.
Yet seismic geopolitical shifts present threats to Hon Hai’s business. In May, it cut its full-year revenue guidance, citing potential fallout from the US-China trade war. It’s already diversifying its manufacturing footprint away from China in a bid to offset the damage."

Based on the forecasts above, Meta Platforms is the best trillion-dollar AI stock to buy now, though Microsoft and Amazon are close behind. Read on to learn more about the social media company and its pursuit of superintelligence.
Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve its advertising business
Meta Platforms owns three of the four most popular social media networks, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as measured by monthly active users. That those platforms attract 3.4 billion people daily makes Meta a key advertising partner for countless brands. And investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are only strengthening the value proposition.
Meta is using AI to create more engaging experiences across its social media. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says, ""AI is significantly improving our ability to show people content that they're going to find interesting and useful."" Users spent 5% more time on Facebook and 6% more time on Instagram during the second quarter due to improvements in the underlying recommendation engines.
Meanwhile, Meta made improvements to Andromeda (a machine learning system that powers ad retrieval) and applied the model to Facebook Reels, which increased conversion rates by 4%. Also, the company made improvements to GEM (a machine learning system that ranks and personalizes ads) that raised conversion rates by 3% on Facebook and 5% on Instagram.
Here's the big picture: Adtech spending is projected to grow at 14% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Meta Platforms, the second-largest adtech company, is well positioned to benefit from AI product development. Indeed, Malik Ahmed Khan at Morningstar writes, ""Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share.""
Meta Platforms sees a tremendous opportunity in smart glasses and superintelligence
Meta has established a business unit called Superintelligence Labs, which is focused on model development and product initiatives. The company has invested heavily to build data center infrastructure, with capital expenditures topping $100 billion in the last two years, and is actively recruiting top talent in the field.
The ultimate goal is to develop and monetize superintelligence, which means an AI system that is not only fundamentally smarter than people but also has the capacity to improve itself by learning without human intervention. There are several ways Meta could monetize such a system, but the company is particularly focused on smart glasses.
""Personal devices likes glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices,"" Zuckerberg wrote in July. ""Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful.""
Importantly, Meta is already the dominant player in the smart glasses market, and its lead is widening. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025, up from 66% in the second half of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Investors have good reason to think that trend will continue.
Meta recently introduced its first pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses called Ray-Ban Meta Display, which overlay the real world with a holographic color display on the right lens. The glasses are controlled by a wrist-worn device that tracks finger movements. It integrates with the conversational assistant Meta AI, but future models could integrate with a superintelligence system.
Smart glasses could become a substantial revenue stream for Meta. The augmented reality market is forecast to increase at 38% annually to reach $600 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research.
Meta Platforms stock trades at a reasonable valuation
Wall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17.3% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate is reasonable given that adtech spending is forecast to increase at 14% annually through 2030. But it also leaves room for upside if smart glasses or another superintelligence form factor becomes a material source of revenue.
Regardless, the present valuation of 25.9 times earnings is reasonable even if the forward earnings estimate is spot-on. Those numbers give a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.5. In that context, Meta is actually tied with Nvidia as the cheapest trillion-dollar stock. So, patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position today."

FuriosaAI founder and CEO June Paik said his startup’s architecture can reshape an industry dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). He told Benzinga he is determined to make FuriosaAI the company that powers the transition to sustainable AI, while declining to comment on reports of an $800 million acquisition offer from Meta (NASDAQ:META).
Yet, his message was clear. “We believe Furiosa will have the greatest impact as an independent company,"" Paik said. ""The world urgently needs new, much more energy-efficient ways to run advanced AI. We are committed to building the technology that will bring the benefits of sustainable AI to everyone.”
Paik added that being mission-driven has simplified key strategic choices, guiding Furiosa to remain independent and focused on long-term impact.

The Inherent Inefficiency Nvidia Can’t Fix
Paik sees Nvidia’s market dominance as both formidable and fundamentally vulnerable.
“Nvidia’s greatest strength—a legacy built on general-purpose [graphics processing units]—is also its Achilles’ heel,” he declared.”There is inherent inefficiency and architectural complexity that stems from using a general-purpose GPU architecture for specialized AI computing.""
Paik added, ""GPU makers have developed extremely sophisticated hardware and software workarounds to mitigate these limitations. But their efforts are directed at advancing on their current path, making it difficult for them to pivot to a new paradigm that is uniquely suited to AI.”
FuriosaAI started from first principles in 2017, designing the Tensor Contraction Processor architecture specifically for AI computations. “Our chip architecture, the Tensor Contraction Processor, works at a higher abstraction level,” Paik told Benzinga. “Tensor contraction is the fundamental operation in deep learning, which makes complex optimization problems much more tractable compared to the lower-level matrix multiplication used by GPUs.”
The architectural choice delivers practical advantages. “This means that when new AI models emerge, our compiler can run them efficiently without a massive effort to write hundreds of new, hand-tuned kernels,” Paik said. “It also means our chips minimize wasteful data movement, resulting in breakthrough power efficiency.”"

Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the stocks that Wall Street analysts are discussing these days.
Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, said in a latest program on CNBC that the AI trade is “alive and well” and companies like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continue to be the leaders in the space. Here is why the analyst likes Broadcom:
“With AVGO, they have huge demand from hyperscalers for their ASIC chips, very strong management team, ability to earn very strong earnings growth going forward. The stock actually is not as expensive as one might think given its earnings growth trajectory.”
What's Broadcom’s moat? It makes ASIC, chips designed for specific applications and tasks. As major companies look for custom chips to break Nvidia's monopoly and lower costs, Broadcom is positioned well to thrive. Many top AI spenders are teaming up with Broadcom to develop these chips, which are expected to be high-margin, high-volume products, potentially driving substantial growth in both revenue and profits. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASIC and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling.
Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Shares of fellow semiconductor giant Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also outperformed during the quarter, as customer demand for the company’s custom accelerator chips remained insatiable despite the uncertain economic environment. The company is on pace for 10 consecutive quarters of AI-related semiconductor growth and expects continued strong demand persist, due to the sizable AI opportunity. In addition to its dominant market position, the company’s history of strong capital returns to shareholders results in a favorable outlook for a sizable investor base.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
-
Erste Group upgraded Alibaba (BABA) to Buy from Hold. The firm says the company is ""developing very well"" in artificial intelligence applications.
-
Fox Advisors upgraded Instacart (CART) to Outperform from Equal-Weight. The firm thinks the 24% decline in the stock since August 11, including 16% over the past month, on ""overblown"" competitive concerns has made shares ""oversold,"" the firm tells investors.
-
Gordon Haskett upgraded Zillow (Z) to Buy from Hold with a $90 price target, citing the belief that the negative sentiment weighing on the shares over the past two weeks creates ""a favorable risk/reward.""
-
Wells Fargo upgraded Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $212, up from $170. The firm says its concerns around pharmaceutical tariffs, pricing risk and Stelara's loss of exclusivity are now largely behind Johnson & Johnson.
-
Rothschild & Co Redburn upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $417, up from $325. The firm still expects compression in the company's take rate over time, but believes its retail volume growth will help to mitigate this.
Top 5 Downgrades:
-
Jefferies downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $205.16, down from $205.82. Better demand for iPhone 17, likely driven by no price hike in the Pro and Pro Max models and ""an effective price cut"" on the 17 base model, is already in the price, which has led to ""excessive expectations"" on the replacement cycle and prospects of the 18 Fold, the firm tells investors.
-
Piper Sandler downgraded Instacart (CART) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $41, down from $62. The firm cites the company's rising competitive pressures from Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), Uber (UBER) and DoorDash (DASH) for the downgrade.
-
Wolfe Research downgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Peer Perform from Outperform with a fair value range of $70-$80. The firm believes the shares will be range-bound with investors requiring further proof of branded execution before getting more constructive.
-
KeyBanc downgraded Corteva (CTVA) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target after the company announced its intent to separate into two public companies.
-
Goldman Sachs downgraded Bumble (BMBL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $7, down from $8. The stock's risk/reward is more balanced at current levels, the firm tells investors in a research note."

Analyst Edison Lee cut his rating on the stock to underperform from hold, writing that the stock’s current valuation prices in an “overly bullish iPhone outlook.” Shares fell 0.9% on Friday.
The stock’s consensus recommendation — a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — now stands at 3.93 out of five, making Apple the least-loved of the Magnificent Seven except for Tesla Inc. Even so, bearish ratings for the stock are relatively rare. Fewer than 7% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a sell-equivalent rating on the shares. Roughly 57% recommend buying, while that ratio is above 90% for Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Amazon.com Inc.
The stock has risen more than 20% off a low hit in early August, an advance that has returned it near record levels. Despite that advance, the stock is barely positive this year, while the Nasdaq 100 Index has risen more than 15%.
Much of the recent strength has come on stronger-than-expected demand for the company’s latest iPhone, as well as optimism over an upcoming foldable model.
Lee wrote that “better demand for iPhone 17, partly due to a price cut on the base model, is already in the price,” and this “has led to excessive expectations on 18 Fold, and the replacement cycle.”
He added that it was unclear what market there would be for a phone that costs around $2,000, and trimmed his price target to $205.16 from $205.82. The stock last closed at $257.13, meaning the new target points to downside of more than 20%.

The stock has been a key beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, which has driven strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and computing solutions.
Year to date, NVIDIA shares have soared 40.5%, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 23.6%. It has even outpaced major semiconductor companies, including QUALCOMM QCOM, Texas Instruments TXN and Marvell Technology MRVL. QUALCOMM’s stock has gained 9.9% year to date, while shares of Texas Instruments and Marvell Technology have fallen 2.8% and 22%, respectively.

This outperformance shows investors are becoming increasingly confident in NVIDIA’s long-term prospects, even in a volatile market shaped by trade conflicts and geopolitical risks. We believe this momentum is grounded in strong fundamentals, and NVDA’s long-term outlook justifies a hold position for now.
AI Boom Keeps Driving NVIDIA’s Data Center Business
NVIDIA’s most powerful growth engine continues to be its Data Center business. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the segment generated $41.1 billion in revenues, representing 87.9% of total sales. This marked a staggering 56% year-over-year increase and 5% sequential growth.
The robust performance was mainly driven by higher shipments of the Blackwell GPU computing platforms that are used for the training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications.
The demand for NVIDIA’s Hopper 200 and Blackwell GPU computing platforms has been a key catalyst as cloud providers and enterprises scale their AI infrastructure. Large cloud service providers contributed to the majority of Data Center revenues, indicating continued hyperscale investment in AI-driven computing.
With AI adoption accelerating across industries, NVIDIA's stronghold in data centers makes it a critical beneficiary of this trend. The company’s leadership in AI chip development positions it well for sustained revenue growth in this segment.
NVIDIA’s Resilient Financial Performance
Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical issues, and trade and tariff wars, NVIDIA’s financials remain rock solid. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues jumped 56% from the year-ago quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share rose 54%.
The company reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 61%, maintaining profitability despite rising operational expenses. Non-GAAP operating income jumped 51% year over year to $30.17 billion, reflecting the company’s ability to convert strong revenue growth into bottom-line gains."

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) thought it had a breakthrough deal this spring supply the United Arab Emirates with hundreds of thousands of its coveted AI chips each year in return for fresh Emirati investment in the U.S.
Five months later, nothing has moved. The money hasn't shown up, and the chips haven't shipped.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the deal is caught in Washington's balancing act. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has made it clear the UAE must put cash on the table before any export licenses are granted. Behind that push are security concerns, given the country's close ties to China.
The delay has frustrated Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has staked the company's growth on global demand for AI hardware. It has also irritated some White House officials, who wanted to point to the deal as proof of America's tech leadership."

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained ground Thursday after a Semafor scoop said Intel (INTC) holds early-stage talks to add AMD as a foundry customer.
The report pushed investor interest in chipmakers, with traders parsing what a U.S.-based manufacturing tie-up could mean for supply chains and competition.
Markets reacted: AMD shares rose 3% on Thursday late morning amid the headlines and broader AI-driven demand that already lifts chip peers.
Analysts note AMD still relies heavily on TSMC (NYSE:TSM) for production today, so any deal with Intel would represent a material shift if it moves forward.
The rally sits against a backdrop of strong chip-sector momentum, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and others also saw gains as investors weigh AI spending trends.
Is AMD Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 41 analysts, the average target price for Advanced Micro Devices Inc is $184.58 with a high estimate of $230.00 and a low estimate of $134.20. The average target implies a upside of +9.58% from the current price of $168.44.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Advanced Micro Devices Inc in one year is $191.35, suggesting a upside of +13.60% from the current price of $168.44. Gf value is Gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at.

The firm highlighted four main drivers of the increase: “Upgrading trad. infrastructure to accelerated computing; Protecting existing moats in search, social, ecommerce, cloud services from being disrupted by likes of OpenAI, xAI, neoclouds; Sovereign builds-outs; and Steady enterprise adoption of AI productivity tools.”
BofA said the current AI infrastructure buildout is more resilient than past cycles because it is “funded by strong cash flows of hyperscalers and government buyers – top 5 US cloud providers alone will spend capex equal to 25% of sales CY25 sales, well covered by 30%+ operating cash flows – while AI adoption can happen without costly consumer device upgrades.”
The bank raised its cloud capex tracker, now seeing “$443bn/$528bn in capex from top public cloud vendors, up +58%/+19% YoY from +54%/+16% prior. Capex could 3x towards $1.2Tn+ by CY30E at current levels of 25-30% capex intensity.”
Chip companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, Marvell, Credo, and semiconductor equipment vendors Lam Research and KLA were cited as well-positioned.
On concerns around vendor financing, BofA said Nvidia’s $100 billion commitment to OpenAI “should not be viewed as free money/GPUs” but instead as a force multiplier driving further hyperscaler investment.

Nebius Group Investment Narrative Recap
The core thesis behind Nebius Group is that surging enterprise demand for cloud-based AI compute will sustain the company’s rapid expansion and revenue growth potential. The multi-billion dollar Microsoft partnership strengthens Nebius’ position as a go-to provider of dedicated AI infrastructure, but the biggest near-term catalysts, like accelerated revenue growth from hyperscaler contracts, remain tightly linked to execution. The most immediate risk is potential dilution from heavy capital raising; the Microsoft deal does not eliminate this concern, though it could help ease funding pressures depending on contract terms.
One of the most relevant recent events is the completion of Nebius’s US$1 billion follow-on equity offering in September, a move that adds to its financial resources to meet rising infrastructure needs. This announcement ties directly to the short-term growth opportunities presented by the Microsoft agreement, but also heightens shareholder sensitivity to dilution and long-term returns on new capital invested.
However, investors should be aware that despite strong momentum, shareholder dilution risk remains elevated in the near term...

It's time now for today's trending tickers.
Nvidia striking another deal this morning. This time with Japanese telecom and computer giant Fujitsu.
The companies will work together on AI to make smart robots and other innovations using Nvidia's computer chips.
The hope is to establish the AI infrastructure for Japan by 2030.
Invidia CEO Jensen Huang taking the stage overnight saying quote, building the infrastructure to power it is essential in Japan and around the world.
Shares of Fujitsu closing higher by 3% uh overnight and ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street Nvidia shares catching a bit of a bid too, poised to open higher as well.
But there is trouble brewing for Japan and its beer supply. Asahi Group is under pressure this week after a cyber attack crippled production operations on Monday.
Bars and restaurants in Japan are already reporting they are running out of Asahi products.
A report in the financial Times Thursday saying that Asahi's Super Dry supply could dry up in two or three days.
Now Asahi is working to restore its computer system, but the company says it is unclear how soon the company can resume full operations.
Computers are still down, but the company has started processing some orders by visiting customers in person and handwriting orders.
Now Asahi says it's looking into the effect the attack will have on earnings.
We're also watching shares of Pateer this morning.
The stock right now is little changed, but a new report says the company's Battlefield communication software that it built with Andul and others has major flaws.
Reuters is starting citing an internal army memo which says it has fundamental security problems and should be treated as a very high risk.
This coming months after Andul was awarded a 100 million contract to create the prototype for the platform with other companies including Pateer and Microsoft.
Neither Pateer nor Andul provided a comment to Reuters.

Now they're issuing debt, too.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9ebc8c4a7388b7525a4d5ed5602aae323da0b917095af4f246fabc7eaa943f46,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-increasingly-fueled-debt-115949675.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-increasingly-fueled-debt-115949675.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-increasingly-fueled-debt-115949675.html,yahoo.com,200,,"-
Goldman Sachs warned AI spending is increasingly debt-financed, slightly weakening corporate credit quality. The S&P 500 set a new all-time high driven in part by AI spending from Big Tech. Nvidia, Palantir, and Amazon rose yesterday.
The S&P 500 rose to a new all-time high yesterday, up slightly to hit 6,715. AI stocks led the way, again, with Palantir up 1.1%, Nvidia rising 0.91%, and Amazon climbing by 0.81%.
In the absence of macro jobs data, a result of the U.S. government shutdown, traders are piling into AI stocks, ING told clients this morning: “Financial market volatility is falling across the board, partly driven by the U.S. government shutdown and the delay to key data releases such as the September jobs data. Instead, investors remain transfixed by the AI-driven rally in megacap tech shares, which shows no signs of slowing.” S&P futures were up 0.12% this morning, premarket.
Stocks are benefiting from the massive amount of capital expenditure (capex) coming from companies that are investing heavily in AI. Wedbush’s Dan Ives told clients in a note this morning: “For now, AI is being driven by a handful of U.S. Big Tech players spending almost $350 billion on capex this year with now the cavalry coming as more enterprises and governments from around the world get into the AI spending game.
“The Middle East is a perfect example as now Saudi and UAE are diving into the deep end of the pool with Nvidia and U.S. hyperscalers set to build out massive AI-driven data centers to fuel the use cases for the coming years.”
But where is all that money coming from, exactly?
Goldman Sachs notes that, increasingly, it is coming from debt. Over the past three years, most capex came from the cash sitting on tech companies’ balance sheets. But now those companies are increasingly borrowing money to fund AI build-out.
“These AI-related issuers have accounted for $141 billion in corporate credit issuance in 2025 to date, eclipsing full-year 2024 gross supply of $127 billion,” Lotfi Karoui and his colleagues wrote in a note seen by Fortune.
The shift will marginally reduce the quality of corporate credit, Karoui wrote. “The read-through for credit markets is, on the margin, negative, in our view. While not yet a cause for alarm, given both the high cash-flow generation and low leverage among large tech companies, the shifting funding mix of capex beyond cash is worth monitoring.”
The note adds to recent talk on Wall Street about the quality of corporate debt. Two auto-industry companies, First Brands and Tricolor, recently collapsed into bankruptcy because they issued too much debt to lenders who thought they were safe. Jim Chanos and Pimco President Christian Stracke have both recently bemoaned cracks in the private credit market."

The collaboration centers on building industry-specific AI agents that continuously learn and adapt, forming what both companies describe as the foundation for the next phase of the AI industrial revolution.
The effort will integrate Fujitsu’s Monaka Central Processing Units (CPUs) with Nvidia’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) via NVLink Fusion, enabling more specialized systems than general-purpose architectures can provide.

“Fujitsu’s strategic collaboration with NVIDIA will accelerate AI-driven business transformation in enterprise and government sectors. By combining the cutting-edge technologies of both companies, we will develop and provide full-stack AI infrastructure, starting with sectors such as manufacturing where Japan is a global leader. To further support the expanding needs of AI infrastructure, Fujitsu and NVIDIA will expand this partnership in the areas of high-performance computing and quantum,” said Fujitsu CEO Takahito Tokita.
“The AI industrial revolution has begun, and we must build the infrastructure to power it, in Japan and across the globe. Fujitsu is a true pioneer in computing and Japan’s trusted leader in supercomputing, quantum research, and enterprise systems. Together, NVIDIA and Fujitsu are connecting and extending our ecosystems to forge a powerful partnership for the era of AI,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang added.
Fujitsu framed the collaboration against a backdrop of rising demand for generative AI, where high costs and technical hurdles have kept adoption largely confined to major corporations.
The company said the partnership is designed to address those barriers by creating scalable infrastructure that balances performance, security, and enterprise autonomy.
The deal comes as Nvidia continues to ride surging demand for its GPUs, which underpin most of the world’s cutting-edge AI systems. The company’s stock has surged 41% year-to-date, far outpacing the Nasdaq 100 index’s 19% gain. Earlier this week, Nvidia became the first company to reach a $4.5 trillion market capitalization, underscoring its central role in the AI boom.
Price Action: NVDA stock was trading higher by 0.55% to $189.92 premarket at last check Friday.

How does our tendency to procrastinate show up in corporate finance?
For Tesla (TSLA), it's customers rushing to purchase vehicles just before the expiration of crucial tax credits. The electric auto company reported surprisingly strong third quarter global deliveries Thursday as the sunset of the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US appeared to reverse what had been a sales decline.
The sunny report served as a stark reminder that Tesla, and other EV makers, face a harsher market ahead without the draw and cushion of government subsidies. Because it wasn't just Tesla that enjoyed a last-minute feast of sales.
Tesla's robust Q3 followed similarly strong EV sales results from GM (GM), Ford (F), and Rivian (RIVN), my colleague Pras Subramanian reported. Buyers likely fast-tracked their decisions to purchase EVs after a Republican-led Congress phased out the federal tax credit.
The rush to cash in on tax breaks before their end comes at a moment of uncertainty for Tesla. A challenging first half of the year, tied in part to the public backlash against CEO Elon Musk, has weighed on the company, just as it works to redefine itself as an AI and robotics giant.
That helps explain why the stock fell even after beating Wall Street delivery estimates, but remains near all-time highs.
If the criticism against Tesla — the stock — is that it is divorced from the actual business of selling cars, then the response from its leadership and faithful backers is that Tesla isn't a car company, and shouldn't trade like one.
Investors are eyeing production plans for the Cybercab, Tesla's dedicated autonomous vehicle at the heart of its robotaxi service. The company plans to start churning them out as soon as next year. And the bulls hope it's a paradigm shift.
""The AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for TSLA over the next six to nine months has now begun,"" Wedbush analyst and vocal Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a note to clients on Thursday.
But what's most striking about Tesla's bull case is that even as the company says farewell to special tax breaks, its most optimistic forecasts rely on — and perhaps even take for granted — another kind of government assistance elevating the company to multitrillion-dollar heights."

""Moore Threads' rapid IPO process reflects that the domestic GPU industry is entering a critical period,"" said Zhang Xinyuan, an analyst from Beijing-based think tank Kefangde.
The listing, in which Moore Threads expected to raise 8 billion yuan (US$1.12 billion), would significantly accelerate the large-scale commercialisation of the company's GPUs, Zhang added.

Stocks to Gain from Quantum Computing in 2025
This year has seen quantum computing being pushed from lab interests toward practical deployments. Vendors and tech giants published official updates showing progress on error correction, larger qubit systems, hybrid quantum-classical stacks and new research centers aimed at real-world use.
Google reiterated its Willow roadmap and published research on error correction and scalable chips and NVIDIA launched a dedicated “Quantum Day” and announced an Accelerated Quantum Research Center to couple AI supercomputing with quantum research. Pure plays like Rigetti highlighted multi-chip systems and new commercial availability in their quarterly results. Together, these companies have sketched a year of measurable engineering advances and growing commercialization pathways.
Below are four stocks expected to gain from quantum computing in 2025.
Microsoft
Microsoft’s first-half 2025 quantum computing-based developments center on Majorana 1 and on partnerships to scale quantum hardware and control. Earlier this year, the company unveiled Majorana 1 as a breakthrough topological-qubit processor and a measurement/control approach intended to simplify qubit control and make very large qubit counts practical, positioning Microsoft to pursue a distinct, potentially more scalable hardware path than superconducting or trapped-ion approaches.
Microsoft’s focus on developer toolchains and collaborations to accelerate scalable systems suggests the company is pushing both hardware differentiation and cloud integration as its path to commercial quantum advantage. For investors who prefer a diversified tech heavyweight’s exposure to quantum instead of startups, Microsoft’s official roadmap points to multi-front engagement.
IBM
IBM in 2025 is pursuing a stepwise engineering route to fault-tolerant quantum computing that includes building a new IBM Quantum Data Center and an explicit roadmap toward large-scale, fault-tolerant machines. IBM also highlighted international System Two deployments, including a collaboration with RIKEN, along with continued Nighthawk-family hardware and software releases to expand circuit complexity, all signaling IBM’s investment in data-center-scale infrastructure, strategic partnerships and software stacks to support near-term commercial users and research collaborators."

Tesla (TSLA) stock tumbled, even after it reported blowout third quarter global deliveries, as the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit in the US likely juiced sales.
Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company.
Tesla (TSLA) stock but fell over 5% in Thursday trading, but looked set to recover slightly when markets open later on, trading up 1.4% in premarket.

Competitor Rivian (RIVN) on Thursday issued a dour forecast that cast a spotlight on the electric vehicle (EV) industry's gloom, as it looks to a world without the federal credit.
Tesla (TSLA) also said global production came in at 447,450. The company deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products.
Tesla's huge Q3 follows similarly strong EV sales results from GM (GM), Ford (F), and Rivian. Buyers likely pulled forward EV sales after the Republican-led US government phased out the federal $7,500 (£5,570) EV tax credit.
Occidental (OXY)
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) confirmed on Thursday reports earlier in the week that it is set to buy out Occidental's chemical division, OxyChem, in a $9.7bn, all-cash transaction
The transaction would be the firm's largest deal since it bought Alleghany in 2022 for $11.6bn.
It was earlier reported that Occidental (OXY) was in late-stage talks to sell the OxyChem division in a process aimed at reducing its debt load. The Warren Buffet-owned conglomerate emerged as the suitor on Tuesday, as first reported by the Financial Times.
OxyChem will be an operating subsidiary within Berkshire (BRK-A), the companies said, while a subsidiary of Occidental will retain the chemical unit’s legacy environmental liabilities.
Occidental's stock price lost 7.3% in trade on Thursday but looked set to recover some of those losses, trading 1.3% higher in premarket on Friday.
Asahi (4216.T)
Tokyo-listed shares of beer-maker Asahi (4216.T) remained resilient on Friday, even amid reports that its factories have been shutdown for nearly a week due to a cyber attack.
""No immediate recovery of our system is in sight at the moment. Ordinary shipments remain halted,"" a spokesperson, who declined to be named, told AFP on Friday.
""Production is not directly affected (by the system dysfunction) but it has been halted because shipments are suspended."""
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-03T09:00:00,"Nvidia's Stock Is Up Over 1,100% Since 2023. Is It Too Late to Buy?","If Nvidia's management is correct, this run is just getting started.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4e2fbf735776f0c5a8826161ca445d66c7c72362697f4ea6ce3b75e862fa46b1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/nvidias-stock-is-up-over-1100-since-2023-is-it-too/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/nvidias-stock-is-up-over-1100-since-2023-is-it-too/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/03/nvidias-stock-is-up-over-1100-since-2023-is-it-too/,fool.com,200,,"If you bought Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) at the start of 2023, you're very happy. The stock is up more than 1,100% since then, for a phenomenal return in a short time frame. However, after a run like that, investors would be forgiven if they thought they were too late to buy.
This thought process is called price anchoring, where your mind anchors itself to what the stock price was, making you think that you've missed the boat. However, the more appropriate (albeit difficult) way to think is to picture where it is going. If you can do that with Nvidia stock, it's clear that it has a huge growth runway, and that even after its monstrous run, it still has plenty of steam to keep going.
Management believes data center capital expenditures will rise dramatically
Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the semiconductors of choice for training and processing artificial intelligence (AI) models. GPUs can perform multiple calculations in parallel, making them ideal for workloads that require vast computing power, like AI. While there are a handful of competitors in this space, Nvidia is by far the preferred option and has a 90% market share in the data center realm.
Because its market share is so dominant and demand currently is greater than supply, the company's biggest customers are working closely with it to ensure that there are enough GPUs available for them to outfit their data centers when construction is complete. So, when management makes a bold projection about the direction of the industry, investors should listen.
This year, Nvidia expects data center capital expenditures to reach $600 billion globally. By 2030, that figure is expected to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion. That's monstrous growth, and if that pans out, the company clearly has more room to run.
While I think huge projections like that should be met with some amount of skepticism, the reality is that the chipmaker has more information than anyone else in the industry because of its close ties with its customers. Even if the forecasts are wrong on the total amount, they are likely correct on the general direction, which makes Nvidia an intriguing stock to consider buying now, even after its strong run.
The stock is a no-brainer buy if management is correct
At its current price tag, the stock doesn't look cheap. At 40 times forward earnings, it's at the high end of the range it has traded at over the past three years. However, it's roughly in line with its level at about this time last year, so it is staying pretty true to its historical data.
Should Nvidia's market projection pan out, this will actually be a fairly cheap price to pay, since it could result in revenue more than tripling over the next five years.
However, if AI spending ends up nowhere near where management projects, this could prove to be too high a price to pay, making it a poor investment. Considering all of the recent spending announcements and Nvidia's track record of success, I'd say there's a low probability of this happening.
The market tends to double every seven years, and if Nvidia's revenue growth is correlated to its stock growth, this makes it a worthy investment now because it will likely outperform the market if the demand turns out to be as strong as management projects it will be.
There is a ton of money flowing into AI infrastructure, and Nvidia grabs the largest slice of the pie of anyone operating in this space. This makes it a no-brainer buy right now, and investors should be happy to have paid today's price years down the road."

A good case can be made for artificial intelligence (AI). Since OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, the stock market has enjoyed strong momentum overall. Mega-cap AI stocks led the way, especially Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Meta Platforms (META 1.20%).
While these tech titans are still going strong, they haven't been the biggest AI winners in 2025. Three other sizzling-hot AI stocks have skyrocketed over 120% this year.
1. AppLovin
AppLovin (APP 2.08%) makes software and AI solutions for mobile advertising, marketing, and analytics. The company's core AppDiscovery solution helps mobile app developers connect with targeted users. Its MAX product runs an in-app auction that increases monetization of ads displayed in mobile apps. AppLovin's Adjust platform helps advertisers analyze data from their campaigns. Wurl is a connected TV platform that distributes streaming video and helps put content in front of the ideal audiences.
This stock has delivered an impressive gain of more than 120% so far in 2025. Over the last three years, AppLovin's shares have generated a jaw-dropping return of more than 36x.
AppLovin's revenue jumped 77% year over year in the second quarter of 2025 to around $1.3 billion. The company's net income vaulted 164% higher to $820 million.
Can this stock's momentum continue? Maybe, but Wall Street isn't optimistic. The average 12-month price target for AppLovin is roughly 18% below the current share price.
2. CoreWeave
AI hyperscaler CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) conducted its initial public offering (IPO) on March 28, 2025. The company operates a cloud platform that's specifically built for hosting generative AI applications. Nvidia is a major partner with CoreWeave as well as an investor, with the huge GPU maker's stake worth nearly $4 billion at the end of Q2.
CoreWeave's IPO was a big success. The AI stock is up more than 240% after only around six months of trading publicly.
The company's revenue more than tripled year over year in Q2. Although CoreWeave isn't profitable, that's mainly because it's investing heavily in building out additional AI infrastructure to support fast-growing demand.
Analysts don't think CoreWeave stock will move much higher over the next 12 months. However, most of their forecasts came before the company announced a massive $14 billion deal with Meta in late September.
3. Nebius Group
Another AI hyperscaler has been an even bigger winner than CoreWeave in 2025. Nebius Group's (NBIS -1.73%) shares have more than quadrupled year to date. The stock shows few signs of slowing down.
Nebius Group has an interesting history. It was initially known as Yandex, which operates the largest search engine and ride-sharing service in Russia. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the company sold all of its Russian assets and rebranded itself under the Nebius Group name with a focus on AI infrastructure. That looks like a smart move in retrospect, with Nebius' revenue soaring 625% year over year in Q2.
However, operating an AI cloud platform isn't Nebius Group's only business. The company's Avride subsidiary develops autonomous driving technology. Avride is gearing up for a commercial launch of an autonomous ride-hailing service in partnership with Uber Technologies (UBER 0.35%) in Dallas, Texas, later this year. TripleTen, another subsidiary, uses AI to help technology workers improve their skills. In addition, Nebius Group owns stakes in open-source database company ClickHouse and AI data specialist Toloka.
Wall Street analysts appear to be more bullish about Nebius Group than they are about AppLovin and CoreWeave. The consensus 12-month price target among analysts surveyed by S&P Global (SPGI -0.82%) in September reflected an upside potential of around 36%. Five of the six analysts recommended Nebius Group stock as a ""buy"" or a ""strong buy."""

Since then, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) shares have advanced 1,190%, and Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%) shares have advanced 2,810%. The Wall Street consensus suggests investors can still buy Nvidia, but they should consider selling Palantir.
- Among 66 analysts, Nvidia has an average target price of $218 per share. That implies 15% upside from its current share price of $189.
- Among 29 analysts, Palantir Technologies has an average target price of $157 per share. That implies 15% downside from its current share price of $185.
Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Palantir.
Nvidia: 15% upside implied by the average target price
The investment thesis for Nvidia rests squarely on its status as the industry standard in AI infrastructure. The company is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips also known as AI accelerators, but it actually designs rack-scale systems equipped with GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), interconnects, and networking equipment to provide a turnkey solution for data centers.
Importantly, while several companies are developing custom AI chips with assistance from Broadcom and Marvell, Nvidia GPUs are likely to remain the dominant AI accelerator due to its CUDA programming model, an unparalleled ecosystem of software tools that support application development across use cases ranging from recommender systems to robotics.
Beth Kindig, technology analyst at the I/O Fund, says Nvidia benefits from an ""impenetrable moat from the CUDA software platform."" Similarly, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh writes, ""With significant barriers to entry created by its CUDA software stack, we see limited competitive risks and expect Nvidia to continue to dominate"" the market for AI accelerators.
Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to increase at 36% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 54 times earnings look reasonable. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position today, provided they can tolerate volatility. Nvidia has lost at least 50% of its value seven times since going public in 1999.
Palantir: 15% downside implied by the average target price
The investment thesis for Palantir centers on its position as the emerging leader in AI software. Its core data analytics platforms help commercial businesses and government agencies manage and make sense of complex information, and its AI platform lets customers build large language models (LLMs) into business processes and applications.
Palantir has distinguished itself with unique software architecture. Its platforms are built around an ontology, a framework that defines the relationships between digital data points and real-world assets to support decision making. The ontology also captures operational outcomes (i.e., the impact of a particular decision) to create a feedback loop that improves insights over time.
CTO Shyam Sankar recently told analysts that Palantir's ontology-based software affords the company a ""unique moat and a massive lead"" over its competitors. Indeed, Forrester Research recently recognized Palantir as the technology leader in AI and machine learning platforms, awarding the company higher scores than Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft.
Palantir has reported accelerating sales growth in eight straight quarters, due primarily to unrelenting demand for its AI platform. And the company is well positioned to maintain its momentum. Grand View Research estimates spending on data analytics software will increase at 29% annually through 2030, driven by the growing adoption of AI tools.
However, Palantir has a serious valuation problem. The stock currently trades at 137 times sales, a valuation that few software companies have ever achieved. For context, the next closest S&P 500 stock is AppLovin at 43 times sales. That means Palantir would retain its title as the most expensive stock in the index even if its share price dropped 65%.
Anecdotally, I've heard pundits say valuation doesn't matter with Palantir, but that is alarmingly shortsighted. I recently reviewed software valuations and found only seven other stocks that topped 100 times sales since 2000. And among those seven stocks, the average decline was 74% from the peak price-to-sales multiple."

In an investigation, the Ottawa-based researchers concluded that TSMC manufactured the dies used in the Huawei accelerators. They also uncovered an older-generation type of high-bandwidth memory, designated HBM2E, made by Samsung and SK Hynix. Components from the two manufacturers were found in two different samples of the Ascend 910C, TechInsights said.
Huawei didn’t respond to a request for comment during a weeklong holiday in China.
The Shenzhen-based hardware giant has been a target of American policymakers since President Donald Trump’s first term, when Washington embarked on a yearslong campaign to curtail Beijing’s semiconductor prowess. It added Huawei to its Entity List, restricting the flow of technology to the Chinese firm.
The broader US effort has also included export restrictions on AI chips themselves, the HBM they’re paired with, and the tools and components used to make both. Those policies aim to curtail Beijing’s access to frontier AI systems, and also prevent Huawei and other Chinese chipmakers from developing the manufacturing capacity to challenge Nvidia Corp. on the global stage.
Chinese officials, meanwhile, want to wean the country off Nvidia chips, and Huawei’s 910C is the most competitive domestic offering. It entered mass shipment earlier this year. While Huawei is working to boost the number of 910C chips made by local partners, the company’s access to foreign goods — stockpiled ahead of, or around, export controls — has been of crucial importance.
In one prominent example, Huawei managed to get millions of dies manufactured at TSMC from an intermediary company called Sophgo that didn’t disclose it would resell the components to the Chinese firm. TSMC cut off Sophgo and reported the incident to the US government, which sanctioned the company. Still, Huawei has been able to use the stockpile of some 2.9 million dies in its Ascend chips and will have enough for the 910C through this year, according to estimates from SemiAnalysis experts including Dylan Patel."

“The AI industrial revolution has already begun. Building the infrastructure to power it is essential in Japan and around the world,” Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said, hugging his Fujitsu counterpart Takahito Tokita on stage.
Fujitsu stock closed 3% up on Friday.
“Japan can lead the world in AI and robotics,” Huang told reporters at a Tokyo hotel.
The companies will work together on building what they called “an AI infrastructure,” or the system on which the various futuristic AI uses will be based, including health care, manufacturing, the environment, next-generation computing and customer services. The hope is to establish that AI infrastructure for Japan by 2030.
It initially will be tailored for the Japanese market, leveraging Fujitsu’s decades-long experience here, but may later expand globally, and will utilize Nvidia’s GPUs, or graphics processing units, which are essential for AI, according to both sides.
The two executives did not outline specific projects or give a monetary figure for planned investments. But exploring a collaboration in AI for robots with Yaskawa Electric Corp., a Japanese machinery and robot maker, was noted as a possible example. AI will be constantly evolving and learning, they said.
Fujitsu and Nvidia have been working together on AI, speeding up manufacturing with digital twins and robotics to tackle aging Japan’s labor shortages.
Tokita said the companies were taking a “humancentric” approach aimed at keeping Japan competitive.
“Through our collaboration with Nvidia, we aim to create new, unprecedented technologies and contribute to solving even more serious social issues,” said Tokita.

These types of stocks carry considerably more risk, but if one hits it big, the payoff will be worth it.
Let's look at two growth stocks that have the potential to go parabolic.
1. IonQ
IonQ (IONQ -5.85%) wants to do for quantum computing what Nvidia did for artificial intelligence (AI), and it's not shy about saying so. The company is trying to solve one of the hardest problems in tech, which is to make quantum computing less prone to errors.
Because quantum computing uses qubits that can be either a 0 or 1 at the same time, it can solve problems exponentially faster than traditional computing. The catch, though, is that this also makes the technology error-prone.
IonQ is betting that its trapped-ion technology, which uses actual atoms instead of fabricated qubits, can deliver more stable results with fewer errors. It's also developed its Clifford Noise Reduction software to help reduce logical error rates even further.
The company also understands that quantum computers and software by themselves don't solve the entire issue of quantum computing, so it has also invested in and acquired companies involved in quantum networking and other areas. It recently showed that it can convert photons from its trapped-ion system into telecom wavelengths, which would allow quantum computers to communicate over existing fiber networks. That opens the door to a future quantum internet.
While IonQ is well capitalized, the company has only generated $28.3 million in revenue through the first half of the year and has produced negative free cash flow of $89 million. This is not a stock you're buying because it's about to see a big surge in revenue or profits -- you're investing in its future potential. The problem is that no one knows if and when this potential will be realized.
However, the prize, if IonQ succeeds, is enormous. If a company can crack the code for quantum computing, its stock will likely go parabolic.
2. SoundHound AI
While IonQ is working to reinvent computing, SoundHound AI (SOUN 2.66%) is turning its focus on changing how people interact with AI. The company has its roots in music recognition, but has evolved into a voice-first AI platform. Its goal is to take AI beyond just text chat and apply voice AI so that people can interact with AI more naturally. As AI moves to its next phase with AI agents, this becomes even more important.
SoundHound's Amelia 7.0 platform is a big step in that direction. It's designed to let AI agents go beyond answering questions to actually planning and executing tasks through natural conversation. Its technology was designed to handle speech-to-meaning and deep-meaning understanding in real time, which means it can process what someone is saying even before they finish talking.
Meanwhile, SoundHound's acquisition of Amelia brought with it conversational intelligence and industry-specific knowledge. This type of voice-first platform would be huge in helping companies automate call centers or customer service without frustrating customers.
SoundHound AI has been seeing rapid growth, with revenue surging 217% year over year in its most recent quarter to $42.7 million. Meanwhile, management expects to reach adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) profitability by the end of 2025. SoundHound is currently transitioning 15 of its largest customers to Amelia 7.0, so this growth is coming even before its big agentic AI push.
Competition in AI agents is intense, but SoundHound's voice-first approach could be a real differentiator. If it can become a leader in agentic AI, this relatively small company could see its stock price move sharply higher over the next few years."

Shares in Nvidia pulled back slightly on Friday.
This week has seen extra momentum after South Korean semiconductor giants Samsung and SK hynix said they had struck a preliminary deal with OpenAI to supply chips and other equipment for its Stargate project.
Positive sentiment has also been supported by data in recent months pointing to a slowdown in the US labor market, which led the Federal Reserve to cut borrowing costs and indicate more easing could come.
Traders brushed off a standoff in Washington that has seen the government partially shut down, leading to the closure of some services and the delay of key monthly jobs figures that would normally have been published on Friday.
While the readings on non-farm payrolls is a major guide for the Fed when deciding monetary policy, analysts said the shutdown was unlikely to deter the Fed from an expected second rate cut this month.
""Markets seem to have taken this political impasse in their stride, showing little sign of stress,"" said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.

Intel CEO Tan Says Corintis Is Becoming Industry Leader With 10,000 Systems Deployed
The Switzerland-based company emerged from stealth with a solution to one of AI's most pressing limitations: heat. Corintis says it has already manufactured over 10,000 cooling systems with deployments running in data centers on leading-edge AI chips.

The AI cloud infrastructure company reinvented itself, transitioning from a crypto mining company by repurposing its GPUs to provide AI computing power to customers like Microsoft, Nvidia, and OpenAI.
With the AI boom in full swing, that business model has led to jaw-dropping growth. In its second quarter, its revenue jumped 206% to $1.21 billion, showing how fast demand for its services is ramping up.
Now, CoreWeave just got another shot in the arm as the stock jumped 12% on Tuesday after announcing another blockbuster deal, this time with Meta Platforms (META 1.20%).
What's happening with CoreWeave and Meta?
Meta is committing to spend up to $14.2 billion through 2032 on cloud computing capacity from CoreWeave, with an option to expand its commitment.
The deal comes at a time when Meta has been ramping up its spending on AI, seeing it as a must-win for its future. In June, Meta acquired a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data-labeling start-up, and poached its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to run its new AI lab.
On the same day that the CoreWeave news came out, Meta also announced that it's buying the chip start-up Rivos, which designs chips based on RISC-V architecture, an alternative to those used by leading CPU architecture designers Arm, Intel, and AMD. Rivos is also expected to help Meta build out full-stack AI systems.
For CoreWeave, the deal builds on the earlier momentum it earned when it signed an expanded $6.5 billion agreement with OpenAI in September, bringing its total contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.
The drumbeat of positive news for AI includes rival Nebius's $17 billion deal with Microsoft, Oracle's huge cloud computing forecast, and CoreWeave's own wins, including OpenAI, Meta, and a $6.3 billion deal with Nvidia, in which it will buy any of CoreWeave's unused capacity, effectively backstopping the company's growth.
Those news items, and improving sentiment around CoreWeave, sparked a recovery in the stock last month. After falling by more than 50% from its peak in June, CoreWeave jumped more than 50% off its lows early in September.
Is CoreWeave overvalued?
CoreWeave is a challenging stock to value. The company is delivering phenomenal top-line growth, but it's also reporting huge losses. The company's business model is risky. It's borrowing billions of dollars to buy Nvidia GPUs and build out the infrastructure to provide next-generation AI computing.
That high-interest debt has also led CoreWeave to pay significant interest expense, set to be above $1 billion this year, essentially preventing CoreWeave from turning a profit.
For most stocks, to determine an appropriate valuation, you just look at the numbers. However, CoreWeave is in a class of its own. Given its growth rate, in which revenue is still tripling, the upside potential for the stock is tremendous, and conventional cloud computing businesses like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure have shown how profitable cloud computing can be at scale.
Rather than parsing the numbers for CoreWeave to determine whether the stock is overvalued, investors are better off considering the future of the AI boom. If the massive capex buildout continues, including on CoreWeave's infrastructure, the stock is a good bet to be a winner. At a market cap of $66 billion, the stock still has room to move higher.
However, if the AI boom turns into a bubble and spending suddenly slows, CoreWeave is likely to plunge. While it's locked in multi-billion-dollar deals with the likes of Meta, the company will need more of those to turn profitable and justify its current valuation.
Either way, expect the volatility in the stock to continue."

Ford CEO Jim Farley gathered a host of experts this week to discuss what he calls “the essential economy,” the blue-collar backbone that he sees mired in crisis. AT&T CEO John Stankey and FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam talked about how AI is impacting manufacturing and how they’re hustling to stay ahead of the curve; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a sober warning about how China could “dominate” if we’re not careful with our auto industry; and even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon appeared via video to urge America not to become a “nation of compliance and box-checking.”
But during the keynote discussion with Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Mike Rowe of the Mike Rowe Works Foundation, Farley revealed how his own family is being impacted. “My son worked as a mechanic this summer,” Farley said while moderating.
Then, Farley added, his son said something that stunned both of his parents: “Dad, I really like this work. I don’t know why I need to go to college.” Farley said he and his wife looked at each other and wondered, “Should we be debating this?” It’s something that’s happening in a lot of American households, he noted. “It should be a debate.”
Math isn’t mathing
Rowe, a longtime vocational advocate, seized on data showing that while two skilled tradespeople enter the workforce, five retire each year. The imbalance, he explained, is “the math that’s catching up to us” as the baby boomer generation ages and birth rates fall.
Rowe cited data from his own life. His own degree cost $12,200 in 1984, he said, whereas today it would cost something like $97,000.
“Nothing in the history of Western civilization has gotten more expensive, more quickly,” Rowe said. “Not energy, not food, not real estate, not even health care, [nothing has been inflated more] than the cost of a four-year degree.”
The Associated Press reported that, yes, many colleges were charging roughly $95,000 per year as of April 2024, but the financial aid system lowers that in practice. Still, it’s by and large true that inflation for college tuition, health care, and housing costs has far outpaced that for, say, televisions, toys, and software, showing Rowe is making a solid point. With costs this high, the value proposition of college is under serious scrutiny.
Fortune has reported on several Gen Z entrepreneurs who dove straight into the trades instead of going to college. One, at 23, was already his own boss and making more than $100,000 per year, and the other, 19, was working his way up to it. Both of them had side hustles as social-media influencers, adding another revenue stream. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Arizona, said she often gives options to students that are different from a traditional four-year degree."

Key Notes
- NVIDIA's stock breakthrough above $190 catalyzed synchronized gains across all top ten crypto AI tokens on Thursday.

- Capital rotation from US treasuries into equities drove $2.6 billion sector expansion as investors hedged political shutdown risks.
The aggregate crypto AI sector reached $32 billion in market capitalization on Thursday, driven by NVIDIA’s rally to fresh all-time highs above $190 per share. As the chipmaker’s valuation approaches $4.6 trillion, it continues to cement its position as the dominant force shaping the global AI landscape.
The broader crypto market also received a boost as investors sought alternatives to hedge political risk triggered by the US government shutdown. Capital rotation out of US treasuries into blue-chip stocks provided additional momentum for risk assets during the session.
ADP private payroll data released earlier in the week also eased bearish concerns. According to CME Group’s Fedwatch tool, markets now price in a 97.8% likelihood of an interest rate cut in the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) slated for October 29.
NVIDIA Rally Propels Crypto AI Sector Valuation Above $32B
NVIDIA’s record-breaking stock rally has fueled widespread positive sentiment across crypto projects with artificial intelligence exposure. Coingecko data shows aggregate crypto AI market capitalization crossed the $32 billion threshold on Thursday, climbing 8.8% in the last 24 hours.
Notably, gains were evenly distributed, with all top ten crypto AI tokens trading in the green at press time. This synchronized rally signals the $2.6 billion sector growth was driven by sector-wide catalysts linked to NVIDIA’s all-time high rally.
Among standout movers, Virtual Protocol VIRTUAL $0.81 24h volatility: 1.5% Market cap: $530.08 M Vol. 24h: $47.08 M price advanced 7.2% in intraday trade, while Render RENDER $2.71 24h volatility: 4.7% Market cap: $1.41 B Vol. 24h: $73.23 M added 4% and Artificial Intelligence Alliance FET $0.29 24h volatility: 8.8% Market cap: $764.28 M Vol. 24h: $164.85 M climbed 3%.
As NVIDIA stock edges closer to its $5 trillion market cap target, speculative bets on Fed rate cut expectations could see the Crypto AI sector maintain an upward trajectory in the near-term.

Meanwhile, investors kept an eye on developments in Washington, weighing the chances of a lengthy US government shutdown.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%. All three major averages posted new records.
Stocks rose one day after the S&P 500 closed above 6,700 for the first time. A wave of good news from the AI sector lifted chip stocks worldwide, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising to a record high. AMD (AMD) and SK Hynix (000660.KS, HXSCL) also gained.
OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) valuation soared to $500 billion after an employee share sale, boosting tech rally hopes despite fears of an AI bubble. The ChatGPT maker ousted Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup in the world.
Markets have so far been unperturbed by the US government shutdown, which looks set to drag on at least until the end of the week. President Trump is amping up his rhetoric against Democrats, threatening to fire ""thousands"" of federal workers and canceling billions of dollars in federal funding to blue states.
Trump said he is meeting on Thursday with OMB Director Russ Vought, who has been leading White House strategy in the shutdown, to discuss which ""Democrat Agencies"" should be cut.
In any case, Friday's scheduled release of the September jobs report is all but certain to be delayed. That has Wall Street looking elsewhere during the federal data blackout, as Fed policymakers have indicated cracks in the labor market will loom large in their October rate decision.
Private data from the firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found hiring plans at their lowest level since 2009, even as layoffs fell. The report provided more evidence of the softening ""low hire, low fire"" labor market after Wednesday's ADP report. Investors remain near-unanimous on bets for a cut at the Fed's next meeting.
Elsewhere in corporates, Tesla (TSLA) shares took a hit despite a record sales quarter as investors turned focus to future performance without the federal EV tax credit.

OpenAI valuation spurs stock rally in Nvidia, AI chipmakers
Excitement over OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) $500 billion valuation sparked a rally in AI stocks on Thursday, after the company surpassed Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) as the most valuable startup.
Shares of AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and AMD (AMD) gained about 1.5%, 2%, and 3%, respectively, in early trading.
Nvidia stock hit an intraday all-time high of $190 on Thursday morning, as optimism around AI chip demand eased investors' concerns about Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI.
It's been a news-filled week for OpenAI, which released its new video generation AI model, Sora, and announced a partnership with Samsung (005930.KS) and SK Hynix (000660.KS) to increase the supply of advanced memory chips. Current and former OpenAI employees also sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors, which is what boosted the ChatGPT maker's valuation to an estimated $500 billion.

Bessent on the government shutdown: 'We could see a hit to the GDP'
As the federal government enters day two of a shutdown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the gridlock could slow US economic growth.
“This isn’t the way to have a discussion, shutting down the government and lowering the GDP,” Bessent told CNBC's “Squawk Box.” “We could see a hit to the GDP, a hit to growth, and a hit to working America.”
The US's gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 3.8% in the third quarter, growing for the second straight quarter after growth contracted in the first quarter.
On Wednesday, US senators failed to advance a plan to fund the government after another round of votes. But as Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul notes, the White House also appears poised to use the shutdown as an opportunity to expand Trump's powers to potentially fire government workers or cut programs.
""A lot of good can come down from shutdowns,"" Trump said ahead of the stoppage. ""We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want, and they'd be Democrat things.""

FICO stock soars after the data company begins offering scores directly to lenders
Fair Isaac (FICO), a data analytics company that provides measures of consumer risk, said on Thursday that it would begin selling FICO scores directly to mortgage lenders, circumventing the three major credit bureaus.
FICO stock soared nearly 19% in premarket trading on Thursday, while shares of credit bureaus TransUnion (TRU) and Equifax (EFX) fell 12% each. Experian (EXPN.L) stock, which trades on the London exchange, also dropped 5%.
FICO will sell scores to lenders for a royalty fee of $4.95 per score, undercutting the fees from resellers by 50% on average, the company said. FICO-score mortgage loans that close will also incur a fee of $33.
The move comes as the company faces competition from its lone rival, VantageScore Solutions. In July, government-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dealt a blow to FICO by giving lenders a green light to use VantageScore to buy a home.
Since July 8, excluding today's premarket move, FICO shares have declined by around 20%. If today's upswing holds, the stock will have regained nearly all its losses since then.

Interesting AM analyst calls
It's almost earnings season!
And that means the start of interesting pre-earnings notes from the Street.
A few that caught my attention pre-5am:
Chipotle: Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo leaves an Outperform rating on Chipotle (CMG). But he all but hints the stock could get hit again on third quarter earnings. ""With persisting macro pressures and a weakening labor market, we expect Chipotle’s same-store sales to miss 3Q25 expectations. Rather than by ‘Mexican food fatigue’, ‘excessive pricing’ or ‘rising competition’, we continue to believe that the relative demand weakness is driven by consumer confidence declining, greater exposure to more impacted demographics, and partially by the increased promotional environment that is compressing consumers’ willingness to pay $10+ for their lunch. We are also conscious that rising beef prices may impact restaurant level margins given Chipotle’s commitment not to take price near term,"" says Gargiulo. My recent Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright for my insight into the company at this juncture.
PepsiCo: No rest for the weary at PepsiCo (PEP) as it contends with new activist investor Elliott Management and a largely bearish Wall Street. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi is keeping a Sector-Perform rating PepsiCo, but similar to Gargiulo on Chipotle sound quite bearish on PepsiCo into earnings. ""We are expecting another difficult quarter for PepsiCo headlined by continued sluggish top line results in North America as snacking volumes continue to be a challenge, with muted PBNA [North America beverages] trends and pockets of international softness (Coca-Cola (KO) was talking down international beverage volumes in early September),"" Modi said.
Alibaba: Alibaba (BABA) is seeing interest today on the Yahoo Finance platform amid estimate raises from JP Morgan analyst Alex Yao. The stock is up 36% in the past month, and 117% on the year. Explains Yao: ""Alibaba’s share price has outperformed the sector average, as measured by KWEB, by 364 percentage points in the past three months, due to better-than-expected cloud revenue growth rate in 2Q25 and management’s confident articulation of its investment strategy in food delivery and quick commerce, in our view. After attending Alibaba's Apsara conference last week in Hangzhou, we are incrementally more positive on AliCloud for its future revenue generation opportunity with external clients (i.e. cloud revenue) and synergy with domestic ecommerce. We believe the positive development in both cloud and China domestic ecommerce warrants a higher valuation multiple as the narrative of Alibaba shifts towards ‘a tier-one asset in China Internet’ from ‘a domestic ecommerce market share loser.""

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the technology sector climbed as an OpenAI share sale catapulted the firm to the world's most valuable startup, bolstering optimism for artificial intelligence.
The Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 benchmarks both reached new records, powered by gains in tech giants and AI-related companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Broadcom. Investors are increasingly viewing AI as a significant long-term growth driver, a sentiment strong enough to overshadow concerns from a U.S. government shutdown. This continued enthusiasm highlights the market's strong belief in the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, which is propelling major indices to unprecedented heights.

Zooming In On Teladoc (TDOC)
Teladoc’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 5.5% on the news that a steeper-than-anticipated drop in U.S. consumer confidence raised alarms about future consumer spending.
The Conference Board reported its consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in September, its lowest reading since April. The decline was attributed to growing pessimism among Americans regarding inflation and a weakening job market. This data is particularly concerning for companies reliant on discretionary spending, such as those in online retail, travel, and the gig economy, as reports suggest a bleak consumer outlook could curb spending on non-essential items and services. The survey's Expectations Index, a measure of short-term outlook, has remained below a key threshold that often signals a future recession, adding to investor concerns about the economic landscape."

Zooming In On Lyft (LYFT)
Lyft’s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 4.6% on the news that Mizuho initiated coverage on the company with a Neutral rating and a $24 price target.
A ""Neutral"" rating often suggested that an analyst believed the stock was fairly valued with limited potential for significant gains. This lack of a strong ""buy"" signal from a new analyst covering the stock appeared to weigh on investor sentiment. Adding to this view, MoffettNathanson LLC also maintained its own neutral recommendation on Lyft's shares. While MoffettNathanson did raise its price target to $20 from $16, the prevailing neutral stance from the analysts seemed to have prompted the sell-off.
Lyft is up 65.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $22.60 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $22.93 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Lyft’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $817.77.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Alright, time now for some of today's trending tickers. Bullseye's Adam Johnson back at the desk to talk through a couple names catching your eye. Adam, let's start with DraftKings. What you're seeing there, a story for you on a name that's down about 25% in the last month.
Back up the truck is is the uh punch line. And I don't I don't mean to be um flippant by saying that. I think it's absurd that this stock has fallen as much as it has over the past several weeks. What did what did you just say down 25% in yeah, two or three weeks. Uh crazy and I say crazy because uh it at this point is trading at 19 times earnings. That's cheaper than the S&P 500 and yet earnings growth 75%. So it's trading cheaper than the S&P and yet growing about five or six times as fast. Um there's no reason for this stock to be down especially since they just earlier this week signed the new deal with NBC Universal. Uh you're going to see DraftKings co-branded with NBC sports on every single one of their platforms. and that's not just this season, it's the next several years. I think it's going to um cement DraftKings as the um easiest and most recognized betting platform. I think it's going to be very strong for the business, which again is already growing 19%.
Do you feel like there's any concern from the street when you look at that move that they're not being aggressive enough in the prediction market space. and I particularly think about that announcement from Robin Hood maybe three or three weeks ago, maybe a month ago at this point, around them offering sports-based prediction markets within the Robin Hood app. all this legal gray area, regulatory gray area. Uh like does that feel like needs to be more of a product imperative for?
Well, in other words, go to Robin Hood and it's a one-stop shop. You can buy crypto, you can buy stocks, you can buy bonds, and you can make bets. Uh I think that's the pitch and I think that's in part what is um uh weighing on DraftKings right now. But uh I'm a big believer in best-in-breed companies. To me, DraftKings is best in breed. This is what they do. Um in the same way salesforce.com is customer relationship management. Nvidia is chips. Uh on and on. I um I want to own best in breed company, cyber security, Palo Alto Networks. On and on, right? Best in breed. That's what you want to own.
Yeah. Uh we talk a lot about the idea of when does a company become a verb. And you know, I think we could have a discussion on whether the DraftKings is the verb of the the uh you know, betting in your in your pocket kind of trade. Um let's move to another hot part of the market and that's the AI trade. Couple of names in here that you like. I want to start with Core Weave, which continues to be uh a name that drives a ton of interest on our platform. Huge IPO this year. And I think for a lot of folks, it feels like it's like the the first name in the second tier of AI names that people think of.
Yeah, um and quickly becoming a first tier, uh not only uh name but operator. The company IPO a few months ago at 40 bucks, ran all the way to 190, backed down to um about 70, at which point I to look took a look at it and I thought, you know what? This actually makes sense at this point at 70 or 80. And now it's you know, 130, 140, etc. CoreWeave is a really fascinating, inventive, exciting company that fits my paradigm of American ingenuity, the people, companies, and technologies driving the world forward. This is a company that effectively uh will rent you AI capability as a platform uh that's off in the cloud. And so, um if you want to start a business and you need AI to run your business, you can go to Core Weave and they will make a a particular structure for you. Is it six months, two years, five years? Do you want to be able to grow and scale with it? Uh do you just need to do intermittent analysis? How integral is AI to your business? They answer all those questions for you and create a custom platform for you and then you pay on a quarterly basis for it. So, uh you know, in the same way that we lease cars, we rent apartments, you can rent the runway, you know, and go rent a dress for a party. Well, now you can rent AI. I think it's brilliant.
Rent your compute. Um another name that has an agreement with Core Weave is applied Digital. In that space, and I think applied, uh Celestica, these names that are within this infrastructure piece of the AI trade. Um and these have been excellent stocks over the last year.
Yeah, and I'm happy to say I own them all. Uh I don't get everything right, but I do happen to own all these that we're talking about and they've been very profitable and will continue to be very profitable, I believe. uh because I think they're going a lot higher. Um applied is a partner of Core Weave. So applied builds and operates data centers. and then Core Weave rents space from applied effectively or in some cases partners with applied so that they share the revenue upside. Uh that needs no explanation, right? Data center, you build them, uh you expand them, you rent them out. Uh very hot space and this is again is a is a reasonably um inexpensive stock. It has almost tripled in the past six weeks and that may um scare some people, but they are effectively going to quadruple capacity over the next two years. That's why it's going up so much. And so I'm very comfortable owning applied. Um the company is in part owned by Nvidia. Imagine that, right? So you see there's this whole cabal, right? You know, you build the data centers, you partner with the guys who are running the AI that's powered by um Nvidia, uh Sterling infrastructure, not a name on your list, but I'll just mention they build data centers. They're they're the actual engineers who come in and you know, break ground and build them. So it's it's it's a whole ecosystem.
Does this concern you at all, this this circular financing, whatever you want to call it of Nvidia's invested in this company, they've partnered, they're they're, you know, what is it? Open AI is going to buy Nvidia chips, rent them back to Nvidia or you know, whatever the agreement is. It it is a very, it's a cabal, I guess as you said.
It is a cabal, uh and yet it's a brilliant cabal because it's so desperately needed uh by everyone. I mean, every you know, if you remember, there was a point at which every company became an e-commerce company. And then every company became a cloud company, and then every company became a data analysis company. Well, now every company is an AI company. And this cabal of companies that we're talking about is perfectly positioned to serve that growing need and what's so important about this is that they're making money.
Yeah.
Right? You know, unlike back in 2000 when you know, pets.com, oh anything with a.com, miles.com, let's buy it. Adam.com. Oh gosh, we got to own it. Uh no, actually you don't because um those companies weren't making money. Um and the ones that were were trading at crazy valuations. Remember when John Chambers from Cisco said our stock is trading at 70 times sales, not even earnings. We'd have to sell stuff for 70 years just to, you know, get to the market cap. And that was sort of everyone's aha moment.
Scott Scott Scott McNealy had the same kind of commentary. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. Uh yeah, right. We're nowhere near that. Um these are companies that make money and they're growing. I mean, I would argue that Nvidia, you know, the granddaddy of them all is cheap. trading um um it was at one point trading under 30 times earnings with 50 to 75% growth.
Yep. Yep. Right.
So these are moneymaking companies and they're cheap.
All right, great conversation. We'll leave it there. Adam Johnson, always appreciate the time.
Thank you, sir."

Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.
The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday.
The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015.
But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas.
“Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.”
He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that ""over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.”
Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos.
OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang.
OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose."

Oct 2 - Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) is in preliminary discussions with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) about becoming a customer of its chip-manufacturing unit, according to a Wednesday report from Semafor.
The report said it remains unclear what type of products Intel might produce for AMD, as the company's foundry has not yet developed the capacity to manufacture AMD's most advanced processors. At present, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) is responsible for most of AMD's chip output.
Talks with AMD come as Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan seeks new partnerships with major technology firms, financial groups, and policymakers to support the turnaround of the U.S. semiconductor company. Intel has also recently reached agreements with Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) to co-develop PC and data center chips, with Nvidia taking a $5 billion stake in Intel.
Other developments include Japan's SoftBank Group completing a $2 billion investment, while the Trump administration earlier acquired a 9.9% holding valued at $8. billion. Intel has also approached Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other firms about potential equity positions.

Micron (NASDAQ:MU) rose 1%, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 3%, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) added 1%, SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) jumped 4.6%, Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) increased 2%, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) climbed 3%, and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) surged 4%.
The sector-wide rally came after OpenAI’s Sam Altman signed letters of intent with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to enlist them in his data center construction effort. According to the companies, OpenAI could need as many as 900,000 wafers per month as the Stargate project expands.
This projected demand is more than double the current global capacity for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), highlighting the massive scale of the Stargate initiative and accelerating global AI development.
However, some analysts expressed skepticism about the demand projections. KC Rajkumar of LYNX Equity Strategies said, ""We would love nothing more than our favorite names such as MU, LRCX and SNDK climb higher, but for the right reasons. The 900K estimate coming from the two memory suppliers looks like a typo to us. Even if a zero were to be removed, a 90k wpm projection still would look dubious.""
The OpenAI-led initiative is part of a global push to build data centers for next-generation AI tools, an effort expected to cost trillions of dollars and require substantial amounts of chips, servers, cooling systems, and electricity.

Telegram users will soon gain access to tokenized US equities through a new partnership between Wallet in Telegram, crypto exchange Kraken, and xStocks operator Backed.
Key Takeaways:
- Telegram Wallet will launch tokenized U.S. stocks through a partnership with Kraken and Backed.
- The rollout starts in October with 35 assets and will prioritize emerging markets.
- Support will expand to TON Wallet by late 2025, marking a broader push into tokenized finance.
The collaboration will bring over 60 tokenized versions of publicly traded companies, including MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Nvidia (NVDA), to Telegram’s third-party wallet platform.
Announced Wednesday, the rollout will begin in select markets, with a focus on testing user experience and regulatory compliance.
Telegram Wallet to Launch “Stocks and ETFs” Section in October
Wallet in Telegram said it plans to introduce the service under a new “Stocks and ETFs” section starting in October.
The initial launch will feature 35 tokenized assets, including tokenized versions of Coinbase (COINX), Circle (CRCLX), Robinhood (HOODX), and TON Strategy (TONx).
While the offering avoids Bitcoin ETFs, it represents a broader push to bring real-world financial products to blockchain-powered platforms.
Backed, which specializes in tokenization for emerging economies, is leading the infrastructure behind xStocks.
As such, Wallet in Telegram’s stock integration will prioritize emerging markets in the first phase of the rollout. The platform did not confirm which countries will be eligible at launch.
While similar integrations from firms like Alchemy Pay have restricted U.S. users and sanctioned regions, they have provided access to over 170 countries globally.
It remains unclear whether this new partnership will adopt a similar model.
In addition to the custodial rollout, Wallet in Telegram plans to expand tokenized stock support to TON Wallet, its self-custodial solution, by the fourth quarter of 2025.
The move comes just days after Telegram founder Pavel Durov revealed in a podcast with Lex Fridman that he was an early Bitcoin buyer. Durov shared that his 2013 BTC investment has become a key source of personal income.
“I was a big believer in Bitcoin since more or less the start of it,” he said.
Wallet in Telegram Launches in the US
In July, Wallet in Telegram announced the launch of its self-custodial TON Wallet for tens of millions of Telegram users in the US, not as a bot or add-on, but as fully and natively embedded into the app.
Users can now send and receive Toncoin (TON), USDT, and NFTs directly within chats, with full control over their private keys. No separate app, browser extension, or seed phrase is required.
Through integrations with MoonPay and TON Connect, users can buy crypto using Apple Pay, Google Pay, and credit cards without fees, and withdraw funds to bank cards.
The wallet also supports in-app crypto trading, access to third-party DeFi protocols, and simplified signing for TON-based dapps, positioning Telegram as a key gateway to Web3 and the top cryptocurrencies of the moment.
Wallet in Telegram is a digital asset solution within Telegram’s interface. The Open Platform powers it. This is a technology company that builds Web3 infrastructure and apps within the Telegram ecosystem, leveraging the TON (The Open Network) chain.

AI initially fueled dizzying rallies in chipmakers and software firms. Then, as the power demands became clear, a boom in shares of utilities and builders of data centers. Now, investors are moving further afield in search of beneficiaries from the hundreds of billions of dollars flowing into the build-out of the AI economy.
“You just saw a market that was thirsty for non-Magnificent Seven winners regarding, effectively, the information economy or the digital economy,” said Brian Sponheimer, a portfolio manager at Gamco Investors Inc.’s Gabelli.
Shares of Caterpillar surged 14% in September, the best month since December 2023. The rally brought the stock’s year-to-date gain to 32%, far outstripping the 17% gain in the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index and the 19% advance in the cohort of the seven top US tech giants.
The stock advanced another 0.8% on Wednesday, with investors seemingly unperturbed after news that Dutch pension fund ABP had sold a €387 million ($455 million) stake in the company amid backlash over links to Israel’s war in Gaza.
The surge wasn’t entirely predicated on Caterpillar’s turbines business. The shares had slumped after the company warned at the end of August that it expects tariffs to cost it as much as $1.8 billion this year, crimping profit margins. But the manufacturer has a record backlog of nearly $40 billion as of the end of June, softening the blow from higher costs for steel and aluminum. It also stands to pay lower taxes thanks to Congress’s spending bill. The Federal Reserve’s first rate cut this year helped, as well.
The September rally, though, gained momentum after Oracle Corp. delivered a unexpectedly robust forecast for its cloud computing business — a unit that will require massive amounts of electricity and processing power. To meet that kind of demand from the tech sector, investors are betting, Caterpillar’s turbines will be needed. The company’s shares jumped in eight of the nine trading sessions after Oracle’s forecast."

SINGAPORE, Oct. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The9 Limited (Nasdaq: NCTY) today announced that its Singapore investee company Nanyang Biologics Pte. Ltd. (""NYB""), together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, entered into a business combination agreement with RF Acquisition Corp II (""RFAI"") (NASDAQ: RFAI), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, in a transaction that will result in NYB becoming a publicly listed company (the ""Proposed Transaction""). Following the closing, the combined company (the ""Combined Company"") is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the reserved ticker symbol ""NYB"".
The Proposed Transaction gives NYB approximately $1.5 billion in pre-transaction equity value. NYB's existing shareholders, including The9, will roll over 100% of the equity and retain a majority of the Combined Company's outstanding shares, while NYB will also designate a majority of the Combined Company's board of directors. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of NYB and RFAI, and its closing is expected to be in the first or second quarter of 2026, subject to shareholders' approval and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Additional information about the Proposed Transaction, including a copy of the business combination agreement and investor presentation, will be provided in one or more Current Reports on Form 8-K to be filed by RFAI with the SEC.
Following the Proposed Transaction, NYB aims to accelerate the discovery of more effective drug molecules and identify active ingredients from natural sources for use in both pharmaceuticals and traditional medicine by utilizing its AI platform accelerating therapeutic discoveries.
In June 2025, NYB was crowned the 1st Prize Winner among over 700 regional startups in the SuperAI Genesis Startup Competition 2025, held at SuperAI Singapore, Asia's largest AI event. among over 700 regional startups
In August 2025, NYB entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Nvidia, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Equinix focusing on building the largest natural compound library in the world, developing scalable AI platforms for drug discovery, and creating secure, enterprise-grade infrastructure for healthcare innovation. AI-driven drug discovery requires large-scale molecular screening and cloud-based collaboration. Sovereign digital infrastructure, meaning that data is strictly protected and complies with national and regional regulatory requirements, is particularly important for drug development, as it involves a large number of highly sensitive scientific research information, such as biopharmaceutical data and molecular screening models."

Two of South Korea’s biggest technology firms saw their shares jump in Seoul trading on Thursday after OpenAI announced it would enlist the country’s tech memory champions to supply its colossal 'Stargate' data-centre project.
Shares of SK Hynix surged around 10% and Samsung Electronics climbed over 3% after news broke that both Korean giants had secured a role in supplying high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for the Stargate supercomputer project.
Samsung Electronics is the world’s largest producer of memory chips, dominating both DRAM — the main working memory in computers and data servers — and NAND flash, which powers storage in everything from smartphones to data centres.
Its smaller rival SK Hynix ranks second in global DRAM output and has carved out a lead in high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the ultra-fast chips that underpin Nvidia’s AI processors.
Together, the two South Korean giants command more than half of the world’s memory market, giving them an outsized influence over pricing, capacity and the technological direction of an industry that sits at the heart of the digital economy.
The initiative, valued at as much as $500 billion (€425.3bn), is expected to fuel an unprecedented wave of capital spending across the artificial intelligence supply chain.

High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is crucial for AI because it allows chips like Nvidia’s to move massive amounts of data at ultra-fast speeds, needed for its ever-developing computing needs, enabling the training and deployment of large-scale models that standard memory processing cannot handle.
The Stargate project plans to set up a vast network of AI supercomputers across several continents and is expected to require hundreds of thousands of HBM wafers or stacks every month, according to industry estimates.
At those volumes, it would mark a massive change in global semiconductor capacity, reinforcing SK Hynix’s role as the leading supplier of HBM3 chips and bolstering Samsung’s efforts to expand in the next generation of HBM4.
A new AI hub in Asia
The plan also carries crucial strategic implications for South Korea itself, with Seoul long having sought to position itself as a regional technology hub beyond hardware manufacturing.
By hosting one of the largest AI infrastructure projects ever conceived, OpenAI and its US backers are reinforcing ties with a close ally but also diversifying away from China-sensitive ties in the AI technology chain.
Washington has been pushing to secure critical facilities in friendly countries, and Korea’s export-driven memory chip sector offers both scale and the necessary political alignment."

The strategy is aimed at coping with a shortage of AI data center capacity and letting Microsoft free up its own server farms to provide lucrative AI services to customers.
This is just one of a string of deals Microsoft has struck with so-called neoclouds — a new category of small infrastructure providers that lease out AI-focused computing power. Microsoft has inked more than $33 billion in commitments to such providers, including Nebius, CoreWeave Inc., Nscale and Lambda. The deals demonstrate the company’s growing willingness to use relative newcomers for important infrastructure.
Cloud vendors have generally operated their own data centers, but Microsoft is struggling to bring sufficient computing capacity online. Renting access to servers from neoclouds speeds things up since they have already solved logistical challenges including obtaining sufficient power and chips.
“We are in very much land-grab mode in the AI space,” said Scott Guthrie, who leads Microsoft’s cloud efforts. “We’ve made the decision that we don’t want to be constrained in terms of capacity.”
Nebius shares were up about 5.5% at 10:17 a.m. in New York, while Microsoft was mostly unchanged. Nebius and the other neocloud firms declined to comment.
The advent of power-guzzling generative AI has put enormous strain on data center infrastructure. So Microsoft is freeing up capacity in its own data centers for cloud clients by running some computing for internal and OpenAI work at neocloud facilities, Guthrie said.
For example, the first foundation AI models built under consumer AI chief Mustafa Suleyman were trained at a CoreWeave data center near Portland, Oregon, according to people familiar with the work."

But by no means is that the only case. You can also invest in solid blue chip stocks which make for safe long-term buys, and attain some incredible returns.
Three examples of this are Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Oracle (ORCL 1.45%), and Eli Lilly (LLY 1.75%). If you invested in these companies five years ago, you would be up over 380% (returns as of Oct. 1). And these were large, well-known businesses back then. By simply investing in companies with strong track records for growth and excellent fundamentals, you could have achieved amazing returns.
Here's why these three stocks have done so well.
Nvidia: up 1,290% in 5 years
Nvidia is, unsurprisingly, the top stock on this list. Its incredible rally over the past five years has been due to the enthusiasm for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The company was known for its graphics cards five years ago, and was already a relatively big tech business.
It ended up being well-positioned to benefit from the boom in AI, and today, it makes cutting-edge chips that tech companies rely on. It has become the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $4.57 trillion. And what's most remarkable about that is that it's still not an obscenely overpriced stock. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple (based on analyst estimates of future profitability) of 42.
Normally, when stocks surge to incredible valuations, there's a high degree of risk and speculation involved. However, Nvidia has simply been a growth machine. Over the trailing 12 months, it has generated earnings totaling nearly $87 billion. Just a few years earlier, its full-year earnings weren't even $5 billion. If you have a long-term horizon, Nvidia can still make sense as an investment to hang on to, given its leadership position in the AI chip market.
Oracle: up 381% in 5 years
Another company that benefited from the AI boom, albeit to a much lesser extent than Nvidia, is Oracle. Five years ago, it was already known as a large tech company with reliable databases. Today, those databases still play an important role. But it also provides crucial cloud infrastructure and applications that can assist with AI development, particularly as more of its customers do more of their operations in the cloud.
In September, the company said it would soon be launching an ""Oracle AI Database"" allowing its customers to use the large language model of their choosing. That will be on top of their normal Oracle database, making it easy for customers to analyze their data with the help of AI. It's a great example of how Oracle has adapted to the changing needs of its customers.
Oracle's business has grown at a much steadier pace than Nvidia's over the years, but it's nonetheless still a top AI stock. Earnings over the past 12 months have totaled $12.4 billion, nearly double the level they were at three years ago. Shares trade at a forward P/E of 42. And like Nvidia, this can be a good stock to hang on to if you want exposure to a top AI company.
Eli Lilly: up 462% in 5 years
Drugmaker Eli Lilly may seem out of place on this list, as it isn't a big tech company developing AI-related products. But the stock helps bring home an important point: innovation isn't predictable. Five years ago, Eli Lilly was a top healthcare company, but GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs weren't yet on the radar for healthcare investors as huge growth catalysts to watch out for. And now those products have transformed Lilly's business and enabled it to significantly grow its operations.
Today, the company has two approved GLP-1 drugs, one sold for weight loss (Zepbound) and another for diabetes (Mounjaro). They both contain the same active ingredient, tirzepatide. Lilly is still working on more GLP-1 treatments, including a pill which it hopes to launch sometime next year.
Eli Lilly's bottom line has totaled $13.8 billion over the past four quarters; it has also doubled in a span of a few years, thanks to the massive growth in GLP-1 drugs. Its forward P/E of 24 makes it the cheapest growth stock on this list to consider. And given the lucrative potential for GLP-1 weight loss drugs, that makes it practically a no-brainer buy at this point."

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) made a significant six-figure investment into a U.S. Treasury Bill in mid-September, anchoring a flurry of trading activity that also saw her purchase shares in popular technology stocks and a Bitcoin ETF.
The transactions, made on Sept. 11, were detailed in a financial disclosure report filed with the House of Representatives on Sept. 27, 2025.
Piling On US Treasury Bills Ahead Of Rate Cuts
The congresswoman's largest transaction was a purchase of a U.S. Treasury Bill valued between $100,001 and $250,000.
This move into a safe-haven asset marks a strategic shift from a disclosure covering her trades in August, which showed she had sold a Treasury Bill valued between $15,001 and $50,000.

INTC is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Christopher Danely, Citi semiconductor analyst, explained in a recent program on CNBC why he downgraded Intel to sell. The analyst said Nvidia’s $5 billion investment in Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is “no big deal” and is not enough to “move the needle” for the stock. Here is how the analyst explained his reason:
“Obviously, there’s a lot of political pressure going on with various parts of the market right now. I think that has to be somewhat of a factor, but as far as Nvidia goes, it’s no skin off their back. So, they gave Intel $5 billion. They’re down to their last $67 billion in cash. I don’t think that’s a big deal. They already have some products called Grace that offer an ARM core. So now they’re offering an Intel core with that and then they’re going to loan their graphics capabilities out to Intel to let Intel integrate the graphics in their own laptop chip. So for us, the $5 billion is no big deal. Intel is still behind AMD in terms of processors and if you have a better graphics chip it doesn’t necessarily help the actual core processor. Then on the AI product offering, that might end up being 500 million, a billion, maybe two billion at best to Intel, but that’s years out. Intel’s a $53 billion company, so again not enough to move the needle, and more importantly we think this continues to keep Intel in this perpetually money-losing foundry business, which we think they should get out of. If they did get out of that, i.e., making chips for other companies, we think that unlocks a dollar to $2 in earnings power and we’re loving that. But this sounds like this is just going to keep them in this perpetual cycle of trying to make chips for other companies.”
Last month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel to co-develop data center and PC chips. Nvidia and Intel will partner to make artificial intelligence systems for data centers that combine Intel’s x86-based central processors with Nvidia’s GPUs.

“We also added several new positions, including two in Information Technology: Workday, a category leader for enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources, and KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC), a leader in semiconductor process control. KLA, a leader in semiconductor process control, benefits from inherently high switching costs, structurally higher demand for advanced semiconductors and increasingly complex semiconductor manufacturing.

The AI hyperscalers, including Amazon, Meta, and others, are projected to spend roughly $400 billion in capex in 2025 alone. Global data center infrastructure spending is expected to reach $7 trillion by 2030.
There is no end in sight to the wave of AI spending that extends to energy and grid infrastructure because generative AI platforms like ChatGPT use 10X the energy of an average Google search.
The two AI-related stocks we dive into today are not the tech stocks most associated with AI, such as Nvidia. Nonetheless, Constellation Energy and Arista Networks benefit directly from the AI megatrend that’s poised to dominate Wall Street in the back-half of the decade and beyond.

Let’s dive into why investors should buy CEG and ANET now before possible breakouts in October and the fourth quarter. Both AI-boosted stocks are also long-term buy-and-hold candidates.
Nuclear Energy Stock Constellation is a Must-Buy AI Winner
Constellation Energy CEG is at the forefront of the growing relationship between big tech and nuclear energy. CEG earned 20-year power purchase agreements with Microsoft and Meta META over the last year to support their AI expansion efforts.
The largest U.S. nuclear power plant operator is ready to transform into one of the energy industry titans of the AI age through Constellation’s $27 billion deal to buy natural gas and geothermal powerhouse Calpine.
CEG’s acquisition, which is expected to close in Q4, creates the largest clean energy firm and expands Constellation’s footprint into power-hungry, tech-heavy Texas and California.
Constellation stock is poised to be one of the most surefire long-term winners in the AI-driven energy age as the U.S. government aims to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050 and AI hyperscalers go all-in on nuclear and natural gas.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks that caught analysts' attention.
Tom Hancock, GMO portfolio manager, recently talked about Nvidia’s $100 billion deal with OpenAI during an interview on CNBC. He believes the company is “losing” on the deal.
“I think vendor financing has a pretty spotty history, frankly. It’s been a feature of past bubbles that we’ve seen. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is basically giving hundreds of millions here. Roughly 35 million will go back into NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revenue down the road. It’ll look like revenue for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), but it’s not real cash they’re getting—they’re losing on the deal. Nvidia has also underwritten some of Coreweave’s investment. This is not to say it’s a bubble or anything fraudulent, but it demonstrates how much capital intensity there is in building out AI infrastructure at a time when monetization outside some in-house applications at companies like Meta or Alphabet is very unclear, given the scale of investment required.”

Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Shares of core holding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged during the quarter, after the company reported strong quarterly results driven by very strong demand for the company’s next-generation Blackwell architecture. The new Blackwell chips deliver compelling performance improvements, with up to 30x faster inference capabilities as compared with prior generations and, importantly, are much more energy efficient. The company also proved resilient against a backdrop of increasing geopolitical tension, as sovereign deals announced in parts of the world such as the Middle East and Taiwan helped to offset headwinds that resulted from U.S. export restrictions on China sales.”"

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
In January, Jim Cramer said during a program on CNBC that he wanted to own Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares because of the company’s AI capabilities. Cramer said at the time that Meta was using AI to improve its ads business. The stock was trading at around $645 as of Cramer’s comments. As of September 22, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stock price stands at $778, having gained about 30% so far this year.
“I’ve got to tell you, you want to own this stock. New AI capabilities, capex, return on investment really terrific, and first time I’ve finally seen look potential for spend shift from TikTok disruption. I think they are going to be the big winner if it’s shut down or if the president owns it with another entity. They are using AI to be able to develop fabulous ad packages, and I think that if you want to build your business right now, Instagram has never been better. Individuals who want to live their dream, go to Instagram, start it, start your business, you’ll do well.”
Photo by Mohamed Hadji on Unsplash Can Meta Shares Rise on the Back of AI Spending? With daily active users of about 3.48 billion, Meta’s huge edge in the AI race is the data and user base it has access to, which is extremely useful for ads targeting and monetization. In 2024, digital advertising accounted for about 98% of the company’s total revenue. The business is thriving for now. In the June quarter, price per ad rose 9% year over year, reflecting higher returns for advertisers and a favorable supply and demand balance for Meta. However, an overall slowdown in digital advertising and huge spending from the company could limit the stock’s upside. Between 2014 and 2019, digital advertising rose about 20% annually, but growth is now expected to slow to 9% per year from 2025 through 2030. Meta is expected to spend about $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025 on capital expenditures to expand its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Unlike hardware chip makers like Nvidia, companies like Meta would need to show actual results from their AI spending to unlock more shareholder value in the short term.
First Eagle Global Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)—the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among other social-media platforms—reported strong revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, driven by increases in both ad impressions and price per ad. The company continued to aggressively invest and hire in AI, even as it develops its core advertising businesses. We believe these results demonstrate Meta’s ability to focus on both profitability and efficiency in conjunction with ongoing investments in the core ad business, the metaverse and other AI applications.”"

Shares of pharmaceutical company AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) jumped 5.2% in the afternoon session after the company submitted a biologics license application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its drug candidate pivekimab sunirine. The company is developing the molecule as a potential treatment for blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), a rare and highly aggressive blood cancer, as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Investor optimism was further bolstered by AbbVie's announcement of a $70 million expansion of its Bioresearch Center in Massachusetts to increase its U.S. biologics manufacturing and R&D capabilities. This move is part of a larger investment to strengthen domestic operations, potentially shielding the company from pharmaceutical tariffs. The positive news, which followed the stock reaching an all-time high on the previous day, appeared to outweigh a downgrade from HSBC to 'Hold' from 'Buy'.
The shares closed the day at $244.38, up 5.6% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
AbbVie’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 3.9% on the news that reports revealed a potential drug-pricing agreement between the White House and the pharmaceutical industry. The Trump administration is advancing its “Most Favored Nation” initiative, which aims to lower prescription drug costs for Americans. This policy would tie the prices of medications in the U.S. to the lowest costs paid by other wealthy nations. As part of this push, Pfizer has reportedly entered into an agreement to voluntarily sell its medications through Medicaid at these reduced prices. The move comes as the administration intensifies pressure on drugmakers to make prices more affordable. While pricing controls can often be a headwind, the market's positive reaction suggests that investors may see this voluntary agreement as a way to resolve regulatory uncertainty, providing a clearer path forward for the industry.
AbbVie is up 36.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $244.50 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AbbVie’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,806.

Jason Ware, Albion Financial Group CIO, was recently asked on CNBC whether he is worried about the fact that 56% of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) accounts receivables are accounted for by three companies. Here is what the analyst said:
“Yeah, we’re not worried at all because these are the companies with the most financial firepower and they continue to spend and that’s what they tell us every quarter. They’re hyperscalers. They’re saying we’re spending a ton of money. And to just put that into context, you know, Christina mentioned that, you know, Crest the CFO of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) on the call mentioned that three to four trillion.

Macquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) performed strongly in the quarter on renewed AI optimism and reduced concern that an individual customer or two will moderate capital expenditures. Though the Fund’s weight was among our largest positions at over 4.5% during the quarter, the relative underweight (the benchmark weight averaged 6.3%) negatively affected relative returns.”

AMD shares are also trading over 1% higher on the news.
Intel has recently secured investment and public support from several major players, including the White House, Nvidia, and SoftBank. The company is also reumored to be in discussions with Apple.
AMD’s current chips are primarily manufactured by Taiwan’s TSMC. According to the Semafor, one challenge of any potential deal is that Intel currently lacks the technology to produce AMD’s most advanced and profitable chips.
The scope of any manufacturing shift to Intel remains unclear, as does whether AMD would make a direct investment similar to deals made by other companies. No agreement is certain at this point in negotiations, the report added.
Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry thinks a potential deal between the two makes sense. The analyst said Intel’s 18A backside power delivery could attract AMD to sign up as a foundry customer.

finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-01T18:04:00,AI Stocks: Bubble or Boom Ahead?,We explore the AI trade outlook and feature three ETFs.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=172e9eedd73bc1bf1ce25956fcbbe80bcd665ca094442769021f4e0303f85f41,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-stocks-bubble-boom-ahead-180400416.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-stocks-bubble-boom-ahead-180400416.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-stocks-bubble-boom-ahead-180400416.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Last Monday, Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI announced a ""strategic partnership"" under which the former will invest as much as $100 billion in the latter. The investment will support new data centers with a capacity of at least 10 gigawatts of power.
According to the Financial Times, the computing capacity could cost nearly $600 billion, with about $350 billion potentially going to Nvidia for its advanced chips used to train and deploy AI models.
Shares of Nvidia rose nearly 4% after the report. The company is the largest in the world, with a market capitalization over $4.5 trillion. Demand for its cutting-edge AI chips shows no signs of slowing.
OpenAI, valued at close to $500 billion, is the most valuable privately held company. While its ChatGPT boasts more than 700 million monthly users, its path to profitability remains unclear.
Nvidia has already invested in several AI-related companies, though at smaller scales. It recently invested $5 billion in Intel (INTC), holds a 7% stake in AI cloud-computing company CoreWeave (CRWV), and is also an investor in Elon Musk’s xAI.
Some analysts raised concerns about the circular structure of the agreement, comparing it to vendor-financing subsidies seen during the dot-com bubble. Critics have also warned about a potential AI bubble, suggesting these large investments are designed to boost demand for Nvidia’s chips.
Nvidia is not alone. Other mega-cap companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) have also made large investments in AI startups that, in turn, rely on their cloud-computing products. Microsoft is one of the biggest stakeholders in OpenAI, and Amazon has made huge investments in Anthropic.
Unlike the dot-com bubble, however, the leading players in the race to artificial general intelligence today are highly profitable, cash-rich mega-cap companies investing hundreds of billions to stay ahead.
For them, the greater risk lies in underinvesting and losing the race, not in overspending. Artificial general intelligence could transform our lives and result in enormous productivity gains. Further, valuations are not as extreme as during the dot-com bubble.
These big investments will likely result in handsome returns for some companies, while others may lose money. Some companies are already showing the positive impact of AI on their businesses. That’s why diversified exposure to AI beneficiaries via ETFs makes a lot of sense.
In fact, over the past few weeks we have already seen the AI trade broaden beyond the “Mag 7” group. Companies like Palantir (PLTR) and Oracle (ORCL) have performed much better."

Oct 1 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares slipped Wednesday morning after touching a record $4.5 trillion valuation earlier this week.
The dip followed Meta's (NASDAQ:META) announcement that it will acquire AI chip startup Rivos, a move that underscores the tech giant's ambition to expand its custom silicon program and reduce reliance on Nvidia hardware.
The deal strengthens Meta's MTIA initiative, which launched in 2023 in collaboration with Broadcom. These chips are designed to handle training and inference tasks in Meta's data centers, offering the potential to lower costs and improve efficiency. Meta executives emphasized that bringing Rivos' expertise in AI system design in-house should speed up development.
Despite this push toward independence, Meta continues to invest heavily in Nvidia-powered infrastructure. Just last week, the company struck an agreement worth up to $14.2 billion with CoreWeave, a cloud provider that rents Nvidia-based compute capacity.
Is NVDA Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 53 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA is $214.95 with a high estimate of $389.73 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +14.97% from the current price of $186.96.
Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for NVIDIA in one year is $320.57, suggesting a upside of +71.46% from the current price of $186.96."

Here's why the specialty chipmaker is a good addition to an enterprising investor's portfolio.
What does ON Semiconductor do?
The company provides power and sensing solutions to the automotive sector (55% of 2024 revenue), the industrial sector (25%), and what management categorizes as ""other"" (20%). Its product portfolio includes power semiconductors, intelligent sensors (including image sensors), and analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for electronic systems. Within the automotive industry, it has key and growing exposure to silicon carbide (SiC) chips used in electric vehicles (EVs), as well as exposure to EV charging, industrial automation, machine vision, and smart buildings and infrastructure in its industrial segment.
Finally, within ""other,"" it includes exposure to AI/data center spending and a wide range of consumer electronics products. For reference, it's also an Nvidia partner in developing the next generation of data centers.
Long-term growth, near-term risk
There are several aspects to appreciate about the company's long-term growth opportunities. However, in the near term, the slowdown in EV investment (triggered by high interest rates curtailing auto sales and ongoing losses by automakers on EVs) and an industrial slowdown are hurting demand. As previously discussed, the company's sales have been slowing since the end of 2023.
Still, the reality is that EVs are the long-term growth market in the auto industry, and that's why Ford Motor Company and others are committed to making multibillion-dollar investments to capture market share. With ON Semiconductor stock trading on slightly over 14 times the Wall Street analyst consensus for free cash flow in 2025, , there's a margin of safety for error in its valuation over the near term, and plenty of growth potential over the long term. That makes it a highly attractive stock to buy on a risk/reward basis."

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just set another record, becoming the first company ever to top a $4.53 trillion market cap as shares climbed nearly 3% Tuesday to close at $186.58.
It's been a stunning run. The chipmaker crossed $3 trillion only last summer and $4 trillion this July. Now it's riding a 39% year-to-date surge, thanks to unrelenting demand for its AI chips and a flood of infrastructure deals.
The biggest splash came with OpenAI, where Nvidia committed up to $100 billion to build AI infrastructure capable of delivering 10 gigawatts of compute power. OpenAI followed up by teaming with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) on five mega data centers packed with GPUs. Meanwhile, rivals like Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Google (GOOGL) are racing to expand their own AI muscle. Just this week, CoreWeave a cloud provider backed by Nvidia announced a $14.2 billion deal to supply Meta with AI infrastructure.
With Apple sitting at $3.78 trillion and Microsoft at $3.85 trillion, Nvidia's latest move cements it as the defining name of the AI boom."

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is reportedly looking to scoop up Rivos, a Santa Clara-based chip startup building processors for AI data centers, according to Bloomberg.
The talks are still early and details remain scarce, but Rivos has been chasing fresh funding at a $2 billion valuation. The company's chips are built on a scalable system-on-chip design meant to handle AI training, inference, and data analytics, and its team includes veterans from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD (NASDAQ:ARM), Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), and Google (GOOGL).
For Meta, the interest makes sense. The company has spent billions buying GPUs hundreds of thousands from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and smaller orders from AMD and expects 2025 capex to top $70 billion. At the same time, Meta is developing its own AI chips to cut reliance on suppliers. Earlier this year, it even tried to buy Korean startup FuriosaAI for about $800 million, though that deal never materialized.
If Meta does move forward, the acquisition would highlight just how serious it is about locking down chip capacity as competition in the AI arms race heats up."

Huawei is gearing up to nearly double production of its Ascend 910C AI chip in 2026, a move aimed at easing China's dependence on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) after U.S. restrictions curbed shipments. Bloomberg reported the company wants to churn out about 600,000 units next year with the help of state-backed foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International in Shanghai.
Chinese tech firms like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and DeepSeek are eager for homegrown alternatives. Nvidia sold about 1 million H20 chips to China in 2024, but that pipeline has now shut. On Nvidia's latest earnings call, CFO Colette Kress confirmed the outlook includes zero H20 shipments to China, while CEO Jensen Huang described the Chinese AI market as a $50 billion opportunity this year alone and one that could grow 50% annually. He also noted that nearly half of the world's AI researchers are in China, underscoring its importance.
Huawei isn't stopping at the 910C. It's planning follow-up chips the 950, 960 and 970 to roll out through 2028. But the technology gap remains stark: the upcoming Ascend 950 is expected to deliver just 6% of the performance of Nvidia's VR200."

The company successfully tested microfluidics technology, which uses tiny channels etched directly into a chip to carry liquid coolant right where heat is generated. This approach removes heat up to three times more effectively than today’s advanced “cold plate” systems, positioning Microsoft to push its AI chips harder and outpace its rivals.
The innovation comes as AI chips grow more powerful and generate more heat. Traditional cooling methods, such as fans or cold plates, are reaching their limits, threatening to slow progress. By cooling chips directly at the silicon level, Microsoft not only reduces heat but also improves efficiency, sustainability and cost-effectiveness in its data centers.
Researchers say the technology could allow for denser server designs, more powerful AI chips and even new 3D chip architectures. If widely adopted, microfluidics could reshape how data centers are built and help Microsoft strengthen its competitive edge in the fast-growing AI market.
Cooling Innovation Becomes a Strategic Necessity
As AI chips become more powerful, they also generate unprecedented levels of heat. Traditional methods like fans and cold plates are no longer sufficient to sustain performance, threatening to create a bottleneck for future breakthroughs. This makes cooling not just a technical challenge but a strategic imperative for companies competing in the AI space.
Microsoft's microfluidics innovation directly addresses this obstacle by removing heat from the silicon layer, which is three times more effective than cold plates. Beyond performance gains, this efficiency translates into lower energy costs, improved sustainability and the potential for more compact and denser server designs. In a market where speed, scale and cost-efficiency define leadership, cooling technology has become as important as chip design.
Microsoft Faces Rising AI Chip Competition
Microsoft faces mounting pressure in the AI chip race as rivals scale aggressively across compute and infrastructure.
NVIDIA NVDA remains the clear leader, anchored by its CUDA ecosystem, advanced Blackwell architecture and a multi-billion-dollar OpenAI chip deal. NVIDIA’s recent U.S. approval to sell H20 AI chips in China further strengthens its global reach and underscores its dominance in next-generation AI infrastructure.
Intel INTC is pursuing its biggest architectural shift in four decades, embedding AMX accelerators into Xeon CPUs and launching Xeon 6 processors with integrated AI, networking and media capabilities. Intel aims to strengthen its position across cloud, enterprise and edge markets with this transformative strategy.
Broadcom AVGO, meanwhile, is carving out a differentiated role with custom ASICs, XPUs and advanced networking chips. AI sales surged 63% year over year to $5.2 billion, supported by a $10 billion custom chip order reportedly tied to OpenAI. Broadcom’s strategic moves highlight its growing influence and underscore the intensifying competition Microsoft must navigate in AI infrastructure."

Nearly half of the analysts covering CoreWeave now have buy-equivalent ratings after at least three raised their recommendations in September. It’s a stark shift from mid-July, when less than 20% of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommended buying the stock.
The improving sentiment follows recent agreements with companies including OpenAI that quelled fears CoreWeave was too beholden to Microsoft Corp., which accounted for more than 70% of its revenue at the end of June. On Tuesday, CoreWeave said it will provide Meta Platforms Inc. with as much as $14.2 billion worth of computing power. The news sent the stock soaring, capping its best month since June with a gain of 33%.
“The Street is finally seeing the stickiness and the demand story when it comes to CoreWeave,” said Tejas Dessai, director of thematic research at Global X ETFs, which holds CoreWeave shares. “Once you get these data centers up and running, of course the demand exists, and then the infrastructure in terms of using AI compute services can be a very attractive business.”
Since its initial public offering in March that was propped up by long-time backer Nvidia Corp., CoreWeave has been one of the most controversial stocks on Wall Street. Bulls see a new breed of computing services provider that is poised to win more business as spending on AI continues to climb. For bears, it’s a cash-burning trap that’s destined to end badly when demand eventually slows.
CoreWeave shares have gained more than 230% since their debut but remain down 27% from a June peak when the market capitalization of the Livingston, New Jersey-based company briefly exceeded $88 billion. The stock fell 1.9% at 10:05 a.m. in New York trading on Wednesday.
The shares have considerable upside even after September’s run up, with strong demand expected to translate into future profits, Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note on Tuesday initiating coverage of CoreWeave with an outperform rating. The analysts’ 12-month price target is $175, implying potential for a gain of more than 25% from Tuesday’s closing price."

While the role of graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom accelerators in the global AI build-out is indisputable, equally important are the manufacturing tools and equipment needed to make these processors possible.
Lam Research (LRCX 4.66%) is one of the pick-and-shovel companies that develops these tools -- highly precise etching and deposition equipment (used for precise pattern shaping and accurate metal layering on the silicon wafer) used to manufacture the smallest and most advanced semiconductor chips.
These tools are essential for manufacturing cutting-edge chips at 3 nanometers and below where traditional extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography alone falls short on precision and throughput. The company is also a prominent player in gate-all-around (GAA) transistors and advanced packaging -- critical technologies that are crucial for manufacturing faster and more efficient AI chips.
In its latest period (fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, ended June 29), Lam's revenue was up 33.6% year over year to $5.2 billion, while gross margins were a record 50.3%. This highlights the strong demand and robust execution from the company. The company is also committed to returning capital to shareholders, having paid $1.3 billion in buybacks and $295 million in dividends during Q4.
Lam Research's shares have soared nearly 78% so far in 2025. Yet, here's why it is still a very attractive pick in 2025.
Market opportunity
Global wafer-fabrication equipment (WFE) spending is expected to reach approximately $105 billion in 2025, up from the previous estimate of $100 billion, primarily due to increased investment in China. Lam Research is well positioned to capture a significant share of this market since AI chips require smaller transistors, denser memory, and more advanced packaging -- all of which increase the need for Lam's etch and deposition equipment.
The company expects its serviceable available market (SAM) to reach the mid-30% range of the WFE market in 2025, with potential to reach the high-30% range of WFE. Long term, the company expects to capture almost half of the incremental SAM.
Competitive edge
Besides its etching and deposition equipment, Lam Research also offers multistation plasma processing (which etches metal layers across multiple silicon wafers at once), thus helping foundries and Integrated Device Manufacturers (a chip company that both designs and manufactures in-house) to boost efficiency and yield.
The company's atomic layer deposition (ALD) metallization tools using molybdenum are mainly used for GAA transistors -- used in the smallest nodes, typically 3 nanometers and below -- to better control electricity consumption and make chips faster and more power efficient.
Advanced packaging
Lam Research is also seeing rapid growth in advanced packaging, which is critical for improving memory density, bandwidth, and power efficiency in GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), AI accelerators, and memory chips used in data centers. The rapid adoption of AI is driving demand, with leading customers spending over six times more on advanced packaging than they did in 2021.
With its SABRE 3D packaging tool and decades of copper-plating experience (needed for advanced packaging), Lam Research is capturing new opportunities in the high-volume AI and data center chips.
Valuation
Lam Research's future earnings estimates and current valuation highlight the stock's upside potential. The stock is trading at around 29 times forward earnings. Analysts expect the company's earnings per share (EPS) to be $4.48 in fiscal 2026 (ending June 30, 2026) and $5.20 in fiscal 2027.
We can expect its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple to gradually expand in the range of 30 to 35, in line with high-growth AI-powered semiconductor players, especially as demand for advanced node chips continues to surge. This implies that the company's share price could fall within the range of $156 to $182 by 2027, representing an increase of nearly 21.7% to 42% over its closing price as of Sept. 26.
Even though the share price gains are not massive, they are sufficiently high, especially when you get a stake in a company with a stable business model and cutting-edge technologies. The stock can go even higher in the next decade, as AI chip manufacturing further picks up momentum. Hence, it makes sense to buy at least a small stake in this high-quality semiconductor stock in 2025."

Earlier this month, CoreWeave announced a similar deal with OpenAI and revealed a revenue guarantee from Nvidia for up to $6.3 billion. It's been a successful month for the high-growth data center company and a great six months for CoreWeave investors. Since the company IPO's in late March, its stock is up nearly 250%.

So just how much would you have if you'd invested $10,000 in CoreWeave stock when it IPO'd? The 242% gain through Sept. 30 would have turned $10,000 into $34,200. Not bad.
CoreWeave is attempting to thread a needle
Despite the flashy numbers and the impressive chart, I would caution investors from getting swept away in the excitement. CoreWeave is very new to the public markets and its growth is built on a rocky foundation. The company's growth is being fueled by expensive debt. It is walking a tightrope as it must expand capacity at a lightning pace in order not to fall short of what it is promising clients, but if it expands too quickly or AI demand sags -- a possibility that shouldn't be taken ignored -- CoreWeave could find itself in very hot water."

The funding will be used to make AI factories — the data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI workloads — radically more resource-efficient via AI agents.
At the heart of this mission lies a simple truth: we live in an energy-constrained world. Our ability to generate intelligence, and therefore revenue, is fundamentally limited by the energy available to power these grid-scale computing systems. We must therefore maximize the tokens generated by every watt of energy that enters the AI factory.
This in turn requires careful orchestration of the complex power, cooling, and workload management systems that underpin modern AI factories. Historically, these systems are designed and operate independently with minimal coordination, leading to large inefficiencies. In a world where every watt is precious, this waste is unacceptable. These systems must operate seamlessly as a single integrated system of compute.
Phaidra addresses this challenge by building AI agents to optimize large-scale compute facilities. Today, the company collaborates with industry leaders like NVIDIA to design the next generation of AI infrastructure. Phaidra is developing a portfolio of AI agents — from liquid cooling to chiller plants to workload management — that are trained to orchestrate complex systems that exceed the capability of human intuition or hard-coded controls logic, thereby unlocking efficiency gains that were previously unobtainable.
""Every breakthrough in AI requires an equally ambitious breakthrough in infrastructure efficiency,"" said Jim Gao, CEO of Phaidra. ""Our technology enables AI data centers to run smarter, not just harder, cutting costs while dramatically reducing their environmental footprint.""
""Collaborative Fund has always believed that the most transformative companies are those that marry profit with purpose,"" said Sophie Bakalar, Partner at Collaborative Fund. ""Phaidra is tackling AI's biggest bottleneck, energy consumption, in collaboration with NVIDIA, the global leader in compute.""
With the new capital, Phaidra will accelerate development of its agent ecosystem, deepen its collaboration with NVIDIA, and expand to additional global operators.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers, as South Korean chipmakers join forces with the ChatGPT maker to meet rising demand from its Stargate project.
The announcements were made on Wednesday after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and the chairmen of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix at the presidential office in central Seoul.
U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled the $500 billion Stargate project in January, charging OpenAI and partners including SoftBank and Oracle with ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in artificial intelligence.
Expanding chip availability was one of the key ideas of the project, and Nvidia said last week it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply it with data center chips.
PLAN TO BUILD TWO DATA CENTERS IN SOUTH KOREA
South Korea's top presidential adviser, Kim Yong-beom, said OpenAI was seeking to order 900,000 semiconductor wafers in 2029, and planned to set up joint ventures with Samsung and SK Hynix to build two data centers in South Korea with an initial capacity of 20 megawatts.
The adviser said South Korea was open to participating in financing for the Stargate project if needed.
“The significant part of the Stargate project would be impossible without memory chips from the two companies,” Kim told a press briefing.
The president's office said the partnership would give South Korean chipmakers an early foothold in the world's largest AI infrastructure project, providing a growth opportunity for the domestic chip industry.
Samsung and SK Hynix together hold about 70% of the global Dynamic Random Access Memory chip market and nearly 80% of the HBM market.
HBM - a type of DRAM standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volumes of data generated by complex AI applications.
OpenAI this year set up its first office in Seoul as South Korean demand for its ChatGPT service surged. The country has the largest number of paying ChatGPT subscribers after the United States, according to OpenAI.
Alongside the chip supply agreements, Samsung Electronics' affiliate Samsung SDS signed a partnership with OpenAI to develop, build and operate AI data centers under the Stargate project, while also expanding enterprise AI services.
Shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries and construction unit Samsung C&T will jointly work with OpenAI to develop floating offshore data centers to cut cooling costs and carbon emissions.

The company's AI-optimized GPUs are in high demand, and this trend shows no signs of slowing as enterprises and hyperscalers continue to scale their AI infrastructure.
While much investor attention is focused on compute capacity, networking and high-speed connectivity are also equally crucial in global AI buildout. That's where Astera Labs (ALAB -0.05%) comes in.
Astera Labs estimated the target addressable market for its cloud and AI connectivity solutions at $17.2 billion in 2024 and expects it to grow to $27.4 billion by 2027. Those 17 billion reasons alone make this networking player hard to ignore, while its focus on open standards and interoperability-including collaborations with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Alchip positions it as the next monster company in the AI infrastructure landscape.
Business drivers
The global AI infrastructure buildout is increasingly vulnerable to networking and latency bottlenecks, in addition to compute power constraints. PCI Express (PCIe) is the open networking standard used inside servers and AI racks to link CPUs, GPUs, memory, and storage. Each new generation delivers faster and more efficient internal chip-to-chip and server-to-server connectivity, allowing AI workloads to move massive amounts of data with reduced delay.
Astera is targeting this connectivity and latency market with its purpose-built solutions that includes Aries PCIe retimers (a small chip that cleans and boosts data signals), Scorpio PCIe fabric switches (connecting PCIe devices inside a server or data center rack), Taurus electrical cables, and Leo CXL controllers (manages Compute Express Link connections, a new standard built on PCIe). These products ensure stable and high-speed connections across accelerators, storage, and memory in the AI server racks.
The California-based company also operates an Intelligent Connectivity Platform that combines hardware (retimers, switches, active cables, CXL controllers) with COSMOS software, which is used to monitor and optimize connections across entire AI racks. The hardware-software integration is becoming increasingly critical as hyperscalers expand their AI clusters. The company has also demonstrated PCIe Gen 6 interoperability with Nvidia's GPUs (including Blackwell architecture chips ), which has dramatically strengthened its position in the AI connectivity space.
Financial performance
Demand for these advanced networking products is evident from Astera's financial performance. In the second quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended June 30), revenue soared 150% year-over-year to $191.9 million, driven by solid demand for its Aries and Taurus product lines to connect more chips within an AI server rack or to connect multiple AI server racks.
Astera Labs is also showing strong profitability and cash generation. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 550 basis points year over year to 39.2%. The company also generated free cash flow of $135.4 million and had $1.07 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the second quarter. These funds have provided the company with the flexibility to fund growth initiatives.
Demand visibility
Astera is seeing strong demand as hyperscalers accelerate AI data center buildouts. The company's Scorpio P-Series switches, which support PCI Express Gen 6 (the latest version of the PCIe standard) for connecting multiple servers and racks in AI clusters, have entered volume production and already account for more than 10% of revenue -- the fastest product ramp in its history.
The company is also engaging with over 10 unique AI platform and cloud infrastructure companies for its Scorpio X-Series, designed for connectivity between next-generation AI racks. The company expects high-volume production of Scorpio X switches in 2026. These switches can lead to better monetization for the company in the coming years.
Server manufacturers are also testing Leo CXL controllers and may soon choose to deploy them. Taurus Ethernet cables are also expected to see wider use in 2026.
Interoperability
Astera is positioned to benefit dramatically from the AI Infrastructure 2.0 transition -- the shift from proprietary and difficult-to-scale rack designs to open, multi-vendor, and scalable ones. The company is a promoter of UALink, an open interconnect standard for AI accelerators backed by AMD and major hyperscalers. Astera is also working with Nvidia to support NVLink Fusion networking technology and with custom chip developers such as Alchip. These partnerships highlight its commitment to ensuring vendor interoperability in AI clusters.
Data centers are increasingly preferring interoperability, as it prevents vendor lock-in. Hence, this could help drive adoption of Astera's solutions in future years.
Valuation
Shares have surged over 440% from Astera's initial public offering price of $36 in March 2024. The stock trades at nearly 103 times forward earnings, which is steep. However, with trailing 12-month revenue of $605.5 million and a profit margin of 16.5%, the valuation appears more reasonable -- especially since topline and bottom-line performance is better than that of many AI peers. Analysts are also guiding for revenue to grow year over year by nearly 96% in fiscal 2025 and 31.5% in fiscal 2026. On the other hand, earnings per share are estimated to grow by 88.4% and 29.3%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026.
Investors often accept high valuation multiples for companies with rapid revenue growth and improving profitability -- much like Palantir Technologies, which continues to trade at premium valuations due to robust demand trends. Hence, while execution risks remain, Astera seems to be a solid high-risk, high-reward choice for long-term investors."

The strategic partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI is telling for the AI sector. The intent is to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems to help OpenAI build sector-leading models and tools for developers and to expand uses for the AI experience. For perspective on the amount of computing power that represents, consider that a typical nuclear power plant has a power output of about 1 gigawatt.
The partnership complements the relationships Nvidia has with notable global tech companies like SoftBank, Microsoft, and Oracle. Data center construction announcements across the technology sector have Wall Street believing the demand for the chipmaker's products is insatiable. In a recent research note shared by Barron's, for example, Dave Novosel, an analyst at credit-researcher Gimme Credit, wrote:
Firstly, Nvidia is the clear leader among chip providers, at least for the time being. Secondly, we expect robust demand for AI for the foreseeable future. AI is being employed by virtually every major company. And firms are finding more and more uses for AI in their operations, primarily because of the massive cost savings attained.
That line of thought has Nvidia stock holding up well even as other AI-related names pulled back in recent weeks.
Be aware of the risks
Some say the company's investment in OpenAI is a kind of circular deal since the money is seemingly being recycled into buying Nvidia products. That could bring into question whether the AI spending boom is sustainable.
But the big tech hyperscalers and foreign entities also continue to announce multibillion-dollar projects that will undoubtedly benefit the chipmaker directly. Microsoft has an AI data center in the works in Wisconsin. It also made a mid-September announcement detailing plans for a $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure and related operations in the United Kingdom over four years.
Meta Platforms is building a $10 billion data center in Louisiana dubbed Hyperion. Another project called Prometheus is for a smaller facility in Ohio. The large Stargate joint venture among SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle plans to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the U.S. There have also been several international projects announced by sovereign governments.
An Nvidia investment has a risk buffer
There is the risk that these capital spending plans get pulled back or downscaled. But a good result from an investment in Nvidia isn't fully reliant on all of those plans panning out. It isn't a story stock in the sense that a successful investment outcome is based on future potential rather than current fundamentals.
It's already a very profitable company, and not just from its data center segment. It has growth engines elsewhere. Revenue from its gaming business also soared 49% year over year in the most recent fiscal quarter. Its automotive and robotics segment experienced revenue growth of 69% versus the year-ago period.
While the automotive and robotics business generates much lower revenue than either data center or gaming, CEO Jensen Huang sees enormous potential there. Earlier this year, he told investors that he sees a multitrillion-dollar opportunity in autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.
The chipmaker's stock is trading at a relatively high valuation largely based on expectations for continued strong sales growth in the data center business. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 40. That's more than 15% above the three-year average, but well off the high. Even if some expected capital spending doesn't materialize, the AI race is well underway, and Nvidia will continue to benefit."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-01T10:15:00,Is IonQ a Buy?,"While the stock is highly speculative, it could become a huge winner.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c5a0ae840cedde60d15bd42f22c9df5764e0bdfb5a9111cc9de71e1ebe8134d0,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/is-ionq-a-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/is-ionq-a-buy/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/is-ionq-a-buy/,fool.com,200,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping drive the market higher right now, but it's not the only game-changing technology on the horizon. The next big technological leap could come from quantum computing, which takes a completely different approach to solving problems.
One company right in the middle of this shift is IonQ (IONQ -5.85%). The company wants to become the Nvidia of quantum computing, and it is following the chip leader's playbook. Let's take a closer look at quantum computing and how IonQ is positioning itself.
The next potential big tech breakthrough
Quantum computing works by replacing traditional bits, which are either a zero or a one, with qubits that can be both at the same time. That's the whole trick behind what's called superposition, and it's what lets quantum machines tackle problems that would take a regular computer forever. The problem, though, is that qubits throw off a lot of errors.
IonQ is working to help overcome this quantum computing obstacle through the use of its trapped ion technology, which uses actual atoms instead of artificial qubits. That makes its systems harder and more expensive to build, but the payoff is qubits that are more stable and produce fewer errors. At the end of the day, lower error rates will be necessary to make quantum computers useful.
Like Nvidia, IonQ is also looking to build an entire technology ecosystem. While Nvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used to train large language models (LLMs) and run inference, its wide moat doesn't just come from its chips, but the software and networking ecosystem built around them.
IonQ is taking the same approach. Its Clifford Noise Reduction software helps cuts down logical error rates even further, which is critical for scaling. The company has also shown it can convert photons from its trapped-ion systems into telecom wavelengths. This is important because it could allow quantum computers to link up over today's fiber networks and be the building block for a future quantum internet.
To speed up its ecosystem push, IonQ has been active on the acquisition front. It bought Lightsynq to add high-speed networking, picked up Capella to bring in satellite-based distribution, and now has a pending deal for Vector Atomic, which would give it a foothold in quantum sensing. That is a smart way to expand its reach into applications that go beyond computing itself, and it shows the company is thinking long term.
What makes all of this possible is that IonQ is well-funded. In early July, it had $1.6 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet, putting it in a strong position to continue to invest and make acquisitions. It also has already built out a 105,000-square-foot manufacturing facility and research center.
A speculative investment
While IonQ holds a lot of promise, at the end of the day, it is a highly speculative investment. It's already burned through $89 million in cash through the first six months of this year, and it's only generated $28.3 million in revenue over the same stretch.
The prize, though, is potentially huge. Quantum computing isn't replacing classical computing anytime soon, but as problems in AI and drug discovery get more complex, there will be cases where only quantum computing can handle them. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang recently said quantum computing is reaching an inflection point, which is worth noting because eventually quantum computing and AI are expected to converge.
For investors, IonQ is a classic speculative stock. It appears to have an early technological edge and a credible plan to build a moat, but the timeline for adoption of the technology is uncertain, and the risks are high. Like Nvidia or Amazon in their early days, the stock could be volatile and endure sharp pullbacks along the way, but if IonQ's vision plays out and it becomes the go-to platform for quantum computing, the upside could be enormous."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-01T09:45:00,"After Getting a $5 Billion Investment From Nvidia, Is It Off to the Races for Intel's Stock?","Shares of Intel have been rallying of late, but they're still down close to 30% over the past five years.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=03407841e77a106e4a9b9cd53b48c112754cce65a7e257b07d58990e6f4cd57a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/after-getting-a-5-billion-investment-from-nvidia-i/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/after-getting-a-5-billion-investment-from-nvidia-i/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/after-getting-a-5-billion-investment-from-nvidia-i/,fool.com,200,,"Intel (INTC 4.24%) has suddenly become one of the hottest stocks to own of 2025. Its year-to-date return was a staggering 77% as of the end of last week. Investors have been seeing plenty of reasons to take a chance on the stock despite its lackluster financials.
The U.S. government took a 10% stake in the business and leading chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has also announced it will invest $5 billion into the company. Is this a clear sign that Intel is a safe stock to own again, and that it could be due for an even greater rally?
How important is the Nvidia investment?
The timing of the Nvidia investment is intriguing, since the news comes after the government recently announced it was taking a 10% stake in Intel. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has been fairly close with the U.S. government as the two sides brokered a deal where the chipmaker would be able to sell its chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut going to the government. This recent move may have been as part of a way for Nvidia to win more favor from the government, which has been pushing hard for more chip production in the U.S.
For Intel, getting an influx of cash is important as the company's free cash flow over the trailing 12 months has been negative, totaling a loss of $10.9 billion. While the companies will work together, a key detail that's noteworthy is that Intel's foundry will not be making chips for Nvidia. And it's Intel's foundry business that has been struggling mightily to show that it can win over big customers and be a major growth driver for Intel in the future. Huang says he's still evaluating the foundry and the lack of firm commitment may be the most telling piece of this investment.
Although a $5 billion investment may be significant, for a company of Nvidia's size, which has generated $87 billion in profit over the past 12 months, it's by no means an investment that will make or break its operations.
Investors shouldn't ignore Intel's worrisome fundamentals
Obtaining an investment from Nvidia may sound great at first glance, but without a commitment to its foundry, there are still some significant doubts about Intel's long-term success. Consider just how unimpressive the company's results have been in recent years.
There has been limited growth for Intel and its bottom line has frequently been in the red or just barely above breaking even. The big overarching question is whether Intel's foundry business can truly be successful and make quality, high-performing chips in the U.S. and be able to compete effectively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which utilizes a labor market where wages are far lower than in the U.S.
For now, Intel still has a lot to prove.
Why Intel's rally may not last
The market has a way of overreacting to news in the short term. And over a longer period, things usually calm down. That's what I think may end up happening with Intel's stock. News of the U.S. government and Nvidia investing in the business may sound promising at first, but that doesn't mean that Intel is suddenly on a path to profitability or that it has become a less risky buy overnight.
At the end of the day, what matters is how the business is actually performing, not who has invested in it. A company like Nvidia can afford to make a $5 billion investment into Intel and not lose sleep over it because its profits are so massive. But for the average investor, even putting a few thousand dollars into this tech stock may not be a great idea given the significant uncertainty around Intel's operations. Given all the question marks around Intel's future, a wait-and-see approach may be the best one to take with the stock right now."

Since the start of 2023, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) is up a whopping 73%, and even a brief plunge on tariff concerns hasn't been able to slow it down. Paced by the so-called Magnificent Seven, the broad market index has soared as AI-driven growth has fueled stocks like Nvidia, Meta, and Microsoft.
There is some evidence that a bubble could be forming in the S&P 500. After all, the index is unusually expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and the CAPE ratio, which adjusts for inflation, is even more expensive. The so-called Buffett indicator, a ratio of the S&P 500's market cap to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is also at an all-time high.
However, the AI stocks leading this charge aren't as expensive as you might think. The chart below shows five of the leading AI stocks.
Although none of those stocks are cheap, they are mostly in line with the S&P 500, and all are delivering double-digit percentage growth. Nvidia, which is the most expensive of the group, is also the fastest growing, and its revenue is forecast to grow by 56% in its next quarterly report.
Where the bubble is forming
Rather than in large-cap stocks, the bubble forming in the stock market appears to be happening in zero-revenue, emerging technology stocks, and it's reminiscent of earlier stock market bubbles.
For example, in the dot-com era, droves of small internet companies went public with little or no revenue and unproven business models. That helped hasten the bust in 2000.
During the pandemic era, we saw a similar phenomenon with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), nearly all of which crashed or went bankrupt, even though they generally had successful debuts.
Other emerging technology stocks with little revenue, like electric vehicles, mostly went bankrupt or crashed in that era. Even the higher-profile newcomers like Rivian and Lucid lost more than 90% of their value.
This time around, there are a number of emerging sectors that are demonstrating similar trends. For example, modular nuclear reactor company Oklo (OKLO -1.34%) has jumped 1,200% during the past year even though the company has no revenue and doesn't expect to generate revenue until at least late 2027. It is currently attempting to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and has not sold a purchase agreement yet. Oklo currently has a market cap of almost $17 billion.
Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are another sector that has gotten frothy despite minimal revenue. Archer Aviation (ACHR -0.08%), which also has no revenue, currently trades at a market cap of $6 billion.
Finally, quantum computing stocks have soared this year, even though that sector is still producing little or no revenue. One stock, Quantum Computing (QUBT -2.52%), is up nearly 3,000% during the past year and its market cap has reached $3.7 billion, though it expects to generate less than $1 million in revenue this year.
What it means for investors
Investor enthusiasm for AI stocks seems to have carried over to emerging technology sectors that are unproven, much as it did in the dot-com era and during the pandemic.
Although companies like Oklo and Archer Aviation have potential, their current valuations don't seem to factor in the downside risk in the stock. It's likely to take years to build significant revenue, and even if they get there, that's not a guarantee of success.
In the current stock market, any of these stocks could crash if investor sentiment starts to shift. For the businesses to grow into their valuations without a major pullback seems unlikely."

Is It Too Late to Buy?,"If history is any guide, the incredible run in Robinhood stock this year probably isn't sustainable.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a6ddcdf1ec5099e874055ff7ab43229d44383f7e7dd4e5a51f52ba6ed47d8319,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/stock-sp-500-nvidia-palantir-too-late-to-buy-hood/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/stock-sp-500-nvidia-palantir-too-late-to-buy-hood/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/stock-sp-500-nvidia-palantir-too-late-to-buy-hood/,fool.com,200,,"The S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) is made up of 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy. To be considered for a spot in the index, there are multiple criteria, including that companies must have a market capitalization of at least $22.7 billion and must be profitable. But even after ticking those boxes, a special committee ultimately decides which candidates make the cut.
The S&P 500 is rebalanced once per quarter, meaning stocks that no longer meet the criteria are removed in favor of more suitable names. The most recent rebalance occurred on Sept. 22, when casino operator Caesars Entertainment was replaced by Robinhood Markets (HOOD -0.63%), which operates a popular online investing platform.
Robinhood stock is trading up 208% so far this year, crushing the comparable performances of artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouses Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, which have returned 28% and 136%, respectively. That's a ton of gains already for Robinhood. Does it mean it's too late for investors to board this train? Read on.
Concerning trends are emerging in Robinhood's core business
There are two parts to Robinhood's total revenue:
- Transaction revenue, which comes from processing stock, option, and cryptocurrency trades for clients.
- Net interest revenue, which is the interest income Robinhood earns on its own cash, and the cash clients store on its platform. The company also earns interest on margin loans, which clients use to buy stocks and other financial assets.
Transaction revenue is the more important component, because it reflects the performance of its core business. President Donald Trump's election win last November drove a boom in trading activity, but especially in the cryptocurrency space, as he promised to slash regulation and adopt policies that would boost economic growth. This change ended up being great for Robinhood.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company's transaction revenue hit an all-time high of $672 million, with crypto transaction revenue making up $358 million of that figure. However, the Trump bump quickly faded -- just six months later, in the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), Robinhood's transaction revenue was down 20% to $539 million, with crypto transaction revenue plummeting 55% to just $160 million.
Many popular cryptocurrencies are losing ground right now, so investors are being more cautious. Dogecoin is down 51% from its 52-week high, Shiba Inu is down 63%, and XRP has declined by 24%. Even Bitcoin has lost around 11% of its peak value.
This isn't the first time Robinhood has suffered a sharp downturn in its crypto business. The company's crypto revenue soared 4,560% in the second quarter of 2021 and accounted for half its total transaction revenue. But in the second quarter of 2022, just one year later, its crypto revenue had plummeted by 75%.
Robinhood's shrinking revenue doesn't align with its surging stock price, and this could be a major problem for investors -- but more on this later.
Falling interest rates could be another headwind
The U.S. Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate (the overnight interest rate) three times in the final months of 2024, and a few weeks ago, on Sept. 17, the central bank executed its first cut of 2025. Falling interest rates would normally be a headwind for Robinhood's net interest income, but it's being offset by a sharp increase in margin loans and client cash balances.
At the end of the second quarter, clients were holding $8.7 billion in cash on Robinhood's platform, which nearly doubled from the year-ago period. The company's margin loan book was also at a record high of $9.5 billion.
As a result, second-quarter net interest income actually grew by 25% year over year to $357 million. However, I wouldn't expect the growth in the company's margin loan book and client cash balances to outrun the decline in interest rates forever.
A stock market correction, for example, could trigger a decline in margin loan balances as investors pare their exposure to risk. Moreover, investors might pull cash out of their trading accounts in the event of an economic recession, as they prioritize day-to-day expenses.
Robinhood stock could be heading for a sharp correction
The incredible 208% gain in Robinhood stock this year, combined with the company's shrinking revenue, has sent its price-to-sales ratio (P/S) surging to 30.8 -- three times higher than its average of 10.2 since it went public in 2021. This is known as a multiple expansion, and an extreme one like this is almost always unsustainable.
As a result, unless Robinhood can find a way to deliver significant revenue growth from here, its stock might be destined for a sharp correction. It would have to decline by 67% just for its P/S to align with its long-term average of 10.2, which isn't out of the question because it plummeted by more than 80% from its 2021 peak after the last crypto boom.
Robinhood's monthly active user base shrank in both the first and second quarters this year, and it won't be easy for the company to find more revenue with fewer clients actively trading on its platform. Therefore, it probably isn't a good idea to buy Robinhood stock right now, and investors who already own it might want to cash in some of their gains."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-01T08:25:00,2 High-Yield ETFs to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid,Investors looking for reliable option income ETFs should avoid the lure of huge yields and stick with something a bit more boring.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a75e4322dc8366df9e32e9639647fa245a81d2ae9047bc7a541873e49ebb31df,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/high-yield-etf-buy-hand-over-fist-1-to-avoid/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/high-yield-etf-buy-hand-over-fist-1-to-avoid/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/high-yield-etf-buy-hand-over-fist-1-to-avoid/,fool.com,200,,"Income-focused investors have plenty of options at their disposal when it comes to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). One type of ETF that is gaining a lot of traction today is option income ETFs. The big draw is large yields, but there are material risks to consider before you buy one of these funds.
In the end, most investors will be better off with fairly simple options like Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (DIVO 0.23%) and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (IDVO 0.73%). The ultra-high yields on offer from ETFs like YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY -0.32%) could be a siren's song that hurts you more than helps you.
What is an option?
Options are created when a person sells another person the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a future date. The person buying the right pays a fee to the person selling the right. The most common type of option is a covered call, in which a person who owns a stock sells someone the right to buy that stock at a future date. If the option is used (exercised), the stock must be sold. If the option is not exercised, nothing happens. Either way, the fee that is paid is kept by the stockholder.
Selling covered calls is a fair amount of work and only more active, and probably aggressive, investors should use this income-generating approach. However, it is a way to create an additional income stream from your stock portfolio that could be valuable. This is where option income exchange-traded funds come in. Simply put, you don't have to do the work because someone else is doing it for you.
Tread carefully with option income ETFs. There are some that offer dividend yields that just can't be sustained over the long term. And often, those same ETFs are so highly concentrated that there is material asset-specific risk (also called idiosyncratic risk) to consider.
Simple is better with covered call ETFs
If you were going to sell covered calls to generate additional income from your dividend portfolio, you would likely start by building a portfolio of stocks you like. And then you would start looking at selling covered calls on those stocks. You would probably find that selling covered calls worked better at different times for different stocks, which would leave you strategically selling covered calls across the portfolio. This is what Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF both do.
The difference between these two covered call ETFs is in the name. One is focused on international stocks and the other is U.S.-focused. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF owns around 30 stocks that are fairly well diversified by sector. And it sells covered calls on just a portion of the portfolio at any given time. That allows the owners of the ETF to generate extra income and benefit from capital appreciation, too. (Covered calls can limit the upside of a stock if the call is exercised.)
Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF owns around 60 or so stocks, applying the same basic approach to foreign stocks.
In both cases, the outcome has been a fairly reliable dividend over time, accompanied by a rising share price. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has a yield of around 4.6%. Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has a trailing 12-month yield of around 5.5%. Both are actively managed ETFs and have fairly high expense ratios of 0.56% and 0.66%, respectively. But if you are looking for consistent income from a covered-call strategy, these ETFs basically do what you would do if you chose to sell covered calls yourself.
Be careful how far you reach for yield
At the other extreme is YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF. It is actually just one of an entire family of option income ETFs offered by YieldMax. YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF's trailing 12-month yield is 81%. If that sounds too good to be true, it likely is.
For starters, many of the YieldMax ETFs are focused on just one stock, and they use a complex options approach to generate income instead of buying the stock and then selling covered calls. That's a lot more aggressive than what either of the Amplify ETFs does.
On top of that, option income can be highly variable from month to month for any given stock. Amplify addresses that issue by having a diversified portfolio and selling covered calls strategically. YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy can't do that. The income it generates is entirely reliant on just one stock. As the chart below highlights, the income you actually collect can change dramatically each month.
Then there's the risk posed by return of capital. Notice in the chart above how YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF's price has declined over time. That's because it is paying so much out in dividends that it is depleting its capital. There are some fairly complex tax issues involved here, but from a practical point of view, you are getting some of your original investment back with each dividend you collect. The only way to avoid that is if the underlying stock goes up dramatically. That can happen for a period of time, but Wall Street has a habit of pushing up stocks and then eventually pushing them down again. There are no free lunches, as the saying goes.
Meanwhile, the expense ratio for YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF is a lofty 1.27%. You are paying more for a less reliable income stream and the risk of your capital declining over time.
Keep it simple and go with DIVO or IDVO
To be fair, the huge yield numbers from YieldMax Option Income ETFs are very alluring. And perhaps for some investors, they will be a good fit. But if you are looking for a long-term investment, you should probably keep it simple and focus on option income ETFs that do what you would do. Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF and Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF don't have the highest yields, but they do have much more sustainable investment approaches."

He recently told CNBC, ""This continues to be, in my opinion, the most undervalued true AI play."" That may surprise readers because Ives also covers Nvidia and Palantir, both of which are cornerstones of the AI trade.
Ives says Tesla will eventually achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion as physical artificial intelligence products become a material source of revenue. That forecast implies 115% upside from its current market value just shy of $1.4 trillion. But most analysts are less optimistic. Tesla's median target price of $349 per share implies 21% downside from its current share price of $443.
Is the stock worth buying?
Tesla lost its leadership position in the electric vehicle market to BYD
Tesla has lost substantial market share across China, Europe, and the United States. The company accounted for 12% of battery electric car sales through June, down from 18% in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Chinese automaker BYD gained 2 points of market share to become the global leader as measured by vehicle volume.
Tesla reported dismal financial results in the second quarter. Deliveries declined 13%, due in part to increased competition, but consumers also shied away from the brand due to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. In turn, revenue declined 12% to $22 billion and non-GAAP net income declined 23% to $0.40 per diluted share.
Evidence suggests the third quarter will be equally disappointing. Sales in Europe declined 40% in July and 37% in August. Sales in China dropped 12% in July and 10% in August. And while sales in the U.S. increased modestly in those months, Tesla's U.S. market share still fell to 38%, the first reading below 40% since October 2017, according to Reuters.
Tesla has big opportunities in physical artificial intelligence (self-driving cars and robots)
Tesla currently earns the vast majority of its revenue from electric cars, but has much larger opportunities in autonomous ride-sharing and robotics. Indeed, Elon Musk thinks Tesla can be the most valuable company in the world several times over -- its market value reaching $30 trillion -- if it executes on opportunities in physical artificial intelligence (AI).
In June, Tesla launched its first autonomous ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and the company has since received approval to begin testing in Arizona and Nevada. Alphabet's Waymo is still the market leader, with robotaxi services open to the public in five U.S. cities, but Musk says Tesla has an edge that will allow the company to capture 90%+ market share in the future.
Specifically, Waymo uses a broad sensor suite (lidar, radar, and cameras) to create detailed maps that help its robotaxis navigate. But Tesla relies only on computer vision and does not map cities beforehand, an approach that is both cheaper and more scalable. For instance, despite entering the market three months after Waymo, Tesla robotaxis already have twice the coverage area in Austin.
Meanwhile, Tesla is developing an autonomous humanoid robot called Optimus that Musk says will eventually account for 80% of the company's value. The company plans to scale production next year and hopes to build at least a million units annually within five years. Humanoid robots could radically disrupt the labor market by displacing human workers, especially in tedious or dangerous tasks.
How big are those opportunities? Goldman Sachs expects U.S. ride-sharing revenue to hit $100 billion by 2030, but Morgan Stanley estimates the addressable market is closer to $1 trillion. Similarly, Citigroup analysts expect humanoid robot sales to reach $210 billion by 2035, and Morgan Stanley says that figure will hit $5 trillion by 2050.
Tesla stock is worth owning (for some investors) despite an absurd valuation
Tesla is the third most expensive stock in the S&P 500 at 178 times projected earnings for 2026. That multiple is absurd, but it's also irrelevant to some extent. I say that because the company is shifting focus from electric cars to physical AI, which leaves room for earnings growth to accelerate substantially in the future.
Investors that lack conviction in Tesla's ability to pivot to autonomous ride-sharing and humanoid robots should avoid the stock. But risk tolerant investors (those who can handle a 50% decline) that believe Tesla can disrupt the mobility and labor markets should own the stock. Now is as good a time as any to buy a small position."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-01T08:10:00,Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Stock Price in 2030,Is Nvidia on the road to more explosive growth?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=e79f2902f877dcacfbf1a41542fa216939bddbf0e42dce67e66337b2d8cd502c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/prediction-this-will-be-nvidia-stock-price-in-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/prediction-this-will-be-nvidia-stock-price-in-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/prediction-this-will-be-nvidia-stock-price-in-2030/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has wowed investors with its stock performance over the past several years -- whether you look through a short-term or long-term lens, this artificial intelligence (AI) giant has scored a win. For example, it's heading for a 35% gain this year, adding to an eye-popping 2,100% increase over the previous five years.
There's an obvious reason for this fantastic performance, and that's the fact that Nvidia has been generating enormous levels of revenue from its AI business -- and this, at high levels of profitability. In the most recent full year, Nvidia reported revenue of more than $130 billion, and gross margin exceeded 70%.
The AI market promises more growth ahead, and investors now have one big question: What will Nvidia's share price look like in the years to come? My prediction is this will be Nvidia's stock price in 2030...
The Nvidia of today
Before we dive into my prediction and the math behind it, though, let's take a quick look at how Nvidia has gotten to this point. This will help us better understand the company's future prospects.
As mentioned, AI has been and continues to be a massive opportunity for Nvidia. The company, originally known for powering video games with its graphics processing units (GPUs), repositioned itself to make AI its major focus -- and it did that early in the AI story. That was a smart move, offering Nvidia the opportunity to get ahead of rivals -- and this, along with Nvidia's commitment to annual innovation, is keeping the momentum going.
On top of this, Nvidia has expanded into a wide range of AI products and services including networking tools and enterprise software and is well positioned to play a key role in future phases of AI growth, from AI agents to humanoid robots. This is because Nvidia's GPUs power everything from the training of models to the use of AI to address real world problems.
So, customers need Nvidia every step of the way as they travel along the AI path. Of course, rivals exist, but the high performance of Nvidia's GPUs -- more powerful than other accelerators on the market -- have kept its AI customers coming back.
And in particularly bright news, Nvidia has made moves in recent times to expand its presence across AI and even in the personal computer market. This is thanks to its billion-dollar investment in AI research lab OpenAI and a separate deal with PC chip leader Intel. I would expect these moves to add to revenue in the coming years.
Nvidia's revenue potential
All of this offers us reason to be optimistic about Nvidia stock continuing to climb, but to find out exactly how high it might go, let's start by considering future revenue potential. Right now, Nvidia trades for 27 times sales, and it's generally traded at this level or higher in recent times. The average analyst estimate for revenue this year is about $206 billion, representing a 58% increase from last year's revenue level. And Nvidia has maintained double-digit revenue growth and even triple-digit growth over the past few years.
Even if this growth rate slows to a certain degree, it's likely to remain in the double digits considering forecasts for AI infrastructure spending to top $4 trillion by the end of the decade. This spending is set to benefit a company like Nvidia, which powers data centers with its GPUs.
And this suggests that at a compound annual growth rate of only 23%, Nvidia could grow its revenue to $370 billion by 2030. This level of sales and a potential market value of $10 trillion could keep Nvidia at a price-to-sales ratio of 27 -- and that translates into a share price of $411 in 2030.
This represents a 125% increase from Nvidia's price today -- a feat that's very possible for Nvidia.
Of course, these figures are just examples of one possible scenario, but it isn't far-fetched considering Nvidia's strength so far, commitment to innovation, and the phases of AI growth yet to come. And all of this supports my prediction that Nvidia stock could reach beyond $400 in 2030 as the next era of AI growth heats up."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-01T08:07:00,"2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in October","A fresh corporate earnings season is about to begin, and all eyes are on the ""Magnificent Seven.""",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=aa9096576b4735b84c45ed06e4ef3db80c7f273a4b73365a41424976f72d15dc,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/2-magnificent-seven-stocks-buy-hand-fist-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/2-magnificent-seven-stocks-buy-hand-fist-october/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/2-magnificent-seven-stocks-buy-hand-fist-october/,fool.com,200,,"In October, corporate America will start reporting its financial results for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Wall Street will be laser-focused on the ""Magnificent Seven"" companies, which tend to grow faster than the rest of the market thanks to powerful trends like artificial intelligence (AI).
The Magnificent Seven stocks include:
Meta Platforms and Alphabet (Google) are heading into this earnings season with significant momentum across their various businesses, mostly thanks to AI. They also happen to be the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks by one traditional valuation metric, making them a great value for investors.
Here's why they might be great buys in October (and beyond).
The case for Meta Platforms
Over 3.4 billion people use at least one of Meta's social media apps every single day, which include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. Meta generates most of its revenue by showing ads to those users, so the longer they stay online, the more money the company makes.
Meta uses AI in its recommendation algorithms to learn what type of content each user likes to see, so it can show them more of it. During the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), this strategy drove a 6% increase in the amount of time users were spending on Instagram compared to the year-ago period, and a 5% increase for Facebook.
Meta has applied a similar AI-powered strategy to its ad-recommendation engine to target users more accurately, which is driving a modest increase in conversions. This allows the company to charge a higher price per ad, because businesses are getting a greater return on their investment.
Meta is also using AI to power new features like its Meta AI chatbot, which launched in late 2023 and already has over a billion monthly active users. It's powered by the company's Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which rival some of the best models from leading start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic. As Meta AI's capabilities expand, it's likely to become a major tailwind for engagement.
Meta's revenue increased by 22% during the second quarter, accelerating from its first-quarter result of 16%. In other words, better engagement and higher ad conversions are driving significant momentum in its business. According to Yahoo! Finance, Wall Street now expects the company to generate $196.1 billion in revenue for the whole of 2025, with earnings of $28.15 per share. Both figures would be record highs.
Meta stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.9 as I write this, making it the second-cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven. As a result, there might be plenty of room for upside from here.
The case for Alphabet
When AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT went mainstream in 2023, investors were worried they would take traffic away from traditional internet search engines because they gave consumers a faster and more convenient way to access information. That would have spelled bad news for Alphabet, because Google Search accounts for more than half of the company's total revenue.
Alphabet met those concerns with innovation, developing its own AI models called Gemini, along with a chatbot with the same name. The Gemini models power a new Google Search feature called AI Overviews which combine text, images, and links to third-party sources to provide holistic answers to search queries. These responses appear above the traditional search results, so users no longer have to sift through web pages to find the information they need.
Overviews strike a good balance between the traditional Google Search experience, and the convenience provided by AI chatbots. As a result, Alphabet said more than 2 billion people were using them at the end of the second quarter, and since they monetize at a similar rate to traditional Google Search results, they aren't hurting the company's valuable core business.
Finally, Google Cloud deserves a special mention because it has become a key part of Alphabet's AI strategy. It provides computing power from state-of-the-art centralized data centers, in addition to an expanding list of ready-made LLMs from top third-party developers. These are the main two ingredients required to develop AI software, which is why nearly all AI unicorns (start-ups worth $1 billion or more) are using Google Cloud in some capacity.
Google Cloud's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 32% during the second quarter. That momentum is likely to continue because the platform's order backlog climbed at an even faster rate of 38%, reaching a whopping $106 billion, which will be converted into revenue as Alphabet brings more data centers online.
Alphabet stock has soared by 48% over the past year, yet its P/E ratio is still just 26.2 which makes it the cheapest member of the Magnificent Seven. Considering the company's resounding success in the AI space so far, I think its stock could be destined for much higher ground."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-10-01T08:00:00,3 Underrated AI ETFs With Multi-Million Dollar Potential,These ETFs offer three distinct ways to invest in AI over the long term.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=79fbd22b3da857d768f7c0bffa90faebd3c16e38a98ff30154ca59ae22e7d9ad,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/3-underrated-ai-etf-growth-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/3-underrated-ai-etf-growth-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/01/3-underrated-ai-etf-growth-stocks/,fool.com,200,,"Investing to attain potential multi-million-dollar returns takes time, good ideas, and a bit of luck. One of the easiest ways to miss out on outsized gains is to lack the conviction needed to hold stocks through periods of volatility.
All of today's top companies have undergone multiple brutal drawdowns. It's easy to forget that just a few years ago, in 2022, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), Amazon (AMZN -0.45%), Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%), and Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) all saw their stock prices fall over 40% from all-time highs. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia stock is trading up more than 1,100%, Meta is up over 500%, and Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet have all crushed the comparable performance of the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%).
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can make it easier to hold volatile growth stocks through steep downturns because of their diversification. Here's what makes the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG 0.53%), the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI 1.98%), and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ 1.36%) top AI ETFs to buy now.
1. Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF
The Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF invests in the top 10% of S&P 500 companies by market cap. Many of the most valuable U.S. companies are growth and AI-focused names. The ETF has a staggering 62% invested in the ""Ten Titans"" -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix.
The Ten Titans make up 39% of the S&P 500, which is already a lot. But this ETF takes that concentration a step further.
The fund is a particularly good buy for investors who believe that the largest companies by market cap will benefit the most from AI.
The fund's expense ratio of 0.2% is higher than some passively managed ETFs, but it's still reasonable for investors looking for a simple way to bet on today's existing winners.
2. iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF
With a net expense ratio of 0.55%, this fund is considerably more expensive than the 0.03% expense ratio found in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.
Unlike most passively managed funds, this active ETF isn't market-cap weighted. So its weights are based more on conviction than the value of the company.
Oracle's 5% weighting is nearly as high as Microsoft's 5.7%. Oracle could become the largest cloud purpose-built for AI within the next five years. And Broadcom is at 8.4%, right behind Nvidia at 9.2%.
The fund is very new, having launched less than a year ago in October 2024. So investors should only approach the ETF after doing more research on its holdings and the strategy employed by its active managers.
3. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF
This ETF is ideally suited for investors looking to build an AI portfolio around U.S. companies while also gaining significant exposure to international leaders. Around 31% of the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is invested in non-U.S. companies. Alibaba Group, Samsung Electronics, Tencent, and Taiwan Semiconductor are all top-10 holdings in the fund. And you won't find any of these companies in the S&P 500 because they are non-U.S. firms.
Another unique characteristic of this fund is that it isn't top-heavy. No holding makes up more than 4%, which is a stark contrast to the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF, which has over a third of the fund invested in just five stocks.
In this vein, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF is a good fit for investors looking for a diversified and global approach to the AI theme. The ETF features an ""unconstrained approach,"" which targets established and up-and-coming innovative companies without regard to stock market sector or geography. Its 0.68% expense ratio isn't cheap, but it could be worth it for investors looking for high growth potential.
Bold bets for risk-tolerant investors
These ETFs are likely to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years if investor appetite for tech-focused companies and AI names remains positive. But eventually, companies will need to convert capital expenditures (capex) into returns. We are still in the early innings of the AI build-out, with droves of data centers coming online in the next few years. But demand for those data centers depends on the usage of AI models by end users.
Agentic AI presents an opportunity to further integrate AI into regular business functions by helping with task completion and organization. And edge AI involves running algorithms directly on devices rather than depending on the cloud.
Despite the long-term potential of AI, there are plenty of reasons why the discussed ETFs could disappoint. A cyclical downturn for factors unforeseen could challenge the lofty valuations of companies that are priced for perfection. Or simply a pullback in capex spending after an initial ramp-up.
In this vein, investors need to consider the risks associated with allocating to AI names through individual holdings and ETFs. Investors should only approach AI-focused ETFs if they have a high risk tolerance, a long-term investment time horizon, and if the strategy aligns with their existing holdings and investment objectives."

Chicago, IL – October 1, 2025 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA and Meta Platforms META.
Will Amazon Keep Rebounding This Year?
On the surface, the price performance of Amazon stock has been very respectable. After all, AMZN is only 9% from a 52-week and all-time high of $242 a share (post-split basis).
That said, the rebound in AMZN has been subpar after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs rattled the broader market earlier in the year.
Rebounding +15% in the last six months, Amazon stock is now virtually flat in 2025, being the worst performer out of its ""Mag 7"" big tech peers, just behind Apple’s YTD gains of over +1% with Nvidia’s +35% leading the way.
Keeping this in mind, investors may be wondering if Amazon stock is being overlooked at the moment and if AMZN will keep rebounding.
AI is Streamlining Amazon’s Businesses
As illustrated by the price, consensus, and surprise chart above, Amazon has now exceeded EPS expectations for 11 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, Amazon has posted a very impressive average EPS surprise of 22.98% in its last four quarterly reports.
Most appealing and correlating with this exceptional operational performance is that Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence in nearly every facet of its business, as depicted below.
1. Enhancing Customer Experience
Amazon has integrated generative AI into Alexa, making interactions more natural and context-aware. Also boosting Amazon’s core e-commerce business, generative AI is providing smarter product listings, with engagement being further boosted by AI-generated ads that create lifestyle-themed visuals.
2. Revolutionizing E-Commerce Operations
AI-powered robots: Operating over 750,000 intelligent robots in its warehouses, Amazon has optimized inventory movement and storage while improving efficiency and safety.
Predictive analytics: Amazon is using AI to forecast demand and manage global inventory, reducing waste and improving delivery speed.
3. Driving Innovation Through AWS
Amazon Bedrock: Fully managed generative AI platform that allows developers to access top-tier machine learning models through a single application programming interface (API), including Anthropic’s Claude, Meta Platforms' Llama, and Amazon’s Titan model.
4. AI in Everyday Services
Amazon One: Futuristic, frictionless way to make payments and verify identity, with customers using their palm thanks to AI-powered biometric recognition."

How CoreWeave Turned a Crypto Crash into an AI Empire
“You adapt, evolve, compete, or die.”~ Paul Tudor Jones
CoreWeave: Right Place at the Right Time
Founded by three former commodities traders in New Jersey in 2017, ‘Atlantic Crypto’ first opened up shop as a crypto mining company, leveraging its graphic processing units (GPUs) to earn crypto rewards. At the time, crypto was becoming mainstream, Bitcoin was on its way to ~20x gains in two years, and business was good. However, in 2018, fate intervened when the crypto markets crashed and Bitcoin fell 80% from its peak.
“It’s not about the cards you’re dealt, but how you play the hand.” ~ Randy Pausch
CoreWeave Pivots from Crypto Mining to AI
While it didn’t seem like it at the time, the crypto crash would ultimately prove to be the best possible outcome for the company. Instead of fighting a brutal crypto bear market, the Atlantic Crypto team pivoted, sensing the incoming AI revolution. In 2019, the company renamed itself CoreWeave.What happened next was an incredible stroke of luck, coupled with foresight.
CoreWeave had exactly the necessary ingredients to pivot into an AI juggernaut, including multiple data centers and the hard-to-attain and highly coveted Nvidia H100 chips. Between a unique arrangement with Nvidia and its existing data center infrastructure, CoreWeave began providing cloud computing infrastructure necessary to train large language models (LLMs) to big tech companies just as the AI race heated up and billions in CAPEX would be spent. Meanwhile, as an early mover, CoreWeave has optimized its platform to meet specialized AI needs, offering industry-best performance at a fraction of the price.
CoreWeave: Deals, Deals, Deals
CoreWeave’s business is accelerating at a lightning-fast rate. Over the past few weeks, CoreWeave has landed three multi-billion-dollar deals, including:
· A $6.5 billion deal expansion with OpenAI to provide cloud infrastructure.
· A $6.5 billion “backstop” deal with Nvidia. In the deal, Nvidia will purchase any of CoreWeave’s unsold cloud capacity through 2032.
· A $14.2 billion deal to provide Meta Platforms access to its Nvidia GB300 server racks and “Blackwell” GPUs.

Chipmaker Nvidia Corp.’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang pushed back against Wall Street's long-term outlook for the company, saying analysts are underestimating the scale of artificial intelligence demand.
Dismisses Wall Street Forecasts
On last week's Open Source podcast, Huang was asked about Wall Street consensus from 25 analysts projecting Nvidia's growth ""flatlining"" after 2027. He said he had no issue with those forecasts but argued they fail to capture the scale of AI adoption that is now underway.
During the podcast, Huang said, “We're comfortable with that,” adding that his company has “no trouble beating the numbers on a regular basis.”
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
He described a “massive divergence of belief” between what AI leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman and Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ: MSFT) Satya Nadella are projecting and what Wall Street models assume. “Our opportunity, as I described it, is much larger than the consensus,” he said.
Huang pointed to what he called “two exponentials” driving compute requirements, that is, the rapid increase in the number of users engaging with AI tools, followed by the exponential growth in compute needed per user as models move from one-shot inference to reasoning.
“Until we fully convert all general-purpose computing to accelerated computing and AI... the chances [of a glut] are extremely low,” he said.

Huang Defends $100 Billion OpenAI Investment
On the podcast, Huang defended his decision to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, calling it “some of the smartest investments we can possibly imagine.”
Huang said, “OpenAI is likely going to be the world’s next multi-trillion-dollar hyperscale company,” adding that Nvidia will be working with the company “at the chip level, at the software level, at the systems level, at the AI factory level” to help build and operate its AI infrastructure.
This comes amid growing investor concerns that the company was creating a “circular” investment loop by investing in OpenAI, which would in turn acquire chips from Nvidia.

After all, AMZN is only 9% from a 52-week and all-time high of $242 a share (post-split basis).
That said, the rebound in AMZN has been subpar after President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs rattled the broader market earlier in the year.
Rebounding +15% in the last six months, Amazon stock is now virtually flat in 2025, being the worst performer out of its ""Mag 7"" big tech peers, just behind Apple’s AAPL YTD gains of over +1% with Nvidia’s NVDA +35% leading the way.
Keeping this in mind, investors may be wondering if Amazon stock is being overlooked at the moment and if AMZN will keep rebounding.

AI is Streamlining Amazon’s Businesses
As illustrated by the price, consensus, and surprise chart above, Amazon has now exceeded EPS expectations for 11 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, Amazon has posted a very impressive average EPS surprise of 22.98% in its last four quarterly reports.
Most appealing and correlating with this exceptional operational performance is that Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence in nearly every facet of its business, as depicted below.
1. Enhancing Customer Experience
Amazon has integrated generative AI into Alexa, making interactions more natural and context-aware. Also boosting Amazon’s core e-commerce business, generative AI is providing smarter product listings, with engagement being further boosted by AI-generated ads that create lifestyle-themed visuals.
2. Revolutionizing E-Commerce Operations
AI-powered robots: Operating over 750,000 intelligent robots in its warehouses, Amazon has optimized inventory movement and storage while improving efficiency and safety.
Predictive analytics: Amazon is using AI to forecast demand and manage global inventory, reducing waste and improving delivery speed.
3. Driving Innovation Through AWS
Amazon Bedrock: Fully managed generative AI platform that allows developers to access top-tier machine learning models through a single application programming interface (API), including Anthropic’s Claude, Meta Platforms META Llama, and Amazon’s Titan model.
4. AI in Everyday Services
Amazon One: Futuristic, frictionless way to make payments and verify identity, with customers using their palm thanks to AI-powered biometric recognition.
AI in Amazon pharmacy and logistics: AI streamlines prescription fulfillment and delivery routing, making services faster and more reliable.
AMZN Broker Recommendations
Not to be confused with the Zacks Rank, brokers do appear to be bullish on Amazon’s outlook and AI endeavors. Derived from 56 brokerage firms, Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.14 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell)."

Sep 29 - The S&P 500 edged slightly higher on Monday, adding 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near flat levels.
Investors looked to regain momentum after a tough week for the artificial intelligence trade.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) gained 2% as sentiment around AI spending steadied following recent doubts about infrastructure capacity and energy demands tied to its partnership with OpenAI. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Micron Technology (MU) also moved higher, rising 2% and 3% respectively.
Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) jumped 4% after announcing a $55 billion take-private deal. According to Goldman Sachs, U.S. merger activity has already topped $1 trillion this year, up 29% compared to last year.
Despite last week's pullback, analysts remain optimistic. Barclays strategist Venu Krishna noted that capital expenditures tied to AI infrastructure remain strong and continue to support broader markets, though he cautioned about the risks of market concentration.
Markets are also keeping a close eye on the potential U.S. government shutdown, which could delay key economic data releases and complicate the Federal Reserve's policy outlook."

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.
But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?
DeepSeek’s trader origins
DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.
AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.
In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.
From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.
DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.
DeepSeek’s strong models
DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.
DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.
DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety.
According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o."

While many leading tech players develop advanced AI software, Nvidia has a clear-cut leadership position when it comes to designing the advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that serve as the foundational hardware used for training and powering AI applications.
Thanks to the surge in demand and excitement surrounding AI technologies, Nvidia has seen massive sales and earnings growth over the last five years. In turn, these performance wins have helped power explosive gains for the company's share price.
What would a $10,000 investment in Nvidia five years ago be worth now?
Nvidia has posted a total return of roughly 1,290% over the last five years. That means that a $10,000 investment made exactly half a decade ago would now be worth more than $139,470.
With a market capitalization of roughly $4.34 trillion, Nvidia currently ranks as the world's largest company by a substantial margin. While it's impossible to predict exactly where the AI hardware market will head over the next five years, it looks like Nvidia is poised to retain a strong leadership position in the near term.
In addition to its market-leading strengths in the GPU category, the company looks poised to continue broadening its strengths in software and service categories While it would be a tall order to expect Nvidia to repeat its stock performance over the last five years again over the next half decade, it wouldn't be surprising to see the company significantly outperform the broader market across the stretch."

“You think President Trump is selling Boeing planes to all these countries around the world? Now that he owns $9 billion of stock, or we own $9 billion of stock, he’s going to be selling Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) chips. So this $5 billion from Nvidia starts with CPUs and is going to lead to GPUs. Why? Not because Nvidia is doing charity work, but because Nvidia is capped at Taiwan Semiconductor’s $4 billion per quarter growth. They’re not demand-constrained—they’re supply-constrained. They need Intel to succeed. They need Intel’s fabs to succeed with advanced chips so they can supply all the unlimited demand for this around the world. So Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) could be a multi-multi-bagger from here, and no one’s paying attention to it.”

The firm wrote that “the President literally tweeted/truthed out pictures of himself watching the stock [Intel] price go up, so we suppose that is a bull case of sorts.”
In its latest semiconductor sector report, Bernstein addressed the unusual role of government influence in markets.
The analysts wrote, “on top of all the typical concerns investors have in semiconductors we can now add governmental intervention to the list, both indirect (for example tariff policy, export controls) as well as increasingly direct measures like full-on equity stakes.”
Despite the presidential spotlight, Bernstein remains sceptical about Intel’s long-term prospects.
“We continue to believe Intel is fundamentally challenged, and recent partner investments don’t really change the story,” the note said.
The firm added that the company’s problems stem from execution rather than capital.
“Far more than money they need customers, and hence capability, and their lack thereof has nothing to do with money.”
Bernstein conceded that Intel “is likely to be viewed as a tariff winner,” but warned that the company’s current lack of external customers undermines this argument.
Overall, analysts see little near-term upside: “the turnaround is going to be a slog; we wouldn’t short it, but have trouble with that long case.” Intel is rated Market-Perform at Bernstein.
The wider sector has shown mixed signals, with AI driving “off the charts” demand for Nvidia, while analog recovery plays have stalled.
Yet the analysts cautioned that “valuations have started to climb markedly again,” leaving investors to weigh political intervention alongside fundamentals.

The stock has surged 56% over the past six months, yet slipped 2% in the last 30 days (as of Sept. 26, 2025), reflecting growing unease.
On the surface, the numbers leave little doubt. Q2 fiscal 2026 revenue jumped to $46.7 billion, with gross margins topping 72%. But warning signs are flashing: capital spending at bubble-like levels, enterprises questioning AI's return on investment, and competitors eager to chip away at Nvidia's dominance. The truth likely falls between euphoria and collapse.
Nvidia remains the backbone of AI infrastructure, but the easy money may already be behind it. The key question for October: Is the stock still a buy, or has the market already priced in perfection?
The empire strikes back
Nvidia's latest quarter didn't just meet expectations -- it redefined them. Data center revenue soared to $41.1 billion, nearly double the company's total revenue from just two years ago. Shareholders were rewarded handsomely: $24.3 billion returned in the first half of fiscal 2026, with another $60 billion buyback locked and loaded. Those aren't defensive moves; they're a declaration of confidence in a cash machine that shows no signs of slowing.
The strategy also stretches beyond GPUs. A recent $5 billion stake in Intel signals Nvidia's intent to shape entire computing stacks, not just dominate acceleration. On the product front, the Blackwell architecture is ramping quickly, while Rubin and Feynman -- the next-generation chips already in the pipeline -- keep the roadmap full.
And then there are the customers. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet can't build their AI ambitions without Nvidia silicon. When every hyperscaler depends on your hardware, pricing power follows. The 72% gross margins are the proof point -- not an aspiration, but a fact.
The bubble detective arrives
History suggests caution when capital spending reaches current extremes. Tech infrastructure investment now echoes 1999 -- today, AI replaces the internet as the narrative fuel, but the investment cycle looks strikingly familiar.
This circular validation creates dangerous echo-chamber economics, where each player's investment props up the next without clear evidence of end-user ROI. Microsoft invests in OpenAI, which buys Nvidia chips, which Microsoft cites as proof of AI demand.
Meanwhile, enterprises experimenting with AI report mixed results. Many pilot projects fail to scale, costs exceed budgets, and productivity gains prove elusive. If customers can't monetize AI, they won't keep buying $40,000 GPUs indefinitely.
Competition looms larger than investors acknowledge. Advanced Micro Devices gains ground with MI300 chips. Broadcom dominates custom silicon for hyperscalers. Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms accelerate in-house chip development. Even Intel's Gaudi processors show promise in this regard.
Nvidia's moat remains formidable, but 90% market share only moves in one direction from here -- down.
Beyond the data center hype
The bear case often stops at today's AI boom, but that misses Nvidia's bigger play. This isn't a one-trick company riding a temporary surge -- it has built hedges that extend its dominance into the next era of computing.
Take quantum computing research. The world's leading labs lean on Nvidia's CUDA platform and DGX systems to simulate quantum algorithms long before the hardware exists. In robotics, everything from warehouse automation to autonomous vehicles already depends on Nvidia's edge-computing solutions. And in industrial automation -- whether it's drug discovery, climate modeling, or materials science -- the workloads demand accelerated computing that only Nvidia can deliver at scale.
So when AI training demand eventually cools, Nvidia won't be left scrambling. Inference workloads alone could rival today's training revenue, and robotics or scientific computing could add entirely new legs of growth. At $4.3 trillion, the market may be pricing in perfection, but the company's portfolio hints at multiple acts still to come.
The October verdict
Nvidia's stock offers no easy answers heading into October. Bulls see unstoppable AI adoption, 72% margins, and a stranglehold on data center compute. Bears point to bubble-level valuations across the AI landscape, shaky ROI for AI investments to date, and rivals eager to chip away at Nvidia's dominance. Both sides have valid arguments.
For traders, the setup looks risky after a 56% six-month run -- even a small miss on Blackwell shipments or hyperscaler demand could spark a 20% to 30% pullback. For long-term investors, Nvidia remains the definitive picks-and-shovels play on the future of computing, with exposure not just to AI but also quantum, robotics, and industrial automation."

Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge was recently asked about Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) stock gains following its earnings report and forecasts. Here is what the analyst said:
“There was an article on the Information about OpenAI spending about $450 billion over the next five years on compute. Remember that was the huge part of the RPO boost at Oracle. A lot of that was driven by OpenAI. So that’s another positive suggesting that the biggest, most prominent player in the industry continues to spend a lot of money. XAI, there were a lot of articles about them raising money at a $200 billion valuation. And then right before the close, there was a report on Bloomberg about how Oracle could be striking a deal with Meta for a $20 billion AI compute contract. So the headline and news flow around AI just remains extremely bullish and Oracle really has risen to become one of the most prominent names in the industry and that continues to drive the shares higher.”
Why are some analysts reluctant about the Oracle-OpenAI deal? OpenAI is expected to burn about $115 billion over the next four years and is not projected to be profitable until 2030. Even after Nvidia’s latest $100 billion investment by Nvidia, OpenAI will likely need to raise over $200 billion in total funding to cover its commitments. Some analysts believe Oracle may need to borrow tens of billions to build enough data centers for the deal. ORCL is up 70% so far this year, and its P/E (TTM) is about 80% higher than the sector median of 24.4, according to data from SeekingAlpha.
Loomis Sayles Growth Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is a leader in the enterprise software market with a strong market position in database, infrastructure and application software, and cloud-based software and services. We believe the company’s competitive advantages include its large and experienced direct sales force, a founder-driven management team that reinvests relentlessly to maintain a leading intellectual property (IP) portfolio and differentiated product suite, and a large installed base of clients with high switching costs where it consistently achieves renewal and retention rates in the mid-90% range. We believe Oracle is well positioned to benefit from the continuing growth in data storage and enterprise application software, as well as the shift to cloud-based solutions."

It also plans to put $100 billion over several years into OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.
If that sounds a bit crazy, it's not. Lots of public companies own stakes in other businesses. And, in fact, Nvidia already holds significant stakes in six other tech companies:
- CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%), an AI cloud-computing infrastructure provider.
- Arm Holdings (ARM 1.33%), a British semiconductor and software design specialist.
- Applied Digital (APLD 7.83%), a maker and operator of data centers.
- Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%), a Dutch company that provides AI infrastructure and platforms.
- Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX 15.28%), a clinical-stage biotech that is employing AI in its efforts to discover effective new drugs.
- WeRide (WRD 4.24%), a Chinese autonomous vehicle company.
Let's take a closer look at these investments. (Note: These were Nvidia's stakes as of June 30, 2025, based on its most recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)
CoreWeave: Nvidia owns about 24.3 million shares of the company. At the current share price, that stake is worth about $3 billion. CoreWeave, based in Livingston, N.J., purchases large quantities of Nvidia's GPU and installs them in servers, then leases time on those servers to its customers. This month, CoreWeave and Nvidia announced a new agreement under which the chip giant will purchase any excess CoreWeave cloud capacity not leased to other customers. CoreWeave stock is up 247% year to date.
Arm Holdings: Nvidia owns about 1.1 million shares of the British chip and software design company, worth a total of about $152 million. In fact, it attempted to acquire Arm in 2020, but the deal was blocked by regulators. The stock is up 10% this year and 147% over the past five years. The recent Nvidia-Intel deal could be interpreted as a bit of a blow for Arm, as Intel does some of the same things as Arm.
Applied Digital: Nvidia owns about 7.7 million shares of the data center operator, worth about $169 million. Of course, Applied Digital uses Nvidia chips in its servers. The stock is up 187% year to date.
Nebius Group: Nvidia's stake of about 1.2 million shares is worth about $134 million. The price of the stock is up more than 300% in 2025.
Recursion Pharmaceuticals: Nvidia bought a 7.7 million share, $50 million stake in the biotech in July 2023, but the share price has declined since then, making Recursion one of the chip giant's rare losers. It's down 31% year to date, leaving the value of the stake at about $36 million. Biotech companies, particularly those in the clinical stage, are highly speculative investments.
WeRide: Nvidia owns about 1.7 million shares of the robotaxi company, worth a total of about $19 million at the moment. WeRide shares spiked in February after Nvidia disclosed its stake in the company, but have since fallen back to earth. They're now down by about 20% this year.
Nvidia's core AI investments -- data centers, AI infrastructure and server providers, chip designers -- appear to be doing extremely well. And Intel's share price has soared by 33% since the Sept. 18 announcement that Nvidia is investing in the legacy semiconductor maker.
By contrast, Nvidia's more speculative -- and generally smaller -- investments in biotech and autonomous vehicles have not yet panned out. Of course, when your market cap is $4.3 trillion, paper losses of those sizes are not even rounding errors on your balance sheet. And eventually, they may become profitable investments.
But just the fact that Nvidia has bought stakes in these companies -- and so presumably has a vested interest in helping them to succeed -- makes all of their stocks worth looking into."

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
In December last year, Joseph Moore, Morgan Stanley semiconductor analyst, commented on the volatility NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) was going through at the time and said the stock would have a strong second half of 2025. The analyst’s call turned out to be correct. Here is what he said at the time:
“I still think when you think about 2025 and AI the story is Blackwell, the product cycle that Nvidia has. I think they’re going to have a huge second half of the year and I think we do have these transitional issues as we’re moving there but I think the stock is very attractive this level. I’m not going to say absolute bottom because it’s volatile but you know it’s very attractive at this level. I think you’re trading at a much lower multiple than some of the AI peers and I really believe that they actually gain share versus custom silicon in 2025. I’m very excited for this custom silicon trend but I still think Nvidia can gain share relative to that in 2025.”
NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are up 28% so far this year.
Nvidia’s latest deal with OpenAI and Intel, along with Oracle’s partnership with OpenAI are showing signs that companies are continuing to spend a fortune on compute, and AI demand won’t slow down anytime soon. But can NVDA shares keep gaining?
Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Nvidia recently impressed the market by signing an AI infrastructure deal with Intel. Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel. Jensen Huang said the deal would open up $50B in TAM for both companies in the data center and PC business.
Macquarie Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) performed strongly in the quarter on renewed AI optimism and reduced concern that an individual customer or two will moderate capital expenditures. Though the Fund’s weight was among our largest positions at over 4.5% during the quarter, the relative underweight (the benchmark weight averaged 6.3%) negatively affected relative returns.”"

A simplified version that enables younger students to adjust with basic parameters and understand performance impacts will be demonstrated at the Aramco STEM Racing World Finals September 27-October 2
SUNNYVALE, Calif., Sept. 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNPS) unveiled a digital twin racetrack experience featuring Discovery accelerated by NVIDIA Omniverse libraries at the Aramco STEM Racing World Finals in Singapore. As the exclusive global CFD simulation partner for STEM Racing, Synopsys offers over 400,000 students across the globe complimentary access to advanced simulation software — the same tools leveraged by professional F1 teams — educational resources, and technical support. STEM Racing features middle and high school student teams across 65 countries competing to design and race miniature F1 cars.
The new setup links their race car, refined in Discovery, with a digital twin of the racetrack and Omniverse libraries. Using Discovery, teams can explore advanced aerodynamics concepts and learn how to interpret CFD behavior. Then, they can import this data to Omniverse to visualize the air flow in real-time, enabling deeper understanding of complex STEM topics.
At the STEM Racing World Finals, students can interact with a simplified version of the workflow, where they can easily modify key features of the car, like swapping pre-made parts to test various spoiler designs. This hands-on method helps them explore how design decisions impact performance, fostering creativity and innovation through direct experimentation.
Before each major race in the 2025–2026 STEM Racing season, demo days will provide students with access to the more advanced workflow. Teams can upload their custom car designs to Omniverse and use Discovery for CFD analysis — gaining predictive insights into physical performance to refine their virtual models.
""Synopsys' specialized simulation & analysis tools have already transformed the way our student teams approach STEM learning,"" said Andrew Denford, founder and chairman at STEM Racing. ""And this new virtual STEM Racing track will enhance that experience even more. Enabling students to explore complex concepts such as aerodynamic drag and iterative design in an immersive and engaging environment will strengthen their practical engineering skills — not only will this deliver real performance gains on the physical racetrack, but it will also prepare them for success in advanced degree programs and future STEM careers."""

While it's tempting to buy individual AI stocks like Nvidia, perhaps the better strategy for many investors is to invest in the trend through a growth-oriented exchange-traded fund (ETF), especially if you're just starting out.
Growth ETFs can give you a collection of the companies at the center of AI innovation. This lets you ride the wave without having to pick individual winners. Even if you have $1,000 or less to put to work, I'd recommend ETFs over individual stocks, as they give you an instant portfolio.
However, starting with $1,000 and just letting it sit is not going to build wealth. The key is to consistently invest through dollar-cost averaging and let compounding do its magic. Since ETFs are portfolios of stocks, they are a much easier way to implement this strategy.
Let's look at four growth ETFs that you can start investing in now.
Invesco QQQ Trust
The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 0.71%) has been one of the most reliable ways to invest in growth stocks over the past decade. It tracks the Nasdaq-100 index, which consists of the 100 largest Nasdaq-listed non-financial companies. The Nasdaq has always been tech-heavy, which means you're getting a portfolio of top growth stocks.
The ETF has given investors a 19.4% average annual return over the past 10 years, which easily surpasses the return of the S&P 500. Even more impressive is that it's beaten the S&P 500 on a 12-month rolling basis nearly 90% of the time during this stretch.
Vanguard Growth ETF
The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG 0.45%) is another great option. It's built around the growth side of the S&P 500, which also gives you a heavy dose of tech stocks.
Many of the companies at the forefront of AI make up its top holding. In fact, Nvidia (12.3%), Microsoft (11.5%), Apple (10.5%), Alphabet (6.6%), Amazon (6.5%), Broadcom (4.4%), and Meta Platforms (4.4%) account for more than 55% of its portfolio. The ETF has been a strong performer over the years, generating a 17.1% yearly return over the past 10 years.
Vanguard Information Technology ETF
If you want to strip away everything else and just own tech stocks, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT 0.77%) could be right for you. While it's still an index fund, the ETF is unapologetically concentrated in technology stocks. Its top three holdings of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple make up about 44% of its holdings.
That concentration has led the ETF to generate a 22.4% average annual return over the past 10 years. One downside of the fund is that it does not include some top AI names, including Amazon and Alphabet, nor does it have any international AI beneficiaries. That said, its return has been tough to beat.
Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF
For those who want a pure-play AI angle, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ 1.36%) is one of the best ways to go. Unlike broader growth ETFs, this one was built specifically to capture the AI theme. It owns nearly 90 stocks across semiconductors, software, and other sectors where AI adoption is accelerating.
About 69% of its portfolio is in U.S. stocks, so it's also giving you exposure to top international AI companies. This includes its top holding, Alibaba Group Holding, as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The ETF is also not as concentrated as the ones listed above.
Since launching in 2018, the ETF has delivered a 16.6% average annual return. However, it's been performing better more recently, with a three-year average annual return of 28.3%. The fund's expense ratio is a bit high at 0.68%, but what you get is exposure that cuts across industries and geographies, since AI's effect is not limited to U.S. mega-caps."

SMCI is capitalizing on this trend by being the first to ship next-generation AI systems, such as the NVIDIA B300 and GB300. SMCI has also expanded its Data Center offerings with the introduction of Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS), which is a modular architecture designed for speedier deployment of AI data center buildouts.
SMCI has also introduced DLC-2, which lowers power and water consumption by up to 40%, operates at significantly reduced noise levels of approximately 50 decibels, and reduces the total cost of ownership by 20%.
Furthermore, SMCI has launched more than 30 new solutions optimized for the latest NVIDIA and AMD architectures. SMCI is well-positioned to benefit from strategic partnerships to build hyperscale AI campuses globally, along with the expectation that more than 30% of global new data center deployments will adopt liquid cooling solutions in the next 12 months.
On the execution front, SMCI is scaling its global manufacturing capacity to meet demand, with a third Silicon Valley campus underway, expansion in Taiwan and the Netherlands, and a new facility in Mexico. SMCI’s 2026 and 2027 revenues are expected to grow at 48% and 15%, respectively, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
How Competitors Fare Against SMCI
Super Micro Computer’s next-generation products face intense competition from Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE and Dell Technologies DELL, which provide solutions like liquid cooling and advanced AI servers.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered the AI infrastructure space with a modular, performance-optimized data center solution that offers AI and high-performance computing features and supports its Private Cloud AI. This offers liquid-cooled HPC and AI servers through its HPE Cray and Apollo systems.
Dell offers liquid cooling architectures through its Apex and PowerEdge platforms. Dell has designed its AI server solutions to be custom and modular by adding both air and liquid cooling features with 24-hour rack deployment turnaround and end-to-end deployment services. These key differentiators make its server easy to deploy, hence encouraging smoother adoption.
SMCI’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates
Shares of SMCI have gained 50.4% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry’s growth of 36.5%."

It's time now for today's trending tickers. Well, let's start with CoreWeave. After a 200% rally this year following its IPO, the Gen AI cloud platform had some setbacks last week, as you can tell from this chart. But it's trending higher again this morning. Around up two and a half percent up in the pre-market actually. Now, the impressive lineup of now down just under 2% actually now. Now, the impressive lineup of partners, think Alphabet, Cloudfare, Cloudflare and of course Nvidia, keeps powering CoreWeave's rise along with strong revenue growth and positive indicators.
Okay, let's now move on to the farmer sector, which has been in the news in recent days with new tariffs and rules. Well, today, AstraZeneca is gaining some value after announcing plans to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, AstraZeneca said it would be maintaining its status as a UK listed and headquartered company, but it's hoping to attract a broader base of investors via a New York listing.
Two more stocks to know about. GSK is up as it announced a new CEO, Luke Miels. He'll replace Emma Walmsley in January. And UCB SA, it's a very big European company you may never have heard of. It's flying this morning after it presented presented positive trial results for several of its drugs.
Finally, let's move on to electric vehicles and China's BYD, that's Tesla's main competitor in the EV space. Well, it's rallied today in Hong Kong after it reported that it expects to export up to 1 million vehicles. That's roughly 20% of its total sales in 2025. It's good news for the EV maker even as it lowered its overall sales targets.
And in the United States as well, the EV industry is in the spotlight. As you may have heard, a $7,500 tax credit is set to end tomorrow, September 30th. Some EV shoppers race to buy their vehicles this weekend. But the Tesla stock, well, it seems a bit unscathed this morning. Kevin Roberts from CarGurus, well he spoke to my colleague, Josh Lipton.
I can say from our data, you can see that the sales rate has picked up. and then not only that, the amount of, you know, the number of EVs on dealer lots has been declining and the market day supply has dropped quite significantly. Uh from where we were, you know, at the end of June, 108 days supply, and now we're under 45 days supply. So, the message is clearly getting out to consumers and they're looking to kind of snap up those EVs before that credit expires.
So that bottom line, Kevin. So, you know, now let's let's look ahead. So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball. What what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin? What what would you expect to see?
So, it's it's unknown. I I've been taking a look at what happened in other markets where tax credits expired. And if you look to Europe, you know, you saw double digit declines, uh of EV sales afterwards. Uh California is one we've been watching. They accounted for about 30% of EV sales last year. And there had been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit. So a large EV market that we could be seeing uh a drop in sales volume in.
Are there certain EV names, Kevin, EV makers that in your opinion, hey, these guys, they they may be better positioned than others in a sort of a post tax credit world.
So, normally I would have assumed that automakers might be looking to plug the gap themselves, but we're in a post-tariff environment and that tariff tax bill they're currently consuming mostly themselves right now. So I don't know how much automakers are going to be able to really kind of foot the bill uh as those EV tax credits go away.
And Kevin, by the way, what what does the the used market for EVs look like? Do you have line of sight there?
Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit. It's for vehicles under $25,000. So we've been seeing an acceleration in that market as well. Not as much as what we've been seeing in the new vehicle market, but there has been an uptick uh in that used EV market and we've been seeing a lot more used EVs particularly get under that $25,000 threshold. And so it's a small but growing market."

However, even after an incredible run, you would have made a ton of money even if you invested in Nvidia slightly late. For example, Nvidia's stock was up over 800% from the start of 2023 through 2024. Most people threw in the towel at the start of this year and said that they missed the move and ignored the stock. However, Nvidia has had another strong year and is up another 33% so far.
I think there's still plenty of room for Nvidia's stock to run over the next five years, and just because you missed the initial big movement doesn't mean you have to miss out on the next leg up. Nvidia's stock price could hit jaw-dropping levels by 2030, and projections from Nvidia's management back it up.
Nvidia expects increased AI spending over the next few years
Nvidia has been the king of the artificial intelligence investment trend because of its graphics processing units (GPUs). The computing devices are the muscle behind practically every generative AI model. GPUs have a unique ability to process multiple calculations in parallel. This effect is amplified when thousands of GPUs are connected in clusters.
Nvidia's GPUs aren't cheap, either. When you hear about a data center being outfitted with hundreds of thousands of GPUs, Nvidia is getting a massive chunk of the total cost. Management estimates that for a gigawatt AI factory, it captures around 50% of that spend. That likely doesn't include other costs like land and building infrastructure, but it's still an impressive revenue share.
Many of the AI hyperscalers already informed investors of their 2026 capital expenditure plans, and most forecast that they will spend a record-breaking amount on AI data centers after spending a record-breaking amount in 2025. Nvidia expects this trend to continue, as it believes that global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. With the AI hyperscalers spending an estimated $600 billion this year, this bodes well for Nvidia's stock.
But what kind of returns can investors expect?
Nvidia's stock has plenty of room to run if management is correct
If AI hyperscalers are spending $600 billion this year and Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to generate around $206 billion in revenue, Nvidia gets around a third of all data center capital expenditures. However, with rising competition from companies like Broadcom that are partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to create a custom AI accelerator chip, some of Nvidia's market share may fall. Additionally, a large part of the $3 trillion to $4 trillion market opportunity is in China, where Nvidia's chips cannot be sold currently because its export license hasn't been granted. Even if it does get approval, there's no guarantee that China will be buying them at the same level they previously did.
As a result, I think it's better to model Nvidia getting 20% of total capital expenditures. If I'm wrong, it will likely be to the upside, which will result in even greater gains. If Nvidia can capture 20% of $3 trillion in spending by 2030, that would indicate $600 billion in revenue. If we assume Nvidia can maintain its 50% profit margin and achieve a price-to-earnings valuation of 30 times earnings, that would price the stock at a market cap of $9 trillion.
With Nvidia's stock price sitting at $178 at a $4.3 trillion valuation, that would indicate Nvidia's stock price will reach $370 by 2030 -- an upside of over 100%. Considering that the market typically doubles once every seven years, this would be a market-beating growth rate.
Furthermore, this is a very conservative estimate if Nvidia's management's market projection turns out to be correct. As a result, I think Nvidia is a top stock to buy now, as the AI computing power buildout cycle is far from over."

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-29T09:00:00,3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now,AI hyperscalers are still building their computing capacity.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6dbbb95bd0ef39b10ad4f9d3d48d847ef7641590e051e8dddc12ed7510a5153e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/3-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-buy-rig/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/3-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-buy-rig/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/3-top-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-to-buy-rig/,fool.com,200,,"Although artificial intelligence (AI) investing gets a ton of attention from the market, there's a good reason for that. It's where the majority of cash flows are being poured into, and following the money to where it's being spent is a genius investing strategy.
Right now, most of the AI hyperscalers are still building their computing capacity, making companies that sell this equipment into great investments. I believe stocks like Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.22%), and Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) are among the best buys now, as they receive a boatload of this spending.
1. Nvidia
Nvidia has topped the list of best AI companies to invest in since the trend began in early 2023. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the computing muscle behind most of the AI technology people experience today, and show no signs of slowing down. Nvidia's management projects that the AI hyperscalers will spend $600 billion on capital expenditures for AI data centers this year, but that figure could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion globally by 2030. Nvidia captures a sizable chunk of that spending, as Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to generate around $206 billion in revenue this year.
Time will tell if Nvidia can capture a large chunk of that projected spending, and a lot of it will hinge on whether its products are accepted back in China once the U.S. government grants Nvidia's export license. However, I think that Nvidia still has the world's best technology for general-purpose computing, making its products a no-brainer choice when building artificial intelligence computing capacity.
Nvidia remains a top stock pick in the AI realm, even if it has been a massive success over the past few years.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor
Nvidia is what's known as a fabless chip company. It designs the products, but relies on other companies to manufacture the components that go into them. One of the most important companies in this setup is the chip foundry, which produces the microchips in the devices. Nvidia uses Taiwan Semiconductor for this work, and TSMC has made a name for itself in the industry by providing best-in-class technology and production yields.
Nearly all leading tech companies use TSMC's chips. Often, two competitors both use chips produced by TSMC, such as Nvidia and AMD (AMD 9.36%). Because Taiwan Semiconductor is acting as a neutral party fabrication facility, this arrangement works great and allows it to capitalize on massive technology trends.
An investment in Taiwan Semiconductor is a bet that companies are going to use more advanced chips, and a greater quantity of them, in the future. I think that's a very safe assumption, making TSMC a great stock to buy now.
3. Broadcom
Broadcom is challenging Nvidia's dominance in the AI computing market by partnering with AI hyperscalers to design custom AI accelerator chips.
Nvidia GPUs are the undisputed leader of multi-purpose computing, and can handle many types of workloads, whether it's AI training, cryptocurrency mining, or engineering simulations. However, if a client only uses an Nvidia GPU for one workload, these capabilities are wasted. By designing an AI chip with one workload in mind, Broadcom can achieve greater performance at a cheaper price.
This makes Broadcom's custom AI accelerators a potentially massive business, and it's starting to show up in the company's results. In third-quarter fiscal year 2025 (ended Aug. 3), Broadcom's AI revenue soared 63% year over year, outpacing Nvidia's 56% growth rate.
This shows that Broadcom is gaining market share in this area, and it could be a force to reckon with over the next five years. I think Broadcom will be a great investment over the next few years as a result, and investors should consider scooping up shares alongside Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor."

AstraZeneca (AZN.L)
On the London market, shares in AstraZeneca (AZN.L) advanced 1.6% after the pharmaceuticals company announced plans to directly list shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The company said on Monday that it was recommending to shareholders that it replace its New York listing of ADRs – giving US investors exposure to a foreign company – with a direct listing of ordinary shares.
AstraZeneca said it would be maintaining its status as a UK-listed and headquartered company, as well as keeping shares listed in Stockholm.

Lale Akoner, global market analyst at eToro, said: ""The move is aimed to attract a wider base of investors as Astra pursues strong growth over the next decade. By broadening its investor reach in the US, Astra is looking to secure the capital and visibility needed to fund its next wave of medicines and hit its long-term sales targets.
""Importantly, this dual listing isn’t about shifting away from London but securing a truly global platform. Backed by a blockbuster cancer portfolio and a pipeline of promising new treatments, we think AstraZeneca is well positioned for steady earnings growth.
""With sights set on reaching $80bn in sales by 2030, the US listing strengthens its ability to deliver for both patients and shareholders.”
GSK (GSK.L)
Another UK-listed pharma stock in focus on Monday morning was GSK (GSK.L), with shares rising 3.6% to the top of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE), after announcing a new CEO.
GSK said current CEO Emma Walmsley would be replaced by Luke Miels, who would assume full responsibilities of the role on 1 January."

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-29T07:51:00,Nvidia Received a Rare Price Target Cut From a Wall Street Analyst -- but the Reasoning Behind the Cut Misses the Biggest Threat Facing This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Darling,Analysts continue to overlook the biggest threat to Nvidia's top competitive advantage.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ed22d50de9d8fc57245938b3f47acb4119512fe76af54cd89758e66cbb869924,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/nvidia-rare-price-target-cut-wall-street-analyst/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/nvidia-rare-price-target-cut-wall-street-analyst/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/nvidia-rare-price-target-cut-wall-street-analyst/,fool.com,200,,"For the better part of the last three years, the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) is all Wall Street and everyday investors have cared about. But there's a good reason for that.
Empowering software and systems with the capacity to make split-second decisions and become more efficient at their assigned tasks is a game-changing technology that the analysts at PwC foresee boosting global gross domestic product $15.7 trillion by 2030. Even if PwC is only somewhat in the ballpark with its estimate, it would lead to dozens or hundreds of public companies being enormous winners of the AI revolution.
But it's no secret that Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has been Wall Street's AI darling and shining star. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the brains powering decision-making, generative AI solutions, and large language model (LLM) training in AI-accelerated data centers. With demand for AI-GPUs overwhelming their supply by a considerable amount, Nvidia has enjoyed exceptional pricing power for its Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra GPUs.
Nvidia's strengthening foundation has also been propped up by its CUDA software platform. This is the toolkit developers use to maximize the compute capabilities of their Nvidia hardware, as well as to build and train LLMs. Think of CUDA as the hook that keeps buyers of Hopper, Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra chips loyal to Nvidia's ecosystem of products and services.
Yet in spite of these competitive edges and Nvidia's knack for trouncing Wall Street's sales and profit expectations, one Wall Street analyst recently reduced his and firm's price target on Wall Street's most-beloved AI stock.
One Wall Street analyst is tempering expectations
Almost every one of the 63 analysts covering Nvidia in September have a positive view of the company and its stock. A combined 58 analysts rate it as some form of strong buy or buy equivalent, compared to four holds/market performs and one sell rating.
Citigroup analyst Atif Malik falls into the majority. He and his firm hold a buy rating on Nvidia stock and expect robust growth in AI-GPUs going forward. But he's not quite as bullish as he used to be.
Not long after Nvidia lifted the hood on its fiscal second-quarter operating results, Malik took the road less traveled on Wall Street and reduced his firm's price target for Nvidia by $10 per share to $200 from $210. On a percentage basis, this isn't a groundbreaking change. But in terms of market cap, a $10-per-share reduction in price target equates to nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars!
Malik's ""why?"" is simple: competition.
In the note he released on behalf of Citi, Malik pointed to the rise of custom chips as a potential threat to Nvidia's, thus far, monopoly like hold of AI hardware being used in high-compute enterprise data centers. He specifically pointed to a relatively new member of the trillion-dollar club, AI-networking specialist Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), as the catalyst for this price target cut.
When Broadcom delivered its quarterly operating results, it revealed a $10 billion order from an unnamed customer (speculated to be privately held OpenAI by some Wall Street analysts) for its next-generation custom accelerating chips known as XPUs. Malik anticipates that XPUs will enjoy 53% growth in 2026 compared to the current year, while AI-GPU growth will ""slow"" to 34% next year.
While the latter is still a highly impressive figure, Malik believes Broadcom and other companies may begin to chip away (pun fully intended) at Nvidia's dominance and slow its growth potential -- thus the need to temper expectations.
Right risk, wrong threat
While some on Wall Street, like Atif Malik, speculate about businesses shifting their infrastructure workloads to custom chips, I'd argue the greatest threat to Nvidia's biggest competitive advantage can be found within.
While no external competitor has come close to rivaling the compute capabilities of Nvidia's hardware -- and CEO Jensen Huang plans to keep it this way with an aggressive innovation timeline -- the company's biggest competitive edge has always been scarcity.
Even with global No. 1 chip fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, the supply of AI-GPUs has come nowhere close to satiating demand.
The law of supply and demand in economics is pretty straightforward in this situation: the price of AI-GPUs will climb until demand tapers. Nvidia has had no trouble netting $40,000 or more for its chips, which has, in some instances, represented a 100% to 300% premium compared to the price rivals are selling their AI-GPUs.
The threat for Nvidia is that this AI-GPU scarcity is going to be torn away by its top customers, based on net sales. Many of these leading customers -- mostly members of the ""Magnificent Seven"" -- are internally developing AI-GPUs or solutions to use in their data centers. Though these chips aren't going to be sold externally, and they're no match for the compute potential of Hopper, Blackwell, or Blackwell Ultra, they do possess the advantage of being significantly cheaper than Nvidia's hardware and aren't backordered.
If members of the Mag-7 begin turning to their internally developed chips on a complementary basis, it means less available real estate for Nvidia's hardware to occupy. It also reduces the scarcity that's helped fuel Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin.
Furthermore, internally developed chips from Nvidia's top clients might delay upgrade cycles, especially if Huang's aggressive innovation cycle rapidly depreciates the value of prior-generation AI-GPUs.
While it's possible custom chipmakers like Broadcom steal some of the spotlight from Nvidia in the coming quarters, the biggest threat is likely to come from its own top customers by net sales."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-29T07:15:00,Buy and Hold: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Own Through 2035,These three players are well positioned to benefit amid the AI spending boom.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=c22f7a5dad08d7b95d97db10d8c6b843c05f57deb90bf48c89ca0c8ff67d48b7,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/buy-and-hold-3-ai-stocks-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/buy-and-hold-3-ai-stocks-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/29/buy-and-hold-3-ai-stocks-2030/,fool.com,200,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is going strong, meaning that even though AI stocks have soared in recent years, it's not too late to get in on this exciting theme. AI has the potential to streamline processes and boost efficiency at companies -- and usher in new game-changing innovations. All of this may significantly lift corporate earnings over time, and investors are eager to bet on the potential winners.
These days, the focus is on the infrastructure buildout. Companies and countries are rushing to impose their AI presence by constructing and expanding data centers -- in fact, Jensen Huang, chief of AI chip giant Nvidia, predicts AI infrastructure spending may surpass $4 trillion by the end of the decade. Let's check out three AI stocks that should benefit as this growth phase unfolds -- and make top investments to own through 2035.
1. CoreWeave
CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) offers AI customers something they greatly need: capacity for their AI workloads. The company has invested in an armada of more than 250,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) across 32 data centers and rents them out -- even on an hourly basis. CoreWeave, unlike big cloud service providers, designed its platform specifically for AI, and that's resulted in speed and efficiency.
Customers clearly like this offering as CoreWeave's revenue has soared in recent quarters. In the latest period, it tripled, and demand remains strong. On top of this, there's reason to be confident CoreWeave, the first to make Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and chip generally available to customers, will be able to continue delivering the top GPUs to customers right away -- Nvidia is an investor in CoreWeave, holding about 7% of the company, and the two work closely together.
CoreWeave shares have soared more than 200% since their March IPO, but this may be just the beginning for the AI-focused cloud company. That's why this stock is a great one to own as the need for AI training and inferencing continues.
2. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) is a networking specialist, selling top performing switches and routers that connect computer nodes during an AI task. But Broadcom's AI offerings don't stop there. The company also sells XPUs, or custom AI accelerators that are proving popular with big cloud service providers.
So, is Broadcom competing with Nvidia for chip orders? Not necessarily. While Nvidia's GPUs are all purpose, Broadcom has built itself a niche, offering chips that are excellent at doing specific jobs. This means customers may use both Nvidia and Broadcom chips, and in a different manner, to fuel their AI platforms.
All of this has helped Broadcom's AI revenue advance quarter after quarter. In the recent period, the company said AI revenue climbed 63% to $5.2 billion -- and it's expecting AI revenue of $6.2 billion in the coming quarter. The momentum should continue amid the AI infrastructure buildout, as the need for chips and networking explodes higher, making Broadcom a smart long-term AI investment.
3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Everyone talks about chips from Nvidia, Broadcom, and others, but one particular company is essential for these products to make it to the market. And that's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%), the manufacturer of these AI leaders' chips.
Though Nvidia, for example, designs its chips, TSMC is the one to produce them at its factories in Taiwan and in the U.S. This allows the chip manufacturer to benefit from Nvidia's successes and demand for its latest innovations. But what's fantastic is TSMC also benefits from demand for chips from other companies too -- so it can score multiple wins year after year as the AI boom continues.
Gains in AI infrastructure spending should supercharge growth at the manufacturer as a key element in this buildout is the chip to power any AI platforms. So, TSMC, which has seen revenue explode higher in recent years, is likely to see more such gains.
TSM Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
That's why, right now, trading at 28x forward earnings estimates, TSMC looks like a fantastic stock to buy and hold until 2035 as AI infrastructure spending fuels growth."

On September 22, the company confirmed plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. In addition, the company is to supply the AI startup with data center chips as the two companies look to capitalize on the AI boom.
The $100 billion investment will give Nvidia a financial stake in the prominent AI company, which is already one of its biggest and most important customers. The investment will also provide the Microsoft-backed startup with the cash and access it needs to purchase advanced chips, which are necessary to strengthen its prospects in the burgeoning segment.
Nvidia is to start investing in OpenAI for non-voting shares once the deal closes. The two companies have also signed a letter of intent for the deployment of 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems.
“Everything starts with compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.”
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor giant that develops graphics processing units used in data centers, computers, and gaming consoles. It also creates high-performance hardware and software platforms, like its CUDA software ecosystem, to power Artificial Intelligence (AI), graphics, and other complex computational tasks.

AMD’s trailing and forward P/E were 95.68 and 26.88 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) presents a compelling 12–18 month investment opportunity, targeting 12–18% base case returns ($168–$177) and 20–25% upside ($180–$187) if Nvidia’s execution issues persist. While markets focus on AMD’s CPU gains, the company’s transformation into a diversified GPU powerhouse is underappreciated, particularly as Nvidia faces unprecedented reliability problems.
AMD’s Q2 2025 results were strong, with 32% year-over-year revenue growth to $7.7 billion, driven by gaming revenue up 73% to $1.1 billion and data center revenue up 14% to $3.2 billion, signaling successful GPU diversification. Near-term margin pressure arose from export controls on MI308 accelerators, resulting in an $800 million inventory charge, but Wall Street forecasts support a 15–20% EPS CAGR through 2027.
Nvidia’s structural GPU reliability failures, including melted RTX 4090 connectors and boot issues with the RTX 5090/5080 series, create a rare competitive window, positioning AMD as a stable alternative. The RX 9070 XT demonstrates strong 1440p performance and improved power efficiency, while AMD’s open-source ROCm platform strengthens its data center positioning, despite export restrictions limiting near-term revenue. CPUs continue to provide stability, contributing roughly 50% of revenue and anchoring growth in consumer and enterprise markets.
AMD’s potential market share gains in the $120 billion discrete GPU segment could generate $3.6–$6 billion in incremental revenue, though Nvidia’s ecosystem dominance and limited RDNA 4 portfolio constrain high-end capture. Macro risks, including Fed rate hikes or AI capex slowdown, could pressure valuations. Nonetheless, AMD’s diversified revenue streams, competitive GPUs, and proven data center scale support multiple expansion. Key risks include Nvidia’s rapid fixes, export control tightening, and semiconductor cyclicality. Overall, AMD offers a strong risk/reward profile, with Nvidia’s vulnerabilities and AMD’s execution creating meaningful upside potential.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) by StockOpine in May 2025, which highlighted strong Q1 revenue growth driven by Data Center and Ryzen processor sales, AI demand, and EPYC market share gains. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately 39% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as AMD’s diversified CPU and GPU business supports growth. Phaetrix shares a similar view but emphasizes Nvidia’s execution issues and AMD’s opportunity to gain GPU market share."

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-28T22:36:00,Prediction: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia and Palantir Combined by 2030,Alphabet could become the largest company in the world in the next five years.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=279da7915e2c30b20fb2e2bdfc1b642815f9fa249b9ab4d3d3504ebf9f6ac98a,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/prediction-1-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-will/,fool.com,200,,"Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%) has become one of the world's most important artificial intelligence (AI) companies. What investors initially saw as a big potential risk has instead turned into a big tailwind.
And while Nvidia and Palantir Technologies get plenty of the hype these days, Alphabet has the opportunity to be worth more than both of them combined before the decade is out.
Nvidia currently sits at a $4.3 trillion market cap, while Palantir is around $425 billion. Alphabet is valued at roughly $3 trillion, but it has a real chance to grow significantly from here, while the other two face some risks.
Alphabet's opportunities
Alphabet's opportunities start with search and AI, which in some cases are melding into one. The company already owns the front door to the internet for billions of people, and most users don't even think about it because Google is just the default engine on most devices.
Its ownership of the Chrome web browser and Android operating system, together with its revenue-sharing agreement with Apple, gives it a huge distribution advantage.
AI, meanwhile, is not replacing search; it's enhancing it and complementing it. Alphabet says its AI Overviews are now being used by more than 2 billion people a month, and its new AI Mode, which is now just being rolled out globally, allows users to toggle between traditional results and chatbot-style answers without switching apps.
It has also added multimodal AI features like Lens and Circle to search. These are just leading to more queries, often with a commercial intent from shoppers, which feeds into its massive ad network.
This kind of seamless integration means the company doesn't need to rewire consumer habits the way competitors do; it only needs to make the products that people already use more useful. The fact that its Gemini app passed ChatGPT as the most downloaded app in the Apple App Store shows that the company is gaining real traction in AI on the consumer side.
Then there is Alphabet's biggest growth driver, its cloud computing business. The company is seeing both strong revenue growth and huge operating leverage as it scales up. This was seen last quarter when Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% and operating profit more than doubled.
What sets Alphabet apart in cloud computing is that it owns the full stack, from its world-class Gemini AI model to custom AI chips, to top-notch analytics and software, to one of the largest private fiber networks in the world. That vertical integration means better performance at lower costs. The company's pending acquisition of Wiz will also give it a huge opportunity to cross-sell leading cloud cybersecurity to its customers.
Investors should also remember Waymo, which could become one of its biggest growth drivers in the next five years. Robotaxis have been hyped for years, and with Waymo, Alphabet is currently building out a large fleet across the U.S.
It has a first-mover advantage with commercial services running in several major U.S. cities, while being tested in others. If autonomous driving takes off in the next five years, Waymo could become another huge business.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's stock is one of the cheapest among megacaps, at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of less than 23 times 2026 analyst estimates. Between its growth opportunities and the potential for multiple expansion, the shares could have a lot of upside in the next five years.
Palantir and Nvidia face risks
Now contrast that with Palantir. It has been executing well, with its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in high demand from U.S. commercial customers, while it is continuing to win big government contracts.
However, the stock's valuation is at nosebleed levels. With a forward price-to-sales multiple (P/S) of more than 100, the stock would still be expensive even if it that figure were cut in half. This is a valuation that leaves no margin for error; one slipup on growth, and the stock will get punished.
And then there is Nvidia. Undoubtedly, it has been the biggest winner in the AI boom, but investors should not forget it is still a hardware company. Hardware sales are not recurring revenue, since every chip sold has to be replaced by the next cycle of spending, and once customers find a cheaper or more efficient solution, the shift can happen fast.
We've seen this happen before. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) were once the primary chips used in Bitcoin mining until ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that did the job faster and cheaper came along. Practically overnight, mining Bitcoin with GPUs became irrelevant.
While ASICs aren't likely to completely replace GPUs for AI workloads, they are a rising threat, especially as the market moves more toward inference, which is a continuous cost -- and hyperscalers (companies that own large data centers) are highly motivated to lower computing costs. With inference not nearly as technically demanding as training, Nvidia's CUDA software moat is not as wide in this area, and more and more large companies have started developing their own custom AI chips.
Nvidia knows this, which is why its recently-announced $100 billion OpenAI partnership looks more defensive than offensive. OpenAI is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, but it has also been developing its own chips. With this investment, Nvidia is effectively paying to keep OpenAI tied to its GPUs, which is a risky kind of circular financing that echoes what Cisco did during the internet bubble.
Nvidia's dominance in AI infrastructure today is unquestioned, but the upside in the stock could be limited if customers keep moving toward in-house AI chips.
Put it all together, and Alphabet looks like the company best positioned to become the largest in the world by 2030, with a good chance of being bigger than both Nvidia and Palantir combined."

Nvidia is helping OpenAI achieve its goal of building at least 10 gigawatts (GW) of data centers purpose-built for artificial intelligence (AI) by investing in data centers progressively as each GW is deployed.
The news is significant, considering OpenAI needs funding to fulfill its promise, and because it is currently structured as a nonprofit (although it plans to become a Public Benefit Corporation).
Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world and the largest of the ""Ten Titans"" -- which is the ""Magnificent Seven"" plus Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Oracle, and Netflix. The Ten Titans are highly influential -- making up nearly 40% of the S&P 500.
Here's why Nvidia continues to be a powerhouse in the age of AI, where it stands amid competition from Broadcom, and whether it's worth buying now.
Nvidia's deal with OpenAI
As I've mentioned in the past, Nvidia is a steelmaker at the dawn of the age of skyscrapers. Nvidia makes the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) -- as well as associated networking components and software. These systems play an integral role in the parallel processing of AI workloads that require massive amounts of computing power. As OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman said in the Sept. 22 press release:
Everything starts with compute. Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.
Nvidia's investment in OpenAI builds on its $5 billion purchase of Intel stock, announced on Sept. 18. Intel will design and manufacture customer data center and central processing units (CPUs) with Nvidia's NVLink technology, which increases communication speed between GPUs and CPUs.
Nvidia continues to push the bounds of AI computing power, and its results have been astounding, as its data center segment now makes up 88% of total revenue. Nvidia is growing earnings at a rapid pace with no signs of slowing down. But it isn't the only company that's driving the future of data center compute.
Broadcom's custom AI chips are the real deal
Broadcom's custom AI chips (XPUs) are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Unlike GPUs, which are all-purpose workhorses in the data center, Broadcom works with hyperscalers to build custom AI chips to suit their AI workflows.
The strategy is paying off, as Broadcom stock has outperformed Nvidia year-to-date -- hitting an all-time high and knocking on the door of a $2 trillion market cap.
Like Nvidia, which depends on a handful of customers, Broadcom's AI revenue is largely tied to the ramp-up in hyperscaler capital expenditures. Broadcom's AI revenue is expected to reach nearly $20 billion by the end of this fiscal year, compared to $3.8 billion two years ago. So although Broadcom is still magnitudes smaller than Nvidia in terms of AI revenue, it is challenging Nvidia's dominance.
Broadcom's AI chips, paired with its Jericho routers, Tomahawk switches, and other associated infrastructure, enable the connection of over 1 million XPU clusters across multiple data centers. At scale, Broadcom's custom chip economics improve dramatically because they are more energy efficient than general-purpose GPUs.
Nvidia and Broadcom can win together
Broadcom will likely play an increasingly important role in the data center, but it won't replace Nvidia. Rather, both companies will likely work together, with Broadcom specializing in task-specific functions and Nvidia leading in versatile compute for AI training, inference, and high-performance computing.
The latest flurry of announcements showcases how both companies are positioned to thrive. In its latest earnings report from early September, Broadcom announced a $10 billion custom AI chip customer -- which is likely OpenAI. But OpenAI is also closely collaborating with Nvidia, serving as the key driver of its path to 10 GW in datacenter capacity.
A hyperscaler like OpenAI may partner with Broadcom on custom AI chips for specific tasks, but these chips take a while to develop and are best for inference (handling the needs of existing AI models with fixed patterns). Whereas Nvidia's GPUs -- paired with its CUDA software system -- are a solution that works right now and is more flexible for variable and complex scenarios, like training models with new parameters.
OpenAI is also likely reducing its dependence on one chip supplier, similar to how it has expanded its cloud partnership beyond Microsoft to include Oracle in a blockbuster $300 billion deal. Spreading business across multiple vendors reduces OpenAI's supply chain risk.
Nvidia remains a top growth stock to buy now
Nvidia remains the gold standard in the data center. It can thrive alongside Broadcom, so investors shouldn't view the two companies purely as competitors, but rather, as examples of the evolving anatomy of the modern AI data center.
At 39.7 times forward earnings, Nvidia is far from cheap, but it also isn't as expensive as it used to be. Especially given that it is still growing earnings at a rapid rate.
In fact, on a forward-earnings basis, Nvidia is cheaper than other Ten Titans stocks like Tesla, Broadcom, Netflix, and Oracle. And it's a much better buy for growth investors than a stock like Apple, which trades at 34.5 times forward earnings but is growing earnings far more slowly than Nvidia.
All told, Nvidia remains a foundational AI growth stock to buy now. Although investors may want to consider incorporating both Nvidia and Broadcom into their long-term AI portfolios."

1. Nvidia: 31,161% return over a decade
Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are considered the gold standard for training artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploying AI applications. As such, the company's revenue and earnings growth have exploded upward since the advent of generative AI about three years ago. Generative AI has greatly expanded the potential use cases for AI.
In its fiscal second quarter, Nvidia's revenue soared 56% year over year to $46.7 billion. Growth was driven by a 56% surge in AI-driven data center revenue to $41.1 billion, which was 88% of total revenue. The data center sells GPUs and other compute products, along with high-performance networking products. The gaming, professional visualization, and auto platforms grew revenue 49%, 32%, and 69%, respectively.
The quarter's adjusted net income jumped 52% to $25.8 billion, translating to a 54% leap in earnings per share (EPS) to $1.05. These fantastic results were achieved despite Nvidia not selling any H20 data center AI chips to China because the U.S. government's export controls spanned the entire quarter.
2. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): 9,225% return over a decade
AMD competes with Nvidia in the discrete GPU market. It trails Nvidia considerably in the AI-driven data center GPU market -- which it just entered a couple of years ago -- and trails Nvidia moderately in the gaming GPU market. Along with GPUs, AMD also makes central processing units (CPUs), with Intel being its major competitor.
In its second quarter, AMD's revenue grew 32% year over year to $7.69 billion. By segment, revenue growth was data center, 14% to $3.2 billion; client, 67% to $2.5 billion; gaming, 73% to $1.1 billion; and embedded, negative 4% to $824 million.
Data center growth was significantly hurt by AMD being unable to sell AI-enabling MI308 GPUs to China due to the U.S. export controls. For context, in the first quarter, data center revenue jumped 57% year over year.
Moreover, AMD's profit was also hurt by the export controls, as it took inventory and related charges of about $800 million. Its adjusted net income was $781 million, with EPS of $0.48, down 30% year over year.
The China situation and AMD's scaling up of its data center GPU business, which currently sports a lower profit margin than its more established overall business, will likely weigh on the company's earnings growth for some time. That said, with demand for GPUs so powerful and the wait for Nvidia's GPUs sometimes extended, AMD's longer-term picture looks bright.
3. Arista Networks: 3,489% return over a decade
Arista is a leader in cloud networking solutions for large data centers and enterprise campuses. Specifically, it sells hardware, including high-performance Ethernet switches and routers, and software for monitoring and control of the network. The rapid adoption of AI is boosting demand for Arista's products.
In the second quarter, Arista's revenue increased 30% year over year to $2.2 billion. Product revenue grew 32% to $1.9 billion, and software and service revenue rose 23% to $328 million. Adjusted net income jumped 37% to $923.5 million, translating to EPS rising 38% to $0.73.
4. Broadcom: 3,356% return over a decade
Broadcom makes semiconductors and infrastructure software. Its strong recent growth is being driven by robust demand for its products for AI data centers, including custom AI chips and Ethernet networking products, and its November 2024 acquisition of software maker VMware.
The custom AI chips are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for large tech companies that have designed their own AI chips. These are for internal use and, in some cases, for availability in their cloud computing services.
In its fiscal third quarter (ended Aug. 3), Broadcom's revenue grew 22% to $16.0 billion. AI-related revenue is growing like gangbusters. In the quarter, it grew 63% year over year to $5.2 billion, accounting for 33% of revenue. Adjusted net income surged 37% year over year to $8.4 billion, which translated to EPS rising 36% to $1.69.
5. Axon Enterprise: 2,906% return over a decade
Axon develops weapons and related technology products for the law enforcement, military, and consumer markets. The company makes Tasers, which are electroshock weapons that incapacitate the target; body-worn cameras; and other hardware and software products.
In the second quarter, Axon's revenue grew 33% year over year to $669 million, of which $292 million was recurring software and services revenue. Growth was driven by strong adoption of premium software and robust demand for Taser 10, Axon Body 4 body camera, and counter-drone equipment. Adjusted net income soared 83% year over year to $174 million, translating to EPS surging 74% to $2.12."

With a dividend ETF, you get all the benefits of a dividend stock -- including a regular payout -- but you also have the advantage of diversification.
Face it: Unless you are investing in a stock like Nvidia that's in the middle of an unprecedented run, it can be challenging to identify the best stocks that can offer long-term growth. And Nvidia's stingy payout of $0.01 per quarter isn't worth the time if you are seeking income.
Fortunately, there are quite a few dividend ETFs on the market, but in my eyes, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD -0.34%) is the best of the bunch for 2025.
About the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF
This ETF is offered by Charles Schwab Asset Management, one of the leading financial firms on Wall Street. The ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which includes stocks that have a track record of consistent payouts. Stocks in the fund are also carefully screened for superior fundamentals compared to their peers.
The SCHD ETF is a passively-managed fund, which keeps the expense ratio at a low 0.06%, or $6 in annual fees per $10,000 invested, far below what you'd find in an actively-managed fund. It has $71 billion in total net assets.
Top holdings of the ETF represent dividend-friendly sectors such as healthcare, consumer, industrial, and energy stocks.

One thing to know about investing in a dividend ETF: While the payout schedule is consistent, the amount that you'll get may not be. Dividend ETFs collect dividends from the stocks of companies they hold and then pass them on to ETF shareholders on a regular basis. Because the companies have different schedules for their dividend payouts, the ETF's distributions will vary each quarter.
Why the SCHD ETF works for dividend investors in 2025
The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is one of the biggest and best-known dividend ETFs in the market. What you may not realize is that it also provides one of the highest dividend yields you can find. Compared to other funds in its class, the SCHD ETF stands out as you can see below.
As shown above, the SCHD gives income investors both yield and quality. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF provides a yield more than a full percentage point lower. And compared to broader index funds, the Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF offers about a 2.1% yield, while the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust yields just 0.5%. For investors who are seeking income, the appeal of the Schwab ETF is clear.
The bottom line
If there's any concern regarding this ETF, it's a limited exposure to the technology sector. Tech has been the best-performing sector on Wall Street for years, and while the fund holds some decent tech names, many of the best-performing tech stocks don't offer a dividend that allows them to be included in its holdings.
Investors who prioritize dividend stocks would still do well to choose the SCHD ETF as part of their balanced portfolio. But if you also want to make sure you're tapping into major trends like artificial intelligence, it would be wise to also put some money into a tech ETF or a basket of top-performing tech stocks."

On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they’re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry’s building capacity to its limit.
Below, we’ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We’ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
Microsoft’s $1 billion investment in OpenAI
This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI — and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft’s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.
It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion — a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.
The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft’s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn’t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.
OpenAI’s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it’s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company’s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company’s GPUs."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-28T18:00:00,"Meet the Monster Quantum Computing Stock That Continues to Crush Nvidia, Oracle, and Palantir","While big tech companies have been the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, a new wave of momentum is emerging.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=92615c58ec72c972824aca1fa07c471e8ed2e8f935aef5429c4de2aeabf56ab6,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/meet-the-monster-quantum-computing-stock-that-cont/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/meet-the-monster-quantum-computing-stock-that-cont/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/meet-the-monster-quantum-computing-stock-that-cont/,fool.com,200,,"The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has ignited tremendous investor interest about which technologies could drive the next wave of growth for decades to come. Thus far, the most visible beneficiaries have been GPU designers like Nvidia, software platforms such as Palantir Technologies, and cloud infrastructure hyperscalers like Oracle.
However, as valuations in these well-established incumbents surge, many investors are beginning to search beyond the usual suspects. Increasingly, attention is shifting toward emerging applications -- in particular, quantum computing. Quantum computing is a frontier technology promising to solve problems beyond the reach of today's most advanced supercomputers.
This sweeping potential has fueled a speculative frenzy around which companies might emerge as the leaders of quantum AI. For now, one of the most closely watched names is D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 4.13%), whose stock has skyrocketed 216% so far this year -- far outpacing the broader S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, as well as many big tech companies.
With D-Wave rapidly becoming a lightning rod for investor debate and the broader narrative around quantum mechanics, the key question is straightforward: Does D-Wave's meteoric rise represent the dawn of a transformational opportunity, or is it just another bubble waiting to burst?
D-Wave's growth is real, but there's a catch
While quantum computing has captured intrigue, the reality is that its practical utility for AI remains limited today. Put simply, despite enthusiasm that quantum AI could one day revolutionize industries such as energy, financial services, and logistics, the technology is still largely in a research and development stage rather than delivering on its bold commercial ambitions.
These dynamics are on full display in the financial profile above. Over the past year, D-Wave Quantum generated just $22 million in revenue -- with the vast majority of those sales concentrated in a single quarter. Such inconsistency highlights that market demand for quantum AI services remains thin and sporadic.
At the same time, losses continue to mount -- accelerating at a pace that far outweighs the company's modest top-line growth.
This matters because when management touts headline-grabbing growth rates -- such as annual revenue expansion in the triple-digit range -- the figures are inflated by a minuscule baseline. In other words, the law of small numbers is obscuring the reality of D-Wave's fragile fundamentals.
Smart investors understand D-Wave's valuation is unsustainable
In the chart below, I've outlined Wall Street's consensus revenue estimates for D-Wave over the next few years. Even if the company meets its 2027 projection of $71 million in sales, D-Wave would still be trading at an implied forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 130, based on its current market capitalization of $9.2 billion.
A multiple of this magnitude is unsustainably high, particularly for a company with persistent cash burn and no tangible path to profitable unit economics. So, what's really happening here?
Much like many penny stocks that get caught in speculative cycles, D-Wave has become swept up in a momentum-driven rally fueled by hype over fundamentals. Even the slightest whiff of positive news tied to the broader quantum computing narrative -- such as government funding initiatives -- sparks frenzied buying from retail traders chasing hope rather than sustainable, compounding earnings power.
How can you invest in quantum AI?
While D-Wave will likely continue to attract its share of fanfare, investors seeking durable exposure to the quantum computing opportunity should look elsewhere.
The reality is that hyperscalers like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon are all actively developing proprietary quantum processors -- positioning themselves to benefit from the upside of commercialization once the technology matures. Meanwhile, Nvidia has extended its CUDA software architecture to run in hybrid classical-quantum environments, further reinforcing its technological moat.
For investors preferring a more passive, diversified approach, exposure to quantum AI is also possible through established blue chips like Honeywell, JPMorgan Chase, or Amgen -- each of which own equity stakes in Quantinuum, a $10 billion quantum computing start-up.
The bottom line is clear: Quantum mechanics remains largely experimental, and investors need not chase hype-driven small caps to participate. There are far more credible avenues to gain exposure to this emerging frontier of AI as opposed to carrying the outsize risk of getting caught holding the bag in unproven, speculative contenders."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-28T15:43:00,2 Tech Stocks That Could Help Set You Up for Life,"IonQ and SoundHound AI are two high-risk, high-reward stocks that could pay out big in the future.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cc179062cf97172081bec1bf924b7942ed561ea3b8b14a85cf88dce85f118dea,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/2-tech-stocks-that-could-help-set-you-up-for-life/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/2-tech-stocks-that-could-help-set-you-up-for-life/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/2-tech-stocks-that-could-help-set-you-up-for-life/,fool.com,200,,"If you're looking to buy some stocks that may set you up for life, you're going to have to take some big swings -- especially if you aren't starting with a lot of money. One of the best ways to do this is by investing in some emerging technology trends early. You're likely going to have some misses along the way, but if one of these growth stocks hits it big, it could help set you up for life.
Let's look at two stocks that fit this bill.
IonQ
IonQ (IONQ -5.85%) is trying to become the Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) of quantum computing, and it's taking the steps to get there. Nvidia didn't become the dominant player in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure just because it developed the best graphics processing units (GPUs). It was the software and networking ecosystem it built around its chips that created the wide moat it has today. IonQ is now trying to follow that same playbook when it comes to quantum computing.
IonQ's approach to quantum computing itself is a bit unique, as it uses trapped ions, which are actual atoms, instead of trying to build artificial qubits. That gives its machines much lower error rates and more predictable performance. It's also a more expensive approach with very tight system-building tolerances. However, the company isn't just looking to build quantum computers; IonQ is looking to provide the whole quantum stack. This starts with software, where its Clifford Noise Reduction technology is used to cut errors even further, which is critical as systems scale up.
It's also aggressively adding networking capabilities through acquisitions like Lightsynq and Capella Space, and its latest pending deal for Vector Atomic puts it into quantum sensing with a portfolio of technology trusted by some of the most demanding government programs. IonQ has also demonstrated that it can convert photons from its trapped-ion system into telecom wavelengths, which opens the door to high-speed links connecting quantum computers across existing fiber infrastructure.
This is a big step toward an eventual quantum internet. IonQ has over $1.6 billion in cash and no debt as of July 9, which lets it keep expanding its talent pool and make strategic acquisitions like these. It is worth noting that IonQ consumed $155 million of cash over the last year, though -- it's running an expensive business with minimal revenues.
Quantum computing isn't going to replace classical computing tomorrow, but it could become the next big technology in the future. IonQ has been making good strides in this area, as demonstrated by its recent agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to work on quantum-secure communications in space.
IonQ doesn't have to be the only quantum computing winner to deliver massive returns; it just needs to stay ahead of the pack, and right now it appears to be doing so.
SoundHound AI
SoundHound AI (SOUN 2.59%) is betting that the future of AI will be conversational and voice-driven, and it's building out its platform to enable more seamless interaction with AI agents. Its Amelia 7.0 platform is a big leap forward because it lets AI agents plan and take action through voice interactions, which means fewer calls need to go to a human. That cuts costs for customers and creates more value for SoundHound. The company is just at the start of its AI agent journey, but it is already transitioning 15 of its largest clients to Amelia 7.0.
The company also recently announced the acquisition of Interactions, which it said was an early pioneer of AI-powered voice assistants for customer service. It said that Interactions' technology complements its own and brings with it some big new customers and a strong patent portfolio. It plans to incorporate this technology with its own to provide a full suite of options for omnichannel AI agents.
The deal comes on the heels of SoundHound AI posting its best quarterly results ever. Last quarter's revenue surged 217% year over year to $42.7 million. Management raised its outlook, noting it's on track to hit adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) profitability by the end of 2025. It said the pending Interactions buyout, meanwhile, will be immediately accretive to profitability.
Competition in AI agents is intense, but SoundHound's voice-first approach could make it the go-to platform as AI systems become multimodal and voice becomes the preferred way to interact with them. If it can keep growing and take a leadership role in this space, the stock has the potential to be a huge winner over the next decade."

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on APLD. Applied Digital Corporation's share was trading at $19.83 as of September 17th. APLD’s forward P/E was 526.32 according to Yahoo Finance.
Applied Digital (APLD) has rapidly transformed from a speculative small cap into a serious player in AI infrastructure, with its stock price surging from about $3 in April to nearly $20 today. The momentum is not mere market hype but underpinned by long-term contracts and a credible execution track record. Central to this story is CoreWeave, a fast-growing AI infrastructure company backed by NVIDIA, which signed two 15-year leases with APLD worth $7 billion.
CoreWeave later expanded its commitment with another 150 MW lease, bringing the total to 400 MW and raising APLD’s backlog to approximately $11 billion in contracted revenue. This revenue stream is multi-year, locked in, and set to ramp as facilities come online. APLD has already demonstrated its ability to scale rapidly, constructing 480 MW in the past 18 months. Its current flagship project, Polaris Forge 1 in North Dakota, is a 400 MW facility with the first 100 MW expected to go live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW in mid-2026, and the final 150 MW in 2027.
The company also boasts a 1.4 GW future pipeline, supported by financing from Macquarie, highlighting its ability to expand aggressively. Efficiency is a competitive edge, with direct chip cooling developed in collaboration with Dell, low-cost energy supported by North Dakota’s favorable climate, and power usage effectiveness near 1.18, giving APLD a structural cost advantage.
Energy security is equally critical, and APLD has already locked in long-term renewable and utility contracts in Texas and North Dakota to support its data centers. With management signaling advanced negotiations with a major North American hyperscaler, additional contracts appear likely. Together, these elements make APLD one of the most compelling emerging plays on AI infrastructure buildout, offering investors exposure to a company with contracted revenue, secured energy supply, and a fast-expanding capacity pipeline.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Applied Digital Corporation (APLD) by DoU92 in December 2024, which highlighted the company’s pivot to AI-driven growth, rapid data center expansion, and scalable HPC infrastructure. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 108% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as long-term contracts and operational execution underpin growth. GloriousLebron shares a similar bullish view but emphasizes major CoreWeave leases, secured energy, and an aggressive buildout pipeline."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-28T14:30:00,5 Dividend Powerhouses Every Investor Should Own,"From defense contracts to AI chips, these dividend giants dominate their industries while rewarding shareholders with growing cash distributions.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=b6195ec7b8bd40e27d94dbdd487783eb5e74d106e42e2104a7e3bcbdba733eba,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/5-dividend-powerhouses-every-investor-should-own/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/5-dividend-powerhouses-every-investor-should-own/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/5-dividend-powerhouses-every-investor-should-own/,fool.com,200,,"Forget chasing the next hype-fueled stock. Real wealth comes from companies that dominate essential industries and return cash to shareholders year after year. These dividend powerhouses span consumer goods, defense, energy, and finance, with records of resilience through recessions, wars, and market crashes.
The formula is simple: durable businesses, consistent cash flows, and dividends that continue to rise. The beauty is boring predictability -- exactly what long-term investors should want.
The defense dividend fortress
Lockheed Martin (LMT -1.20%) yields 2.7% with support from one of the most reliable customers in the world: the U.S. government. Its flagship F-35 fighter program is slated to run into the 2070s, providing decades of predictable revenue that have fueled 6.6% annual dividend growth over the past five years.
While its 73% payout ratio looks elevated, it is supported by an $886 billion U.S. defense budget and record global military spending. With geopolitical tensions from Ukraine to Taiwan driving defense outlays higher, Lockheed offers one of the most secure dividends investors can find.
The consumer staples cash machine
Procter & Gamble (PG -1.14%) yields about 2.8% and owns some of the world's most essential consumer brands -- Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Crest -- generating durable demand across economic cycles. The company has paid a dividend every year since 1890 (134 consecutive years) and has raised it for nearly seven decades.
With 6% average dividend growth over five years and a forward payout ratio in the low 60s, P&G is a textbook example of steady income compounded over time. Its strong brand power and ability to raise prices in inflationary periods provide a buffer, letting P&G maintain margins when input costs rise.
The energy income giant
ExxonMobil (XOM -0.47%) offers a 3.4% yield that looks attractive in an era when many investors discount traditional energy stocks due to transition fears. Dividend growth has averaged just 2.6% annually over the past five years, but a 56% payout ratio leaves room for steady increases as oil demand remains resilient.
The Pioneer acquisition cemented Exxon's dominance in the Permian Basin, while massive offshore Guyana discoveries provide decades of low-cost production. Add in the stability of its chemicals and refining operations, and with industrywide capital discipline replacing past drilling excesses, Exxon's dividend looks increasingly sustainable.
The AI growth paradox
Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) sports an almost invisible 0.02% yield, but that misses the point entirely. The real story: 20% annual dividend growth over five years from a minuscule 1.1% payout ratio. This isn't an income play today -- it's tomorrow's dividend champion being born.
With artificial intelligence (AI) demand creating unprecedented pricing power and a gross margin above 70%, Nvidia could multiply its dividend 50-fold and barely notice. Buying for current yield would be foolish, but ignoring the dividend growth potential would be equally shortsighted.
The banking profit printer
JPMorgan Chase (JPM 1.27%) yields 1.9% with reliability, growing its dividend 8% annually over five years while maintaining a conservative 27.2% payout ratio. CEO Jamie Dimon built a fortress balance sheet that survived the regional banking crisis without breaking a sweat.
The bank's diversified revenue streams -- from investment banking to wealth management to credit cards -- provide stability through any rate cycle. With the conservative payout ratio leaving massive room for increases and the business model proven resilient through multiple economic shocks, JPMorgan's dividend growth looks set to continue regardless of Federal Reserve policy.
The dividend diversification playbook
These five stocks create a perfectly balanced dividend portfolio. ExxonMobil and P&G provide immediate income at 3.4% and 2.8% yields. Lockheed and JPMorgan offer steady growth with defensive characteristics. Nvidia represents the moonshot -- negligible current income but potentially explosive future payouts.
Together they span defense, consumer goods, energy, technology, and financials -- sectors that rarely crash simultaneously. Average the yields and you get 2.2%, but focus on the payout ratios, averaging just 46%, and you see the real opportunity: massive dividend growth ahead."

Economic data releases and earnings
This has been a week of reminders for investors. There are so many to choose from, I almost don't know where to begin.
First, this is an Nvidia (NVDA) market. It's a market that will work for the bulls for as long as Nvidia works. If Nvidia is going to chart a course for AI domination, as seen in its new $100 billion OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) deal on Monday, and the stock gets pushed higher, it's bullish for the broader market.
""I think AI is a real thing,"" Robinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild said on Opening Bid (video above). ""I still think there's a lot of growth in this country. And you're starting to see it in other sectors, ... in aerospace and defense, for example. So I definitely think it's something you have to pay attention to. You have to kind of be invested in whether it's Nvidia or in other kinds of smaller players that benefit.""
Second, if you're a CEO who ignores the retail investor, you do so at your own risk and general foolishness.
Opendoor (OPEN) and now Better Home & Finance (BETR) continue to see wild moves for the simple reason that a hedge fund manager is making strong bullish cases on X.
I have known that hedge fund manager, Eric Jackson, for more than a decade; I used to edit his columns at TheStreet. I am not surprised he has gained a stock-moving following. He puts in the hard work to find undervalued names.
Jackson shared more about his views on Opendoor during his last appearance on Opening Bid — it's worth a watch.
Lastly, if you're a bear, it will be hard to stay that way as long as the Fed is cutting rates. I think Monday's commentary from new Fed member Stephen Miran on the need for a series of rate cuts is where policy may be headed. This could keep a strong buy-the-dip mentality in markets.

Having said that, I want to get back to the AI trade.
For the better part of the summer, a black cloud was hanging over this trade, and there was a constant fear that the artificial intelligence buildup was nearing a peak.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%) has been one of the market's biggest winners since early April's tech sell-off, more than doubling since its springtime bottom. However, the stock is also currently trading at 5% lower than it was a year ago.
There are some legitimate reasons for concern, but the prognosis remains bullish for the maker of central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and other types of microprocessors. Let's go over the good and the bad when it comes to AMD. You need to look at both sides to determine whether investing in AMD could be your ticket to becoming a millionaire.
1. The bullish case for AMD
The rally in AMD is understandable. Demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) is booming, and AMD is there to provide the chip solutions for data centers to crank out the resource-intensive query results. It's not the leader in this space. Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) takes that crown. However, there is room for more than one winner in this seismic tech evolution.
AMD's business is picking up. It delivered several quarters of accelerating revenue growth before Chinese trading restrictions kicked in during the spring this year.
- Q1 2024: 2%
- Q2 2024: 9%
- Q3 2024: 18%
- Q4 2024: 24%
- Q1 2025: 36%
- Q2 2025: 32%
Investors shouldn't feel discouraged by the top-line deceleration. The U.S. restricting sales of AMD's Instinct MI308 data center GPU chips in China resulted in an $800 million hit in inventory-related charges in the second quarter. The lack of sales left a substantial dent on the $7.7 billion revenue it ultimately recorded for the quarter. Top-line growth would've accelerated for the fifth consecutive quarter if the export controls weren't in place.
The collateral damage from the trade war also hurt AMD's bottom line. AMD's adjusted gross margin of 43% would've been roughly 54% without the charge. Its adjusted operating profit tumbled 29% to $897 million, with AMD's adjusted earnings sliding 30% to $0.48 a share. However, it was still in line with analyst expectations.
Despite what should hopefully be a temporary results-sapping situation, AMD is probably cheaper than you think. It is trading for less than 27 times next year's profit target, a reasonable price given its recent growth rate early in the AI revolution. You could've bought AMD for less than 13 times 2026 earnings at the April bottom, but we're here now. It doesn't mean that you're late.
AMD's forward revenue multiple of 6.4 may seem high for a cyclical semiconductor stock, but you would be cheating the chipmakers if you assume AI is a fad. There should be strong demand for the buildout of data centers for several more years.
2. The bearish case against AMD
Nvidia is the rock star in this space, trading at a lofty 15.8 times next fiscal year's revenue target. However, it's fetching only 28 times next year's earnings, barely a premium over AMD's forward earnings valuation. This is a testament to Nvidia's stronger margins, but it has also grown at a faster clip than AMD. There's a reason Nvidia commands the country's largest market cap.
Another knock on AMD -- and it applies to Nvidia as well -- is that the trade war is taking its toll in a few ways. When Nvidia and AMD agreed this summer to hand over 15% of their sales to China in order to lift export controls, the market cheered the news. The rub is that it takes two to tango. China isn't ready to open the floodgates, and homegrown companies are working on solutions to fuel that nation's AI game plan.
AMD can survive without China. After all, it just posted 32% revenue growth in its latest quarter, and that was with the now-absent Chinese AI chip sales padding the prior year's report.
The stock may have soared 108% since its April low, but new uncertainties in the trade standoff that are beyond its control have emerged. It's still a stock with serious upside, especially as headwinds become tailwinds. Nvidia may be the shiny choice, but what happens as the margin gap closes between the two companies? On its own, AMD has a long trajectory of growth, even before the China situation sorts itself out. There are no guarantees when it comes to investing, but AMD seems to have a good shot at being your ticket to becoming a millionaire."

A company that began as a niche designer of graphics chips for video games has evolved into the undisputed leader of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Today, Nvidia isn't just a chip company -- it's the bellwether investors use to gauge the direction that the computing sector is headed.
Nvidia's share price moves on practically every headline tied to AI infrastructure, as its GPUs are powering a growing universe of generative AI applications across the globe. It's no wonder that over the past three years, Nvidia's meteoric rise has catapulted the company into the position of the most valuable business in the world as measured by market cap.
Now, Nvidia is doubling down. Fresh off a $5 billion strategic investment in Intel, Nvidia just opened up its pocketbook again -- this time committing up to $100 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.
The question investors may be asking now is whether these aggressive moves could be the catalysts that propel Nvidia toward even greater milestones, potentially positioning it for another historic run upward -- this time, toward a $10 trillion valuation.
Why Nvidia's partnership with OpenAI matters
On Sept. 22, Nvidia announced a letter of intent to supply 10 gigawatts of computing infrastructure to power OpenAI's next generation of models as the company pursues ""superintelligence."" Put simply, OpenAI requires unprecedented quantities of GPU clusters to train and scale its large language models -- and Nvidia has both the hardware and software that is needed.
Building a moat against AMD and hyperscalers
While Nvidia still has first-mover advantages in the GPU market, competition in that area has steadily intensified. Advanced Micro Devices offers lower-cost alternatives, while hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are investing heavily in designing their own custom AI accelerator chips. Yet the OpenAI deal illustrates how Nvidia's competitive moat continues to expand despite these pressures.
The deal underscores Nvidia's dominance in AI infrastructure -- securing long-term demand, revenue visibility, and ecosystem lock-in. By aligning itself closely with OpenAI, Nvidia further embeds itself at the center of generative AI adoption.
In many ways, the agreement functions like a form of vertical integration -- ensuring that OpenAI's most advanced models continue to be built upon and optimized for Nvidia's platform well into the future.
The path to a $10 trillion valuation
Because it's a private company, it's difficult to peg the true value of OpenAI. Media reports suggest it could generate around $20 billion in annual recurring revenue by December -- with projections as high as $125 billion by 2029.
Sustaining that type of growth is ambitious, especially given rising competition from Perplexity, Anthropic, xAI, and Gemini. Moreover, achieving these targets will require astronomical expansions in its processing power -- hence the rationale behind OpenAI's deepening alliance with Nvidia.
Wall Street currently expects Nvidia to generate $320 billion in annual revenues in 2027. Yet with the Intel and OpenAI deals in hand, that forecast already looks outdated. If Nvidia were to capture even 30% of OpenAI's projected annual recurring revenue, it could add nearly $40 billion of incremental revenue annually.
Perhaps even more significant than the figures above is the underlying signal of these deals: By committing its next-generation systems to Nvidia's backbone, OpenAI -- one of the most influential brands in the AI arena -- is effectively telling the market that Nvidia remains the gold standard for advanced computing. This endorsement is likely to echo across enterprises, cloud providers, and even government agencies, reinforcing Nvidia's platform as the default choice for AI infrastructure.
This halo effect could push Nvidia's revenues far beyond the current analyst consensus, potentially into the neighborhood of $500 billion by 2030. Applying its three-year average price-to-sales ratio of 28 to that figure implies that by that year, its market cap could be well north of $10 trillion.
Ultimately, precise time frames and dollar figures matter less than the broader takeaway: Nvidia stock continues to look like a durable, profitable, long-term holding for investors seeking exposure to the AI megatrend."

Many of those stocks -- including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon -- were in the tech sector. Amazon, the top cloud infrastructure company, also became the first online retailer to join the 12-zero club.
Yet not a single brick-and-mortar retailer has joined that elite group. Could Costco Wholesale (COST 0.85%), with a market cap of $420 billion, cross that threshold in the near future?
How fast has Costco grown since its public debut?
Costco, the world's largest warehouse club retailer, went public at a split-adjusted price of $1.67 per share on Dec. 5, 1985. Today, it trades at about $950 -- a $1,000 investment in its initial public offering (IPO) would be worth nearly $569,000 today and pay out more than $3,100 in annual dividends. That 56,786% gain over the past 40 years was driven by its constant construction of new warehouses, its rising number of cardholders, and its high renewal rates.
From fiscal 1985 (which ended in September 1985) to fiscal 2024, Costco's number of warehouses increased from 11 to 891 locations, its number of cardholders jumped from 1.3 million to 136.8 million, and its annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from $1.1 billion to $254.4 billion.
How does Costco keep expanding?
Costco generates most of its profits from its high-margin membership fees, which allows it to sell a lot of its products at low, break-even, or even loss-leading margins. It also leverages its scale to negotiate favorable bulk rates with its suppliers, and it promotes its own Kirkland private-label products as a cheaper alternative to name-brand products.
Costco carries a narrower selection of products than superstores like Walmart, but it constantly rotates them to draw its shoppers back for return visits. Its gas stations, food court, vision center, and other ancillary services reinforce that strategy. So as long as Costco keeps growing its comparable store sales, opening new warehouses, gaining new cardholders, and locking them in with high renewal rates, its business will flourish. All of those core growth metrics headed in the right direction over the past few years -- even as the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds rattled the global economy.

Costco weathered the pandemic because it remained a top destination for stocking up on household goods, while inflation drove more cost-conscious shoppers to its stores. It raised its membership fees for the first time in seven years last September to offset the inflationary pressure on its margins, but that price hike didn't impact its growth.
Costco hasn't reported its full-year earnings for fiscal 2025 yet, but it ended the third quarter with 142.8 million cardholders and a healthy global renewal rate of 90.2%. For the full year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow 8% and 9%, respectively.
Could Costco become a trillion-dollar company?
From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Costco's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 8% and 10%, respectively. That growth should be fueled by its ongoing overseas expansion, its rising e-commerce sales, and upgrades for its ancillary services.
We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but Costco has a proven track record of expanding through bear and bull markets. But it isn't a bargain at 47 times next year's earnings -- presumably because too many investors bought it as a safe haven play in this choppy market. If Costco matches analysts' expectations, continues to grow its EPS at a CAGR of 10% over the following eight years, and trades at a more reasonable 30 times earnings, its stock could rise nearly 50% to $1,420 over the next 10 years.
That would be a decent gain, but it would only boost its market cap to $630 billion. It could also underperform the S&P 500, which has generated an average annual return of about 10% since its inception. So while Costco is still a stable investment, it's getting overheated and probably won't become a trillion-dollar retailer within the next decade."

Nvidia’s announcement earlier this week that it is investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund its massive data center build out has added to a growing sense of unease among investors that there is a dangerous financial bubble around AI, and that the revenues and earnings math underpinning the valuations of both public and private companies in the sector just doesn’t add up.
While Nvidia’s latest announcement is by far the largest example, the AI chipmaker has engaged in a series of “circular” deals in which it invests in, or lends money to, its own customers. Vendor financing exists to some degree in many industries, but in this case, circular transactions may give investors an inflated perception of the true demand for AI.
In past technology bubbles, revenue “roundtripping” and tech companies financing their own customers have exacerbated the damage when those bubbles eventually popped. While the share of Nvidia’s revenues that are currently being driven by such financing appears to be relatively small, the company’s dominance as the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company means that its stock is “priced for perfection” and that even minor missteps could have outsized impact on its valuation—and on financial markets and perhaps even the wider economy.
The extent to which the entire AI boom is backstopped by Nvidia’s cash isn’t easy to answer precisely, which is also one of the unsettling things about it. The company has struck a number of investment and financing deals, many of which are too small individually for the company to consider “material” and report in its financial filings, even though collectively they may be significant.
In addition, there are so many interlocking rings of circularity—where Nvidia has invested in a company, such as OpenAI, that in turn purchases services from a cloud service provider that Nvidia has also invested in, which then also buys or leases GPUs from Nvidia—that disentangling what money is flowing where is far from easy.
Tangled webs of investment
Two of the most prominent examples of Nvidia’s web of circuitous investments are OpenAI and Coreweave. In addition to the latest investment in OpenAI, Nvidia had previously participated in a $6.6 billion investment round in the fast-growing AI company in October 2024. Nvidia also has invested in CoreWeave, which supplies data center capacity to OpenAI and is also an Nvidia customer. As of the end of June, Nvidia owned about 7% of Coreweave, a stake worth about $3 billion currently.
The benefits that companies get from a Nvidia investment extend beyond the cash itself. Nvidia’s equity stakes in companies such as OpenAI and Coreweave enable these companies to access debt financing for data center projects at potentially significantly lower interest rates than they would be able to access without such backing. Jay Goldberg, an analyst with Seaport Global Securities, compares such deals to someone asking their parents to be a co-signer on their mortgage. It gives lenders some assurance that they may actually get their money back."

- Recent earnings reports from critical players in the AI supply chain, such as chipmaker Nvidia and cloud provider Oracle, have raised concerns among investors that the AI boom is increasingly dependent on investments from a handful of huge companies.
- Some experts note that AI demand is so strong that, if one big customer were to rein in its spending on infrastructure like Nvidia's chips, others would likely fill the gap.
- Others warn that cloud computing deals inked with unprofitable start-ups like OpenAI could fall far short of expectations if investors lose their risk appetite or future AI models disappoint.
U.S. companies expect to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI over the next few years, but some investors are worried those plans—and the stock market rally they've fueled—depend too much on just a handful of companies.
Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) revealed in a regulatory filing last month that two direct customers accounted for nearly 40% of total revenue in the second quarter, with ""Customer A"" representing 23% of sales and ""Customer B"" 16%. At no other point since 2022, when ChatGPT sparked the AI craze, have two individual buyers represented a greater share of Nvidia’s sales.
But experts note that the 40% figure likely overstates Nvidia's reliance on those two customers. Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, but Customers A and B are likely distributors or system integrators that package Nvidia products in larger systems for sale to end users like hyperscalers and software companies.
Nvidia has less visibility into how much of its revenue comes from the hyperscalers. In the most recent quarter, the company estimated that two unnamed end users each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. Unless they each account for well over 10%, the estimate suggests Nvidia's pool of final users could be more diverse than its pool of direct customers.
“Feast or famine,” is how Bill Kleyman, Senior Data Center Analyst at HostingAdvice, characterizes Nvidia’s sales. The company’s fortunes, Kleyman told Investopedia, “are increasingly tied to how much the big cloud platforms spend on AI infrastructure.”
Why This Matters To You
The artificial intelligence boom has helped the U.S. stock market and economy weather elevated inflation and interest rates for the past several years. A slowdown in spending by just a few major tech companies could shake investor confidence in AI, rattle the stock market, and detract from economic growth.
Competitor Broadcom (AVGO) is in the same boat. One distributor accounted for nearly 30% of sales in the past two quarters, and Broadcom estimated that about 40% of revenue came from its five largest end users. Broadcom's sales have become more concentrated during the AI arms race of the past few years.
Nonetheless, according to Kleyman, the unique dynamic of the AI infrastructure buildout makes this level of concentration less risky than it otherwise would be. “Overall AI demand is so strong across many sectors that a shortfall from one large customer would likely be offset by others ramping up their investments,” he said.
Chipmakers aren’t the only companies in the AI supply chain that could be forced to grapple with the consequences of customer concentration.
Enterprise software and cloud computing company Oracle (ORCL) reported earlier this month that its backlog swelled by nearly $320 billion in the most recent quarter. Shares soared as Wall Street hailed the “historic” quarter. But it quickly became apparent that nearly all of the backlog could be attributed to a 5-year, $300 billion cloud computing deal with OpenAI.
Related Education
The terms of the agreement are unknown, but experts say flexibility is always written into contracts of that size and duration. How much of Oracle's backlog is converted into revenue will depend on OpenAI’s usage, which hinges on factors beyond how much the public uses ChatGPT.
“These deals are only as sticky as the models they serve,” says Rory Bokser, Head of Product at Moken.io, a decentralized computing network data provider. “If OpenAI changes architectures, moves off Oracle’s flavor of cloud, or pivots deployment strategy (edge vs. centralized), those ‘backlogs’ get revised real fast.”
Another risk of inking a $300 billion deal with one company is that the customer may not have $300 billion to spend. OpenAI's annualized recurring revenue reportedly reached $12 billion in July, and the company is targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029. Whether OpenAI hits those aggressive growth targets will likely depend on the ability of other companies to use its models to expand their profit margins or develop revenue-generating applications.
Without rapid revenue growth, OpenAI may need to lean on investors to supply it with the billions of dollars it expects to burn through by the end of the decade. A recent funding round put the company’s valuation at about $500 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable private enterprises.
“It remains to be seen whether or not OpenAI will continue to receive the lavish funding it has received so far,” said Greg Osuri, founder and CEO of Akash, a decentralized computing marketplace. Future funding could become scarce if AI implementation fails to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations or economic stress forces investors and creditors to pull back."

We think that it's likely that the semis and, you know, the Nvidia story is probably coming close to an end. The amount of investment in capital equipment, we're seeing it right around the peaks that we saw back in the uh late 90s, early 2000s bubble.
Uh again, and I don't want to say, I, you know, bubble is probably the worst thing to say as well as it's not different, it's different this time. But
again, you're seeing spending. So we think the people who've enabled AI thus far have received the bulk of the rewards. We think now AI becomes a monetization story and all of this capital investment, we have to see that it generates the returns that we're going to get that ROI. I think that's why you've seen some weakness, uh, the the last few days in Oracle just because people are not sure of that. And
I think there our other big concern around the space is the amount of cross-investment we're seeing.
That always feels a little uncomfortable when you see, you know, somebody is lending is, you know, investing in somebody who is their one of their biggest clients who then trumpets them as one of their, uh, as as one of their great stories.

If you invested $10,000 in the stock a decade ago, you'd have a position worth $3 million now. It's success stories like that that keep ambitious investors hunting for the less known stocks today that have the potential to provide similar gains from here.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a massive investment theme right now, and traditional computing has gone a long way toward developing that technology. However, there are many who believe that quantum computing could boost the capabilities of AI systems.
IonQ (IONQ -5.85%) was the first pure-play quantum computing company to go public, and has seen a ton of investor interest over the past month. It offers several leading technologies in its niche, and it also has asserted that its technology could provide a massive boost for AI. So could IonQ become the Nvidia of the 2030s?
IonQ's technology could separate it from the competition
The primary reason why quantum computing isn't commercially viable yet is a lack of accuracy. Traditional computer chips have error rates of about 1 calculation in a 1 quintillion. (That's 1 billion times 1 billion.) Today's best quantum computers' error rates are closer to 1 in 100,000, so they still have a long way to go before they're similarly reliable. This is clearly an issue.
One reason IonQ has become a leader in this space is its world-record-holding technology. IonQ holds world records in 1-qubit (99.999%) and 2-qubit gate (99.97%) fidelity tests. Most of IonQ's competitors are celebrating being in the 99% to 99.9% range in the 2-qubit gate fidelity test. So IonQ is about an order of magnitude ahead of its quantum computing competition -- but still nowhere near as accurate as a conventional computer.
Assuming IonQ can maintain its lead in accuracy, it will have a shot at releasing commercially viable quantum computers faster than its competition. Being the first mover in an important industry is a huge advantage -- just look at how OpenAI's ChatGPT has performed.
There are numerous technological approaches to quantum computing, and each has its benefits and drawbacks. For IonQ, processing speed is one of them. It uses a trapped ion technology that has slower processing speeds than the superconducting qubit tech that many of its rivals are using. However, I think that potential clients will be more likely to favor a more accurate solution over a faster one, especially while the tech world is still trying to assess quantum computing's relevance.
This is critical. IonQ will need to win market share early if it hopes to repeat what Nvidia has done.
Being a first mover is a huge advantage that IonQ must achieve
Over the past few years, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the primary computing hardware of choice for handling artificial intelligence workloads. Companies could have used chips from rivals such as AMD instead, but Nvidia's software and hardware were the best at the start, so it won a massive share of the data center computing market. Some estimates still peg Nvidia's share of the data center market at over 90%.
If IonQ is the player with the best technology at the moment when quantum computing goes mainstream, it has the potential to become the next Nvidia. It also has massive implications in the AI sector as a hybrid quantum computing approach, where IonQ's technology is combined with traditional computing hardware like Nvidia's GPUs to boost performance. Perhaps the biggest boost is that this hybrid approach would offer significant energy savings -- and electricity is a huge input cost and growth bottleneck for AI hyperscalers.
For IonQ to become the Nvidia of the 2030s, it will need to get its technology adopted widely at the onset of the period when quantum computing becomes commercially viable. However, it is worth noting that while quantum computers can perform some types of calculations vastly faster than traditional machines, the number of potential use cases for quantum computers is far smaller. With that in mind, investors should keep their performance expectations for IonQ's stock in check. Still, if it can commercialize its machines ahead of the pack and dominate the quantum computing market, IonQ has the potential to make patient investors a lot of money."

Thanks to the gains sparked by this technology, several individual stocks and the stock indexes reached record highs in recent trading sessions.
This has to many AI stocks setting new all-time highs. Also, Grand View Research forecasts a 32% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the AI sector through 2033, leading to questions about what comes next, especially for individual stocks in this sector. With that question in mind, three analysts from The Motley Fool share their insights on some of the most critical AI stocks and where they are likely to go from here.
1. Nvidia will likely exceed $200 billion in sales this fiscal year
Jake Lerch (Nvidia): My choice is Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). There's no doubt in my mind that Nvidia -- more than any other company -- has been the prime beneficiary of the AI revolution. After all, this is a company that, in just a few years, has risen to become the largest company by market capitalization in the world.
So, what are investors to make of Nvidia? What is the ceiling for the company? Or is there no ceiling at all?
Obviously, the answers to these questions revolve around the AI ecosystem and Nvidia's prime role within it. If the AI revolution continues to roll on, so will Nvidia. If AI investment slows or collapses, Nvidia's stock will tumble. Moreover, what if new competitors challenge Nvidia's enormous lead within the graphics processing unit (GPU) market?
First, there are legitimate concerns about the amount of spending on AI infrastructure -- and what return on investment (ROI) companies will get from it. Meta Platforms, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and many others are investing billions in AI infrastructure -- much of it in the form of Nvidia's advanced GPUs. These companies each have their own unique vision for utilizing their AI resources and their own ROI expectations.
For the moment, there is no sign that their ROI isn't measuring up. Indeed, the escalating scale of the investments suggests that ROIs are even better than expected.
Second, it's true that competitors will eventually close the gap on Nvidia. That is the nature of capitalism. However, the question remains how long that process will take to play out. According to estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance, Nvidia is expected to generate $206 billion in revenue for the fiscal year (the 12 months ending Jan. 27, 2026), and nearly $275 billion in the following 12 months.
So, competition will eventually emerge. Still, it is not expected to substantially impact Nvidia's growth over the next 18 months.
Nvidia remains the top dog in both the AI sector and the broader stock market. Overall, AI investment remains robust, suggesting that companies are reaping substantial benefits from their AI spending. Finally, Nvidia's competitors remain years off from fully challenging the company's strong sales growth. In short, Nvidia remains an AI stock superstar.
2. Investors must weigh company gains against stock growth in this stock
Will Healy (Palantir): Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%) has been an AI company since its inception. The technology played a critical role in delivering analytical insights in the national security and commercial sectors.
More recently, the launch of its generative AI-based Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) undoubtedly supercharged these capabilities. Numerous customers from diverse enterprises reported eye-popping productivity gains. Amid such improvements, Palantir's stock is up by nearly 370% over the last year.
Unfortunately for bulls in this stock, its financials call into question the near-term direction of Palantir stock. In the first half of 2025, Palantir earned a net income attributable to common shareholders of $541 million, a 126% yearly gain.
While that is an impressive amount of growth by any measure, it fell short of the gains in the stock price. Consequently, Palantir reached stratospheric valuations. Even if investors can dismiss the 592 P/E ratio, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 131 is far removed from the S&P 500's average sales multiple of 3.4.
Does this mean Palantir's stock is headed for a crash, or at least a pause? Not necessarily, as it is always possible that it will beat expectations or find some other factor that will propel the stock higher.
The problem with these valuations is that they price Palantir stock for perfection. That means any hint of negative news could trigger a massive sell-off, making it extremely risky to buy the stock at current prices.
Amid that possibility, investors should probably refrain from putting new money to work in Palantir. Additionally, if one's risk tolerance does not lend itself to owning such an expensive stock, they should consider selling.
3. Don't write off Apple as an AI powerhouse just yet
Justin Pope (Apple): Iconic electronics titan Apple (AAPL 0.54%) has faced considerable criticism for its lackluster rollout of AI iOS features it had dubbed Apple Intelligence.
It was supposed to be an easy layup -- there are over 2.35 billion active iOS devices worldwide. Successfully bringing AI to Apple users would have almost assured the company's place as a top AI company, where next-generation technology would further enhance its already sticky ecosystem.
Unfortunately, Apple dropped the ball. The company has struggled to ship first-party AI features and has since delayed its launch of an upgraded Siri, Apple's virtual personal assistant, to a 2026 release date. But don't write Apple off just yet. The company continues to specialize in bringing refined, quality hardware products to market, allowing its iOS ecosystem to shine.
Apple just launched its latest iPhone models: the 17, 17 Pro, and Pro Max, as well as a new, slim-design model, the iPhone Air. According to early indications, Apple may be in for a strong hardware cycle. The CEO of T-Mobile recently noted that iPhone sales are at an all-time high. Industry experts also pointed out strong demand for the new iPhone lineup.
While Apple must ultimately deliver a working and compelling slate of AI features for its devices, it's clear that Apple's core hardware products haven't lost their fastball. That should give the company time to figure out AI and keep the stock on the radar of any investor looking for some AI upside, but would rather stick with a blue-chip winner versus rolling the dice on unproven or speculative AI stocks."

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are regarded as the backbone of training and running artificial intelligence models, which has helped push the company's market capitalisation to record highs. But sales to China, one of the world's biggest markets, have been disrupted by geopolitical tensions. Earlier this year, the US abruptly barred exports of the H20 - a downgraded chip tailored to comply with restrictions - before relenting after a 15 per cent levy to the US government was agreed.
Yet Chinese regulators' stance remains ambivalent: a warm welcome to Huang when he visited China while continuing a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Out of the 500 companies in the S&P 500, 287 mentioned AI during their earnings call in the most recent quarter. That's up from less than 100 as of the end of 2022, when OpenAI's ChatGPT first came on the scene.
While investor excitement has pushed many AI stocks significantly higher over the last few years, some may have gotten ahead of themselves. Wall Street analysts see two of the biggest winners of the AI boom falling considerably over the next year, as the market isn't accounting for the risks involved in these investments.
Here are two AI stocks that could see their stock prices plummet up to 75%, according to select Wall Street analysts.
1. CoreWeave
CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) specializes in renting GPU servers to artificial intelligence developers and helping larger hyperscale cloud providers meet their customers' demand for compute. One of CoreWeave's biggest investors is Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), which owns roughly 7% of the company. That relationship ensures CoreWeave gets priority access to Nvidia's coveted GPU systems, making it a key supplier of compute for the industry.
Nvidia recently built on its relationship with CoreWeave, signing a contract to buy any unused capacity from CoreWeave as part of a $6.3 billion GPU purchase. That essentially gives the cloud computing company carte blanche to build out capacity, ensuring that its virtuous cycle of growth can continue through at least 2032, when the contract ends.
CoreWeave has grown quickly by taking on debt to build new data centers, which it outfits with Nvidia chips and then rents to customers in need of compute. The growing demand for AI compute enabled it to easily rent out its capacity, giving it more revenue, which it can use to raise more debt and build more capacity.
But even with Nvidia acting as a backstop, the stock comes with significant risks. For one, it has a huge customer concentration challenge. Microsoft represented 71% of its revenue last quarter. Meanwhile, Microsoft is building out its own capacity as fast as possible. And any drop in demand from Microsoft could significantly harm the virtuous cycle powering CoreWeave's growth. Nvidia's backstop will help, but the growth will completely sputter.
CoreWeave's singular focus and its reliance on Microsoft are the biggest reasons HSBC analyst Abhishek Shukla put a $32 price target on the stock earlier this year. That's the lowest on the Street, representing a 75% decline from the stock price as of this writing. While CoreWeave has had some positive developments since that analyst note, the stock still faces significant risks with its extremely high debt load.
2. Palantir Technologies
Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%) makes software that helps businesses and government agencies draw actionable insights from their massive and disparate data sets. The company's data ontology software received a significant boost from the development of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). The addition allows enterprises to plug in a large language model and use natural language to interact with its software. That's expanded the use cases for Palantir while making it easier for more users to take advantage of its powerful features.
Palantir has been growing quickly as a result. Last quarter's sales climbed 48% year over year. It's seeing even stronger results among U.S. commercial customers, up 93% year over year. On top of that, it's showing very strong operating leverage, as the company's product-first strategy has kept its marketing and sales expenses relatively low. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 46% last quarter, giving it a Rule of 40 score of 94.
The future looks bright for Palantir as well. Its remaining deal value among U.S. commercial customers sat at $2.79 billion as of the end of last quarter, up 145% year over year. And it signed a $10 billion contract with the U.S. Army in August.
But Wall Street thinks the stock may have gotten ahead of the results. RBC Capital's analysts put a $45 price target on the stock following the news of its U.S. Army contract. That represents a 75% drop from its stock price as of this writing. The big reason for the low price target is Palantir's valuation, providing an ""unfavorable risk-reward"" profile. Indeed, the stock currently trades for over 100 times forward sales estimates and over 275 times forward earnings estimates. Palantir needs to grow at a breakneck pace for years to come in order to justify those valuations, and any misstep or disappointing earnings report could send shares plummeting."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-28T08:44:00,This Underrated AI Stock Could Be the Best Growth Story of the Decade,This AI stock has nearly quadrupled in 2025.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6c23dd6236f7b28a632679077d55c1817a820a86147888cb048d3e89459c8de1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/this-underrated-ai-stock-could-be-the-best-growth/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/this-underrated-ai-stock-could-be-the-best-growth/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/this-underrated-ai-stock-could-be-the-best-growth/,fool.com,200,,"What companies come to mind first when you hear the words ""artificial intelligence""? I suspect that Nvidia, ChatGPT creator OpenAI, or Google parent Alphabet would rank near the top of the list for many investors.
On the other hand, I doubt that Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%) would be among the most common responses. But maybe it should. This underrated AI stock could be the best growth story of the decade.
""Exciting times""
Nebius' primary focus is on its AI cloud platform. It also operates two subsidiaries: autonomous vehicle technology developer Avride and leading education technology provider TripleTen. In addition, Nebius owns stakes in open-source database platform provider ClickHouse and AI data specialist Toloka.
Arkady Volozh, Nebius' founder and CEO, opened his latest letter to shareholders by stating, ""These are exciting times."" He declared: ""[W]e stand at the brink of the next great leap in technology. To achieve this, we need to build [an] entirely new infrastructure for AI."" Volozh believes that Nebius is one of only a handful of AI hyperscalers with the capability to meet the task at hand.
Nebius is expanding its capacity rapidly to meet the surging demand. In particular, the company is working to secure more than 1 gigawatt of power by the end of 2026. That's critical considering the importance of electricity to power-hungry AI data centers.
This rapid expansion requires a lot of money. Nebius is in a good position on that front as well. It has lined up more than $4 billion in capital. The company's balance sheet should also allow it to pursue additional financing options as needed.
Underrated?
Is Nebius really underrated? There's a good case that it is.
Nebius' share price has nearly quadrupled year to date. That's a much stronger performance than Nvidia has delivered. Nebius has also handily outgained fellow hyperscaler and IPO darling CoreWeave.
The sizzling returns are warranted. Nebius' revenue soared 625% year over year and 106% sequentially in the second quarter of 2025. Although Nvidia and CoreWeave are generating strong revenue growth, neither company is anywhere close to Nebius' pace.
Nebius has landed several marquee customers. Cloudflare and Shopify especially stand out. The AI cloud provider is also winning ground with lots of up-and-coming AI players, such as HeyGen, Lightning.AI, and Photoroom.
But Nebius isn't getting nearly as much attention as other AI leaders. For example, Google Search returns fewer than 1.6 million results mentioning Nebius so far this year. By comparison, CoreWeave has nearly twice as many results. Unsurprisingly, Nvidia has far more (around 119 million).
The best growth story of the decade?
Nebius is already one of the fastest-growing large-cap stocks in 2025. Could it really be the best growth story of the decade? Maybe.
I expect continued explosive demand for AI infrastructure as companies of all sizes scramble to build and deploy AI models. In particular, AI inference should be a huge opportunity. I agree with Volozh's view that Nebius is one of only a few hyperscalers positioned to be the biggest winners from these trends.
Don't overlook the potential for Avride and TripleTen to boost Nebius' growth. In particular, I think Avride has great opportunities in expanding its partnerships to use autonomous robots to deliver orders from restaurants and groceries to customers.
What about Nebius' valuation? The company isn't profitable yet, so we can't use earnings-based valuation metrics. However, Nebius' shares trade at 147 times trailing-12-month sales. But with revenue more than doubling from Q1 to Q2, that sky-high price-to-sales multiple doesn't look nearly as scary.
I won't go out on a limb and predict that Nebius will definitely be the best growth story of the decade. At this point, though, I think it could very well be a contender."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-28T08:15:00,Did Nvidia Just Repeat Cisco's Mistake and Build a House of Cards With OpenAI Investment?,Circular financing adds a big new risk.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9d2668bca1e58408764242f47306bd62e7effdae6814a014bb7e58e0709b6340,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/is-nvidia-building-a-house-of-cards-with-openai-in/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/is-nvidia-building-a-house-of-cards-with-openai-in/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/is-nvidia-building-a-house-of-cards-with-openai-in/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia's (NVDA -0.17%) announcement that it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI is being hailed by the company as a massive bet on the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Still, investors should take a closer look at what is really going on here. The money OpenAI receives will ultimately be plowed right back into Nvidia hardware, mostly through Oracle's cloud buildout, where the two companies recently signed a massive $300 billion deal.
OpenAI plans to deploy Nvidia systems that need 10 gigawatts of power, which is equal to roughly 4 million to 5 million graphics processing units (GPUs). If that sounds like a lot, it is, as it's about the same total number of GPUs that Nvidia will ship this year. The first $10 billion of Nvidia's investment will be deployed as soon as the first gigawatt of capacity is up, and the rest will be rolled out in stages as new data centers come online.
Circular financing
On paper, the OpenAI investment helps secure billions of dollars in future demand. But it's worth remembering that Nvidia is now helping finance one of its biggest customers to keep buying its chips. This is called circular financing.
Nvidia is essentially funding its own demand. This is exactly what Cisco Systems (CSCO 1.19%) did during the internet bubble, when it provided credit to telecoms so they could buy more Cisco routers. Those sales looked great -- until the capital dried up and the entire market collapsed.
This is also a defensive move by Nvidia. More and more of Nvidia's largest customers are designing their own custom AI chips. Alphabet has its TPUs, Amazon has Trainium and Inferentia, and Microsoft is working on its own chip. OpenAI itself has been developing custom chips to bring its costs down, and before this announcement, it placed a $10 billion order with Broadcom for custom chips to be delivered next year.
This is the same threat that Nvidia saw play out in crypto, where ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) displaced GPUs for Bitcoin mining. Nvidia doesn't want to see that happen again. By investing in OpenAI, it's trying to keep one of its biggest customers locked into the Nvidia ecosystem.
This also comes at a time when the market is shifting more toward inference, where Nvidia's moat is much smaller. Training large language models (LLMs) is where Nvidia's CUDA software platform shines. However, inference isn't as complex and doesn't require the same deep software integration. That's why hyperscalers (owners of massive data centers) are so motivated to build custom chips.
Inference is also a continuous cost, so the economics of cost per inference start to dominate the discussion. That's why Nvidia also took a $5 billion stake in Intel and announced a collaboration on AI processors, as it's also trying to stave off Advanced Micro Devices in the inference market and keep its grip on this next phase of AI computing.
Is this a house of cards?
There's no question that Nvidia is in a dominant position right now, and the OpenAI deal only strengthens its near-term outlook. But its OpenAI investment clearly looks like a defensive move that adds risk. When Cisco used circular financing during the internet boom, it looked brilliant, until the customers it was funding went bust.
Both Nvidia and OpenAI are better positioned, but the principle is the same: Nvidia is using its balance sheet to keep demand high. That works as long as the AI boom keeps running, but it makes the company more exposed if spending slows or if hyperscalers switch to cheaper solutions.
Nvidia remains the key player in AI infrastructure, but this deal is a reminder that its growth isn't risk-free. A lot of Nvidia's success is now riding on an unprofitable company that is bleeding massive amounts of cash that it is financing. OpenAI hasn't actually proven yet that it has a great business model, and if it fails, this becomes a house of cards that collapses onto Nvidia."

IDTechEx expects the market for AI chips to exceed $400 billion by 2030.
While graphics processing unit (GPU) leader Nvidia is a popular pick, investors should also consider Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%).
Why Broadcom stock is a long-term buy
One issue for Nvidia is that its chips carry a high cost of ownership. They are the most powerful chips in the world, but they are also power-hungry and expensive. There is growing demand for more affordable chips, which are not as powerful as Nvidia's but are well suited to specific tasks, and that's where Broadcom comes in.
Broadcom expects its AI revenue to reach $120 billion by 2030, up from $20 billion this year. For perspective, its total revenue is $60 billion on a trailing-12-month basis.
Beyond chips, Broadcom also offers advanced networking solutions that allow chips to handle massive data flow for AI training workloads. As CEO Hock Tan recently said at a Goldman Sachs conference, ""The network becomes the computer,"" not just the chip.
Broadcom's offering of specialized AI chips, or XPUs, and networking solutions position the company to meet demand for more intensive compute power. Its total revenue grew 22% year over year last quarter, while AI revenue specifically grew 63%, making up roughly a third of the business.
Broadcom has a long history of delivering operating excellence. The stock is up 2,500% over the last 10 years. Its $120 billion AI revenue target reflects management's confidence in the demand trajectory for AI compute, and importantly, Broadcom's competitive differentiation in the market to capture that opportunity."

With the exception of the five-week COVID-19 crash in February-March 2020, and the roughly nine-month bear market in 2022, the bulls have been in firm control on Wall Street.
The catalyst for this ongoing outperformance primarily rests with Wall Street's trillion-dollar businesses. Think Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Apple, as well as newer trillion-dollar club members Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is also known as TSMC.
All told, just 11 publicly traded companies have ever reached a $1 trillion market cap, not accounting for the effects of inflation, and 10 trade on U.S. exchanges. This includes all members of the ""Magnificent Seven,"" along with Broadcom, TSMC, and billionaire Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway.
While Nvidia appears to have the inside path to retaining its current title as Wall Street's most valuable public company by the turn of the decade, another Mag Seven member is ideally positioned to dethrone Nvidia and leapfrog the likes of Apple and Microsoft along the way.
Despite its AI dominance, Nvidia's spot atop the trillion-dollar pedestal is far from secure
As of the closing bell on Sept. 24, artificial intelligence (AI) titan Nvidia clocked in with a market cap north of $4.3 trillion. It's the first public company to have reached the $4 trillion mark, and is believed to have a chance to surpass a $6 trillion valuation, based on the price targets of Wall Street's most optimistic analysts.
This optimism stems from Nvidia's dominant position as the leader in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) deployed in enterprise data centers. Three generations of advanced AI chips -- Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and now Blackwell Ultra -- have enjoyed insatiable demand and extensive order backlogs.
Aside from clear-cut compute advantages, Nvidia's AI hardware benefits from a persistent lack of AI GPU supply. As long as enterprise demand overwhelms available hardware, Nvidia is going to have no trouble charging a premium for its GPUs and netting a gross margin in excess of 70%.
While these competitive edges would imply that Nvidia's spot atop the trillion-dollar pedestal is secure, historical precedent would beg to differ.
One of the prime threats to Wall Street's largest public company is that every next-big-thing trend dating back more than three decades has eventually navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion. This is to say that investors consistently overestimate the early adoption and real-world utility of next-big-thing innovations. Though AI has undeniable long-term applications, most businesses are nowhere close to optimizing these solutions at present, or have yet to net a positive return on their AI investments.
Competition is something that can't be ignored, either. Even with external competitors lagging Nvidia in compute ability, there's a very real possibility of Wall Street's AI darling losing out on valuable data center real estate and/or being undermined by delayed AI GPU upgrade cycles.
Many of Nvidia's largest customers by net sales are developing AI GPUs to deploy in their data centers. Though these chips won't be competing with Nvidia's hardware externally, they're considerably cheaper to build and more readily accessible. It's a recipe for Nvidia's competitive edge to dwindle in the coming years, and for Wall Street's AI kingpin to cede its title as the most valuable public company.
This will be Wall Street's most valuable public company come 2030
Although Apple or Microsoft would seem to be logical choices to reclaim the top spot that both companies have previously held, dual-industry leader Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) is the trillion-dollar stock that looks to have the best chance to become Wall Street's most valuable company by 2030.
The operating segment that typically introduces consumers to Amazon is its online marketplace. According to estimates from Analyzify, Amazon's e-commerce segment accounts for a 37.6% share of U.S. online retail sales. Amazon's spot as the leading e-commerce giant isn't threatened -- although its operating margin associated with online retail sales tends to be razor thin.
While Amazon's retail operations provide a face for the company, it's a trio of considerably higher-margin ancillary segments that'll be responsible for bulking up the company's operating cash flow in the years to come.
Nothing has more bearing on Amazon's long-term success than cloud infrastructure platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Tech analysis firm Canalys pegged its share of worldwide cloud infrastructure spend at 32% during the second quarter, which is nearly as much as Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud on a combined basis.
AWS has been growing by a high-teens percentage on a year-over-year basis, excluding currency movements. The thinking here is that the inclusion of generative AI solutions and large language model capabilities for AWS clients will only enhance the growth rate for AWS.
As of the June-ended quarter, AWS was pacing more than $123 billion in annual run-rate revenue. Most importantly, AWS is responsible for almost 58% of Amazon's operating income through the first half of 2025 despite accounting for less than 19% of net sales. Even if an AI bubble forms and bursts, application providers like AWS can weather the storm.
The other pieces of the puzzle for Amazon are advertising services and subscription services. When you're drawing billions of people to your site monthly, it's not difficult to command exceptional ad-pricing power.
It also doesn't hurt that Amazon has landed exclusive streaming partnerships with the National Football League and National Basketball Association. When coupled with e-commerce shipping perks and exclusive shopping events, Amazon has plenty of pricing power with its Prime subscription.
Finally, Amazon is historically inexpensive. From 2010 to 2019, Amazon closed out each year between 23 and 37 times trailing-12-month cash flow. Based on Wall Street's consensus, Amazon's cash flow per share is forecast to grow from a reported $11.04 in 2024 to $27.52 in 2029.
In other words, Amazon is valued at only 8 times projected cash flow in 2029, which means it can reasonably add $2.5 trillion to $4 trillion in market value from here and still be trading at a significant discount to its average cash flow multiple during the 2010s."

It debuted on the market with an initial public offering back in March, and it operates in the hot space of artificial intelligence (AI). On top of this, GPU giant Nvidia is one of its backers, both owning a stake in the company and working closely with it.
This up-and-coming cloud computing company has had its share of ups and downs this year, but overall, it has been a winning bet for its early investors. And considering the already high levels of demand for AI capacity and the forecasts for further growth on that front, CoreWeave may have an extremely bright future. Analysts predict the value of the AI market will reach beyond $2 trillion in a few years.
Let's consider how much you would have now if you'd invested $50,000 in CoreWeave at its market launch -- and if the stock still is a buy today.
Access to Nvidia AI chips
So, first, a quick catch-up on the CoreWeave story. The company offers customers the ability to rent access to Nvidia's top graphics processing units (GPUs) for their AI tasks. Customers can rent by the hour, which offers them enormous flexibility, and CoreWeave's focus on building a hardware backbone suitable for AI workloads means its customers are getting high performance and efficiency.
CoreWeave works closely with Nvidia, and has been the first cloud infrastructure provider able to make the AI chip giant's latest wares -- such as GPUs based on its Blackwell architecture and the even newer Blackwell Ultra -- available to customers. That has been a big plus for CoreWeave, as demand for these chips has been high, and customers want access to them as soon as possible.
As mentioned, Nvidia owns a stake in CoreWeave -- 24,277,573 shares to be exact, as of the end of the second quarter. That holding represents 91% of Nvidia's investment portfolio. So, it's clear the chipmaker is optimistic about the business. Reinforcing that premise, Nvidia recently signed an agreement to take on any extra capacity that CoreWeave can't rent out to other customers all the way through 2032. Considering Nvidia's expertise in the world of AI, all of these elements offer good reasons to be bullish on CoreWeave.
Your potential winnings
Now, let's consider where you'd stand if you'd invested $50,000 in CoreWeave on its first day of trading, back in March. It's important to note that the stock didn't immediately take off. It slipped in April along with the rest of the market on concerns about President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports. But the shares later rebounded and have marched higher. Today, that position's value would top $166,000.
That's a fantastic return in such a short period of time. The next question is: Is this stock still a buy at these levels -- or has it reached its full potential for the foreseeable future?
CoreWeave has seen tremendous demand for its computing capacity, and its revenue tripled in its most recently reported quarter. Considering the need for GPUs to drive the next phases of the AI trend, this momentum could continue. Though CoreWeave isn't yet profitable, that isn't surprising at this stage of its story -- and it will have to continue investing in GPUs to provide its customers with what they need. This wouldn't stop me from buying the stock at this point, though it may not be the best choice for cautious or value-oriented investors at the moment.
Yes, this Nvidia-backed player's shares have taken off, but it's offering something that's in high demand now and should remain in high demand in the years to come -- processing capacity for AI workloads -- so it's likely that its revenue growth will continue at a fast pace. And Nvidia's involvement suggests CoreWeave will continue to have early access to the chipmaker's most advanced products.
CoreWeave may not soar by more than 200% over the course of just a few months again, but the company has what it takes to climb further in the quarters and years to come. If you're a growth investor, it would be a great idea to buy and hold shares of this potential AI winner."

The U.S.' move to negotiate with countries and show flexibility relieved some of the tension. Companies went on to generally report strong earnings, and investors maintained optimism that potential interest rate cuts might further support growth.
All this helped the major benchmark take off, led by many of the technology giants and growth players that have soared in recent years -- such as artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia, and software company Palantir Technologies. In fact, the S&P 500 has reached record levels in recent times. Today, it's trading near its highest ever.
But, amid this bright picture, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell just delivered a dire warning to Wall Street. History offers us a strikingly clear picture of what may be next for the stock market and investors.
The Fed's latest moves
Let's consider the Federal Reserve's latest moves. For months, investors had been monitoring both the stock market and economic data and hoping for a fresh cut in interest rates. The Fed initially took action last year, beginning a series of rate cuts in September, but didn't continue that movement until this month. In the first cut this year, on Sept. 17, the Fed lowered its key rate by a quarter point and indicated that two more may be coming before the end of the year.
Investors generally appreciate such moves because lower interest rates are supportive of corporate earnings and overall economic growth. Lower lending rates cut costs for companies that take on debt, and may ease the pressure on individuals who have mortgages or credit card debt, for example. So, this current interest rate momentum, with rates heading lower, is favorable for companies and the stock market.
Amid this positive backdrop, though, trouble could be brewing. In fact, Powell recently pronounced six words that may be seen as a warning to Wall Street.
Speaking about financial conditions, Powell said: ""Equity prices are fairly highly valued."" Though he added that right now isn't ""a time of elevated financial stability risks,"" the warning rings out loud and clear. Stocks have become expensive.
The S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio
We can see this in the S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio, an inflation-adjusted look at stock prices in relation to earnings over a 10-year period. The ratio has reached beyond 37 twice this year -- it's only reached that level two other times since the S&P 500 launched as a 500-company index in the late 1950s.
What happens next? History shows us that every time the Shiller CAPE ratio has reached such a high, the S&P 500 has gone on to fall.
In some instances, this has been a short correction, while in others, it's taken a while for the index to recover and advance. So, if history is a guide, with stocks at historically pricey levels, the S&P 500 could be heading for a decline.
The silver lining
But before you worry about your portfolio losing value, read on. A couple of silver linings exist in this potentially dark cloud. First, we don't know exactly when a pullback will happen -- it could be right around the corner or a year from now -- and it could be short-lived. So, it may not represent a near-term risk, and when it eventually happens, the effects may be limited.
Second -- and this is the most important point -- whenever the next big decline hits, it will be temporary. History also shows us that after every market downturn, and even after major crashes, the S&P 500 has always recovered and eventually climbed to new record highs. We've seen those record highs in recent days.
All of this is fantastic news for long-term investors, because it means that even if your portfolio suffers during a market decline, if you hold on, your investments are likely to recover and deliver positive results over time. This should ease your mind, even after Powell's warning to Wall Street."

A study by the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that the proliferation of this technology could boost productivity and the global gross domestic product by 1.5% in the next decade alone. And it forecasts even greater gains in the decades that will follow.
This explains why companies and governments across the globe are jumping onto the AI bandwagon, attempting to integrate generative AI tools into their operations. That's the reason why demand for cloud computing infrastructure from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle is well exceeding supply.
Cloud computing giants are sitting on an eye-popping backlog
The cloud computing companies mentioned above lease capacity on their infrastructure, enabling their customers to run AI models, design custom applications, and run inference applications. This spares those customers from needing to invest in and maintain expensive hardware.
That cost effectiveness explains why Amazon, Google, and Microsoft reported a combined revenue backlog of $669 billion at the end of the last quarter. Throw in Oracle's remaining performance obligations of $455 billion, and the backlog crosses the trillion-dollar mark. But how can you capitalize on this gigantic opportunity?
These two chip stocks are no-brainer buys
The cloud computing giants mentioned above have been quickly expanding their data center infrastructure so that they can fulfill their massive contracted backlogs. This is requiring them to sharply increase their capital spending. The combined capital outlays of Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are set to jump by 63% to $364 billion in 2025.
High capex can be expected to continue as long as demand for capacity grows. So, it is easy to see why sales of AI-capable chips and accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) are forecast to jump to almost $600 billion next year from an expected $477 billion in 2025.
The simplest way for investors to profit from this wave of spending is by buying shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). Popularly known as TSMC, it is the largest semiconductor foundry in the world, and because it offers the most advanced manufacturing processes, it's the go-to fabricator for almost all the major AI chip designers. Other chips fabricated by TSMC go into consumer electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and gaming consoles.
All this explains why the rapid growth of AI has supercharged TSMC's top line. Its revenue in the first eight months of 2025 was up by 37% year over year. That's faster than the 30% growth it clocked in 2024. TSMC is expecting its AI accelerator revenue to double this year, and during its Q1 earnings call, CEO C.C. Wei predicted that its revenue from AI accelerators would grow at a compound annual percentage rate in the mid-40s for the five-year period starting in 2024.
With TSMC trading at just 24 times forward earnings, and so much more revenue growth clearly visible ahead, the stock is a no-brainer buy.
That brings us to the other company in pole position to capitalize on the massive AI backlog: Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%).
The GPUs designed by Nvidia are the go-to chips for cloud computing giants looking to train and run AI applications in data centers: It dominates the data center GPU market with a 92% share. Its control of that niche has helped it clock impressive growth over the past three years.
In the first six months of its fiscal 2026 (which ended July 27), its revenue rose by 62% year over year to $90.8 billion. It achieved that even though its sales to customers in China have taken a hit due to export restrictions and geopolitical factors. But the growth trend is likely to continue thanks to AI infrastructure projects such as Stargate.
Oracle, for instance, reportedly placed a $40 billion order for Nvidia's GPUs to power a new Stargate data center a few months ago. And now, the chip giant has entered into a strategic partnership worth $100 billion with OpenAI to develop at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. Given that annual spending on AI accelerators is expected to jump by $62 billion in 2026, it won't be surprising for Nvidia's data center business to sustain its healthy pace of growth.
That's expected to translate into solid bottom-line growth for the company despite its massive size.
With Nvidia trading at 40 times forward earnings, a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average earnings multiple of 51, investors can still consider buying this semiconductor stock, as it has the potential to fly higher thanks to the secular growth opportunity in the AI infrastructure space."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-27T17:10:00,"Prediction: These 2 Things, Worth More Than $100 Billion, Will Ensure Nvidia's AI Dominance",Nvidia has built an AI empire over the past few years.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=4baac34e1699391bfd448c4391f528d0688904c9bfc5c540d5f2e779f46a7e34,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/prediction-these-2-things-ensure-nvidia-dominance/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/prediction-these-2-things-ensure-nvidia-dominance/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/prediction-these-2-things-ensure-nvidia-dominance/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has seen earnings climb in the double and triple digits in recent times -- and its stock price soar more than 1,300% in five years. This is a company's and a shareholder's dream scenario, and this dream may be far from over.
That's because Nvidia has established itself as the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader. The company has also expanded into additional products and services. All this has made it the almost unavoidable stop for any customer serious about AI.
Analysts' predictions for market growth suggest that the general environment will be supportive of major AI players -- such as Nvidia -- in the years to come. They forecast that today's billion-dollar AI market will march on to the trillion-dollar mark by the end of the decade. This is great news for Nvidia, but my prediction is that two other things, worth more than $100 billion, will ensure the chip designer's AI dominance over the long run. Let's find out more.
From video games to AI
Nvidia is an AI chip giant today. But its story didn't start out this way. The company initially served the video gaming market with its top-performing graphics processing units (GPUs). Then, as it realized the great potential of these processors, it broadened their usage into other areas. And when AI came along, the match was perfect. Nvidia put the focus on this technology very early in the AI story and built its position as market leader.
Today, AI sales make up the lion's share of Nvidia's revenue, at 88% in the latest quarter. This momentum is likely to continue, as the company's products are the key components to make AI work. For example, its GPUs power essential tasks like the training and inferencing of large language models, and the speed of the Nvidia GPU helps boost its customers' efficiency and overall performance.
Now, let's move along to my prediction. The things above position Nvidia well to succeed in the next phases of the AI growth story. But what may truly ensure its dominance are the following two things, as they show Nvidia partnering with other key players -- instead of fighting them -- to expand its AI empire.
Working with other key players
Just this month, Nvidia announced investments in rival Intel and in customer OpenAI, owner of chatbot ChatGPT. Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel common stock and leverage Intel's platform to boost its own offerings. As part of the deal, Nvidia will integrate Intel's top central processing units (CPUs) into its AI systems, and Intel will integrate Nvidia GPU chiplets into its personal computer (PC) platforms. So Nvidia will gain the world's top CPUs and greater exposure to the PC market.
The OpenAI deal involves Nvidia investing as much as $100 billion in the AI research lab as it builds out infrastructure. That investment may support OpenAI's purchase of Nvidia GPUs, making this an enormous profit engine. Even better, this move ensures that one of the world's most powerful AI players will remain a significant Nvidia customer over time. This is particularly key now, as the AI buildout is unfolding worldwide.
What does this mean for you?
What does all this mean for you as an investor? If you were worried about Nvidia losing ground to competitors at this stage of the AI story, you might now breathe a sigh of relief. Though rivals may carve out a share of business and succeed -- after all, this is a massive market -- Nvidia is well positioned to continue leading the pack.
This means that Nvidia stock looks very reasonably priced today at 39x forward earnings estimates, making it a solid buy for investors aiming to get in on tomorrow's AI success story. If you're already a shareholder, you might want to hold on for the next chapters.
As I said, Nvidia has already been a winner in the AI market, but the great gains in earnings and stock performance that we've seen don't mean the adventure is over. There is plenty of room to run over the long term. My prediction is that Nvidia's move to include other market leaders in its fold, rather than shut them out, may be the key to its ongoing dominance."

These companies are responsible for designing the high-performance chips and networking hardware powering next-generation data centers at an unprecedented scale.
Operating more quietly in the background, however, is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). While TSMC (as it is also known) is less flashy than its peers in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, the company's supporting role is nonetheless mission-critical.
As the world's largest chip foundry by revenue -- with almost 70% market share -- TSMC is the manufacturer behind many of the AI industry's most advanced processors. Its dominance has left rivals like Intel struggling to catch up, with meaningful market share gains appearing more like a pipe dream than measurable reality.
But in a surprising twist, Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a big break for one of those rivals, Samsung Electronics (SSNL.F 9.01%), giving its investors some much-needed optimism. The announcement raises an important question: Will Samsung's latest win usher in a new era of growth and pose a serious challenge to TSMC's supremacy?
Why Samsung's deal with Tesla matters
In late July, Musk announced on X that Tesla had signed a $16.5 billion agreement with Samsung to produce its next-generation inference chip, known as the AI6. Samsung will be manufacturing these chips at a new foundry in Texas, strategically positioning the company closer to Tesla's headquarters and reinforcing its footprint beyond South Korea.
Tesla's upcoming innovations -- most notably its Robotaxi platform and Optimus humanoid robot -- will demand highly sophisticated chip designs and huge computing capacity to function. This makes securing advanced foundry services essential for the company's ambitions in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.
How does Samsung's relationship with Tesla impact TSMC?
At first glance, a deal of this magnitude might look like a major setback for TSMC. The reality, however, is more nuanced.
Musk clarified that TSMC will manufacture the predecessor chip to the AI6 -- aptly called the AI5. In other words, Tesla is deliberately engaging with multiple foundry partners as a strategic, cautious hedge aimed at reducing supply chain risk and ensuring redundancy.
While Samsung's win provides a boost of credibility to its lagging foundry business, analysts at Morgan Stanley said that the deal is unlikely to meaningfully dent TSMC's dominance or serve as a material headwind to its long-term revenue and earnings potential.
Moreover, as TSMC continues to invest in its own infrastructure here in the U.S., the company remains on secure footing to deepen its ties with AI's biggest spenders even further.
Has Samsung delivered a checkmate against its fiercest rival?
Samsung investors have gained tangible proof that strengthens the company's long-term prospects, but TSMC's durable technological position remains supported by entrenched scale, advanced processor leadership, and deep customer relationships. For now, this deal underscores that Samsung can still compete for landmark contracts and carve out relevance in an industry where TSMC's gold-standard reputation remains firmly intact.
At a more macro level, the deal also signals that as AI applications become increasingly more sophisticated, leading enterprises like Tesla are keen on maintaining choice by diversifying key manufacturing partners to ensure stability, flexibility, and supply chain resilience.
For investors, the larger takeaway is clear: Samsung's relationship with Tesla illustrates that the company is capable of winning meaningful battles. Nevertheless, TSMC is still ahead.
Rather than a checkmate, this development looks more like a fleeting stalemate at best -- a dynamic that will continue to evolve as global demand for next-generation chip architectures accelerates and further intensifies the foundry race."

It is easy to see why hands are hovering over the ‘buy’ button, but also why some might pause for a deeper look given the rollercoaster ride over the past five years, which actually still leaves the stock at a 37.2% loss across that longer stretch.
What’s pushing the stock higher? Part of it seems to be shifting sentiment about Alibaba’s growth prospects, especially as the company leans into cutting-edge technology. The recent news that Alibaba is integrating Nvidia’s AI development tools into its cloud platform has certainly caught market attention, fueling optimism about the company’s ability to compete in high-growth arenas.
So, is Alibaba undervalued, overvalued, or just right? By the numbers, Alibaba scores a 4 out of 6 on key valuation tests, which is a strong signal among its large-cap tech peers. This does not guarantee future performance, but it means the market may not be fully recognizing the company’s strategic moves, at least, not yet.
Up next, I will break down which valuation checks Alibaba passes and which it does not. And if you really want to get ahead, you will want to see the one approach smart investors have been turning to for a richer understanding of value. More on that at the end of this article.
Approach 1: Alibaba Group Holding Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company’s value by projecting its future free cash flows and then discounting them back to today’s value. This method is especially useful for large, cash-generating businesses like Alibaba Group Holding, which reports its financials in Chinese Yuan (CN¥).
Currently, Alibaba’s last twelve months Free Cash Flow stands at approximately CN¥83.1 billion. Analyst forecasts indicate this figure could rise significantly over the next decade, with projections for 2028 reaching around CN¥140.9 billion. Further long-term estimates, extrapolated by Simply Wall St, show continued growth each year.
Based on these forward cash flow projections and discounting them appropriately, the DCF model calculates an intrinsic fair value for Alibaba stock of CN¥173.01 per share. When compared to the current share price, this suggests the stock trades at a 0.6% discount to its fair value. This implies the market is very nearly in sync with experts' assessment of Alibaba’s true worth."

Volkswagen Investment Narrative Recap
For investors to remain committed to Volkswagen, they need confidence in the company’s ability to overcome near-term volatility in electric vehicle demand and navigate global trade pressures. The recent temporary EV plant closures reflect heightened exposure to both of these issues, which have quickly become the primary short-term catalysts and risks for the stock; any recovery will likely hinge on how rapidly Volkswagen can realign production and protect margins as competition and policy changes bite. For now, the operational impact appears material, as it directly affects key profit drivers and future growth narratives.
One relevant announcement was Volkswagen’s reaffirmation of its 2025 earnings guidance, including flat sales revenue expectations despite these new headwinds. The move suggests management is focused on cost control and capital allocation, but the forecast signals that near-term earnings may come under further strain as EV launches are delayed and production is curtailed. The ability to stick to guidance in the face of shifting demand and tariffs will be closely watched as a signal of operational resilience.

Acadia Healthcare Company Investment Narrative Recap
To own Acadia Healthcare, an investor needs confidence in the long-term growth of behavioral health services, steady reimbursement, and the company’s ability to convert expansion into meaningful earnings. The recent push from Engine Capital for operational and governance changes adds urgency around execution and capital allocation but does not appear to materially alter the primary short-term catalyst, which is improving management stability and operational efficiency. The most prominent risk remains ongoing regulatory investigations and substantial legal costs, which could weigh on earnings if unresolved.
The announcement of a board-authorized share repurchase plan for up to US$300,000,000, along with completed buybacks in recent months, stands out as timely given Engine Capital’s call for capital returns and operational discipline. This move aligns with shareholder interests by returning capital and supporting the stock price, but ongoing questions around legal risks and execution remain important for the near term.
On the flip side, investors should also be aware that ongoing legal and regulatory investigations...

Instead, you'll want to find a company with an enduring business model, strong competitive advantage, and a clear path to long-term growth on the top and bottom lines. One stock that fits all three of those categories is Arm Holdings (ARM 1.33%), which is best known for licensing its CPU architecture to partners like Nvidia and Apple.
Why Arm is a good long-term bet
Arm has a unique business model in the semiconductor sector. Rather than designing chips or even manufacturing them, the company licenses its CPU designs, collecting money from both a licensing fee and then royalties when the product containing that license sells.
That's been a winning, high-margin business model for Arm, even if it means it doesn't collect as much revenue as it would if it were designing the chips entirely.
It also shows how the company is set up well for long-term growth. First, the company's CPU architecture is much better at conserving battery power than the competing x86 platform from Intel and AMD. That's why Arm has more than 99% market share of the smartphone market, and its market share is growing in data centers, where power is also at a premium.
Arm's royalties also last for a long time. In fact, half of the royalties it's collecting now come from designs that are more than 10 years old. The company continues to innovate, and it's now getting into chip design and more complex products like system-on-chip (SoC) licenses.
However, its technological advantage in CPU architecture and the strength of its royalty model should ensure that the company continues to grow. It has benefited from the AI boom and will continue to do so, but its advantages make it more resilient than many of its peers."

These 10 hidden gems don't build foundation models or design AI chips -- they apply existing AI technology to transform inefficient industries and outdated processes.
From insurance underwriting to drug discovery, each company uses AI as a competitive weapon rather than a marketing buzzword. Here's why these 10 under-the-radar names deserve attention from growth investors seeking the next wave of AI winners.
The enterprise automation enabler
Freshworks (FRSH -0.63%) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for customer support, IT service management, and customer relationship management (CRM) with over 68,000 global customers. Its Freddy AI features make enterprise-style automation accessible to small and midsize businesses, a segment often overlooked by giants like Salesforce and ServiceNow. The company's mid-teens revenue growth and improving margins suggest the AI strategy is gaining traction, though profitability remains elusive.
The healthcare disruptor
Oscar Health (OSCR -0.29%) is a tech-enabled health insurer focused on simplifying member and provider interactions. Its new Superagent AI assistant promises to cut service costs and improve speed, giving it a disruptive edge in a notoriously inefficient industry. With healthcare costs spiraling and administrative burden crushing providers, Oscar's AI-first approach could capture significant market share if execution delivers on the promise.
The education transformer
Nerdy (NRDY -1.77%) runs Varsity Tutors and an AI-powered Live + AI platform that scales tutoring and education services. With school districts piloting AI tutors, the stock taps into the edtech wave of personalized, automated learning. The company's ability to blend human expertise with AI scalability creates a differentiated model in the $100 billion tutoring market.
The insurance innovator
Lemonade (LMND -0.10%) is a digital insurance company using AI bots to underwrite policies, answer claims, and handle customer onboarding. Its automation could expand margins if loss ratios stabilize, making it an intriguing bet on AI in financial services. The challenge remains proving that AI can actually improve underwriting accuracy while maintaining the rapid growth that justifies its valuation.
The biotech revolutionary
Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX 15.28%) is a biotech that uses AI and massive proprietary datasets to accelerate drug discovery. Its supercomputer-scale partnership with Nvidia positions it as a potential leader in AI-driven therapeutics. While the market cap of around $2 billion reflects significant speculation, successful clinical trials could validate the AI approach and trigger explosive gains.
The defense intelligence provider
BigBear.ai (BBAI -4.66%) provides decision intelligence platforms and analytics for the U.S. Department of Defense and industrial clients. As defense digitization accelerates, its AI-based mission planning and predictive systems give it a clear growth angle. Government contract volatility and execution risks make this suitable only for investors comfortable with lumpy revenue patterns.
The product optimization platform
Amplitude (AMPL -0.49%) delivers product analytics software that helps companies optimize user engagement and conversion. Its new AI agents generate insights and suggest experiments automatically, appealing to investors betting on AI-enhanced analytics. Competition from Adobe and free alternatives creates pricing pressure, but the product-focused approach maintains differentiation.
The incident response accelerator
PagerDuty (PD) is a DevOps and IT incident management platform used by thousands of enterprises. Its AI assistant and automation tools shorten incident response times, creating a measurable return on investment (ROI) that resonates with enterprise buyers. The company's shift toward AI-driven operations positions it well as businesses demand faster resolution of increasingly complex technical issues.
The customer experience orchestrator
Sprinklr (CXM 1.13%) operates a unified customer experience management platform used by global brands. Its AI tools for listening, insights, and engagement put it at the center of how companies interact with customers in the AI era. Customers include global brands such as McDonald's and Nike, giving Sprinklr the scale to benefit from AI adoption across marketing departments.
The data infrastructure play
Innodata (INOD 9.43%) provides data engineering, content services, and AI training data sets for large enterprises and AI developers. As demand for high-quality training data soars, its niche infrastructure role makes it a hidden beneficiary of AI adoption.
The hidden gem portfolio
These 10 stocks won't compete with Nvidia for AI supremacy, but they don't need to. Each applies AI to solve specific business problems, creating defensible niches in massive markets. The risks vary widely -- Lemonade and Oscar face insurance industry headwinds, Recursion depends on clinical trial success, and BigBear relies on government contracts. Spreading capital across multiple hidden gems reduces single-stock blow-up risk while maintaining exposure to AI's practical applications."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-27T10:30:00,Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Go Stratospheric Driven by an Ultra-Competitive Race to Achieve Artificial Superintelligence,"Nvidia's plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI should speed up the race to achieve artificial superintelligence, which in turn should further ramp up demand for Nvidia's AI-enabling products.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=cbbf72063e0772646f06bcee96d6c8c4cc7a61ebed0286d5a1532c8643d443a7,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/nvda-stock-openai-investment-ai-superintelligence/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/nvda-stock-openai-investment-ai-superintelligence/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/27/nvda-stock-openai-investment-ai-superintelligence/,fool.com,200,,"Don't fret if you've been eyeing Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) stock and thinking you've missed your opportunity to invest in the artificial intelligence (AI) technology juggernaut. Nvidia stock still has not just great -- but fantastic -- long-term growth potential left.
Nvidia's main growth driver for a while will be the continued strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and related tech to enable generative AI. (Generative AI is the type of AI that caused a sensation in the tech world when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022.) Some specific applications of generative AI that will fuel this growth include customer service operations, driverless vehicles, and the early stages of developing useful humanoid robots.
But Nvidia's primary growth driver over the long term will be something that gets little coverage: the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) and then artificial superintelligence (ASI).
What are artificial general intelligence and artificial superintelligence?
You can think of there being a continuum from generative AI -- the type of AI that's now being rapidly adopted -- to artificial general intelligence (AGI) to artificial superintelligence (ASI).
Generative AI has amazing capabilities and represents a huge technological leap. It excels at pattern recognition and other forms of concrete thinking. But it can't match human-level critical thinking and true creativity. That isn't surprising since generative AI is trained on data that already exists in this world. Moreover, even the best generative AI models are prone to ""AI hallucinations,"" which are incorrect or misleading results presented with confidence.
Going from generative AI to AGI will be the next huge technological leap. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that would at least match average human capabilities across virtually all cognitive tasks.
The meaning of artificial superintelligence is easy to grasp from its name. This tech will be super-intelligent, or significantly brainier than even the smartest humans across nearly every cognitive task.
When do experts believe AGI will be reached?
AI researchers generally believe achieving AGI is inevitable. Research firm AI Multiple's recently released macroanalysis found that the average AI researcher prediction for when AGI will be achieved is 2040, or in 15 years.
Prior to the rollout of AI models powered by generative AI (which started in late 2022), the average prediction was 2060. This data illustrates how much the advent of generative AI advanced the capabilities of AI.
Entrepreneurs are even more optimistic, according to the analysis. On average, they predict AGI will be achieved in 2030, or in just five years.
Achieving artificial superintelligence is further in the future, so predictions provide limited value.
Nvidia's tech is a must in the race to achieve AGI and ASI
Currently, Nvidia's dominance in the global AI semiconductor -- or ""chip"" -- market points to its GPUs and associated technology being must-haves for companies aiming to achieve AGI and ASI. These companies likely include all the big tech leaders (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft), Tesla and other large tech companies, OpenAI, and many other AI native start-ups.
Let's address a topic that Nvidia stock bears like to point out: All the big tech companies and Tesla have developed or are developing their own AI chips. These are for internal use and, in some cases, for use in their cloud computing services, which also offer Nvidia's GPUs. But as suggested by the category name of these chips -- application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) -- they are only ideal for specific applications.
GPUs -- and Nvidia's GPUs, in particular -- remain the gold standard for the overall training of AI models and deployment of AI applications. And there is no indication that Nvidia's dominance of this humongous and rapidly growing market will end anytime soon.
Nvidia's planned OpenAI investment should accelerate the race to achieve artificial superintelligence, which will benefit Nvidia
On Monday, Nvidia announced that it's investing up to $100 billion ($100 billion!) in OpenAI. The gist of this announcement:
OpenAI and Nvidia ... [plan] to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI's next-generation AI infrastructure to train and run its next generation of models on the path to deploying superintelligence. [Emphasis mine.]
To support this deployment including data center and power capacity, Nvidia intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new Nvidia systems are deployed. The first phase is targeted to come online in the second half of 2026 using the Nvidia Vera Rubin platform.
Putting $100 billion in context, it's nearly twice as much cash and equivalents as Nvidia had on its balance sheet at the end of its most recently reported quarter. It's also more cash and equivalents than each of the other ""Magnificent Seven"" companies (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Tesla) had on its books. (This doesn't mean Nvidia will be using up all its cash. The OpenAI investment will be over multiple years. Moreover, Nvidia generates powerful cash flows. Over the last year, its cash flow from operations was $77 billion.)
Tech billionaires are an ultra-competitive bunch, so Nvidia's massive planned investment in OpenAI should accelerate the race to achieve AGI and ASI. And this will benefit Nvidia and its stock, as companies ferociously pour even more money into buying Nvidia's AI-enabling infrastructure."

President Donald Trump has never hidden his antipathy for clean energy, solar and wind investments, but what's happening in U.S. markets since April is delivering results that few, even his fiercest critics, saw coming.
From the market's April 4 bottom through Sept. 25, no industry has posted more substantial gains than clean energy.
The Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (NYSE: PBW) has surged 118%, beating out tech, artificial intelligence stocks and even the gold miners that are on top of the 2025’s leaderboard.
Notably, the performance of renewable stocks has even outperformed Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has rallied 85% since April’s lows.
Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
During this period, Trump has continued his attacks on renewables.
On Aug. 20 he posted on Truth Social: ""Any state that has built and relied on windmills and solar for power is seeing record-breaking increases in electricity and energy costs. The scam of the century! We will not approve wind or solar projects that harm farmers. The days of stupidity are over in the USA.""
Just days ago, during his Sept. 23 address to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump called climate change a ""scam"" and said the concept of a ""carbon footprint"" is a ""con job.""
Despite that rhetoric, investors are flocking to renewable energy names.
The Clean Energy Stocks Trump Can't Ignore
Several companies in the renewable and battery storage space have seen their share prices skyrocket since early April:
-
Amprius Technologies (NYSE: AMPX), which develops advanced silicon-anode batteries, is up 359%.
-
Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE: BE), a fuel cell technology company, has soared 302%.
-
MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), the largest U.S. producer of rare earth materials crucial for EV motors and wind turbines, has jumped 251%.
-
QuantumScape Corp. (NYSE: QS), working on solid-state batteries, has gained 231%.

You don't see them, yet they're the brains that power almost every electronic device that we interact with daily. And there's nobody better at manufacturing semiconductors than the appropriately named Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 3.22%), also known as TSMC.
TSMC is the world's leading semiconductor foundry by a large margin. It has around a 70% market share, while second-place Samsung's market share is only around 7%. The foundry model means that TSMC doesn't make chips for general sale. Instead, companies will design the chips they need for their products, and TSMC will use its manufacturing ability to bring them to life.
At the time of this writing, TSMC's market cap is around $1.4 trillion. To hit the $2 trillion mark by 2028, it would need to average around 14% annual returns over the next few years. You should never use past performances to predict future ones, but given the company's growth prospects and its 29% average annual returns over the past decade, I'm confident it can happen.
TSMC's role in the AI ecosystem
TSMC isn't your typical artificial intelligence (AI) stock in the sense that it has a generative AI app or other software people interact with. Yet its role in the AI ecosystem is as important as almost any stock you can name.
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Alphabet all design chips and other hardware that power data centers, which are essentially the backbones of training and developing AI models. Yet most of this wouldn't be possible without TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability.
When it comes to manufacturing advanced AI chips, TSMC is essentially the only go-to. Without it, you could make a valid argument that data centers would be less efficient, which means that AI training would be less efficient, which means many of the AI applications we interact with today would be less capable and scalable.
TSMC is improving its profit and margins
TSMC has long been an impressive moneymaker, but it has stepped it up a lot in the past few years. In the second quarter, it made $30 billion in revenue, which was up 44% year over year and close to 18% higher than the first quarter. If its third-quarter revenue falls between $31.8 billion and $33 billion, as it predicts, that will represent between 35% and 40% year-over-year growth.
In Nvidia's latest earnings report, it noted that it expects $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure through 2030. With TSMC being a key part of AI infrastructure, this should be music to the company's ears.
The revenue growth is impressive, but TSMC's expanding margins may be the most noteworthy. Since last year, its profit margin has expanded from 36.8% to 42.7%, gross margin has expanded from 53.2% to 56.8%, and operating margin has expanded from 42.5% to 49.6%.
These expanding margins are a testament to TSMC's ability to command premium pricing because of its advanced manufacturing ability, and its customers knowing that it's essentially their only choice if they want the most powerful chips.
TSMC is trading at a good value for long-term investors
TSMC is currently trading at around 23.5 times its projected earnings for the next 12 months. It's not ""cheap"" by most standards, but it also seems like a good value for a company that's as dominant as TSMC and has its growth potential.
TSMC's advanced manufacturing ability isn't something that can be easily caught up to and replicated because it takes many years of experience and billions invested into research and equipment. That gives it a competitive advantage that's likely to last for quite a while, especially because it's not easy for its customers to switch manufacturers without risking performance or reliability.
That edge gives me confidence that TSMC can enter the $2 trillion club within the next few years."

Quantum machines employ the properties of quantum mechanics to deliver potent processing power beyond the ability of current classical computers.
D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 4.13%) is one of the companies at the forefront of applying quantum computing to AI. But is it a better AI investment than Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), a leader of today's artificial intelligence revolution?
Arriving at an answer requires digging deeper into both companies and understanding their respective approaches to advancing artificial intelligence.
D-Wave's marriage of AI and quantum computing
D-Wave is developing annealing quantum computers, a method to identify the best solution among many possible choices. The company demonstrated the strength of this approach by using it to complete complex calculations in minutes that would have taken 1 million years on classical supercomputers.
D-Wave released an AI toolkit this year, allowing software developers to tap into its quantum computers. The company described the achievement as ""a milestone in quantum AI development."" These tools integrate D-Wave's quantum systems with PyTorch, a leading framework for building AI models.
Leveraging quantum devices for AI can significantly lower the rapidly increasing cost of building AI models. This approach also harnesses the superior computational power of quantum computers. Research centers in Germany, Canada, and Japan have achieved AI improvements using D-Wave's quantum machines.
The company's technological advances contributed to second-quarter revenue growing 42% year over year to $3.1 million. That said, Q2 operating expenses soared 41% year over year to $28.5 million, resulting in an operating loss of $26.5 million.
Nvidia's AI advances
Nvidia's state-of-the art semiconductor chips helped to kick off the current wave of generative AI applications, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Its latest chip technology, called Blackwell, is pushing the boundaries of what classical computers can do.
Blackwell was designed to support the largest, most complex AI models. To do so, Nvidia fused multiple semiconductor chips together into a superchip, which lives in a rack holding other components that collectively weigh over a ton. Each rack is a single, massive computer processor.
Blackwell is so powerful, Nvidia is using it to bridge classical and quantum computers. Users can create quantum software applications through Blackwell without needing access to a quantum machine.
Nvidia envisions a period where quantum and classical computers depend on each other. Currently, quantum devices face significant hurdles, such as calculation errors, which hinder widespread adoption. Nvidia sees the Blackwell platform working in concert with quantum computers to overcome these challenges.
Blackwell production began in late 2024, and it's selling well. In the company's fiscal Q2, ended July 27, Blackwell sales rose 17% over Q1, contributing to Q2 revenue growing 56% year over year to $46.7 billion. This success resulted in operating income climbing 53% year over year to $28.4 billion.
Making a choice between D-Wave Quantum and Nvidia stocks
At this point, Nvidia's Blackwell platform is keeping pace with D-Wave in the race to power increasingly potent AI. However, shares of D-Wave have seen the greater gains in 2025, surging over 200% through the week ending Sept. 19, helped by the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. Nvidia's stock was up more than 30% in that time, a robust gain in its own right.
But aside from the technological advances each company is making, another factor to consider is share valuation. Since D-Wave isn't a profitable business, valuation can be assessed using the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.
Since D-Wave's share price took off recently, its P/S ratio has skyrocketed, and the chart reveals it's now more than 10 times higher than Nvidia's. This indicates D-Wave stock is expensive by comparison.
Although quantum computing's potential is exciting, it's a nascent technology with significant challenges to overcome. It's too early to tell whether D-Wave's tech or a competitor's will win over the long run.
In addition, D-Wave's rising operating loss compared to its minimal revenue will eventually put the company in financial trouble if it doesn't reverse. Meanwhile, Blackwell's help to address quantum computing's shortcomings means Nvidia can partner with D-Wave, as well as other quantum computing companies.
Nvidia's AI tech, measured approach to a quantum computing transition, profitable and growing business, and better share price valuation make it the superior AI investment over D-Wave.
On top of these advantages, Nvidia recently announced multibillion-dollar investments in Intel and OpenAI to build out infrastructure for artificial intelligence, further strengthening its offerings. Nvidia is firing on all cylinders, making it a great long-term investment in AI."

The $8.9 billion purchase of Intel (INTC) shares makes the embattled chip manufacturer, which has fallen behind its competitors amid the AI boom, a partially state-owned enterprise. That’s far more common in places like China and Europe, but it may not be a rarity in the U.S. for long.

Making Intel great again
The decision to give Intel taxpayer money did not originate with the Trump administration.
The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act signed by President Joe Biden awarded Intel about $8 billion in grants to support its manufacturing expansion plans and strengthen national security. It was also awarded $3.2 billion as part of the Secure Enclave program.
The company has been paid $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants but needed to meet certain milestones to receive the remaining $6 billion, which was looking unlikely.
What the Trump administration has done is rewritten the terms of the deal.
In an Aug. 25 post [1] captioned “The Art of the Deal: Intel,” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said the president decided it would be “fair” if “America had shares” in Intel in exchange for the monetary support, which in total comes to $11.1 billion."

The stock's rapid rise has been fueled by its fast-improving revenue pipeline, but at the same time, investors have been worried about certain factors.
From CoreWeave's rapidly rising debt to stock dilution on account of its $9 billion Core Scientific deal, shares of the company have slipped significantly since hitting a high nearly three months ago. However, the company's latest deal with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could help assuage investors' concerns to some extent and set CoreWeave up for more upside.
Nvidia's guarantee is great news for CoreWeave investors
CoreWeave has built its business by offering dedicated artificial intelligence (AI) data centers powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. It rents out its cloud computing capacity to the likes of Meta Platforms and Microsoft, which account for the majority of its top line. It has also added a third big customer in the form of OpenAI.
The ChatGPT maker offered an initial contract worth $11.9 billion to CoreWeave in March this year, before enhancing the size of the deal by another $4 billion. And now, Nvidia has signed a $6.3 billion contract with CoreWeave that will guarantee the latter's revenue growth in the long run. Under this agreement, Nvidia will be purchasing any unsold data center capacity from CoreWeave through April 2032.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), CoreWeave pointed out that ""Nvidia is obligated to purchase the residual unsold capacity"" of its data centers in case its ""data center capacity is not fully utilized by its own customers."" CoreWeave's existing data center capacity is falling short of demand.
CFO Nitin Agrawal remarked on the August earnings conference call that CoreWeave's ""growth continues to be capacity-constrained, with demand outstripping supply."" This is evident from the fact that its contractual backlog increased by close to $14 billion year over year in Q2, driven by the multibillion-dollar contracts the company signed in the quarter.
For comparison, CoreWeave's Q2 revenue increased to $1.2 billion from $395 million in the year-ago period. Not surprisingly, the company is laser-focused on bringing online more data center capacity so that it can fulfill its massive revenue backlog worth $30 billion. It currently operates 33 dedicated AI data centers in the U.S. and Europe, with active power capacity of 470 megawatts (MW).
However, it has been increasing its contracted data center power capacity at a nice clip so that it can bring more active capacity online. Specifically, CoreWeave's contracted data center power capacity increased by 600 MW in the previous quarter to 2.2 gigawatts (GW). But even that might not be enough in the long run, as according to McKinsey, data center capacity demand could grow by 4x between 2023 and 2030.
The firm estimates that global data center capacity demand could hit 220 GW in 2030 from 55 GW in 2023 in a midrange scenario. So there is a good chance that CoreWeave could remain capacity-constrained in the long run thanks to the AI-powered data center boom. For instance, McKinsey is expecting a deficit of more than 15 GW in data center power capacity in the U.S. itself by 2030.
As such, CoreWeave may not be left with any residual capacity to sell to Nvidia going forward, as there is a good chance that data center demand will continue to be stronger than supply on account of AI. And now, Nvidia's guarantee gives CoreWeave investors an extra cushion that should ensure healthy long-term growth for the company, even if there's a drop in AI computing capacity requirements.
What should investors do?
Nvidia's guarantee suggests that the demand for AI computing is likely to remain robust in the long run. This should ideally translate into a bigger backlog and stronger growth for CoreWeave, which is just what analysts are expecting from the company through 2028.
The massive opportunity in the cloud AI infrastructure market should help CoreWeave sustain impressive growth rates beyond 2028. For instance, even if it clocks 20% annual top-line growth in 2029 and 2030, its revenue could hit $25.6 billion. If the stock is trading at even 5 times sales at that time, in line with the Nasdaq Composite's average sales multiple, its market cap could get close to $130 billion. That would be more than double CoreWeave's current market cap.
Importantly, CoreWeave can now be bought at 16 times sales, which isn't all that expensive when we consider its remarkable growth.
So investors looking to capitalize on the AI cloud infrastructure market's long-term growth potential can consider buying this AI stock right away, especially considering that the Nvidia deal is a vote of confidence in CoreWeave's -- and the AI data center market's -- prospects."

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.
The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.
A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.
“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.
“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”
A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.
“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.
Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations."

NVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry over the past year (+46.4% vs. +41.8%). NVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues.
However, a limited supply of Blackwell GPUs may hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins.

Yet another compound growth story is unfolding in the world of big tech that it would be easy to overlook. With a market-leading cloud computing business, a high-margin advertising business, and a faster, automated logistics network that continues to lower costs, Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) may soon take the investing world by surprise. Here's why Amazon's market capitalization could cross $5 trillion by 2030.
Impressive financial performance
Amazon's recent financial results have been impressive. In the second quarter, revenues were up 12% year over year to $167.7 billion, while operating income surged 31% to $19.2 billion. Its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), saw revenues grow 17.5% to $30.9 billion, while advertising revenues were up 22% to $15.7 billion. Amazon has also generated a robust $18.2 billion free cash flow in the last four reported quarters.
Management expects revenues to fall in the range of $174 billion to $179.5 billion in the third quarter, including a modest positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations.
AWS Strength
Amazon is the leader in the global cloud infrastructure market with a 30% share, and AWS will continue to benefit from the transition of more IT work from on-premises infrastructure to cloud-based systems. Currently, an estimated 85% to 90% of IT spending goes to on-premises systems, but that mix is set to shift as the adoption of AI accelerates. AWS is also well positioned to capitalize on the increasing shift of enterprise AI spending from model training to inference workloads -- the real-time deployment of AI models. Eventually, inference is expected to account for nearly 80% to 90% of total AI costs as pilot projects advance into commercial use.
Generative AI inference is also expected to become a standard service, similar to computing, storage, or databases. We can expect that companies will prefer to run these workloads in the same cloud regions as their other applications and enterprise data. Since there are more applications running on AWS than anywhere else, and vast amounts of enterprise data are stored there, it could become the preferred cloud computing platform for inference workloads.
AWS is also pushing down its AI costs. Management claims that its custom Trainium2 chip delivers approximately 30% to 40% better price performance for inference than other chipmakers' GPUs. Anthropic is training its next Claude models on Trainium2, and Amazon Bedrock uses it for inference. The company is also working on the third iteration of the Trainium chip, which is expected to be even more effective for computing and inference workloads. Based on all that, the price-performance edge could become a long-term differentiator for AWS.
AWS clocked an impressive annualized revenue run rate of $123 billion as of the end of the second quarter. The cloud computing business also had an incredible backlog of $195 billion, up 25% year over year, giving it significant visibility into its future revenues. Additionally, management expects demand to keep outpacing available capacity. These conditions are expected to improve in the next several quarters.
Advertising business
Amazon's advertising offerings, spanning its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch, Fire TV, and live sports, help advertisers reach an audience of more than 300 million people in the U.S.
In June, Amazon partnered with Roku to give advertisers using the Amazon demand-side platform access to over 80 million connected TV households in the U.S. Amazon has also integrated its demand-side platform with Disney's real-time ad exchange, thereby giving advertisers direct programmatic access to premium ad inventory on platforms such as Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu. With access to customers' identity, Amazon's shopping signals, and premium streaming inventory, advertisers will be better able to effectively target the audiences they're aiming for. This, in turn, is expected to boost the advertising business in the coming quarters.
Improving retail margins
Amazon is focusing on improving its retail margins, too. It reorganized its U.S. logistics network around a regional structure, placing inventory closer to customers, increasing direct lanes, and enhancing product consolidation. All of this cut miles and human touches out of the process, speeding delivery and lowering costs. Combined with large-scale automation and robotics, including its DeepFleet AI system, the retail business is on a path to higher margins
How will Amazon become a $5 trillion company?
Amazon trades today at a cheap valuation of just 3.7 times sales. To become a $5 trillion company, it would not need to expand its valuation multiples to unsustainable levels.
If AWS continues to grow revenues at a low-to-mid-teens percentage as its capacity increases and inference workloads ramp up, advertising grows at a rate in the high-teens to 20% due to robust connected TV partnerships, and retail margins improve thanks to the benefits of the regional network and automation, Amazon will have a potent revenue mix and enhanced margins. While AWS and the advertising business will boost profitability, the retail segment will help reduce the company's cost to serve customers -- translating into higher profit margins, robust cash flows, and better visibility. That setup is far stronger than Amazon enjoyed when its valuation peaked at around 4.6 times sales earlier in the decade. Back then, its advertising business was smaller, its AI opportunity was limited, and its logistics were far less efficient.
Now, we can expect the company to be trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 5 to 7 by 2030, reflecting the blended effect of higher multiples for its cloud computing and advertising businesses, and lower multiples attributed to the slower growth of its retail business. The company can trade at even higher multiples if it continues its leadership in AI inference.
Analysts expect Amazon's revenues will be nearly $1.15 trillion in 2030. Assuming that P/S multiple expands to even 5, then we can expect Amazon's market capitalization to be almost $5.75 trillion by 2030 -- well above the $5 trillion mark."

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-26T19:40:24,What’s behind the massive AI data center headlines?,"This week on Equity, Anthony Ha and Max Zeff go beyond the headlines to break down what's really going on in these AI infrastructure deals.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=37c40011381ed40a834dbccf665179872045d27d17d2575c377844ffe63c6a5e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/behind-massive-ai-data-center-194024855.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/behind-massive-ai-data-center-194024855.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/behind-massive-ai-data-center-194024855.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Silicon Valley flooded the news this week with headlines about wild AI infrastructure investments.
Nvidia said it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. Then OpenAI said it would build out five more Stargate AI data centers with Oracle and SoftBank, adding gigawatts of new capacity online in the coming years. And it was later revealed that Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds to pay for these data centers.
On their own, each deal is dizzying in scale. But in aggregate, we see how Silicon Valley is moving heaven and earth to give OpenAI enough power to train and serve future versions of ChatGPT.
This week on Equity, Anthony Ha and I (Max Zeff) go beyond the headlines to break down what’s really going on in these AI infrastructure deals.
Rather conveniently, OpenAI also gave the world a glimpse this week of a power-intensive feature it could serve more broadly if it had access to more AI data centers.
The company launched Pulse — a new feature in ChatGPT that works overnight to deliver personalized morning briefings for users. The experience feels similar to a news app or a social feed — something you check first thing in the morning — but doesn’t have posts from other users or ads (yet).
Pulse is part of a new class of OpenAI products that work independently, even when users aren’t in the ChatGPT app. The company would like to deliver a lot more of these features and roll them out to free users, but they’re limited by the number of computer servers available to them. OpenAI said it can only offer Pulse to its $200-a-month Pro subscribers right now due to capacity constraints.
The real question is whether features like Pulse are worth the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI data centers to support OpenAI. The feature looks cool and all, but that’s a tall order.
Watch the full episode to hear more about the massive AI infrastructure investments reshaping Silicon Valley, TikTok’s ownership saga, and the policy changes affecting tech’s biggest players."

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 6% in the afternoon session after the stock continued a multi-day rally amid reports that the U.S. administration was considering new measures to boost domestic chip production, alongside news of the company seeking strategic investments.
The potential government policy would require chipmakers to expand their U.S. production, possibly facing tariffs if they imported more chips than they made domestically. Such a move would benefit companies like Intel with a significant manufacturing presence in the U.S.
Adding to the positive sentiment, the company reportedly approached both Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) about potential investments or partnerships. These discussions followed recent multibillion-dollar investments from Nvidia and a 10% stake taken by the U.S. government, fueling optimism about the chipmaker's turnaround efforts. The session's gains extended a recent surge for the stock, which had risen more than 20% over several trading days on the news of potential outside investments.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $35.63, up 4.9% from previous close.
Is now the time to buy Intel? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 35 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 6.3% as reports surfaced that the company was pursuing an investment from Apple and it received a stock upgrade from Seaport Research.
The move continued a rally from the previous trading session, which was initially sparked by a Bloomberg report about the early-stage discussions between the two tech giants. Following these developments, Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg upgraded Intel's stock to 'Neutral' from 'Sell.' While the analyst's note expressed caution that Intel was “on the wrong path with a shrinking window,"" it also stated the stock would likely be driven by follow-on investments in the near term.
This potential investment from Apple followed a series of other capital infusions, including a reported $5 billion from Nvidia and $2 billion from SoftBank, as part of Intel's efforts to bolster its business.
Intel is up 76.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $35.63 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $692.72.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Just to get a little bit more specific here, let's talk about Open AI for a moment since you're talking about generative AI. So, the company looks like according to one estimate, it's going to take in about $13 billion in revenue this year. Um, but the spending that it is doing, not just this year, but over the next several years on Oracle alone, for example, is going to be $60 billion annually. So, how do you close that gap?
So, Open AI I think is a is a special situation here. and I think that is what is starting to spook the market a little bit. To kind of refresh the numbers you just laid out, I think Open AI is currently generating an annualized revenue run rate of about $13 billion dollars. That's up from about 5 billion at the beginning of the year and they expect that to be exiting the year at about 20. So, this is a company that's growing at a pretty extraordinary clip. And if you extrapolate out that kind of growth, just to be fair, supporting $60 billion of annualized CapEx doesn't seem like a crazy, um, aspiration. I mean, they they have to continue to grow at that type of clip, which is going to be the hard part. But, um, I do think to take a step back, back to my first point, Open AI's investment, um, uh, plans are what seem to be spooking the markets. I think initially there was this euphoria, the Open AI spend that showed up in Oracle's massive backlog was gave the market a lot of excitement. I think then people slowed their roll a little bit, have become a little bit more apprehensive. And then you had Sam Altman out this week talking about a trillion dollars of AI infrastructure projects down the pipe. We don't know the timing on that, but I guess that's a long-winded way of saying, if Open AI can continue to grow at the clip they're currently growing at, the market shouldn't be concerned about that infrastructure spend specifically, but Open AI is definitely separate from a lot of the other infrastructure spend that's out there.
Gotcha. Fair enough. Um, so does it sounds like you don't have the bubble concerns then that have been expressed by some in the market?
Well, I don't think I so, let's let's I think there's two types of bubbles, right? There's valuation bubbles, and then there's earnings bubbles. Two two types of bubbles in public stock markets. I think what we had in the .com, um, era was a mix of both. There was vastly overvalued companies on earning streams that never materialized. I think what we have today, speaking more so to the large cap tech companies, it's very hard to argue that there's a valuation bubble right now. I think valuations, so long as the earnings estimates can be realized, valuations are not the problem. So, are we in a bubble right now? I think that's a very nuanced response. Um, I feel good about where valuations are. I'm paying much more attention to earnings expectations. And the ironic thing about a lot of what's recently been announced is these are CAPEX plans that will support earnings growth for the AI infrastructure arms dealers like Nvidia, like the public cloud players for the foreseeable future. So, I don't think we're going to learn the answer to that anytime soon, and I think it's going to be very case-by-case depending on the company, um, et cetera. So, hard to say. I'm definitely watching very closely this CAPEX, the trajectory of this CAPEX, and the monetization on this CAPEX. But as things stand today, I feel reasonably comfortable against a market backdrop where there's increasing concern."

Much of that money has been spent on graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as networking gear and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Broadcom.
The tide is beginning to shift, however. Capital is beginning to move further downstream, where a handful of Silicon Valley startups are no longer just attracting curiosity -- they are disrupting a semiconductor market long dominated by the current incumbents.
Enter Groq, fresh off a $750 million capital raise that values the company at $6.9 billion. Beyond the headline figure, what stands out is its investor roster, which includes Samsung, Cisco, and BlackRock. This funding round represents a pivotal moment in the broader semiconductor narrative -- one that could rewrite the dynamics between the newcomers and legacy giants.
What is Groq, and why should investors pay attention?
Nvidia and AMD both design GPUs -- hardware that is particularly well suited to powering the training of generative AI models. Groq, however, is pioneering a different path with a chip category known as language processing units (LPUs). Unlike GPUs, LPUs are built for inference -- the stage at which trained models are deployed in real-world applications.
This distinction matters because inference requires chips with faster processing speeds, greater power efficiency, and ultra-low latency compared to what GPUs currently deliver. Groq's approach highlights the fact that semiconductors are not one-size-fits-all products, and that AI infrastructure providers will need to look beyond the GPUs they are currently hoarding.
Groq's impressive funding round signals that investors are betting that it can carve out a space in the chip realm by offering viable alternatives optimized for the next wave of AI development.
How does Groq impact Nvidia and AMD?
Nvidia today commands an estimated 90% share of the AI accelerator market. That dominance stems from its leading GPU architectures and the deep integration of its CUDA software ecosystem. Together, those have given it a wide moat in its part of the chip space.
Even so, Groq's rise underscores the fact that AI workloads are becoming more fragmented and specialized. If cloud hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle determine that Groq's chips are better suited for inference, Nvidia could be forced to defend its position more aggressively -- or risk ceding ground in certain high-value corners of the AI landscape.
Throughout the AI revolution, AMD's main pitch against Nvidia has been its ability to deliver lower-cost alternatives. But Groq's emergence could swiftly reshape that narrative.
If enterprises begin diversifying into multivendor platforms rather than relying solely on Nvidia's stack, AMD could benefit too. In effect, Groq's rise does not merely challenge Nvidia; rather, it broadens the playing field and gives buyers more leverage. Such moves could propel AMD into the spotlight.
Nvidia vs. AMD: Which stock is the smarter buy right now?
Groq's $750 million equity raise proves that the AI chip race is far from settled. However, Nvidia certainly hasn't been dethroned just yet.
Its record levels of profitability give it unmatched financial strength -- and plenty of resources it can tap in its efforts to out-innovate smaller rivals. With its current growth trajectory, robust margins, and next-generation chips like Blackwell Ultra and Rubin on the horizon, Nvidia's leadership position still appears durable.
By contrast, AMD is a higher-risk bet. While sales of its MI300 chips are gaining traction, AMD ultimately lacks the ecosystem lock-in that underpins Nvidia's dominance. While Groq's emergence as a chip supplier could help open doors for AMD, it is unclear how much ground it can gain in its efforts to close the gap between itself and the undisputed segment leader.
AMD may capture some incremental upside as a complementary chip provider, but Nvidia continues to be the smarter buy and perhaps the most direct way to profit from the ongoing secular tailwinds fueling the AI infrastructure boom."

“Sometimes, though, you have a winner right in front of your face and you don’t realize it. When I was at NVIDIA’s big GTC conference… I was checking out the booth of all those companies that were working with Nvidia installing product into the data centers… At the end of the hall in what seemed to me to be a pretty empty booth… this company, Nebius, is a data center builder like CoreWeave. I felt bad for them, like no one was paying any attention to them, so I asked what they did. I sauntered it over there. They filled me in. They were going to be a part of the power solution. I thanked them. Never really thought about it again until yesterday when the company won a $17 billion contract to build a data center for Microsoft in Vineland, New Jersey… Sure enough, Nebius, which had been creeping up, vaulted from $64 to nearly $96 today in a colossal move. Nebius, it turns out, used to be a part of Yandex, a controversial Russian story. Spun out from Yandex, Nebius is controversial no more. It’s just electric, literally.”

On September 22, the company announced to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and provide it with data center chips.
This partnership between two major players in the global AI race underscores the growing overlap of interests between tech giants developing advanced systems.
As part of the agreement, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will get a financial stake in OpenAI, which is also an important customer, while the investment will provide the latter with cash and the access it requires to acquire chips that are vital to maintaining its dominance in a fiercely competitive landscape.
The deal will involve two separate transactions, Reuters reported, citing a person familiar with OpenAI. After the agreement is finalized, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will invest in OpenAI’s non-voting shares, and then OpenAI can use the funds to buy the chips, said the report.
The two firms signed a letter of intent for the deployment of at least 10 gigawatts of NVDA systems for OpenAI, with the aim of further finalizing details of the strategic partnership in the coming weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start delivering the hardware in the second half of 2026.
Following the news, several analysts welcomed the deal as a positive development for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), but also expressed concerns that some of the investment dollars might be coming back to the company in the form of chip purchases.

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-26T13:57:00,Meet the Company Challenging Broadcom's AI Chip Dominance (Hint: It's Not Nvidia),This small AI company has the potential to take share away from Broadcom in custom AI chips.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0b91d68d13915d6ec17989bc5da28aba0ca7ccd59a0a37e3f37711aafdbdc979,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/meet-the-company-challenging-broadcoms-ai-chip/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/meet-the-company-challenging-broadcoms-ai-chip/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/meet-the-company-challenging-broadcoms-ai-chip/,fool.com,200,,"Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip boom after Nvidia. That's because the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that Broadcom designs have been a huge hit among cloud service providers looking for cheaper alternatives to the expensive graphics cards that Nvidia sells.
Not surprisingly, there are rumors that Nvidia has established a new department to focus on ASICs. The custom nature of these chips means that they can be programmed to perform specific tasks, which is why they are now gaining traction for AI inference applications.
The overwhelming performance per watt advantage that ASICs are capable of delivering over graphics processing units (GPUs) while performing the tasks they are designed for explains why they are now in great demand -- and other industry players are also benefiting.
A smaller Broadcom rival is cutting its teeth in the lucrative custom AI processor market
Broadcom estimates that its serviceable addressable market (SAM) from just three hyperscale customers that are using its custom AI processors could be worth $60 billion to $90 billion in the next couple of years. That figure could head higher considering that Broadcom has brought new customers on board lately.
However, Broadcom isn't the only company that's looking to make the most of this market. We have seen that Nvidia may have already set its sights on this space. But it is worth noting that Broadcom has a smaller competitor that's rapidly gaining traction in the custom AI processor market and could challenge its dominance.
That company is Marvell Technology (MRVL 3.13%). While Broadcom is reportedly controlling an impressive 70% share of the custom AI processor space, Marvell is quickly gaining ground. It is targeting a 20% market share of custom AI processors by 2028, up from less than 5% in 2023. Earlier, Marvell was projecting an addressable revenue opportunity of $55 billion in this market by 2028, so a 20% share of this space by then would have brought its custom AI chip revenue to $11 billion.
That would have been a substantial increase over the $4 billion AI revenue that Marvell is expected to generate in the ongoing fiscal year. However, don't be surprised to see the company's AI revenue turning out to be higher than $11 billion after three years as it has the ability to take share away from Broadcom, along with an expansion in its addressable opportunity.
Marvell management pointed out on its latest earnings conference call that it expects to corner 20% of an updated $94 billion total addressable market (TAM) by 2028. The company has generated $7.2 billion in total revenue in the past four quarters, which means the custom AI chip market alone has the ability to significantly supercharge its growth.
What's more, Marvell could take away more share from Broadcom in this market in the next three years than it is currently projecting. That's because it now sees more than 50 custom AI chip opportunities across more than 10 customers, which could help it generate a whopping $75 billion in lifetime revenue. Marvell has already been designing chips for three major cloud computing providers, and its updated pipeline suggests that it could witness a significant expansion in its customer base.
Marvell's valuation and healthier growth prospects make it a better bet than Broadcom
Marvell is growing at a faster pace than Broadcom. The former's revenue shot up by 58% year over year in the previous quarter to $2 billion, far exceeding the 22% spike in Broadcom's top line to $16 billion. Additionally, Marvell's earnings more than doubled year over year, while Broadcom reported a 36% increase in its non-GAAP earnings per share.
Of course, Marvell is the smaller company of the two. But that's precisely why it has the ability to keep growing at a faster pace by challenging Broadcom's dominance. Even better, Marvell is way cheaper than Broadcom with a forward earnings multiple of just 27 as compared to Broadcom's reading of 37. All this makes Marvell a top AI stock to buy right now, as it has the ability to deliver impressive long-term gains to investors by making a bigger dent in the lucrative custom AI chip market."

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Altimeter Capital’s Brad Gerstner, in late August, talked about the impressive results of Nvidia on CNBC and explained why the company is benefiting from AI inference. Gerstner said at the time that the world is supply-constrained when it comes to compute.
“Think about this stat a year ago: Google per month was doing about 9 trillion tokens a month in terms of inference generation, compute generation. Today it’s 980 trillion tokens. So from 9 trillion to 980, it’s a 100x increase in a year. You have to compute in order to do that. So the world is massively supply constrained when it comes to compute. They’re 50. You know, he said yesterday the world will continue to grow at 50%. So think about this. If you grow and people ask them, are you going to grow at 50%? He said, well, I think we’re going to maintain market share. So the consensus for next year is 250 billion of data center revenue. If they grow up 50%, that’s going to be closer to 300 billion or closer to eight bucks a share, right. And $200 at eight bucks a share. You know, is about 25 times. So below market multiples in terms of PE. So here’s a company that I think is hitting on all strides.”
Nvidia’s latest deal with OpenAI and Intel, along with Oracle’s partnership with OpenAI are showing signs that companies are continuing to spend a fortune on compute, and AI demand won’t slow down anytime soon. But can NVDA shares keep gaining?
Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Nvidia recently impressed the market by signing an AI infrastructure deal with Intel. Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel. Jensen Huang said the deal would open up $50B in TAM for both companies in the data center and PC business.
Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital
Analysts believe the deal would allow Nvidia to take market share from AMD in the data center and PC business and diversify away from Arm-based designs."

Chicago, IL – September 26, 2025– Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alibaba BABA, Baidu BIDU, Nvidia's NVDA, Invesco China Technology CQQQ ETF and iShares China Large-Cap FXI.
Chase the Surge in Alibaba or Baidu Stocks?
Along with U.S. equities, favorable market sentiment has led to a resurgence in Chinese tech stocks with Alibaba and Baidu leading the way.
Reigniting the buzz, the U.S. and China reached an ongoing framework trade agreement back in May, offsetting previous tariff concerns that had compressed Chinese equities.
Fast forward four months, and AI-driven optimism has kept propelling Alibaba and Baidu stock, which have both soared over +30% since the trade deal was announced between the world's two largest economies on May 12.
With BABA and BIDU printing fresh 52-week highs of well over $100 a share, it's certainly a worthy topic of whether investors should chase the surge in Alibaba or Baidu stock.
Alibaba & Baidu's AI Expansion
Driving bullish sentiment and setting Alibaba and Baidu's AI endeavors apart is that they have produced multimodal AI models, like many of their big tech counterparts in the U.S. These AI systems can understand and generate multiple types of data (modalities) for text, vision, audio, video, and sensor components. As beneficiaries of China's broader push into AI, the country's restrictions on Nvidia's AI chips have opened the door for Alibaba and Baidu to shine.
Alibaba most recently unveiled its powerful new AI model, ""Qwen3-Max"", which has over a trillion parameters. Setting its sights on global data center expansion and striking a strategic partnership with one of the largest telecom companies in China (China Unicom), Alibaba has pledged to spend more than $50 billion on AI in the next three years.
Similarly, Baidu has produced several advanced AI systems stemming from its multimodal large language model (LLM) ERNIE. Furthermore, like Alibaba, Baidu deploys its own internally designed AI chips, with the company securing a strategic deal with China Merchants Group (CMG) to deploy AI agents and digital employees across key industrial sectors.
Tracking Alibaba & Baidu's Outlook
Based on Zacks' estimates, Alibaba's total sales are expected to increase 4% in its current fiscal 2026 and are projected to rise another 11% in FY27 to $160.04 billion.
Reflective of higher operating costs, Alibaba's annual earnings are expected to decrease 14% in FY26 to $7.72 per share compared to EPS of $9.01 in its FY25. However, the e-commerce leader's FY27 EPS is projected to rebound and climb 39% to $10.73."

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s shares have gained 21% year-to-date, with media reports attributing the rise to a turnaround in the firm’s software business and the Azure cloud computing division. Cramer’s previous comments about the firm have wondered whether too much of the market was concentrated in its and NVIDIA’s shares. This time, he discussed a note from Ben Reitzes at Melius Research. The note outlined that the shares had been sold unfairly and the stock could gain momentum over the coming months. Some of the reasons behind Reitzes’ optimism include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s cloud computing business, AI agents, and partnership with OpenAI. Here is what Cramer said about the note:
Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com
“I want to talk about Microsoft for a second. There’s this fellow Ben Retizes at Melius, he’s been very good. He’s been actually dead right. And he’s saying it’s time for, believe it or not, a catch up trade for Microsoft, which is just kind of, you know, in a lull. But this is itself I think is doing extraordinarily well. Talking about how Copilot’s gonna be able to be revealed as a smashing success. I also think, things are a little clouded by AI, by OpenAI, we don’t know.”
While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Cramer does not discuss the stock often, but during the times that he has discussed it, the CNBC TV host linked the firm’s performance to the broader semiconductor industry. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)’s shares were upgraded by Morgan Stanley to Overweight from Equal-Weight earlier this week, with a price target bump to €950. The upgrade followed Bank of America’s decision to raise the share price target to €941 from €742 on September 19th after NVIDIA’s decision to invest $5 billion in Intel. Cramer discussed the upgrade:
Close-up of Silicon Die are being Extracted from Semiconductor Wafer and Attached to Substrate by Pick and Place Machine. Computer Chip Manufacturing at Fab. Semiconductor Packaging Process.
“[Commenting on Morgan Stanley upgrading ASML and AMAT] Well I don’t know, Morgan was, they were too negative on it. But the reason why they were was because we didn’t feel that Micron had gained. We didn’t think that NAND, we were worried about Western Dig, worried about the SanDisk, worried about anything involving Seagate. And they’re all back. I mean they’re all at their highs. They’re now starting to sell at a premium multiple for the first time, maybe in 30 years.”
While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Sep 26 - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares climbed 8.8% on Thursday and 3% on early Friday, capping a strong run that has lifted the stock 37% since Sept. 17 and 69% year to date. The surge reflects renewed investor confidence as the company secures major outside backing and benefits from improving demand in its core PC market.
CEO Lip-Bu Tan has attracted significant commitments in recent weeks. SoftBank invested $2 billion, the U.S. government took a 10% stake, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) pledged $5 billion. Reports also point to potential talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on investment or partnership opportunities.
Separately, speculation has resurfaced around a possible joint venture with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) to operate some of Intel's foundry facilities.
Adding to momentum, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) said this week that PC demand is rebounding. The transition from Windows 10 to Windows 11 and rising adoption of AI-enabled PCs are expected to push PC unit growth higher in 2025. That trend directly supports Intel, whose PC business remains its largest source of revenue.
Is INTC Stock a Buy?
Based on the one year price targets offered by 35 analysts, the average target price for Intel Corp is $25.08 with a high estimate of $43.00 and a low estimate of $14.00. The average target implies a downside of -26.21% from the current price of $33.99.

Several new notes came out this week supporting the buy case for Iren stock.
Demand for the services of the data center operator is quickly rising. That helped lead to a jump of almost 20% in the stock this week as of Friday morning, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Iren is becoming a more familiar name
Iren has been pivoting its data center operations less for cryptocurrency mining and more to serve the increasing need for AI compute power and other high-performance computing applications.
Earlier this week, tech giant Nvidia and AI research and deployment company OpenAI announced a new plan to add massive data center capacity utilizing Nvidia's platform. That partnership reinforced the demand picture for the growing compute capacity that Iren is developing.
It helped lead several Wall Street analysts to get even more optimistic on Iren stock. Arete Research initiated coverage on Iren with a buy rating and a price target of $78 per share, according to reports.
Two other firms raised their price targets on Iren as well this week. Wall Street is gaining optimism because Iren is preparing for the growing market. Earlier this month Iren co-founder and co-CEO Daniel Roberts gave investors a preview of what's coming, stating, ""Demand for our AI Cloud is accelerating as we prepare for the delivery of approximately 9,000 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs [graphics processing units] over the coming months.""
Management has also provided investors with a preview showing its plans to operate with 20,000 GPUs and eventually sees a path for up to 60,000. It seems clear that the demand will be there. If it executes its plan, Iren stock could have further to run."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-26T12:27:00,Is Micron Stock the Best Buy Now?,Investing in companies with strong growth drivers and a durable competitive advantage can be a smart way to build wealth over the long term.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f1f3bed116e323847febedca26b973dabed21cf5d5303095d0dbeda81cdce7ef,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/is-micron-stock-the-best-buy-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/is-micron-stock-the-best-buy-now/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/is-micron-stock-the-best-buy-now/,fool.com,200,,"Micron Technology (MU 2.62%) has proved to be one of the biggest winners of the global artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout. While semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Broadcom often take center stage, Micron also plays a crucial role in supplying the memory and storage required for AI systems.
Shares of Micron have gained nearly 97.7% so far in 2025. The company also reported record results for fiscal 2025 (ended Aug. 28, 2025) on Sept. 23. So, investors are now asking: Is this stock one of the best buys in the market today?
Stellar financial performance
Fiscal 2025 has proved exceptionally strong for Micron. The company's revenue surged nearly 50% year over year to $37.4 billion, while its gross margin expanded by 17 percentage points to 41%. Earnings per share also soared 538% year over year to $8.29.
The growth has been primarily driven by robust demand for data centers. The company's data center segment accounted for 56% of revenue with a 52% gross margin in fiscal 2025. Memory products, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM), high-capacity dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), and low-power server DRAM, collectively contributed $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, representing a more than fivefold increase year over year. Micron has thus emerged as a significant beneficiary of the ongoing AI boom.
Demand-supply mismatch
Management expects Micron's business momentum to continue in fiscal 2026. For the first quarter, the company is guiding for record revenue in the range of $12.2 billion to $12.8 billion, a gross margin in the range of 50.5% and 52.5%, and earnings per share in the range of $3.60 to $3.80.
Micron expects DRAM bit demand to grow in the high teens and NAND (flash memory for long-term storage) demand to expand in the low to mid-teens during calendar 2025. But the company's bit supply growth will remain below industry demand levels for both non-HBM DRAM and NAND, keeping supply tight. This mismatch between limited supply and high demand pushes unit prices upward.
Management also expects sequential improvement in its gross margin in the second quarter, supported by tight DRAM supply and below-target DRAM inventory levels, driving strong pricing. At the same time, conditions in the NAND business are improving. Micron is also shifting more of its memory and storage production toward higher-value markets, such as data centers and AI servers, which should continue to boost profitability.
Product innovation
Micron's HBM offerings, which are preferred for their faster data transfer speeds and higher energy efficiency, are being increasingly used to run complex AI workloads. Micron's HBM has reached an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $8 billion, driven primarily by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory third-generation extended (HBM3E) products. The company's HBM market share is expected to be in line with its overall DRAM market share in the third quarter of calendar year 2025.
Additionally, Micron has already shared samples of the more advanced high-bandwidth memory fourth-generation (HBM4) products with customers. Micron claims HBM4 is faster and more efficient than every competing product -- which can prove to be a solid competitive edge while selling to customers scaling their AI infrastructures.
Micron is also gearing up for HBM4E, the next step in high-bandwidth memory, which will enable customers to customize the base chip that manages the memory stack, with manufacturing support from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. This customization could lead to higher profits and stronger customer relationships.
Storage is another growth driver. Micron is already shipping advanced NAND storage to support AI inference and large-scale server storage. As the supply of hard disks remains tight, demand for NAND is expected to continue growing.
Aggressive investment strategy
Micron is investing aggressively to expand its memory and storage supply. The company invested $13.8 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 and anticipates investing even more in fiscal 2026 to fund DRAM front-end equipment for technology node migration and construct new fabs. The company expects its faster 1-gamma DRAM node to contribute the majority of the DRAM supply in 2026, while the 1-beta node will supply the HBM market in 2026. The company is building new fabs in Idaho and expanding capacity in Japan and Singapore. This implies that the company is working hard to capitalize on the growing global demand for memory.
Micron also boasts a strong balance sheet, with $15.4 billion in liquidity and $14.6 billion in debt with a weighted average maturity of 2033. The company also expects free cash flow to further improve in 2026. This gives the company sufficient financial flexibility to fund future growth initiatives.
Could Micron be the best buy now?
For Micron to maintain its growth trajectory, enterprise AI spending must keep pace. Micron believes trillions of dollars will be invested in data center infrastructure over the next few years, with memory commanding a significant share of that budget. If management's projections prove correct, HBM alone could reach a target addressable market of $100 billion by 2030. Micron is well-positioned to capture a large share of this market.
Analysts are forecasting Micron's earnings per share to be $11.59 and $12.47, respectively, for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027. Micron trades at nearly 12.4 times forward earnings estimates, more like a cyclical commodity memory player than a key enabler of the global AI infrastructure.
However, as Micron solidifies its position in the AI supply chain, Wall Street may assign it a higher multiple, in line with other core AI infrastructure plays that often trade at 18 to 25 times forward earnings. This can translate into a share price in the range of $224 to $311 by fiscal 2027 -- implying an upside of 34.6% to 86.8% in the next two years.
Micron faces significant execution risk and some uncertainty due to tariffs. Despite this, with its robust product strategy and strong financials, the company can weather these challenges. Hence, as long as AI infrastructure spending stays strong, Micron will continue to be an attractive pick for long-term investors."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-26T07:30:00,Prediction: This AI Stock Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia and Palantir Combined by 2030,Amazon could surpass the combined market value of Palantir and Nvidia within five years as AI innovations drive profitability.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=a62dd736a312c6a56ab28061737b116ff9cece11dadfe6654d26f89a47454f46,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/retirement/2025/09/26/ai-stock-be-worth-more-than-nvidia-palantir-stock/,https://www.fool.com/retirement/2025/09/26/ai-stock-be-worth-more-than-nvidia-palantir-stock/,https://www.fool.com/retirement/2025/09/26/ai-stock-be-worth-more-than-nvidia-palantir-stock/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia and Palantir Technologies are two of the most popular artificial intelligence stocks. Their collective market value is currently $4.7 trillion. I think Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) can surpass that figure by 2030. Here's what my prediction means for shareholders:
Amazon is currently worth $2.3 trillion. Its market value must increase 109% to reach $4.8 trillion, and reaching that figure by 2030 implies shareholders would see annual returns of roughly 16% over the next five years. Here's why that seems like a distinct possibility.
Amazon is a major player in three growing industries
Amazon reported encouraging financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 13% to $167 billion, operating margin expanded 150 basis points, and GAAP net income increased 33% to $1.68 per diluted share. Amazon is well positioned to maintain that momentum due to its strong presence in three growing industries.
- Amazon runs the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe in terms of gross merchandise volume. Retail e-commerce sales are projected to increase at nearly 12% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.
- Amazon is the third largest ad tech company and the largest retail advertiser in the world as measured by revenue. It is also the fourth-fastest growing ad tech company worldwide. Digital ad spending is forecast to increase at 15% annually through 2030.
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) operates the largest public cloud platform as measured by infrastructure and platform services spending. Cloud computing sales are projected to increase at 20% annually through 2030 driven by demand for data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) tools.
Importantly, if Amazon merely matches the growth rates in those three markets, total revenue could increase at annualized pace of 13% to 14% through the end of the decade. But earnings could grow even faster. The company is using artificial intelligence to make its business more profitable, particularly across its retail operations.
Amazon is innovating with artificial intelligence and robotics
Amazon has designed over 1,000 generative AI applications to improve efficiency across its retail operations. That includes tools to optimize inventory allocation, demand forecasting, and last-mile delivery. The company recently introduced an AI model to help its robot fleet navigate warehouses more quickly, and another model in development will let warehouse workers engage fulfillment robots in natural language.
Additionally, The Information reports Amazon is developing humanoid robots to assist its drivers with package delivery. Initially, robots could carry packages from delivery vans to doorsteps while human drivers wait in the vehicle. But the entire process could eventually be automated because Amazon is also testing robotaxis with its autonomous driving subsidiary Zoox.
Elsewhere, Amazon developers are using an AI coding assistant (Amazon Q Developer) to automate tedious and repetitive tasks. CEO Andy Jassy told analysts last year, ""With Q's code transformation capabilities, Amazon has migrated over 30,000 Java JDK applications in a few months, saving the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years compared to what it would have otherwise cost.""
Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley says Amazon is ""one of the companies best positioned to deliver material financial return from physical AI and robotics"" over the next three to five years. He estimates costs related to shipping and fulfillment currently consume about 36% of retail sales, so the company should become much more profitable at those workflows are automated.
Why Amazon could be a $4.8 trillion company by 2030
Amazon shares currently trade at 34 times earnings, a reasonable valuation for a company whose earnings are forecast to increase at 18% annually over the next three to five years. If Amazon meets that consensus estimate, its market value can increase 109% to $4.8 trillion by late 2030, while its valuation falls to 31 times earnings.
In the scenario I described, Amazon in five years would be worth more than the combined market values of Nvidia and Palantir today."

And yet here we are with advanced nuclear company Oklo (OKLO -1.34%).
The stock has gone from relative obscurity to a $19 billion market valuation in under a year, outpacing not only rivals like NuScale (SMR 16.36%), but also Wall Street favorites like Nvidia and Palantir.
Yet unlike those big tech giants, Oklo isn't selling chips or software. In fact, as of today, it isn't selling anything at all. It's pre-revenue, pre-license, and doesn't even have a nuclear facility operating commercially.
What it has, however, is an intriguing idea (plus a lot of cash): tiny reactors that can run for a decade or more on specialized fuel. It's the kind of energy that's needed for those same big tech giants that are becoming increasingly energy-hungry: a clean, reliable source for 24/7 power.
That's the promise. But whether it's worth the current price or not depends on how much faith you're willing to put into Oklo's timeline and execution.
What Oklo is designing, and why it matters
Oklo is an advanced nuclear company that's developing an Aurora powerhouse, basically a small modular reactor that's expected to generate upward of 75 megawatts of power.
These powerhouses are being engineered to run on a specialized fuel -- high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) -- that allows them to run for a decade or more without refueling. For context, many of today's reactors typically shut down every 1.5 to 2 years for new fuel assemblies.
Global data centers will need about 84 GW of power in three years -- and Oklo could supply some of it
To be sure, Aurora's power generation (75 megawatts) is only a drop in the bucket of power that will be needed in the near future. At present, Goldman Sachs (GS -0.33%) estimates the global data center market alone consumes about 55 gigawatts (GW) of power, a number that's expected to grow to 84 GW by 2027.
But therein lies Oklo's advantage. Its Aurora powerhouses are small and modular and can be assembled near data center campuses. What's more, they can be strung together to amplify their 24/7 power generation. Since the average hyperscale data center needs 100 MW or more, a network of two or more Auroras could hypothetically meet its needs.
Another interesting fact about Oklo: It aims to recycle fuel. Its planned $1.68 billion Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee is pitched as the first privately funded U.S. facility to turn nuclear waste into fresh metallic fuel. If it works, it could cut operating costs and help Oklo secure a supply chain of what could be the equivalent of 1.3 trillion barrels of oil in recyclable fuel.
The numbers don't add up (yet)
All of that sounds great. Fantastic, even. But here's the kicker: Right now, Oklo's designs are mostly hypothetical, with no Aurora powerhouse governmentally sanctioned to operate.
To date, the company is still trying to get regulatory approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate its Aurora design. The company applied in 2022, but was rejected for missing information on its application. In July 2025, it completed a ""pre-application readiness assessment."" It's progress, but it's only Phase 1, and until a license is granted, the company's ideas will remain untested at scale.
That's a problem for Oklo. The company isn't generating revenue and is expected to burn between $65 million and $80 million in cash for 2025.
Policy winds at its back
That said, Oklo isn't up a creek without a paddle. The White House has sent clear signals that it wants to develop and deploy advanced nuclear reactors, and Oklo's stock is in a position to benefit from it. An executive order from President Donald Trump, along with a recent joint initiative between the U.S. and U.K. to speed up safety checks on microreactors, have given Oklo a vote of confidence that could move it steadily through the regulatory process.
Along those lines, Oklo's Aurora design was recently chosen by the Department of Energy to participate in a Reactor Pilot Program. Its powerhouse was one of three projects awarded (another went to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy), and it could see its first powerhouse up and running by late 2027.
Indeed, as of Sept. 22, 2025, Oklo broke ground on the construction of its first Aurora in Idaho -- a relief for investors who have wanted to see something materialize.
So, is Oklo a buy?
Oklo trades at about 28 times book value, so it's not cheap (its rival NuScale trades at about 9 times book value). As such, a lot of expectation is already baked into today's price.
Aggressive investors with a long-term perspective may want to open a small position. Others who want to capture this market but don't want to risk it all in one start-up may be better served by a nuclear energy exchange-traded fund (ETF)."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-26T07:15:00,Could This AI Chipmaker Surpass Nvidia by 2030?,Nvidia has dominated the AI chip market since the AI boom started.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=859bcb9b3ba55497ea9abc942e3ed88eeed761ac0e42cccbee6d1222352dadbe,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/could-this-ai-chipmaker-surpass-nvidia-by-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/could-this-ai-chipmaker-surpass-nvidia-by-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/26/could-this-ai-chipmaker-surpass-nvidia-by-2030/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) has built an artificial intelligence (AI) dynasty over the past few years. In its earlier days, it was known as a chip designer focused on the video gaming market, but the company shifted into the high-growth AI opportunity early in the story -- and this resulted in explosive growth. Today, Nvidia sells its famous graphics processing units (GPUs) along with a wide range of products and services to power AI, and all of this has resulted in billion-dollar earnings -- and a more than $4 trillion market value for the company.
Nvidia looks positioned for long-term success in the AI market, but it's important to remember that it's not alone here. Other players have carved out a spot with offerings spanning the AI theme -- from chips to servers and capacity for running AI workloads. And one particular player has grown its presence in an area that could make it a Nvidia rival: the chip market. In fact, this company recently reported significant gains in revenue and a major customer win. Could this AI chipmaker surpass Nvidia by 2030? Let's find out.
Soaring market value
This company, like Nvidia, has seen its market value soar in recent times -- in fact, it joined the ""trillion dollar club"" this year when its market capitalization reached $1 trillion for the first time ever. (The trillion dollar club isn't a real club, but instead a way of referring to companies that are valued $1 trillion or more.)
So, which company am I referring to? Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%), a networking specialist that plays an integral part in powering everything from smartphones to data centers. The company makes thousands of products used across many environments and also sells enterprise software solutions -- in fact, Broadcom serves most of the Fortune 500 companies with its software. All of this has helped Broadcom increase earnings into the billions of dollars over time.
AVGO Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
But what's truly been driving Broadcom's revenue in recent times has been its work in the AI market. Broadcom's top networking solutions -- such as Tomahawk switches and Jericho routers -- along with the company's AI chips, known as XPUs, have been gaining ground with big cloud service providers as they scale up their AI infrastructure.
Nvidia vs Broadcom
How do Nvidia's and Broadcom's AI chips compare? Nvidia's GPUs are the most powerful on the market and are general purpose, meaning they can supercharge any AI task. Broadcom designs XPUs to serve specific functions for customers, making them custom solutions. This clearly appeals to AI customers because Broadcom said the XPU business made up 65% of its AI revenue in the recent quarter and orders from three major customers continue to grow.
On top of this, Broadcom said it won a $10 billion order for AI racks based on its XPUs. The company didn't identify this new customer, but analysts have suggested it may be AI research lab OpenAI.
So, the advantage Broadcom offers customers is the ability to choose XPUs specific to particular tasks -- and these custom solutions may be cheaper than going exclusively for Nvidia's top GPUs.
Now, let's get back to our question: Could Broadcom surpass Nvidia by 2030? That's the year AI infrastructure spending may reach $4 trillion, according to Nvidia chief Jensen Huang. I think that Broadcom could see explosive growth by that time and clearly become a major AI player -- this should boost its stock performance and lead to gains in market value too.
Nvidia's expertise
But, even though Broadcom likely will carve out a leading market position, it's unlikely to unseat Nvidia. This is because Nvidia's general purpose expertise offers it a vast audience -- the company's GPUs and related products and services provide top performance and are able to supercharge any AI task, making them very versatile. That will appeal to many customers over time.
In fact, Nvidia's and Broadcom's chip offerings actually are complementary, and many customers may opt to integrate both in their data centers. The AI opportunity is an enormous one, and this is great news for these companies and investors because it indicates there will be many winners. Broadcom and Nvidia already have demonstrated this as they've reported skyrocketing earnings in recent years.
All of this means that even though Broadcom is unlikely to surpass Nvidia by 2030, the stock still makes a fantastic AI investment."

The companies have signed a letter of intent to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) systems for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure. Many analysts have shared their views about this partnership.
Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:
“For Nvidia, the prize is huge — every gigawatt of AI data centre capacity is worth about $50 billion in revenue, meaning this project could be worth as much as $500 billion.
Jacob Bourne, tech analyst at eMarketer, said:
“Demand for Nvidia GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models, and deals like this should also ease concerns about lost sales in China.
David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said:
“Nvidia continues to double-down on AI as we always figured that CEO Jensen Huang would want to invest downward into AI factories – this announcement is much earlier than many would have expected.”
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an American multinational technology company that makes graphics processing units (GPUs), AI hardware and software, and high-performance computing (HPC) solutions.

NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- With global smartphone sales leveling off, Qualcomm and MediaTek are taking their long-running rivalry into the fast-growing cloud AI ASIC market. DIGITIMES Research estimates MediaTek controlled 37% of the smartphone application processor market in 2024, ahead of Qualcomm at 27%. Together, the two suppliers accounted for more than 60% of shipments. With handset growth expected to remain stuck in the low single digits, both companies are turning to cloud computing chips as a new source of expansion.
Cloud strategies unveiled at COMPUTEX
Qualcomm and MediaTek outlined new strategies for cloud AI chips and confirmed plans to join Nvidia's NVLink Fusion consortium, signaling their intent to take on incumbents in high-performance computing. The moves, announced at COMPUTEX 2025, underscore how chipmakers are racing to secure an edge in AI infrastructure, where expertise in HPC SoC design, SerDes interconnects, and advanced manufacturing nodes is critical to compete.
MediaTek focuses on speed and partnerships
DIGITIMES Research analyst Joyce Chen said MediaTek's competitive edge lies in speed. The company has relied on Arm reference designs and TSMC's advanced nodes, building up mass-production know-how in smartphones and Chromebooks. It has also joined Nvidia's DGX Spark GB10 project and partnered with Google on TPU development, accelerating its push into cloud AI ASICs. MediaTek has demonstrated 224G SerDes technology, signaling its in-house interconnect strength and giving it a first-mover advantage through alliances with Nvidia and Google.
Qualcomm emphasizes depth and integration
Qualcomm is taking a different path, focusing on deeper integration. Since acquiring Nuvia in 2021, the company has built its Oryon CPU into a cornerstone of its proprietary IP portfolio. Its 2025 acquisition of Alphawave filled gaps in SerDes and high-speed interconnects, creating a more complete technology stack. Qualcomm also maintains dual foundry options with TSMC and Samsung, enhancing production flexibility. Its Cloud AI 100 and Ultra AI accelerator cards are already deployed in edge inference servers, and it is preparing chips designed for large language model training and inference.
Rivalry that could reshape AI ASIC competition
Chen said both companies now have the capacity to compete in the cloud AI ASIC market. MediaTek's speed gives it an early edge, while Qualcomm has reinforced its technology base through acquisitions. The outcome, Chen noted, will hinge on how well each can manage costs, meet rising demand for computing power, secure advanced manufacturing capacity, and forge partnerships with cloud providers. What is certain, she added, is that Qualcomm and MediaTek are carrying their rivalry beyond smartphones and into cloud AI chips — a contest that could help define the next era of competition in artificial intelligence hardware."

On September 23, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $205.00 price target. The rating affirmation follows Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI and the signifant revenue potential that it offers.
UBS believes that the partnership has the potential to generate approximately $400 billion in revenue for Nvidia over multiple years. However, the timing will largely depend on OpenAI’s implementation plans.
The deal will also allow Nvidia to accomplish its previously outlined growth trajectory toward a $3-4 trillion total addressable market by 2030. Historically, it has managed to capture about 30-35% share.
The firm further elaborated how the partnership is helpful in reinforcing Nvidia’s dominance, demonstrates some risk for Broadcom, and is mostly negative for AMD.
“While timing will, to a large degree, depend on OpenAI’s ramp plan, we estimate this deal ultimately translates into ~$400B of NVDA revenue over a multi-year period. Given the sheer size of the numbers, it does seem likely there could be some overlap with Oracle’s capacity allocated to OpenAI, but our conversation with management suggested this is largely incremental. For NVDA, this helps to flesh out multi-year visibility to the substantial growth headroom it laid out last earnings call when it highlighted a $3-4T TAM by 2030 (of which NVDA’s share has been ~30-35%) and we believe it was OpenAI approaching NVDA for help rather than any sort of vendor financing effort on the part of NVDA. As for AVGO, this could ultimately impact the size of its ASIC revenue from OpenAI, but we have seen no signs of any weakening in what we believe to ultimately be a volume target bigger than what Google does with AVGO. Ultimately, this feels the most negative for AMD as it solidifies NVDA’s market dominance.”
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
All right, now time for some of today's trending tickers. Ya Finance is Ali Canal join me here to take a look at Intel, Tesla, talk a little Starbucks. Let's start with Intel.
Seaport research upgrading that stock to neutral. It's coming amid reports that Intel is in talks with Apple to invest in the company. So this one Ali Seaport uh does go to neutral.
Basically saying they're cautious on the long-term fundamentals but um they say in the near term the stock is likely to be driven. They say by follow on investments and the potential for a stop gap solution for the Fabs. What do you think?
Right. So the near-term catalyst is the focus on for this upgrade. Uh and you know, Intel, it's been in the news a lot recently. We have the Nvidia partnership, Nvidia committing $5 billion dollars, the White House taking a 10% stake in the company. And then you mentioned Josh that report that maybe Apple could invest and there could be a closer collaboration there. Now this is a potential revival of a partnership that Apple moved away from in 2020 when it launched its own chips.
So that in combination is lifting shares of Intel uh today, this afternoon. But for Intel, I just think there's a long road ahead and that upgrade did acknowledge that that over the long term, it's going to be difficult for this company to really catch up to where the others are in this AI race. It's just been behind the eight ball for so long. However, you do have that support now from the government that really wants to bring as much on-shoring as they can to really boost this AI boom.
Yeah, if you saw more direct investments in Intel, I don't know how much that would really be about Intel or is it about also a great way to stay on Trump's good side.
You know, you like Intel, we like Intel. And we've seen billion could be worth it. You know.
Yeah, all these tech executives have been seen at the White House in recent months so.
Yeah, for sure. All right, let's turn two now. Tesla the EV makers seeing uh European sales sliding in August. Our own Prosian has this story for us pointing out uh Tesla here Europe sales drop over 20% in August compared to a year ago, marking the eighth straight month of declining Tesla sales in Europe.
Yeah, that means Tesla's market share is just 1.2% in Europe. That's down from 2% one year ago. And if you compare that to Chinese competitor BYD, they posted a nearly 200% surge in August. So the competition is essentially non-existent. And actually that that might be a 200% surge year to date here. But regardless, Tesla has really struggled in Europe, especially amid these Chinese competitors. Uh shares, I will say, are up around 20% over the past month. This comes after Elon Musk pledged to buy $1 billion worth of stock back.
Year to date though, we are still only up around 5% and it's certainly been a big laggard compared to those other Mag 7 names. And you know, in the US, Tesla did have that first mover advantage. It it it does well in the US. There have been more competition competitors here you could say with some of the big three introducing their own EV models. But Tesla needs to make sure that they can get the car profits right. Because even though over the long term, the Bulls are sort of hanging their hats on robo taxis, uh the promise of autonomous driving. In the interim, this they need to sell cars. And that has to happen both in the US but also especially in Europe and that just seems to be a harder and harder reality for this company to achieve.
Yeah. Now Musk did warn after Q2 earnings that Tesla was in for a said a few rough quarters. And Pros does remind us Tesla will actually give investors the official update of its overall third quarter numbers that's coming next week.
All right, finally, Starbucks announced plans to close unprofitable locations and cut corporate jobs. So, uh this one CEO Brian Nickel making moves, Aly plans to limit 900, these would be non- retail roles, close open positions. This is all part of this $1 billion restructuring effort. We will continue to carefully manage costs and stay focused on the key areas that drive long-term growth, he writes. Uh and this does come after the company already laid off about 1,100 employees.
Yeah, CEO Brian Nickel making moves. He was a former CEO of Chipotle. Now he's at Starbucks and he was specifically brought in to revamp the uh the the really the future of this company that's really just struggled. I mean, underperforming especially with those stores, posting its six straight quarter of falling US same store sales. So, Brian Nickel hoping to reverse that. It's a $1 billion restructuring plan. You mentioned 900 corporate jobs will be eliminated. They're going to reduce the North American footprint by about 1%. And those stores that I mentioned that are underperforming, they'll be shut down as well. And this does bring up a good point to me because even walking around New York City, you see so many Starbucks every single block. And and maybe there is a need to focus on more quality over quantity and that seems to be the playbook of Brian Nickel at this moment in time. Uh they are going to be reinvesting in 1,000 remodels and rolling out a new lower cost prototype store with more seating and drive-through options by 2026. So optionality for the consumer as well.
Yeah, September 9th marking one year for Nickel now at the helm of the company. And he's got his work cut out for him. In his latest quarterly results, Starbucks did post its sixth straight quarterly drop in US Team store sales. That stock is down about 10% from here.
It's been brutal. Brutal, brutal journey for Starbucks.
All right. Thank you Ally. I appreciate it."

Once the chip industry's flag bearer that claimed to put the ""silicon"" in Silicon Valley, Intel has struggled to compete in the booming AI race, falling behind peers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
Intel has invested billions of dollars in setting up a contract manufacturing business that has struggled to compete with TSMC and barely attracted external customers.
The two companies had discussed a preliminary agreement to form a joint venture, with TSMC taking a 20% stake in the new company, the Information had reported in April.

The Morningstar Global Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Index, which provides exposure to about 50 top AI companies, is up 37% in 2025 (as of Sept. 19). The S&P 500 index has increased by 13% over that same time frame.
Because of how much growth there has already been in the AI sector, most of these stocks aren't cheap. But that doesn't mean you're out of luck with investment opportunities. The global AI market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% through 2032, according to research by Fortune Business Insights.
So, which companies are best positioned to capitalize on that growth? Here is a pair of AI stocks worth considering for your portfolio.
1. Nvidia
There are plenty of AI success stories out there, but none has been bigger than Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). It's the top company by market cap and the first to reach a value of $4 trillion.
Nvidia's size and the fact that it's trading at a high valuation (39 times forward earnings) scare off some investors. However, it has consistently delivered excellent results over the last two-plus years, beating earnings expectations and seeing revenue rise by more than 50% year over year for nine consecutive quarters.
Most of that is data center revenue as tech companies invest in Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for the training and inference of their AI models. Nvidia is the dominant player here -- estimates put its share of the AI chip market at 85% to 90%.
Nvidia is also taking steps to expand its reach. It recently invested $5 billion to take a roughly 5% stake in Intel. Intel is the leader in CPU market share, and data centers need AI GPUs and CPUs. Intel will now be making custom CPUs for Nvidia, allowing Nvidia to advance its technology.
On a negative note, China has reportedly banned its tech companies from using Nvidia AI chips due to tensions with the U.S. That effectively cuts Nvidia off from a major market. However, trade talks between the U.S. and China are ongoing, so it remains to be seen if this is a long-term issue.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), which owns Facebook, Instagram, and several other companies, is making a significant push into AI. So far this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has:
- Hired away top AI talent from rival companies to form Meta Superintelligence Labs, with pay packages reportedly as high as $300 million.
- Invested $14.8 billion to take a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data labeling start-up.
- Committed to investing at least $600 billion in U.S. data centers and infrastructure through 2028.
Meta is incorporating AI through various aspects of its business. It launched a Meta AI assistant and has woven generative AI tools into its existing apps, including Messenger and WhatsApp. Meta Glasses are getting an upgrade to AI smart glasses. And it now offers AI advertising tools to enhance and optimize campaigns.
Advertising is also how Meta can afford to invest so heavily in AI. Its revenue over the trailing 12 months is $179 billion, with about 98% of that coming from advertising. Ad revenue gives Meta a sizable war chest -- it has also generated $50 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.
It hasn't all been smooth sailing for Meta lately. The tech giant's Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses recently failed in two live demos, leading to an awkward moment for Zuckerberg and bad publicity for Meta's AI ambitions. However, the glasses are getting positive early reviews.
Overall, this is a business with strong financials that's betting big on AI to enhance its products and services. It's also not overly expensive, trading at 28 times forward earnings. With its valuation, cash flow, and AI ambitions, Meta is one of the better tech investments currently available."

I want to ask you about kind of taking a little bit of a left turn. Another um headline that caught our eye. And this is the report from Bloomberg that Intel had tried to solicit Apple to also invest in it as we have seen other companies and the US government for that matter doing. Um, does that kind of partnership make sense to you from from the Apple perspective? It sounds like it's still in early stages and might not happen.
Yeah, it very much does make sense. Let's rewind a month ago. Intel was saying that they would love to go into their new 14A technology and build that out in the United States. They just don't have any customers. Which was very alarming at the time. That was that meant they really didn't have a viable way forward as a company. The United States government stepped in and said, no, we need there to be a domestic manufacturer of semi and we will do that by backing Intel up, uh by taking a stake in it and by getting involved. Lo and behold, a week later, Nvidia signed up as an investor and to to be a 14A customer likely down the road. And now what what Intel needs is for Apple, the other biggest consumer of of semiconductors to sign up to have a domestic manufacturer of chips. This is of strategic importance to the US and for Intel to be successful, it needs these anchor tenants. There couldn't be better two better anchor tenants. They've already signed up Nvidia, now they need to sign up Apple."

Will It Pay Off?,The GPU giant just made big news again in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8aee296473cf0ba13058918e0fb1cfe4358eb9737dfa8633fabda4f3f4d94a01,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/nvidia-makes-a-familiar-move-with-100-billion-inve/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/nvidia-makes-a-familiar-move-with-100-billion-inve/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/25/nvidia-makes-a-familiar-move-with-100-billion-inve/,fool.com,200,,"Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is at it again. Just days after surprising the market with a $5 billion investment in Intel, it's forming a similar tie-up with OpenAI.
However, the scale of this deal will be much larger: Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI over time as part of a project to build 10 gigawatts of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, with millions of Nvidia GPUs powering OpenAI's next-generation AI infrastructure. Nvidia stock jumped 4% on the news, hitting an all-time high.
What's happening here?
The two companies signed a letter of intent for this ""landmark strategic partnership"" to further OpenAI's ambitions of achieving artificial superintelligence.
With 10 gigawatts, one could power between 4 million and 5 million GPUs, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said is about the volume that the company will ship this year. The first phase of this ambitious project is expected to come online in the second half of 2026, using chips built on Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin platform.
OpenAI and Nvidia have already been working together for years, and OpenAI has run on Nvidia technology since its early days.
As for the $100 billion Nvidia plans to invest, the timeline is unclear. The chipmaker simply says it plans to invest that money ""progressively as each gigawatt is deployed.""
The companies said they would finalize the details over the coming weeks.
A familiar playbook
Nvidia has engaged in similar maneuvers before. It has built up a portfolio of investments in companies that are often its customers, and sometimes even its suppliers.
Among the public companies that Nvidia owns stakes in are CoreWeave and Nebius, the two leading AI neocloud providers; Arm Holdings, whose CPU designs it licenses; Applied Digital, with which it collaborates on high-performance computing data centers; and Intel, a struggling chipmaker that Nvidia just invested $5 billion in as part of a larger partnership.
The OpenAI deal, if it fulfills its ambition, would by far be Nvidia's biggest investment to date. It's also the most valuable company Nvidia has invested in. OpenAI was valued at $300 billion in its last funding round in March, but in August, it was flirting with a $500 billion valuation in its plan for a secondary stock sale.
While $100 billion is a huge amount of money for any company, it's a manageable sum for Nvidia, which will generate approximately that much in net income this year. Investing that much will also make it a major shareholder in OpenAI, but the move makes sense for Nvidia.
OpenAI is the largest and most influential AI start-up, and much of the money that Nvidia is investing will come right back to it via the purchases of GPUs to power those data centers. In fact, the investment serves as an incentive for OpenAI to buy Nvidia's products.
It also helps block challengers like AMD from cutting into Nvidia's huge market share lead in the data center GPU market.
Is Nvidia a buy?
Nvidia seems to be making all the right moves lately in AI, both technologically and strategically, and forming a network of partnerships should only entrench its market leadership. It also gives it a portfolio of investments that could deliver strong returns.
As long as the AI boom persists, Nvidia looks like a great stock to own. As recent reports by the likes of Oracle and others show, the dollars are still flowing into AI infrastructure. As they do, expect Nvidia's stock price to continue to move higher over the long term."

Its graphics processing units (GPUs) power the backbone of generative artificial intelligence (AI), enabling large language models (LLMs) and driving advancements in next-generation use cases across autonomous systems and robotics.
While the notion of dethroning Nvidia in the chip realm might seem far-fetched, one ""Magnificent Seven"" rival is beginning to challenge its dominance. Enter Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%). Best known for Google and YouTube, the company is quietly building momentum through its artificial intelligence businesses.
In the discussion below, I'll examine how Alphabet is positioning itself to disrupt Nvidia's leadership in AI chips and consider whether the internet giant could soon deliver a ""checkmate"" to the market's biggest beneficiary of the AI boom.
Alphabet's secret weapon in cloud computing
At the center of Alphabet's push against Nvidia are its custom-designed, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) known as tensor processing units (TPUs). These chips have become a cornerstone of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) where they serve as a differentiator in an intensely competitive market dominated by Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
In recent months, Google Cloud has secured high-profile wins with companies such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms. Industry reports also suggest that TPUs have played a decisive role in attracting other AI leaders, including Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence, further reinforcing Alphabet's position in the AI infrastructure race.
How big of an opportunity is custom silicon for Alphabet?
By housing both research (DeepMind) and hardware (TPUs) under one roof, Alphabet has created a vertically integrated ecosystem capable of building, training, and deploying AI models and services through the Gemini and Google Cloud platforms.
In a recent research note, Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson estimated that if Alphabet were ever to spin off the DeepMind and TPU businesses, the combined value of these assets could approach $900 billion -- up from an estimate of $717 billion earlier this year.
While these figures are speculative, it implies that Alphabet may be sitting on a near trillion-dollar opportunity -- one that might otherwise have gone to Nvidia.
Is Alphabet about to dethrone Nvidia?
To assess whether Alphabet truly has Nvidia on the defensive, it's important to understand the difference between GPUs and TPUs.
GPUs are designed as highly versatile processors: They can handle parallel computations, which makes them ideal for rendering graphics or running large-scale AI workloads. Their flexibility is what has made them the backbone of AI development to date.
On the other hand, TPUs are far more specialized. They are optimized for neural networking applications, particularly deep learning and inference. This specialization allows TPUs to deliver high performance for machine learning models. Critically, though, they lack the broad utility of GPUs across more diverse workloads.
Another critical factor behind Nvidia's dominance is its CUDA software platform. The seamless integration of its GPUs with CUDA's parallel programming environment has given Nvidia a powerful competitive edge, creating a durable technological moat that makes switching to competing platforms highly unlikely.
Against that backdrop, Google's TPUs have certainly reshaped the competitive landscape, offering businesses a specialized alternative for certain applications. However, TPUs represent more of a complementary option to Nvidia's comprehensive services rather than a true substitute.
In other words, while Alphabet has placed an intriguing piece on the chess board, it has not maneuvered Nvidia into a checkmate position."

Morgan
SAN FRANCISCO, September 25, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today Factory is releasing Droids – the best software development agents in the world, after hitting #1 on Terminal Bench (the standard benchmark used by world-class tools like Claude Code and Cursor). Factory is also announcing a $50 million Series B from NEA, Sequoia Capital, NVIDIA, J.P. Morgan, as well as notable angel investors, including Frank Slootman, Nikesh Arora, and Aaron Levie.
Every other AI coding platform forces you to choose: one IDE, one LLM, one agent, one interface. Developers deserve a choice. Factory is the first platform that is LLM agnostic, IDE agnostic, remote/local agnostic, and interface agnostic. Developers can delegate tasks to Droids from the Terminal, the IDE, Slack, Linear, or the Browser. For further customization, developers can utilize headless mode to set up scripts or triggers that build fully customized Droids. In order to become agent-native, developers need agents that meet them where they are. With the flexibility of the Droids, the path toward that agent-native future is clearer.
""Agent‑native development presents the most substantive shift in software development since the move to the cloud,"" said Matan Grinberg, co-founder and CEO of Factory. ""At Factory, we’re bringing that transition to every developer—starting with Droids in the CLI —so teams can evolve their behavior without rewriting their entire workflow. Agents will not replace developers, but developers who are fluent with agents will rapidly outleverage and outpace developers who are not.""
At the organization level, Factory integrates with the entire engineering stack, including tools such as GitHub, Slack, Jira, Datadog, Sentry, and Google Drive. Using this organization-wide context, Droids onboard like a human engineer and create a ""mental model"" similar to that of an engineer who has worked in the code for decades.
The world’s best engineers at customers and partners like Ernst & Young, NVIDIA, MongoDB, Zapier, Bayer, and Clari are using Factory to accelerate tasks across the entire software development lifecycle, beyond just coding.

Intel received good news yesterday regarding the end-demand fundamentals of its key end markets. However, the stock's strong rally over the past month has generally been due to investments from outside parties, including Nvidia, SoftBank, and the U.S. government.
Last night, another rumor emerged regarding another potential investment along these lines, with Bloomberg reporting the next investee could be Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). This and other news around Intel raising prices on certain PC chips could be leading to the strong rally today.
Lip-Bu Tan pitches Apple
According to Bloomberg, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has apparently approached Apple for a potential investment in the company.
A deal may seem far-fetched, as Apple is a massive, first-in-line customer of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. However, Apple has huge silicon needs between its A-series iPhone chipsets and various M-series laptop and desktop chipsets. The company is also looking to curry favor with the Trump administration, which has been advocating for more investment in U.S. tech manufacturing. And finally, if Intel's foundry efforts were to fail and TSMC became a true monopoly, TSMC could continue raising wafer prices as much as it wanted to customers, including Apple.
An investment from Apple would further bolster Intel's balance sheet, and also could signal that Apple may become a future foundry customer for Intel's 14A node.
In addition to the Apple rumors, it was also reported Intel was raising prices on its older-generation Raptor Lake CPUs.
It is strange to see Intel raising prices on an older node chip, but it could indicate strong demand for low-end laptops. Another possibility would be if Intel were moving more equipment to supply newer nodes, which would indicate stronger demand for new PC chips. Yesterday, memory giant Micron said it is seeing stronger PC demand than anticipated, so this is likely good news for Intel's revenue and margins either way.
Is Intel's run coming to an end or just getting started?
Intel's stock has now regained levels not seen since July 2024, after a long winter in which its future came into doubt and the stock price fell below the company's book value. However, it appears Tan's capital raise from prominent fabless chipmakers is boosting confidence in Intel's strategy and technology, despite their dilutive effects.

Last month, the federal government invested a cool $8.9 billion to own roughly 10% of the chipmaker's equity. Closely following that, Asian tech conglomerate SoftBank bought into the company with a $2 billion investment. Finally, in September, Nvidia piled in with a $5 billion stock buy.
Now, apparently, Apple (AAPL 0.54%) might be reaching for its wallet, too.
Together again... maybe
On Wednesday, Bloomberg, citing unnamed ""people familiar with the matter,"" reported that Intel approached Apple regarding such an investment. Officials from the two tech giants also talked about potentially working together. The article didn't state how much Apple is being asked to invest, or what form future collaboration could take.
The report's sources did say that these discussions are at an early stage. As such, it's possible they won't result in any kind of agreement. Additionally, those folks said Intel also contacted other enterprises about investments and partnering up. No names were given, but if this is accurate we can safely assume these are sizable and well-capitalized peer tech companies.
Neither Intel nor Apple commented on the report, and there has been no official word from either following publication.
Previously partners
The pair had a lengthy business relationship in the recent past.
Most notably, in 2006 Intel started manufacturing processors for Apple computers, but over time the latter decided it was more advantageous to bring such critical components in-house. The transition from third-party to homegrown began in 2020, and Apple discontinued the last Intel-powered machine in 2023.
Since then Apple bobbled along, effectively defending its position as a relatively high-end smartphone maker (so far this decade its iPhone has maintained global market share in the high-20% range against the more ubiquitous Android devices).
Intel's fortunes, however, declined. The PC market that was its bread and butter for many years hasn't been an inspiring source of growth lately -- annual worldwide shipments have fallen more than they've risen since 2015, and that takes into account a COVID-fueled spike in 2021.
Meanwhile, the company has been slow and ineffective in embracing powerful, next-generation processors that can handle the heavy demands of artificial intelligence (AI) technology (in contrast to the prescient Nvidia, which is now a powerhouse in the segment). And a long-promised effort to be a chipmaking business for others (or ""foundry"" in industry parlance) hasn't gotten much traction.
Money can't solve every problem
In the wake of the report, Intel's share price shot up by 6% and Apple's sagged by 1%. That's telling me the tech investing hive mind thinks any potential tie-up would be a win for Intel. For Apple, not so much.
That stands to reason. Intel's major troubles are daunting and deep, and not the kind that can easily be wiped away by infusions of cash (even large ones). That said, getting billions from companies and governments gives Intel at least a fighting chance at tackling the problems and becoming prominent again. So why not accept a fat bag from Apple for a chunk of stock?
It's harder to see any real advantage for the iPhone maker, though. It probably doesn't desire any kind of development or manufacturing partnership with Intel; it expended much time, capital, and resources in that proprietary chip effort, after all.
Besides, it has what appears to be a fine relationship with the most successful third-party chippie in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which cranks out those Apple processors. As far as I can tell, there's no reason to rock this boat.
A different motivation might lie in the political realm. One of the top Trump administration goals is to bring manufacturing, especially that of the tech variety, back into this country. To that end, in April Apple promised to add $100 million to its investments in this country, adding to an existing $500 billion pledge.
Putting a few of those bucks into Intel would help satisfy this commitment. However, in the announcement, CEO Tim Cook said the extra funding would include ""new and expanded work with 10 companies across America. They produce components that are used in Apple products sold all over the world.""
This sounds very much like it's aiming to channel money to existing business partners, not ones it divorced years ago.
Wisest not to count on it
Ultimately, if I were a betting man I wouldn't place any money on Apple placing money on Intel. Yes, like Nvidia the company has piles of cash in its treasure chest (over $30 billion at the end of its latest-reported quarter), but it didn't become the behemoth it is today by spending vaguely or casually. There seems to be, at best, little for it to gain with any level of Intel buy-in.
Yet in the tech world, far more oddball investments have been made, some of which were even successful. So these Intel-Apple discussions are worth monitoring for shareholders of both companies, because one never knows. Still I, for one, am not expecting a reunion of the pair."

(Reuters) - Intel has approached Apple about securing an investment in the struggling chipmaker, Bloomberg News reported on Sept. 24, citing people familiar with the matter.
The iPhone maker and Intel have also discussed how to work more closely together, the report said, adding that the talks are at an early stage and may not lead to an agreement.
Intel declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The report comes days after Nvidia announced it would invest $5 billion in Intel for a roughly 4% stake in the company.
Nvidia's pact with Intel includes a plan for the two companies to jointly develop PC and data center chips, but crucially, will not involve Intel's contract manufacturing business - or foundry - making computing chips for Nvidia.
Intel is in the middle of investing $28 billion into two microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany. The factories were to originally open this year, but now may not be completed until 2030 or later.
Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been trying to bring in partners as part of a turnaround at the ailing chipmaker.
Once the chip industry's flag bearer that claimed to put the ""silicon"" in Silicon Valley, Intel has struggled to compete in the booming AI race, falling behind peers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
The investment from Nvidia came just weeks after the White House engineered an extraordinary deal for the federal government to take a 10% stake in Intel, an agreement that would ensure the company receives about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the U.S.
Intel also received another $2 billion equity investment from SoftBank Group last month.
The cash infusions in Intel have pushed up investor sentiment, with the stock climbing more than 40% since mid-August.
The reported investment from Apple would come as another vote of confidence for Intel. Apple had been a longtime customer of Intel before it transitioned to using its own custom-designed silicon chips from 2020.
For Apple, which relies heavily on Intel's rival TSMC to manufacture its chips, the new partnership would allow it to diversify its chipmaking supplier base - a move that could be valuable if geopolitical risks in Taiwan worsen due to China's role in the region.
The potential investment in the United States would also help strengthen Apple's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. While much of Apple's supply chain remains international, the company has committed about $600 billion to domestic initiatives over the next four years.
In response to a Reuters query on whether the Trump administration had conversations with Intel or Apple about an investment, and if it would support such a deal, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, ""The U.S. Government is not involved in Intel's day-to-day operations.""
""The taxpayer has an equity stake in Intel succeeding, and the Administration supports iconic American companies like Intel doing what's best to cement American tech dominance.""
Striking lucrative partnerships and persuading outside clients to use Intel's factories remain key to its future. The Santa Clara, California-based company has also reached out to other companies about possible investments and partnerships, according to the Bloomberg News report.

Shares of quantum computing company IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) fell 4.6% in the morning session after investors appeared to take profits as the company announced it achieved a significant technical milestone ahead of schedule.
IonQ reached an algorithmic qubit score of #AQ 64 on its Tempo quantum system, a goal it met three months earlier than planned. This achievement marked a substantial increase in the system's computational power. However, the positive news followed an immense run-up in the stock's price, which had surged 873% over the previous year and had just recently touched an all-time high. The drop suggested that investors who had bought in during the rally decided to sell and lock in their profits after the widely anticipated news was confirmed.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy IonQ? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
IonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 107 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 3.1% on the news that B. Riley Securities raised its price target on the stock to $100 from $75 and maintained its 'Buy' rating. The new price target suggested a potential upside of nearly 37% from its trading level at the time of the announcement. Analyst Craig Ellis's decision reflected a more positive outlook for the company's future performance. This bullish signal from the analyst firm occurred while the stock was already on a strong run. The shares were on their seventh straight day of gains, accumulating a total return of 61% over that period and adding significant value to the company's market capitalization.
IonQ is up 56.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $67.58 per share, it is still trading 10.1% below its 52-week high of $75.14 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of IonQ’s shares at the IPO in January 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $6,257.

The company’s focus on high-performance computing solutions, particularly its EPYC processors and Instinct GPUs, has positioned it as a key player in the rapidly growing AI and data center markets. In the second quarter of 2025, AMD reported record revenues of $7.7 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase, driven by strong demand for its EPYC and Ryzen processors, as well as the ramp-up of its MI350 series GPUs.
Expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. In June 2025, AMD unveiled its new Instinct MI350 Series GPUs and open rack-scale AI infrastructure, showcasing significant advancements in AI performance and energy efficiency alongside major industry partners.
AMD’s partnerships with major players, such as Oracle, which is building a 27,000-node AI cluster powered by AMD’s CPUs, GPUs, and SmartNICs, further underscore its growing presence in the AI space.
Further expanding its portfolio, AMD recently expanded its global partnership with Cohere. This collaboration brings AMD Instinct GPU-powered infrastructure to Cohere’s enterprise AI services, integrating Cohere’s North platform into its own AI workloads. The goal of this partnership is to provide secure, high-performance, and cost-effective AI solutions for businesses and sovereign AI projects around the world.
AMD Suffers From Stiff Competition
Advanced Micro Devices suffers from stiff competition from the likes of NVIDIA NVDA and Intel Corporation INTC, which are also expanding their footprint in the AI Infrastructure space.
NVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance accelerated computing. The increasing demand for generative AI and large language models that utilize graphics processing units (GPUs) from NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is driving up data center revenues. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Data Center revenues jumped 56% year over year and 5% from the previous quarter to $41.1 billion.
Intel is gaining solid market traction in the AI infrastructure market. Super Micro Computer, a global leader in high-performance, energy-efficient IT solutions, has opted to deploy Intel’s Xeon 6 Processors in its 4-socket servers for large-scale database and enterprise applications. Intel has also revealed that several industry leaders across industries, including AT&T, Verizon, Samsung, and Ericsson, are leveraging Xeon 6 for network transformation and AI acceleration."

In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenues climbed 55% year over year to $3.3 billion, lifting overall cloud revenues (IaaS + SaaS) 28% to $7.2 billion. Management expects OCI to expand 77% to $18 billion in fiscal 2026, with a roadmap projecting growth to $144 billion within five years. These ambitious targets are supported by a record $455 billion in Remaining Performance Obligations, driven by multibillion-dollar AI contracts with leading customers like OpenAI, NVIDIA, AMD and Meta.
To meet this demand, Oracle is investing $35 billion in CapEx during fiscal 2026 to build 37 new multi-cloud data centers. This expansion is closely aligned with hyperscaler partnerships and accelerating AI workloads, ensuring Oracle can convert backlog into recurring revenues. At the same time, innovations such as the upcoming Oracle AI Database, which integrates large language models directly into its database platform, are broadening its cloud offering.
Rising AI workloads require massive computing power, and enterprises are increasingly adopting multi-cloud strategies. Oracle’s ability to integrate across AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure reinforces the appeal of its cross-platform approach.
Risks remain around heavy spending, margin pressure and competition from established rivals. Still, with robust contract wins, expanding infrastructure and the Zacks Consensus Estimate predicting revenue growth of 16% in fiscal 2026 and nearly 21% in fiscal 2027, Oracle’s aggressive cloud expansion looks well-positioned to deliver strong upside.
Oracle’s Rivals in the Race for Cloud Growth
Microsoft MSFT Azure competes with Oracle in the cloud domain by leveraging its deep integration with existing Microsoft products, like Office 365 and SQL Server, and its hybrid-cloud strength to dominate enterprise workloads, boasting cloud revenues of $47 billion and 39% Azure growth in the recent fourth-quarter fiscal 2025. Microsoft’s vast ecosystem, rapid AI innovation and cross-industry adoption strengthen its cloud leadership against Oracle. With diverse services, hybrid capabilities and global reach, Microsoft Azure is positioned as a superior long-term choice.
Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud Platform (GCP) competes with Oracle by excelling in data analytics, AI/ML and open-source technologies. With leadership in BigQuery, TensorFlow and Kubernetes, GCP provides developer-friendly, innovative tools ideal for data-driven companies. Its transparent pricing and powerful AI capabilities increase appeal, although OCI often sets higher standards when it comes to database performance and traditional enterprise workloads. While GCP's legacy systems may require further refactoring, Google's relentless innovation positions it as a strong choice for modern, cutting-edge cloud adoption."

I was talking about AI fatigue coming into here, seeing some weakness in Nvidia. Barclays out with an interesting note this morning on AI and how big that industry is going and uh, I think you were on a call listening to their uh thesis a little bit more.
Yeah, I was on a call just now listening to them comparing the AI boom to the dotcom bubble and why it's not necessarily like the dotcom bubble.
Uh first of all because the spenders during the dotcom bubble were the telecom companies. They were comparing CapX to sales. They're saying that right now it's increased 25%. Back then it was up 40%.
They're also saying that the telecoms were depending heavily on debt in the credit markets. Not not so not is the case with the hyper scalers that are flush with cash. And they're also talking about how hyper scalers are a high margin business.
And that their operating companies are the operating expenses, I should say, are going up, but their revenue is going up at a faster pace. So Barclays is actually saying that they see a strong footing for the AI theme.
They don't see a derailment so to speak for the next 6 to 18 months. Yes, there are risks. Uh yes, they are they also talked about euphoria in the markets. Euphoria in the in the stock market right now is elevated. We all know that.
But as far as the overall AI theme, when it comes to the hyper scalers, they say that it's on strong footing.
Brent, real quick. Final word to you. Do you buy the dips on AI names?
Look, I I I think that likely Barclays is not correct. I I think there are echoes of the .com era. It doesn't mean they're exactly the same.
I think the risk is that people have priced it as if Barclays is correct, and that's where I would encourage people to own things outside of just AI. And so don't focus only on AI stocks because that is where there is the risk that it doesn't turn out the the way that people imagine right now, which is already priced into the market, which is at the same levels roughly on many measures as it was back in late 1999.
I would focus instead on cheaper parts of the market because I do think valuation works longer term. I do think history repeats. and I do think you'll see better days ahead for the average stock in the S&P 500 as well as small and midcap in the US, which trade at relative valuations at the exact same levels as 1999, which ushered in good years ahead for those parts of the market.
Uh and that's where I would continue to focus on people being diversified and not concentrated.
I'm feeling that hot take. That's the hot take I needed on this Thursday morning. Big thanks to my opening bid round table, Brent Shooty, Brooke DePalma, and Anes Ferrel."

That's according to Charles Schwab (SCHW) CEO Rick Wurster, who repeated the adage ""it's about time in the market, as opposed to timing the market"" on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.
Wurster explained that clients often call asking if now is the moment to cash out after the market's relentless climb. In most cases, he pushes back on the urge to jump in and out of stocks.
""The hard part about timing the market is you've got to be right twice,"" he said. ""You've got to get out at the right time, and then you've got to be able to get back in at the right time, and that's very hard to do.""
The market's massive rally has been driven by a handful of Big Tech names known as the ""Magnificent Seven."" Strong earnings, hefty cash flows, and surging demand for artificial intelligence have propelled Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) to record valuations, helping push indexes to new highs.
As of Wednesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up nearly 13% year to date, while the Nasdaq (^IXIC) has gained over 16%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) has lagged slightly, rising above 8% over the same period.
""Their fundamentals have been so strong,"" Wurster said. ""There's real robustness to their businesses. So I think that's been fueling the market higher, and our clients love it.""
He added that Schwab's investors are also more active than in recent years. ""Our clients are really engaged,"" Wurster noted, with trading up 30% compared to last year. Margin balances are at an ""all-time high,"" he said, and more customers are using options to ride the rally.
That enthusiasm, however, comes with caution.
""I would describe our clients as happy because their balances have never been higher, but a little bit nervous about the elevation of the market,"" Wurster said, describing his recent visits to 15 Schwab branches across the country.

Also on investors' minds are the Federal Reserve's next moves, including forthcoming rate cuts. In part, that may be why markets are continuing to hit new highs, Wurster added.
That nervousness isn't misplaced. RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas previously told Yahoo Finance that the market's rally has been unusually concentrated, or what he described as ""frothy,"" with just a few megacap stocks accounting for much of the gains. If those leaders stumble, the broader indexes could quickly give back ground."

The company's stock fell 5% in premarket trading before quickly rebounding to gain more than 1% in the first hour after the opening bell Thursday morning. The deal brings the value of the companies' joint agreements to $22.4 billion.
Livingston, N.J.-based CoreWeave provides cloud computing infrastructure specifically designed for tasks requiring massive amounts of GPU processing power, like training machine learning and AI models.
This deal promises OpenAI additional computing power needed to train and operate its AI models on top of what CoreWeave already provides the AI giant. The two companies signed an initial agreement for computing power last March for $11.9 billion, then added a $4 billion agreement in May.
“We are proud to expand our relationship with OpenAI, a company consistently at the forefront of advancing artificial intelligence,” CoreWeave co-founder, chair, and CEO Michael Intrator said.
The news comes after OpenAI announced on Tuesday that its Stargate AI data center and cloud computing site in Abilene, Texas, will open three new sites with partner company Oracle (ORCL) in a deal worth $300 billion.
The AI giant said Stargate aims to secure 10 gigawatts of capacity for the site, worth $500 billion, by the end of the year. Nvidia (NVDA), which has signed multibillion-dollar computing purchase agreements with CoreWeave, just minted a new deal with OpenAI in which OpenAI will build at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers with Nvidia, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI.
CoreWeave shares, meanwhile, are up 230% since its IPO in March. The company has been aggressive in dealmaking, inking agreements with OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and IBM (IBM). Wall Street analysts have largely been bullish on the company.
But skeptics see potential issues, especially in the CoreWeave's concentration of customers.
""Chances were already high that CoreWeave would be involved in the NVDA/OAI collaboration, given their experience as an infrastructure partner to both OpenAI and NVDA, who are also CRWV's core clients,"" Hedgeye Risk Management wrote in a research note published Thursday morning after the deal announcement.
""Enormous customer concentration is coming, as we think NVDA and OAI will be CRWV's only core customers by the end of 2027.""
CoreWeave's most recent earnings report showed that Microsoft accounted for 70% of the company's revenue for the quarter."

Memory is prone to boom and bust cycles as inventory levels and prices fluctuate according to supply and demand.
However, Micron has been one of the best performers in the semiconductor sector this year, a sign that investors may be underrating its momentum and that of the memory segment in the AI boom. Micron and its peers make high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that are an essential component of AI, and that's a key reason the stock has doubled this year, outpacing better-known industry players like Nvidia and AMD. That strength and momentum were on display in Micron's fourth-quarter earnings report.
After raising its guidance in August, the company topped both its updated guidance and analyst estimates.
Revenue in the quarter jumped 46% to $11.32 billion, which topped the consensus at $11.16 billion. The quarter capped off a year with similar growth and full-year revenue of $37.4 billion.
The company also fulfilled an earlier promise, made in March 2024, that Micron would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI in the semiconductor industry, and that it would deliver record revenue and significantly improved profitability for the year it just completed. It did just that.
In addition to the strong revenue growth, gross margin improved from 35.3% to 44.7%, reflecting the ramping up of high-value data center products and pricing strength in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), which includes HBM.
Operating margin improved from 19.6% to 32.3% as it gained leverage on research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses, and it reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03, up from $1.18 in the quarter a year ago, and ahead of estimates at $2.86.
Micron stock was essentially flat on the report, but that seems to just be a reflection that high expectations were baked in after the stock rose roughly 40% in September coming into the report. Keep reading to see three reasons the stock can continue gaining.
1. Guidance shows results will get even better
Micron did not give guidance for the full fiscal year, but its outlook for the first quarter shows its momentum will continue into the current quarter.
It called for $12.2 billion to $12.8 billion in revenue, up 44% from the quarter a year ago at the midpoint and well ahead of the consensus at $11.83 billion. It also forecast gross margin to top 50% at 50.5% to 52.5% on an adjusted basis. The company's gross margin has only been above 50% one other time before, during a boom in the late 2010s.
2. Supply remains tight
Supply/demand dynamics are kind in Micron's business, so it's good news that management sees supply remaining tight in the year ahead.
Micron was sold out of HBM capacity for this year by June 2024, and management continues to see a tight supply environment in fiscal 2026, especially as demand for AI capacity keeps accelerating.
That dynamic should support high prices for Micron's products and strong margins into fiscal 2026. The company also said it expects to sell the remainder of its HBM supply for calendar 2026 in the coming months.
3. Micron is still a good value
Forward estimates on Micron have moved steadily upward, and should do so again following the latest earnings report. It now trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 20, and a forward P/E of 12.5.
Compared to its peers in the AI sector, those are rock-bottom valuations, and it's still growing faster than many of its chip stock peers. In fact, its revenue growth is now rivaling that of Nvidia.
The low valuation seems to reflect the previous boom-and-bust cycles in memory, but the AI era may have introduced a new paradigm for the sector. While the same underlying dynamics still exist, the size of the market now seems to be significantly larger, meaning Micron could have more years of booming growth ahead of it -- good news for its investors."

Among the developments are physical AI capabilities such as data synthesis, model training, environmental simulation, and validation testing.
The news spilled over to Chinese companies, including GDS Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:GDS), an AI infrastructure company, with strong confidence that further investments in the industry would largely bolster demand for data centers.
In other developments, investor sentiment was also boosted by announcements earlier this week that China’s AI sector has grown by 24 percent year-on-year to 900 billion yuan.
According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, the number of AI companies in China has already surpassed 5,300, accounting for 15 percent globally.

Is this the the end or a pause in this FOMO trade?
No, absolutely not. I mean, I think you've got a lot of things going on right now. Uh there's a lot of focus on the Fed, interest rates and people try to correlate that to how stocks, particular tech stocks react. I think this is more just one of those stories where it it's run really far, really fast.
So to have a pause is healthy, but I think the momentum it would it be hard to bet against the momentum right now.
Do I think some of these companies have probably outpaced themselves? Yes. Uh but you know, when you look at the valuation of some of the companies like Nvidia, I mean, it's still trading below 30 times earnings now. So, you know, when you look at what they're doing, um, and how they're executing,
it should be no surprise that the stock is up as much as it is. I think where you want to be careful are the names that the valuations are just outrageous. it's hard because I just it eliminates the margin of error when the valuations are that stretched.
It doesn't mean the stock's going to go down by any means. It just means that if the earnings come out and it is a disappointment of any kind, that stock is going to be punished, you know, fairly aggressively. Um so I think that's where you want to watch valuation. I don't think it it's not going to be the entire industry, you're not going to see it roll over. I think what you're going to see is just name by name that may miss.
And you know, because this is that kind of period where we're trying to figure out who the winners and losers are going to be because we're still very early. you know, we're probably third inning of this. So we're going to kind of have a long runway of ups and downs.
Yeah. So, given all of that too, though, do you want to be defensive on the other side? Like have all that stuff, have the Nvidias of the world, but then also be a little defensive just in case?
Absolutely. So, uh we're actually doing what we would call a barbell strategy, right? So, you know, we're still taking that bet. Uh that bet is probably a more defensive tilt on the AI bet. But elsewhere we are playing a lot more defense. We are paying attention more to valuation. We are, you know, looking for those stocks that pay higher dividends to kind of
offset because the growing number of things that could go wrong, you know, the term black swans, uh seems to be escalating. Uh there's still a lot of geopolitical things that we haven't figured out. You obviously have rhetoric out of Washington, the Fed, the Fed chair is going to change. So there are a lot of things that could change over the next six months, 12 months, uh that we still like stocks, we just want to be a little bit careful.
Gotcha. What does the defensive side of the equation look like?
Yeah, so, you know, in tech, it's going very boring, Microsoft, Google. Um right now we're staying away from Apple or at least under waiting it. But then elsewhere, you know, we're looking at healthcare.
Lily is a name we really like. Um, you know, there's just a lot going on in the healthcare space. There are some shifts, but you know, we still like the weight loss story um out of different names. So still still heavy in that, but like I said, that still is a defensive play. And then, you know, when you're looking in the consumer side, you're looking at uh, like I said, it's the more boring names. It's your Pepsi, your Cokes, uh Proctor and Gamble. We think right now, those are the places you want to kind of like I said, barbell, uh kind of hedge the rest of your portfolio in those like
because that dividend, that means something. If the stocks are going down, that's something you can reinvest as as uh markets may turn over. So, like I said, it's just looking at those lower beta, you know, lower volatility names."

Micron
Micron Technology (MU 2.62%) specializes in the production of memory chips, a key component of computing. The memory market is among the most cyclical parts of the semiconductor industry, and this has often led to bust cycles so severe that they wiped out entire booms in past cycles.
More recently, this dynamic seems to have changed thanks to Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM). It uses vertical 3D stacking to raise data transfer rates and throughput, helping to make some of the more advanced AI applications possible.
This popularity helped Micron's revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended May 31) to grow by 31% to $9.3 billion. That improvement increased operating expenses by a modest amount, resulting in a quarterly net income of $1.9 billion, up from $332 million in the year-ago quarter.
With that improvement, investors have just begun to appreciate Micron stock, as evidenced by the rise in the stock price over the last year. At a P/E ratio of 29 and the stock back in a growth mode, there is likely time for new investors to buy before the market takes greater notice of Micron's performance.
Marvell
Chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL 3.13%) has long developed chips for the telecom and consumer sectors. However, its move into custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), specifically in the data center side of the business, has led investors to view Marvell in a new light.
The company's cloud solutions, interconnects, and network switches provide the foundational infrastructure needed to offer what Marvell claims is an ""unmatched performance"" to AI data centers.
The company's financials affirm its value to the AI marketplace. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Aug. 2), Marvell's $2 billion in revenue surged 58% compared to year-ago levels. Operating expenses rose by 5% during that time, resulting in a net income of $195 million. In Q2 of fiscal 2024, Marvell lost $193 million.
Admittedly, investors soured on the stock since Marvell forecast flat quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the third quarter. That helped lead to flat stock price growth over the last year.
Nonetheless, that is likely a cyclical move, as Marvell expects growth to resume in the fourth quarter. Also, considering that the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9 is down from a high of 20 in January, now might be an excellent time to buy Marvell at a discount before its growth resumes.
Qualcomm
Among AI stocks, one of the more surprising laggards may be Qualcomm (QCOM 0.77%). Although it remains the leading smartphone chipset company, AI has not inspired the type of upgrade cycle that other technologies have fostered in past years. Moreover, a heavy reliance on China for its revenue may have also concerned investors.
However, consumers will have to upgrade at some point, which should make Qualcomm's AI more widely available and desirable to users. Additionally, it has long prepared for the day when smartphones are less critical, and it has built chips designed for the IoT and automotive fields and has recently ventured into the PC business.
These industries have already helped boost Qualcomm's financials. In the third quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ended June 29), revenue increased by 10% year-over-year to just over $10 billion. Automotive and IoT revenues rose more than 20% during that period, a trend that bodes well for Qualcomm's future. With that, net income surged to almost $2.7 billion, 25% higher than year-ago levels.
So far, that has not helped Qualcomm's stock, which dropped by nearly 5% over the last year. Still, it has made a dramatic recovery since April, and at a P/E ratio of just 16, the stock will likely become more attractive as this growth trend continues."

Nscale, which is at the centre of Sir Keir Starmer’s plans to become an artificial intelligence hub, has secured $1.1bn from investors including Nvidia, Nokia and the Norwegian investment giant Aker.
The company was only founded in May last year and has not yet constructed a site, although it is scheduled to build a data centre in Essex with Microsoft which has been described as Britain’s largest AI supercomputer.
It is also planning to build a series of “Stargate” AI hubs with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, beginning with a data centre in Newcastle upon Tyne.
The deal makes Nscale, which spun out of an Australian cryptocurrency mining operation, one of Britain’s most valuable AI companies. Aker said it was paying $285m for a 9.3pc stake, suggesting the company is worth around $3bn.
Nscale was founded by Australian Josh Payne, 31, who previously ran Arkon Energy, a Bitcoin mining company.
It remains largely owned by Arkon, according to filings at Companies House.
Cryptocurrency mining requires high-powered IT systems. The company has converted some of its crypto mining operations in Norway to data centre infrastructure. It says it has a “seasoned leadership team that has built over 50 data centres”.
The company now plans to spend billions buying AI chips from Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, to build a global network of data centres.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said last week that he planned to invest £500m in the company, although it is unclear how much of this was in the funding round announced on Thursday.
Mr Huang last week gave Mr Payne a bottle of Johnnie Walker whisky, predicting that the company would go from revenues of “zero to $50bn”.
“I’ll go on record as to say I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to him,” Mr Huang said.
Excitement about AI has led to an explosion of funding for infrastructure, including a $100bn Nvidia investment in OpenAI this week.
However, it has raised concerns about a bubble due to the “circular” nature of deals in which companies invest in their own customers in a way that ultimately sees money flow back to the investors.
Mr Payne said on Thursday: “This [funding] allows Nscale to provide our customers access to scarce, and highly sought after, compute capacity and rapidly accelerate the build-out of secure, compliant and energy-efficient AI infrastructure.
“Europe needs a Hyperscaler, and Nscale is rising to the challenge.”
Kanishka Narayan, the technology minister, said: “The success of UK-founded companies like Nscale shows how our country can be at the cutting edge of AI."

1 The Distribution Rate shown is as of based of the NAV per share as of September 25, 2025, adjusted for corporate actions. The Distribution Rate is the annual rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution remained the same going forward. The rate represents a single distribution from the fund and does not represent total return to the fund. The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing it by the most recent NAV adjusted for corporate actions.
2 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents the net investment income (excluding option income) earned by the ETF over the 30-day period ended August 31, 2025. It is expressed as an annualized percentage rate based on the ETF’s share price at the end of that period. This metric does not reflect the total income generated by the fund, as it excludes option premium income central to the YieldBOOST strategy.
3 Each GraniteShares YieldBOOST ETF seeks to generate income by selling put options on the underlying asset. While this strategy can generate attractive premiums, it generally caps the upside potential of the ETF. If the reference asset appreciates significantly, the ETF will not fully participate in those gains. However, if the reference asset declines in value, the ETF may experience losses that are not offset by the income received. Investors may be exposed to downside risk while forgoing upside participation."

INTC - Intel Corp. (INTC, Financial) has approached Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) about a potential investment as part of efforts to revive its semiconductor business, according to people familiar with the matter.
The discussions are said to be preliminary and may not result in a transaction, according to a Thursday press release.
The chipmaker's shares surged about 6% on upon the report, reflecting investor optimism. The boost comes on the heels of recent capital infusions: Nvidia committed $5 billion, SoftBank put in $2 billion, and the U.S. government has taken a 10 % stake.
Talks between Intel and Apple reportedly also include broader collaboration beyond just investment, but neither side has confirmed specifics.
Apple ceased using Intel-designed processors several years ago, opting instead for its in-house ARM-based chips, a transition completed in 2023.
Analysts caution that converting strategic talk into a binding agreement will be challenging. Still, Apple's backing could lend fresh momentum to Intel's turnaround in a competitive semiconductor landscape."

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market
Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts.

SANTA CLARA, California - (Reuters) -The computing chips that power artificial intelligence consume a lot of electricity. On Wednesday, the world's biggest manufacturer of those chips showed off a new strategy to make them more energy efficient: Using AI-powered software to design them.
At a conference in Silicon Valley, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the contract manufacturer that fabricates chips for Nvidia, showed off a range of ways that it is hoping to boost the energy efficiency of AI computing chips by about 10 times.
Nvidia's current flagship AI servers, for example, can consume as much as 1,200 watts during demanding tasks, which would be the equivalent of the power used by 1,000 U.S. homes if run continuously.
The gains TSMC is hoping to achieve come from a new generation of chip designs in which multiple ""chiplets"" - smaller pieces of full computing chips - using different technologies are packaged together to make one computing package.
But to make use of those technologies, the firms that design chips are increasingly relying on AI-powered software from providers such as Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys, both of which rolled out new products on Wednesday that had been developed in close coordination with TSMC.
For some of the complex tasks in designing chips, the tools from TSMC's software partners found better solutions than TSMC's own human engineers - and did so much faster.
""That helps to max out TSMC technology's capability, and we find this is very useful,"" Jim Chang, deputy director at TSMC for its 3DIC Methodology Group, said during a presentation describing the findings. ""This thing runs five minutes while our designer needs to work for two days.""
The current way of manufacturing chips is hitting limits, such as the ability to move data on and off chips using electrical connections. New technologies, such as moving information between chips with optical connections, need to be made reliable enough to use in massive data centers, said Kaushik Veeraraghavan, an engineer in Meta Platforms' infrastructure group who gave a keynote address.
""Really, this is not an engineering problem,"" Veeraraghavan said. ""It's a fundamental physical problem.""

The good part is that the proliferation of AI is still in the early stages.
According to one estimate, the global AI market is likely to clock a compound annual growth rate of nearly 36% through the end of the decade. So, it won't be surprising to see this technology help more companies enter the club of companies with market caps above $1 trillion. I think cloud giant Oracle (ORCL 1.45%) will be the next company to achieve a trillion-dollar market cap.
AI has fueled a massive jump in Oracle's revenue pipeline
Oracle stock has jumped an impressive 88% in 2025 through Sept. 23 on the back of robust growth in its revenue and earnings. It now has a market cap of almost $877 billion, which means that it is just 14% away from the $1 trillion milestone. This puts Oracle in an ideal position to become the next AI-fueled trillion-dollar company, especially since it has a massive backlog that's going to help it accelerate growth.
Oracle has raised its fiscal 2026 revenue guidance to at least $67 billion, which would mark an improvement of almost 17% from the prior year. That would be double the growth rate that Oracle clocked in the previous fiscal year. However, there is a good chance of Oracle exceeding this forecast, considering the red-hot demand for the company's data centers for running AI workloads.
The company's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) business has received a massive boost as companies have been renting data center capacity from Oracle for running AI models and building custom AI applications. The fact that Oracle's data center network is present worldwide, spanning more than 50 geographic regions, is a key reason why it has been witnessing phenomenal demand.
OpenAI, for instance, will be paying Oracle a massive $300 billion over a five-year period for access to its data center capacity. Oracle ended the first quarter of fiscal 2026 with a whopping $455 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPO), with the figure jumping by 359% from the year-ago quarter.
Oracle CEO Safra Catz said in a company press release that the company expects over the next few months to ""sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers and RPO is likely to exceed half-a-trillion dollars."" All this puts Oracle in a terrific position to increase its revenue estimates. Oracle's massive RPO -- the total value of unfulfilled contracts at the end of a quarter -- also explains why it is expecting OCI revenue to increase 77% in fiscal 2026 to $18 billion, followed by a similar increase the following year to $32 billion.
The growth rate is expected to accelerate in fiscal 2028, with OCI revenue expected to more than double to $73 billion, driven by the addition of more cloud computing capacity. This outstanding growth in the company's OCI business is going to play a central role in helping Oracle achieve a trillion-dollar market cap.
The trillion-dollar milestone could arrive within the next year
Oracle has a median 12-month price target of $350, among 43 analysts covering the stock that CNN is tracking. That points toward a potential jump of 13% from current levels, which should be nearly enough to send this cloud computing giant into the trillion-dollar club.
However, investors can expect stronger gains from the company. The stock is currently trading at 15 times sales. Though that's expensive when stacked up against the U.S. technology sector's average sales multiple, the higher valuation is justified considering its improving growth profile. If Oracle can sustain this sales multiple at the end of the fiscal year and ends up with $70 billion in revenue thanks to its huge backlog, it could achieve a $1 trillion market cap.
So, investors looking for the next trillion-dollar company should consider adding Oracle to their portfolios, and the company's ability to notch faster growth in the coming years could help it become much bigger in the long run."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped 0.4%, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also around 0.5%. Big Tech stocks took hits, with Oracle (ORCL) adding to recent losses and Tesla (TSLA) off over 4%.
Markets are putting the brakes on stocks' recent record-breaking rally amid debate over whether AI fervor is stretching valuations too much.
At the same time, the uplift from the Federal Reserve's switch to lowering rates is fading, as signs of division among policymakers dent hopes for another two cuts this year.
In a positive sign for the labor market, jobless claims data released Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment dropped to 218,000 for the week ending Sept. 20 from 232,000 previously. Continuing claims also fell slightly to 1.92 million.
Meanwhile, US second quarter GDP rose to an annualized pace of 3.8%, rebounding from a 0.6% decline in Q1 and well above estimates for a 3.3% rate of growth.
That sets the stage for Friday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The PCE print for August is expected to show an easing in price pressures, which could make a case for a shift in rate policy.
In corporates, Costco (COST) is expected to report its quarterly results after the bell on Thursday. Investors expect to see a jump in sales as shoppers pursue deals amid economic uncertainty.

Intel jumps nearly 10% as chipmaker seeks Apple investment
Intel (INTC) stock was up 10% on Thursday afternoon as investors cheered the chipmaker's attempt to seek investments from iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) in order to work closer together, though Wall Street is wary of such a collaboration.
Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said it's unlikely a tie-up (beyond an investment) would materialize anytime soon.
Rasgon said it's ""unlikely"" Apple would collaborate with Intel to co-design a chip for its computers or shift to producing its in-house chips in Intel's factories rather than TSMC's, writing ""a foundry agreement with Intel seems very premature.""
Intel passed on an offer to make chips for Apple's first iPhones in the early 2000s.
Apple moved ahead with its own Arm-based (ARM) chips for personal computers that are manufactured by Intel's contract manufacturing rival, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM).

Tesla stock drops after Europe sales collapse in August
Tesla stock (TSLA) fell 3% after the company's EV sales declined in Europe for the eighth straight month.
Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports that, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell to just 14,831 units in August, a 22.5% drop compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region rose 26.8% in August.
Sales fell sharply in Sweden and Denmark, whereas Norway offered a lone bright spot, with sales up nearly 22%.
Tesla's pains in Europe have grown as stiff competition from Chinese EV makers and the unpopularity of CEO Elon Musk have hurt the brand. A new survey from research firm Escalent found that car buyers in Europe were more likely to consider purchasing a vehicle from China than from the US, with the US's tariffs and trade policies playing a role.
Despite a rough 2025, shares remain positive year to date, though Tesla's 6% gain since the beginning of the year trails the S&P 500's 12% return so far.

Intel needs 'capability' more than money: Analyst
Intel (INTC) is reportedly in talks with Apple (AAPL) to have the iPhone maker invest in the company and for the two companies to work more closely together. But Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said it's unlikely a collaboration (beyond an investment) would materialize anytime soon.
He noted that Apple moved from Intel's chips years ago to make its own Arm-based (ARM) chips for personal computers (PCs) that are manufactured by Intel's contract manufacturing rival, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM).
Intel also famously passed on an offer to make chips for Apple's first iPhones in the early 2000s.
Rasgon said it's ""unlikely"" Apple would collaborate with Intel to co-design a chip for PCs or shift to producing its in-house PC chips in Intel's factories rather than TSMC's, writing ""a foundry agreement with Intel seems very premature.""
Intel designs computing chips and leads the market for CPUs (central processing units) for data centers and PCs, but its market share has eroded in recent years as AMD (AMD) and Arm have gained ground.
Intel has always produced chips for itself, but its internal manufacturing business began to fall behind technologically over the past decade. In 2021, the company opened that business to outside customers, launching Intel Foundry Services, in a bid to breathe new life into its factories.
That hasn't worked so far: Intel Foundry Services' losses ballooned to $13 billion in its 2024 fiscal year from $7 billion in 2023, and those losses helped send Intel's stock plunging 60% last year.
Last week, Nvidia (NVDA) announced it would take a $5 billion stake in Intel, following the US government's $9 billion investment in the struggling company in August.
""Hence what Intel really needs is CAPABILITY, which would allow them to attract customers that would allow them to fill the capacity that the money might help them build,"" Rasgon wrote. ""But their capability issue have nothing to do with money; they will have to figure that out on their own.

Oracle extends losses as Redburn analyst initiates coverage with Sell rating
Oracle (ORCL) shares fell more than 4% Thursday as Alex Haissl, an analyst with investing firm Rothschild & Co Redburn, initiated coverage of the stock with a Sell rating.
Haissl said Oracle’s recent five-year revenue guidance for its cloud business (OCI) that sent the stock soaring is a risk, writing that ""the market is already pricing in a risky blue-sky scenario that is unlikely to materialise,” per Bloomberg. He set a $175 price target on the stock, while shares traded around $297 on Thursday.
The decline in Oracle shares follows a nearly 2% dip from the previous trading session as the software giant sold $18 billion US investment-grade bonds.
Oracle's bond sale came as the rising AI cloud firm rushes to build AI infrastructure for its clients, which range from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and Meta (META) to Elon Musk's xAI (XAAI.PVT). As of this summer, Oracle was leading a record data center leasing pipeline in the US as tech giants go all in on AI infrastructure, according to TD Cowen analysts.
Earlier this week, Oracle was named as an investor to take part in the US-China TikTok deal, and the company also named two new co-CEOs in an executive leadership shake-up.

US jobless claims unexpectedly dip
Jobless claims in the US unexpectedly fell to 218,000 in the week that ended Sept. 20 from 232,000 the previous week, according to data from the Department of Labor released Thursday morning.
The 218,000 initial unemployment insurance claims were also lower than the 221,000 claims in the same week last year.
Economists tracked by Bloomberg had expected jobless claims to rise to 233,000 last week amid widening cracks in the labor market. Those cracks have featured heavily in discussions over the Fed's path to interest rate easing, as officials on the central bank's board of governors have expressed dissenting opinions over such rate cuts moving forward.

- Intel is seeking an investment from Apple after recently securing a $5 billion commitment from Nvidia, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.
- Apple was once a big customer for Intel, though the iPhone maker has migrated away in favor of using its own processors in its devices in recent years.
Intel has reportedly set its sights on a deal with Apple, a move that could further boost the struggling chipmaker.
Shares of Intel (INTC) surged over 6% Wednesday following a Bloomberg report that it's solicited support from the iPhone maker. Neither company responded to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. Shares of Apple fell less than 1%.
Why This Matters for Intel Investors
Wall Street analysts broadly believe Intel likely needs more funds and foundry commitments from customers to succeed with its turnaround plan. Investments from Nvidia and the U.S. government have helped that process along, and one from Apple would mark another step. The stock has clambered higher this year, but it's well off past highs, a reminder that there's plenty of work yet to do.
With Wednesday's gains, Intel's stock has added a quarter of its value in the week since Intel announced a $5 billion investment from and chip-development partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). The raft of events have excited investors, with the Nvidia news seen as a vote of confidence from the world's most valuable company.
Still, the stock remains well off its highs, with most Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha sticking by ""hold"" ratings while waiting for evidence of more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other firms and which is central to maintaining support from the U.S. government—itself now a major shareholder.
A deal with Apple could help Intel's case, particularly if it came with foundry commitments. Nvidia's did not, raising speculation about whether a foundry deal could come later or whether the lack of one underscored Intel's challenges in convincing customers.
""If Intel can prove they can deliver they will have customers lined up around the block,"" Bernstein analysts wrote last week. ""If they can’t, no customer in their right mind will put any meaningful volume there.""
New partners might also see a deal with Intel as a way to gain political goodwill, Bernstein said. That may hold some appeal to former Intel customer Apple, which has shown some signs of inroads with the Trump administration, last month winning pledges of tariff exemptions based on its recent investments in U.S. manufacturing."

Shares of Intel gained as much as 7.9% in New York trading on Thursday. They had jumped 6.4% the previous day after Bloomberg News first reported on the discussions. Apple rose less than 1% to $253.71 on Thursday.
Such a deal would follow a $5 billion investment last week by Nvidia Corp., which plans to work with Intel on chips for personal computers and data centers. SoftBank Group Corp., the Japanese tech giant seeking to expand further in the US, announced a $2 billion investment in Intel last month.
Intel also has reached out to other companies about possible investments and partnerships, the people said.
A deal with Apple, a longtime Intel customer that switched to in-house processors in the past five years, would represent further validation of the chipmaker’s turnaround bid. Still, it’s unlikely that Apple would switch back to Intel processors in its devices. The iPhone maker’s most sophisticated chips are now produced by partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
A representative for Intel declined to comment. An Apple spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan is attempting a comeback with the backing of the federal government. In an unconventional deal brokered by the Trump administration in August, the US acquired a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker. Intel is seen as a critical piece of efforts to reinvigorate domestic production — a priority for the White House.
Even with financial support, Intel’s challenges remain daunting. The Santa Clara, California-based company has lost its long-held technological edge and ceded market share to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Moreover, Intel has struggled to capitalize on booming sales of artificial intelligence gear — a specialty of Nvidia."

Shares of technology real estate company Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) jumped 17.4% in the afternoon session after the release of a New Residential Sales report that signaled a stronger demand environment for housing.
The report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development revealed a significant uptick, with sales of new single-family homes in August rising 20.5% from the previous month and 15.4% compared to the same month last year. For Opendoor, this data suggested that higher sales volumes could lead to increased revenues. Additionally, the median sales price for new houses climbed to $413,500, an increase that translated to potentially higher margins on its sales and an increase in the value of its property portfolio.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down and closed the day at $8.21, up 15.9% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Opendoor’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 94 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Opendoor and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock dropped 5% on the news that a major shareholder sold a large block of shares and a prominent hedge fund manager publicly criticized its business model.
The stock's decline extended a slide from the previous trading session after a filing revealed that top holder Access Industries sold about 11.4 million shares for $95.2 million. This move followed a similar large sale by the same firm earlier in the month, shaking investor confidence.
Adding to the pressure, hedge fund manager George Noble attacked Opendoor's business model on X, calling the online real estate firm “total garbage.” Noble noted that the company had lost money every single year since it was founded and suffered from “atrocious” unit economics and a “lousy balance sheet.”
Opendoor is up 454% since the beginning of the year, but at $8.82 per share, it is still trading 16.2% below its 52-week high of $10.52 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Opendoor’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $554.44.

On September 23, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis raised the price target on the stock to $225.00 (from $214.00) while maintaining an Outperform rating. The rating affirmation follows the company’s deal with OpenAI.
The two companies are collaborating to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA systems for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure. Nvidia intends on investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed.
After speaking with Nvidia’s CFO, the firm has come out confident on the stock, stating that the company remains the AI ecosystem play of choice and that Street estimates are too low.
The firm also reiterated Nvidia as its Top Pick. Analysts believe that Wall Street is underestimating demand, and that NVidia is uniquely positioned to handle the scale that OpenAI needs for its infrastructure buildout.
“Post our callback with NVDA’s CFO regarding the OpenAI deal, we came away with further confidence that NVDA remains the AI ecosystem play of choice and that Street estimates are too low – Reiterate NVDA as a top pick. Key takes from the callback: NVDA is the preferred supplier to OpenAI, as OpenAI has underestimated demand for its solution and wants to get ahead of demand going forward, and NVDA is uniquely positioned as the scale solution provider that could help OpenAI with this infrastructure buildout. The deal is for at least 10GW of AI infrastructure, and mgmt. confirmed that historically, NVDA’s TAM was $30bn-$40bn per GW, although going forward it could be higher. The deal would include GPUs, racks, networking and software. The OpenAI deal is additive to what NVDA was expecting before We Estimate $5.5bn in Additional Revs for NVDA in 2HCY26. The company would not give details about the pace and duration of the ramp. We increase our 2H26 revenue estimate by $5.5bn, using Colossus, Prometheus and Project Rainier as benchmarks”
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.

Intel shares climbed by 6.4% to close at $31.22 on Wednesday following the report from Bloomberg News.
Citing people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the talks are private, Bloomberg reported that the companies have also discussed closer collaboration.
If completed, an investment by the iPhone maker would follow recent capital injections from other tech giants into Intel. Nvidia announced last week that it would invest $5 billion in Intel, with plans to collaborate on chips for personal computers and data centers.
Intel has reportedly contacted other companies about possible investments and partnerships as well.
A deal with Apple would provide further support for Intel’s turnaround efforts, which have even included the White House engineering an agreement for the U.S. government to take a 10% stake in the business.
However, reports suggested that Apple is unlikely to return to using Intel processors in its devices after switching to in-house chips over the past five years. Apple’s most advanced chips are currently manufactured by Intel rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
""Is [the Apple investment in Intel] plausible? Sure, why not,"" analysts at Bernstein said in a note on Thursday.
""At this point the company has secured close to $16 billion from prior (albeit dilutive) cash injections in recent weeks, and the idea that the company continues to seek further investors as a vote of confidence as well as the possibility that the [Trump] Administration is encouraging such has been widely speculated among investors.""

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-24T20:05:50,Why Tesla (TSLA) Stock Is Trading Up Today,Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 3.9% in the afternoon session after it received a wave of positive commentary from Wall Street analysts and upbeat forecasts for third-quarter vehicle deliveries.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=41362579bcd362bd71b5b523080936028e7c7e73a1db49bb1103bbcda970bb3c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-stock-trading-200550001.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-stock-trading-200550001.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-stock-trading-200550001.html,yahoo.com,200,,"What Happened?
Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 3.9% in the afternoon session after it received a wave of positive commentary from Wall Street analysts and upbeat forecasts for third-quarter vehicle deliveries.
Wolfe Research stated that the electric vehicle maker's Q3 deliveries could reach between 465,000 and 470,000 units, topping consensus estimates of 445,000. The firm partly attributed the potential lift in volume to consumers speeding up purchases before a $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired.
Adding to the positive sentiment, Piper Sandler's Alexander Potter raised his price target to $500 from $400, highlighting Tesla's strength in artificial intelligence. Similarly, Baird analyst Ben Kallo upgraded the stock to a “Buy.” One prominent analyst, Dan Ives, forecasted that the company's march to a $2 trillion valuation had begun, driven by opportunities in AI and autonomous Robotaxis.
The shares closed the day at $442.77, up 4% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 46 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock gained 3.7% after the company received approval to begin testing its autonomous robotaxis in Arizona and Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock.
This approval marked the third state, after Texas and Nevada, where the electric vehicle maker could test its self-driving cars. The move fueled investor optimism about the company's long-term growth in autonomous driving.
Adding to the positive sentiment, Piper Sandler lifted its price target on Tesla to $500 from $400, citing increased confidence in the company's autonomous vehicle and robotics positioning. The brokerage noted the new target reflected a higher valuation multiple. This news resonated with bullish analysts like Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, who previously stated that the robotaxi business could add as much as $1 trillion to Tesla's market cap.
Tesla is up 16.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $442.55 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,424.
Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

The iPhone maker and Intel have also discussed how to work more closely together, the report said, adding that the talks are at an early stage and may not lead to an agreement. Shares of Intel closed 6% higher after the news.
Intel declined to comment, while Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The report comes days after Nvidia announced it would invest $5 billion in Intel for a roughly 4% stake in the company.
Nvidia's pact with Intel includes a plan for the two companies to jointly develop PC and data center chips, but crucially, will not involve Intel's contract manufacturing business - or foundry - making computing chips for Nvidia.
Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been trying to bring in partners as part of a turnaround at the ailing chipmaker.
Once the chip industry's flag bearer that claimed to put the ""silicon"" in Silicon Valley, Intel has struggled to compete in the booming AI race, falling behind peers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.
The investment from Nvidia came just weeks after the White House engineered an extraordinary deal for the federal government to take a 10% stake in Intel, an agreement that would ensure the company receives about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the U.S.
Intel also received another $2 billion equity investment from SoftBank Group last month.
The cash infusions in Intel have pushed up investor sentiment, with the stock climbing more than 40% since mid-August.
The reported investment from Apple would come as another vote of confidence for Intel. Apple had been a longtime customer of Intel before it transitioned to using its own custom-designed silicon chips from 2020.
For Apple, which relies heavily on Intel's rival TSMC to manufacture its chips, the new partnership would allow it to diversify its chipmaking supplier base - a move that could be valuable if geopolitical risks in Taiwan worsen due to China's role in the region.
The potential investment in the United States would also help strengthen Apple's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. While much of Apple's supply chain remains international, the company has committed about $600 billion to domestic initiatives over the next four years.
In response to a Reuters query on whether the Trump administration had conversations with Intel or Apple about an investment, and if it would support such a deal, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, ""The U.S. Government is not involved in Intel's day-to-day operations."""

US-listed American Depository Shares (ADRs) jumped 8% after CEO Eddie Wu said during a conference in China that a worldwide investment in artificial intelligence is estimated to reach $4 trillion over the next five years, and Alibaba must keep pace.
Wu said the company will expand on its February plan to devote over $53 billion toward building AI models and infrastructure over three years, though he did not specify how much higher the investment would go.
The company also unveiled Qwen3-Omni, an open-source model that can handle text, images, audio, and video as it pushes into generative AI.
Alibaba also announced a software deal with Nvidia (NVDA) to integrate the chip giant's AI development tools used for training for robotics and self-driving cars. The financials of the deal were not released.
The agreement marks a collaboration between the two companies at a time when US-Beijing trade relations remain fragile.
Alibaba and other Chinese tech companies have been working on developing AI chips to fill the void left by regulatory challenges concerning Nvidia's role in China as Beijing has made moves to wean itself off of its reliance on US chips.
During his talk at the conference in Hangzhou, China, Wu underscored the company's cloud ambition to establish itself as a top ""full-stack"" artificial intelligence provider, which includes its AI chip technology.
Alibaba's cloud unit, which services clients abroad including the US and Australia, will expand data center openings into Brazil, France, and the Netherlands.
The company's lean into AI comes as Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are set to invest a cumulative $364 billion in the technology in their respective 2025 fiscal years, up from their prior estimates of around $325 billion.
While Alibaba is often compared to Amazon for its outsized e-commerce business, its cloud computing business has been rapidly growing, helping send the stock up more than 110% year to date.
Cloud revenue grew 26% year over year during its April to June quarter, with Wu saying AI and cloud are Alibaba's engines of growth alongside e-commerce.
Ark Invest's Cathie Wood bought more than $16 billion in Alibaba stock for the first time since 2021 on Monday, with about half going into the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARK-F) and the other half into ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARK-W)."

Companies such as Nvidia are providing the most powerful AI hardware. Companies such as Comfort Systems USA are also benefiting as they help build out data centers, which are necessary for AI. And AI has high electricity demand, giving power companies such as Vistra a nice tailwind as well.
Nvidia, Comfort Systems USA, and Vistra are all up 1,000% or more over the last five years, showing the AI trend is real and benefiting many businesses in multiple industries. But there's a little-known monster company that has nothing to do with AI and yet it's outperforming them all.
If you invested $10,000 in Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW -1.04%) stock five years ago, you'd have $225,000 now -- roughly $90,000 more than a $10,000 investment in Nvidia over the same time period. Indeed, the small toy company has provided investors with a return of 2,150%. It's a story you've got to see to believe.
An incredible comeback story
To be fair, setting the clock at five years ago may be cherry-picking a little. Build-A-Bear stock had dropped sharply in the early days of the pandemic. So five years ago is an apt time to start the clock. That said, the company's profitable growth has been spectacular.
As of Feb. 1, 2020, Build-A-Bear had generated $339 million in total trailing-12-month revenue. By Feb. 1, 2025, that had jumped about 47% to $496 million in trailing-12-month revenue. That represents a roughly 8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
Build-A-Bear Workshop has more than 600 stores, some of which are owned by the company and others that are franchised. Customers come in and have an entire experience. They pick out a plush toy and ""customize"" it by controlling how much fluff goes on the inside.
Build-A-Bear seems to be enjoying an uptick in demand for a few simple reasons. For starters, the company was founded in 1997. Youngsters back then are parents now and are taking their kids in for the nostalgic experience that they had. The company has also done a good job of leaning into trends by licensing popular characters from modern TV shows for kids. And it hasn't shied away from using e-commerce to its advantage, as well.
Revenues are steadily increasing for Build-A-Bear. But its profitability and use of cash have been equally impressive. Its current operating margin of 14% is at an all-time high. And its earnings per share (EPS) are also at an all-time high, in part thanks to its share count being at an all-time low.
To summarize, demand is strong for Build-A-Bear, lifting profit margins. The company is debt-free with relatively low capital requirements. Therefore, management gives back to shareholders with stock buybacks. And it's even paid some special dividends in recent years to go along with its quarterly dividend.
Can the formula keep working for this cheap stock?
Build-A-Bear stock currently trades for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16. Granted, it's been cheaper in the past -- much cheaper. But a P/E of 16 is still a discount to the overall stock market and means there's minimal valuation risk here.
Since Build-A-Bear stock is still relatively cheap, can the business keep delivering on the simple formula that's made it such a monster stock in recent years? (As a reminder, the formula is consistent growth, strong profits, and generous returns to shareholders.) I believe it can.
There are two factors that can keep growth going for Build-A-Bear. First, consumer traffic is still positive even in a strained U.S. economy. In the second quarter of 2025, store traffic was up 3%. And the company's evolution into more of a collectible business fueled impressive Q2 e-commerce growth of 15%. Second, Build-A-Bear is opening a lot of new locations in international markets.
This growth can keep margins strong for Build-A-Bear. Higher store traffic at company-owned stores is good for profitability. And its growth overseas is via franchised and licensed locations, which is higher-margin revenue. So its profit margins may be at all-time highs, but it appears sustainable.
Assuming it's sustainable, I expect Build-A-Bear to continue with paying dividends and doing stock buybacks. After all, there's not much need when it comes to investing its cash elsewhere in the business.
To be clear, I don't expect greater than 2,000% stock returns for Build-A-Bear stock over the next five years. But based on everything going right for the business right now as well as its still-cheap stock price, I wouldn't be surprised if it outperformed the market average again over the next five years."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-21T18:12:00,Big Tech's $4 Trillion Artificial Intelligence (AI) Spending Spree Could Make These 2 Chip Stocks Huge Winners,These companies supply chips to the biggest players in AI.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=5844614f199da5acdb82a283d76156ce3a33bb630e2e42954b27a191faccc734,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/big-techs-4-trillion-ai-chip-stocks-winners/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/big-techs-4-trillion-ai-chip-stocks-winners/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/big-techs-4-trillion-ai-chip-stocks-winners/,fool.com,200,,"Leading tech companies are spending billions on data centers to support growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) compute capacity. AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) recently said it expects spending on AI infrastructure to reach between $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.
This estimate suggests the current bull market for tech stocks could extend for several more years. If your portfolio is light on AI exposure, here are two chip stocks to consider buying right now.
1. Nvidia
For investors looking for the best chip stock to benefit from this opportunity, Nvidia still has to be considered the top choice. It's the most valuable company in the world for a reason. It continues to grow at impressive rates, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) remain the benchmark for AI workloads.
Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips are experiencing robust demand. In the most recent quarter, management said the Blackwell platform grew 17% sequentially over the previous quarter. Strong demand contributed to the company's total revenue increase of 56% over the year-ago quarter.
Nvidia's largest customers are the big tech giants, including Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Google Cloud. These companies have tens of billions of dollars they can afford to spend on AI infrastructure, which benefits Nvidia. Google alone plans to spend $85 billion this year on data centers and technology to support its growth.
Nvidia's advantage can be seen in how leading cloud service providers are transitioning to Nvidia's new Blackwell GB300. Management described it as a ""seamless"" upgrade over the shared architecture, software, and physical footprint of the GB200. The GB300 is a liquid-cooled rack that houses 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 Arm-based Nvidia Grace central processing units (CPUs).
Large data centers install thousands of these racks to run AI training and inference workloads, and Nvidia's shareholders are cashing in. ""The scale and scope of these build-outs present significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia,"" CFO Colette Kress said on the fiscal Q2 earnings call.
Nvidia is one of the most profitable companies in the world, with $86 billion in trailing-12-month net income. The high margins Nvidia earns on its data center business should translate to significant earnings growth and return potential for investors as spending on AI infrastructure increases.
2. Broadcom
For a second chip stock that complements Nvidia, investors could consider Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%). It supplies networking, software, and specialized chips for a range of markets, including smartphones, industrial applications, and data centers.
The demand for high-performance computing in data centers is driving significant growth for the company. Broadcom's custom AI accelerators are in high demand due to their power efficiency and performance relative to Nvidia's costlier, and more power-hungry GPUs.
Both Nvidia and Broadcom can thrive because the AI opportunity is that big. There are simply not enough chips to go around. Companies have literally begged Nvidia for more GPUs, and when they can't get them, they consider alternatives. Broadcom just recently announced a $10 billion deal to build custom AI chips for an undisclosed customer, but analysts believe that customer is ChatGPT's OpenAI.
Broadcom stock is surging, up 55% year to date, and for good reason. Business is booming. AI-related revenue grew 63% year over year to $5.2 billion, or about a third of its total business, and management expects AI chip revenue to accelerate next quarter.
Meanwhile, Broadcom's networking products, such as high-performance Ethernet switches, are also in high demand, since AI workloads require massive data throughput and transfer speeds. Broadcom also has a high-margin infrastructure software business that is used to monitor and secure data center operations.
The company has a long history of delivering profitable growth that rewards shareholders, and it's certainly delivering for investors as the AI boom heats up. Revenue is expected to increase 22% this year, before accelerating to 32% next year. Investors should expect the stock to outperform the market over the next five years."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-21T18:07:00,4 Ways TSMC Makes Its Money,The company is making money hand over fist.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=60a78ae1374373275d76a5b49b1092dcb6fbef051086ec8c6ec14891053be23c,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/4-ways-tsmc-makes-its-money/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/4-ways-tsmc-makes-its-money/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/4-ways-tsmc-makes-its-money/,fool.com,200,,"Semiconductor stocks and artificial intelligence (AI) are ruling the stock market this year. While the benchmark S&P 500 is up 12% so far in 2025, major semiconductor exchange-traded funds are by far outperforming the market.
And while companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom are having solid years, they need a company to actually fabricate the semiconductors that they're designing. That's where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%) comes into play, and why it's one of the most consequential stocks on Wall Street right now.
About TSMC
Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, is the world's largest independent semiconductor foundry. It makes advanced semiconductor chips for multiple companies, including Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, AMD, and others. The company says it used 288 different process technologies to produce nearly 12,000 products in 2024, proving its broad capabilities to literally any type of client.
According to research by The Motley Fool, 60% of the company's revenue comes from manufacturing its specialized 3 nanometer (nm) and 5nm chips. The transistor sizes are important -- a nanometer is 1 billionth of a meter, so the more transistors TSMC can squeeze into a semiconductor chip, the faster it can work.
Back in the second quarter of 2022 -- which is not that long ago -- TSMC earned 30% of its revenue from 7nm chips. But now it gets a full 36% of its revenue from 5nm chips and 24% from 3nm chips, according to The Motley Fool's research.
TSMC is one of four companies that make 3nm chips at scale, in addition to Samsung, Intel, and Xiaomi. TSMC and Samsung already have plans to mass-produce the 2nm process in 2025.
To say the chips are in high demand is an understatement. TSMC announced that its revenues in August were $11.13 billion, up 33% from a year ago and up nearly 4% on a sequential monthly basis.
The company is investing $165 billion into building new production facilities in Arizona to fabricate semiconductors domestically, which will help it get around any trade issues between Beijing and Washington.
Other ways that TSMC makes money
While the high-powered 5nm and 3nm chips make up the lion's share of TSMC's revenue, it also has other sources:
Smartphones (27%): TSMC's semiconductors helped make 5G smartphones function. 5G was one of the biggest developments of the smartphone industry in this decade, allowing customers to access the internet with connections as speedy as a broadband connection. 5G's higher data speeds allow for high-resolution video, real-time gaming, and quick downloading speed.
While the percentage of TSMC's revenue stream involving smartphones fell from 33% to 27% in the last year, this is still a critical space for TSMC. Apple highlighted the company's partnership with the fabricator in August when it announced a $600 billion commitment to manufacturing in the U.S.
Internet of Things (5%): TSMC's revenue from Internet of Things devices fell from 6% to 5% in the last year. This involves a variety of products including smart home devices, smart city devices, and wearable technology. Examples include smartwatches, industrial sensors, medical monitors, lighting, speakers, and robotic vacuums that don't need high-powered 3nm or 5nm chips to function.
Automotive customers (5%): This includes companies like Tesla, which are working to make autonomous driving a reality. This also involves creating chips for electric vehicles, driver assistance systems, and in-car infotainment systems.
The bottom line
TSMC is continuing to advance its technology to create smaller transistors in order to fabricate more powerful chips, and as long as it continues down this path, it will remain the world's top and most significant chip fabricator. That gives it an essential position in today's AI-driven stock market, making Taiwan Semiconductor stock for investors to consider."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-21T14:45:00,Is Having a Position in the Entire Stock Market a Better Option Than Investing in the S&P 500?,"The S&P 500 continues to hit new records, and tracking it may no longer be the safest option for risk-averse investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=41a91a3aa37bdc22bb49af48135d107e20ecc063012a6e7387b7639e68f676b6,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/is-having-a-position-in-the-entire-stock-market-a/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/is-having-a-position-in-the-entire-stock-market-a/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/is-having-a-position-in-the-entire-stock-market-a/,fool.com,200,,"The S&P 500 has traditionally been a sound way for investors to grow their wealth, but there's no denying that its valuation has become bloated. It recently topped 6,600 as of the end of Monday's close, marking its latest record. The growth has been strong, even despite economic uncertainty this year.
But a lot depends on how well the growth prospects for artificial intelligence (AI) continue to be, as companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and other tech giants make up sizable positions in the S&P 500 and have been thriving due to enhanced opportunities as a result of AI. For some investors, that can make investing in the S&P 500 a less-than-ideal situation given this heavy exposure.
An alternative option may be trying to track not simply the S&P 500 but the broader stock market as a whole, giving investors a more diversified investment. The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI 0.42%) attempts to accomplish this. Could it be a better investment moving forward than simply mirroring the S&P 500 through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 0.44%)?
Historically, the returns haven't been all that different
Over the past five years, when including reinvested dividends, the total returns of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF have been 109% (as of Sept. 15). By comparison, investing in the Vanguard fund has yielded a total return of 103%. To put that in terms of dollars, a $10,000 investment would have grown to approximately $20,900 by tracking the S&P 500 and to $20,300 if you'd invested in the Vanguard fund.
In theory, it shouldn't be a surprising conclusion given that the S&P 500, which tracks the leading 500 companies on U.S. markets, will be a good indicator of how the overall market is doing. If the index is performing well, other stocks are likely to follow. But by investing in the best stocks, it's likely to do better amid favorable market conditions.
However, what if that isn't the case, and you're worried about high-priced stocks that could weigh on the S&P 500 and limit its returns in the near future?
Is tracking the S&P 500 still the better option if you're bracing for a slowdown in the market?
The last prolonged crash in the market took place back in 2022. At the time, inflation was getting out of control and companies that had scaled too aggressively due to strong pandemic-fueled demand realized they needed to cut back, and job cuts followed. That year, the S&P 500 tanked and the SPDR ETF's total returns were -18.2%. But the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund didn't fare any better. In fact, its total returns were -19.5%.
The Vanguard fund has a position in more than 3,500 stocks, which is far more than the 500 that the SPDR ETF tracks. But due to the significant market caps of leading tech companies, they are still going to be the driving force in how both ETFs perform. The top three stocks in the Total Stock Market ETF are Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. Together, they combine for 18.1% of its entire portfolio. By comparison, those three stocks, which are also the largest holding in the SPDR ETF, combine for 20.8% of its portfolio.
While there is a bit less exposure to those stocks in the Vanguard fund, it's not a drastic difference. The Total Stock Market fund has a position in a lot of stocks, but the vast majority are incredibly small. After the first 200 stocks, you're looking at stocks that account for less than 0.1% of its entire portfolio. And the 500th largest position in the ETF accounts for just 0.02%.
While it may be tempting to assume that with an ETF that tracks the entire stock market you're going to get a safer and more diversified investment than the S&P 500, that's not necessarily the case.
How can investors reduce their risk in the market?
The S&P 500 index is a gauge for how the overall market is doing, and thus, trying to simply track more stocks such as through the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF may not be a better option, or even a safer one.
If your goal is to minimize your exposure to tech stocks and have a safer mix of stocks than what the SPDR S&P 500 ETF offers, you may want to consider ETFs with specific goals in mind. The Vanguard Value Index Fund focuses on value stocks, and the Invesco S&P 500 Revenue ETF tracks the S&P 500 but weighs the stocks based on revenue rather than market capitalization. These are just a couple of examples of the ways you can potentially reduce your portfolio's risk if you're concerned about high valuations."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-21T14:10:00,The Intel-Nvidia Deal Looks Like Terrible News for AMD,AMD's market share gains could come under pressure.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6704d916cc14ef06ce5e928a1116b574e5eb56c176b1df4ee76c87e2f6585b87,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-intel-nvidia-deal-looks-like-terrible-news-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-intel-nvidia-deal-looks-like-terrible-news-for/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-intel-nvidia-deal-looks-like-terrible-news-for/,fool.com,200,,"On Thursday, Intel (INTC 4.24%) and Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) announced a shocking deal that will pair the two companies' technologies in PC and data center central processing units (CPUs). This news looks problematic for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%). AMD has made an extraordinary comeback over the past decade in both markets, with a unit market share across PCs and servers of around 24% in the second quarter, up from 11% in 2016. Those gains could come under pressure once the Intel-Nvidia partnership bears fruit.
In the PC market, Intel and Nvidia will develop systems-on-a-chip (SOCs) that integrate Intel's CPU cores with an Nvidia RTX graphics processing unit (GPU) chiplet. In the data center market, custom Intel CPUs with Nvidia's NVLink technology will be used directly by Nvidia, and the GPU giant will also offer the chips to third-party customers. NVLink is Nvidia's proprietary high-speed connection technology that's a more performant alternative to the standard PCI Express interface.
In the PC market, in particular, AMD will have a fight on its hands as it looks to preserve its market share.
AI PCs have been slow to take off
The PC CPUs that come out of this deal are targeting ""a wide range of PCs that demand integration of world-class CPUs and GPUs,"" according to Intel's press release. Gaming laptops and gaming handhelds would be the natural form factors for the new CPUs, given the gaming performance that Nvidia's GPU technology will enable. But Nvidia's GPUs will also provide hefty artificial intelligence (AI) computing horsepower.
As a category, AI PCs aren't particularly impressive right now. PCs running Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm CPUs with enough AI computing capacity to run some AI workloads locally get lumped into this category, but they're just not capable enough for AI to be a strong selling point. Microsoft's Copilot+ initiative, which puts that label on certain AI PCs, was a disappointment when it debuted last year. The AI features included brought little to the table, and anything useful still required calling out to a cloud service.
For AI PCs to truly take off, they need to be powerful enough to run capable AI models locally that can perform useful tasks for the user. Once a PC can handle running a competent AI writing assistant or a useful AI coding assistant, the appeal of the AI PC expands dramatically.
A potential AI powerhouse
The CPUs that will emerge from the Intel-Nvidia deal appear to be squarely aimed at the AI PC opportunity. Nvidia's GPU technology has become the industry standard for AI computing, and the GPU chiplet included in these new CPUs could provide enough AI computing capacity to handle more complex AI workloads.
Some of AMD's Ryzen PC CPUs include both a neural processing unit and a GPU to accelerate AI workloads. The high-end Ryzen AI Max+ 395, for example, offers overall AI performance of 126 TOPs, or trillions of operations per second. That's nothing compared to dedicated GPUs, and it's certainly not enough to run truly capable AI models. Nvidia's midrange RTX 5060 laptop GPU, for example, offers 440 TOPS, while its high-end RTX 5090 laptop GPU clocks in at 1,824 TOPS.
We don't know exactly what the Intel-Nvidia CPUs will look like, but they could push the envelope when it comes to AI computing capacity, thanks to Nvidia's GPUs. By putting an Nvidia GPU on the same chip as the CPU, rather than pairing the CPU with a discrete GPU, latency can be reduced, power efficiency can be improved, and costs can be brought down.
AMD makes competitive products, but the PC CPU market is a whole new ball game when Intel CPUs integrated with Nvidia GPUs start shipping. AMD's presence in gaming laptops and gaming handhelds will likely come under pressure, and the larger battle for AI PC market will be much tougher with Intel and Nvidia teaming up."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-21T13:30:00,The Motley Fool Has 3 Key Insights for Investors on TSMC's Revenue,TSMC has been a big winner in recent years. Here's what's behind its gains.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f574570fadc0a1a018350b73871a44a765101e9ef71001b581d3cedecc59a3db,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-motley-fool-has-3-key-insights-for-investors/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-motley-fool-has-3-key-insights-for-investors/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/the-motley-fool-has-3-key-insights-for-investors/,fool.com,200,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%) might not get as much attention as Nvidia or Palantir Technologies, but TSMC, as the chip-manufacturing giant is also known, continues to look like a big winner in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.
Since the beginning of 2023, roughly when ChatGPT was launched, the stock is up 252%, and the business has delivered smashing results on both the top and bottom lines. Its revenue has grown rapidly. Its margins have expanded, and it has stretched its competitive advantage. As the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing company, it's become an even more valuable partner for chip designers like Nvidia that rely on it for manufacturing.
TSMC's strong growth rate has continued through the year as its revenue jumped 34% in August, and the company is guiding for $31.8 billion to $33 billion in revenue for the third quarter with an operating margin of 45.5% to 47.5%.
Let's take a closer look at how TSMC makes its revenue and what it tells us about the future of the company, using this research from The Motley Fool.
1. North America is playing a bigger role
North America has long been the company's biggest market, but it's become even more central to TSMC's business in recent years.
In the second quarter, sales to North America made up 75% of its revenue, up from 56% in the first quarter of 2020. That transition has taken place during a massive data center buildout in North America and because TSMC's biggest customers like Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices come from the U.S.
Additionally, TSMC has been courted by both the Biden and Trump administrations as a key manufacturing partner at a time when the U.S. is seeking to promote domestic semiconductor manufacturing to ensure it has an adequate supply of chips.
TSMC is currently building multiple plants in the U.S. and has received billions in grants from the CHIPS Act. Additionally, its share of business going to China has fallen from 22% to 9% during that time due in part to slowing economic growth in political pressure in the form of export controls from the U.S.
2. Its technology is advancing quickly
Another major transition that has taken place with TSMC's business in the last few years is that advanced chips for high-performance computing have commanded an increasing share of its business.
In the second quarter, advanced chips, which the company defines as 7 nanometers (nm) or less, made up 64% of its revenue, compared to just 35% in the beginning of 2020 when it didn't make 3nm or 5nm chips.
Sixty percent of TSMC's revenue now comes from those two nodes, a reflection of both the company's advancing technology and the demand for more powerful chips, both of which have helped widen the company's economic moat. TSMC will soon start manufacturing chips under a 2nm process.
3. High-performance computing is the future, and the present
At one point, smartphones were the biggest platform that TSMC served, but these days it's been replaced by high-performance computing, which includes chips like Nvidia's that are intended for data centers.
From the first quarter of 2020 to Q2 2025, the percentage of revenue coming from high-performance computing jumped from 30% to 60%. Meanwhile, the percentage of revenue coming from smartphones has fallen from 49% to 29%. Considering TSMC's strong growth, that's more a reflection of the maturing of the smartphone market rather than a decline in revenue.
However, the percentage of revenue share coming from high-performance computing only grow as hyperscalers and other companies are pouring hundreds of billions into AI and data centers.
What it means for TSMC
While competitors like Samsung and Intel have struggled in recent years, TSMC seems to have done everything right as it's on top of all the key trends in the semiconductor industry.
For investors, the stock also continues to look well-priced, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, which is cheaper than most of its AI stock peers. Given its dominance in chip manufacturing and strong competitive advantages, TSMC looks poised to outperform for years to come."

Of the 10 largest American companies by market cap, the top seven are technology sector companies, specializing in hardware, software, e-commerce, internet search, cloud services, or social media.
Nevertheless, investors shouldn't be confused -- many of these tech giants have plenty of room to grow. Today, three Motley Fool contributing analysts will explore the case for some of their favorites: Meta Platforms (META 1.20%), Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), and Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%).
Meta is leveraging its lucrative business model to invest in AI
Jake Lerch (Meta Platforms): Not only is Meta Platforms a big tech stock with ample room to grow, but this social media giant could one day become the largest of them all.
It comes down to three simple factors:
- Meta's enormous reach
- The company's lucrative business model
- Meta's artificial intelligence (AI) investments
Let's start with its reach. Meta boasts nearly 3.5 billion daily average users (DAUs) -- roughly 43% of the population of Earth. The scale here can be tough to wrap your head around, but needless to say, it's enormous. Accordingly, the company can leverage this vast network to generate staggering sums of revenue and profit.
Case in point: As of Meta's most recent earnings report (for the six months ending on June 30, 2025), the company generated nearly $90 billion in revenue and $35 billion in net income. That works out to about $500 million in revenue and almost $200 million in net income each and every day.
To put this in context, Domino's Pizza records about $5 billion in revenue each year -- Meta generates a similar amount of revenue every 10 days. What's more, Meta's revenue is growing at an astounding rate of more than 21%.
Finally, we must discuss what Meta is doing with all this money. To summarize, it's pouring tens of billions into AI investments. It has secured hundreds of thousands of high-end GPUs to power the latest AI models, it has extended lucrative signing bonuses to AI researchers, and it's poured tens of billions into projects ranging from the metaverse to wearable augmented reality (AR) glasses.
In summary, Meta is leveraging its enormously profitable social media business to construct an AI empire. In my view, that is a wise investment that could fuel decades of future growth.
Despite unprecedented gains, this AI growth story is far from over
Will Healy (Nvidia): Looking at the trajectory of Nvidia over the last few years, one cannot blame some investors for thinking the bull market in Nvidia has played out. The stock has risen by nearly 1,200% since its November 2022 low. Additionally, with a market cap of $4.1 trillion, rapid growth is unlikely to occur as easily.
However, Nvidia has benefited precisely because it has created and dominated the market for AI accelerators. The company, which was once known best for its gaming chips, derived 88% of its revenue from the data center segment (which designs AI accelerators) in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended July 27).
Also, with Grand View Research forecasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip market of 29% through 2030, its growth is not on track to stop anytime soon.
Although growth rates have slowed in recent quarters, Nvidia's performance far exceeds this estimate. In the first half of fiscal 2026, its $91 billion in revenue increased by 62% from year-ago levels, an impressive feat for a company of its size.
Still, even with that gain, rising demand has spiked production costs, leading its cost of sales to increase by 131% during the same time frame. Consequently, its $45 billion in net income for the first two quarters of the fiscal year amounted to a 43% increase, a more modest rise that keeps Nvidia in a growth mode.
Over the last three years, profits have grown so rapidly that its P/E ratio is at 49 despite the stock's massive gains, and a 38 forward P/E ratio confirms its continued growth trajectory. Considering the 54% yearly revenue increase Nvidia has forecast for fiscal Q3, investors should expect its stock to climb for the rest of this year and beyond.
Alphabet is up 40% over the past three months, but there is still time to buy
Justin Pope (Alphabet): Technology juggernaut Alphabet continues to rip higher, but I'm still calling this winner a buy. What investors have seen is simply a metaphorical coiled spring that has now unleashed its pent-up energy following the company's favorable outcome in its antitrust litigation.
The stock felt selling pressure for months as Wall Street worried that the courts would take drastic measures to rectify Alphabet's anticompetitive practices in its search engine business. Rumors suggested potential forced sales of key assets, such as the Chrome web browser or Android smartphone operating system. It appears that those worst-case scenarios are out of play.
Now, investors can focus on all the things going right at Alphabet. The company's Gemini AI app has climbed to the top of smartphone app stores, and Google Cloud is thriving as AI demand drives more cloud consumption in Alphabet's direction.
Last but not least, Alphabet's Waymo autonomous ride-hailing service is steadily expanding across the United States. Meanwhile, Tesla's robotaxi, its primary competition, remains confined to a fixed area in Austin, and has reportedly gotten into a few accidents already despite the safeguards in place.
The stock has surged over the past few months, but shares remain valued at roughly 25 times estimated 2025 earnings. That's still a solid deal for one of the world's most prominent technology companies and an emerging leader in AI infrastructure and software, especially if the company can meet Wall Street's expectations of 15% annualized earnings growth over the next three to five years."

BlackRock Investment Narrative Recap
To have confidence as a BlackRock shareholder, one needs to believe in its ability to drive growth through global expansion, especially in private markets and infrastructure, while navigating persistent margin pressure from fee compression. The recent commitment of up to £500 million to upgrade UK data centers for AI, though sizable, does not materially shift the most immediate catalyst, ongoing private markets expansion, or the key risk of integration and operational complexity as BlackRock scales these efforts.
Among recent events, the proposed acquisition of HPS Investment Partners is most relevant, furthering BlackRock’s push into private credit and alternative assets. This aligns with its largest potential growth lever but also adds to ongoing risks around execution and higher costs, as newly integrated platforms and investments must deliver on promised synergies without impacting profit margins.

NVIDIA Investment Narrative Recap
For investors, the core NVIDIA thesis centers on the company’s leadership in AI hardware, full-stack platforms, and accelerating infrastructure demand driven by massive global adoption of advanced AI. The recently announced £2 billion UK investment solidifies NVIDIA’s ecosystem reach and may reinforce its near-term momentum, but the most pressing risk of custom silicon competition from hyperscalers and large enterprises does not appear materially reduced by this specific news.
The formation of joint ventures such as the Nscale-led UK AI supercomputer project with Microsoft and OpenAI, built on NVIDIA’s latest GPUs, highlights robust demand for the company’s data center solutions, a major current growth catalyst. In this context, such deployments spotlight NVIDIA’s ability to deepen customer lock-in and recurring software revenues, even as customers consider in-house silicon alternatives.

However, investors don't need to invest in one or the other; some of the quantum computing pure plays are dabbling in both spaces. This could open up a huge investment opportunity over the next few years and deliver shareholders market-crushing returns.
The standard they'll be judged by is whether they can outperform traditional big tech companies, as they have long led the market to new heights. Additionally, some of them, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), are also competing in the quantum computing arms race alongside the AI buildout.
I've got three stocks that fit the bill that could outperform traditional tech companies, with one of them potentially coming as a surprise.
IonQ and D-Wave Quantum
IONQ (IONQ -5.85%) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS 4.13%) are two of my favorite quantum computing pure plays to follow. Each is taking a unique approach to the quantum computing industry, potentially giving them a leg up if their novel solutions work.
IonQ utilizes a trapped-ion approach, which has a few key advantages over the more popular superconducting approach. Instead of needing to cool a particle to nearly absolute zero, a trapped-ion computer can perform its tasks at room temperature. This reduces input costs, making it easier to deploy. Additionally, a trapped ion calculation is far more accurate than a superconducting one at this time. IonQ holds multiple world records for the most accurate quantum computers, and this could make it a top pick by potential clients.
D-Wave Quantum uses a quantum annealing approach, which isn't intended for broad use like a trapped ion or superconducting quantum computer might be. Instead, it works by finding the lowest energy state in a system, which represents the optimal solution. This makes it ideal for tasks like statistics or logistics networks, which represent a massive use case for quantum computing.
Each company is also looking at deploying its solutions for AI. IonQ's researchers have utilized several existing large language models and improved them by incorporating quantum computing. This cut down on energy cost and provided better-performing models. D-Wave Quantum is also involved with integrating quantum computing applications with AI, specifically focusing on applications where pre-trained AI could assist businesses and researchers.
Both companies are approaching integration with quantum computing in a hybrid approach, which involves using quantum computers to enhance what traditional computers are already doing. Currently, the king of traditional AI computing is Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), and it's also dabbling in the AI realm.
Nvidia
Nvidia isn't developing a quantum processing unit to replace its graphics processing units (GPUs). Instead, it's evolving its popular CUDA software to include quantum computing plug-ins, morphing the platform into CUDA-Q.
This is a smart approach by Nvidia, as it allows it to continue focusing on the AI arms race while capturing the upside of quantum computing. This approach will ensure that Nvidia's GPUs are needed in a hybrid computing application, which will continue to be the vast majority of use cases that deploy quantum computing.
While some may argue that Nvidia could be classified as a ""traditional"" tech company, I don't think it falls under this classification, as it's only a computing hardware provider that just happens to be the largest company in the world due to extreme demand. Nvidia is making a ton of money from its GPU sales to traditional big tech companies, and I think it's well-positioned to outperform in the current environment as well as in the future, when quantum computing potentially becomes a commercially viable technology."

The ‘pennies’ are stocks priced down in the bargain basement, below $5 per share, and that ultra-low starting point means that even a small gain in absolute value will quickly translate into triple-digit percentage gains.
That doesn’t mean, however, that investors should just uncritically buy into the pennies. These shares are usually priced low for a reason, and if that reason comes down to fundamental unsoundness, then it’s time to steer clear. But for the penny stocks with strong potential, the rewards can be impressive.
The real challenge is knowing how to identify them. That’s where Wall Street analysts come in, using their research and experience to sift through the noise and highlight the penny stocks with the potential to grow into far more valuable investments.
With this in mind, we used TipRanks’ database to spot two penny stocks earning top marks from analysts right now. Both carry ‘Strong Buy’ consensus ratings and offer triple-digit upside potential – including one that could jump 840%. Let’s break down the bullish case and see what makes these picks stand out.
Protara Therapeutics (TARA)
The first penny stock we’ll look at is Protara Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotech company focused on developing treatments for cancer and rare, life-threatening diseases. The company’s pipeline currently features two drug candidates: TARA-002, its lead program, which is being evaluated for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and lymphatic malformations (LMs), and IV Choline Chloride, designed to support patients who require parenteral nutrition.
What sets TARA-002 apart is its novel approach. This cell therapy is derived from a cell bank of genetically distinct Streptococcus pyogenes, already approved in Japan as the broad immunopotentiator OK-432. The therapy works through a dual mechanism – directly killing tumor cells while also stimulating an immune response known as immunogenic cell death, thereby amplifying antitumor activity."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-21T11:15:00,Prediction: This Will Be AMD's Stock Price by 2030,AMD is second fiddle to Nvidia in the largest computing buildout we've seen.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=f5a4b9798751ed4f4be5b237fb84f86308792a53b39e1f43f28dd5b328f41c8e,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/prediction-this-will-be-amds-stock-price-by-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/prediction-this-will-be-amds-stock-price-by-2030/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/21/prediction-this-will-be-amds-stock-price-by-2030/,fool.com,200,,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 9.36%) hasn't had the best few years. It has been outshined by its rival Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) in the biggest computing buildout of all time, and there doesn't appear to be a path where AMD can be a direct competitor with Nvidia. Instead, it's only viewed as an alternative so customers can push back against Nvidia if it gets too aggressive with pricing.
Furthermore, AI hyperscalers are starting to design their own chips in collaboration with Broadcom, creating another fierce competitor for AMD. Alongside all of that, AMD isn't completely focused on high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs). It also has an embedded processor division as well as other computing chips used in gaming consoles and PCs.
All of this creates a company that is more diversified than its peers. However, diversification isn't always a good thing, especially when one division is experiencing a generational growth opportunity.
So, what will AMD's stock price be by 2030? Let's take a look.
AMD is a more diversified business than Nvidia
AMD splits its business into three primary divisions: data center, client and gaming, and embedded.
Data center isn't AMD's largest division by revenue; Client and gaming is by a slim margin. In Q2, data center revenue was $3.24 billion versus client and gaming's $3.62 billion. However, AMD's data center divisions were heavily affected by the ban on selling computing hardware to China, which also affected Nvidia.
When comparing Nvidia and AMD's data center growth, it's quite heavily favored in one direction. AMD's data center revenue increased by 14% year over year in Q2, while Nvidia's rose by 56%. This clearly indicates that AMD is getting smoked by Nvidia, and doesn't really have a chance to catch up.
Most AI hyperscalers have already built a ton of infrastructure using Nvidia's technology, and when these GPUs eventually burn out, it would cost a significant amount more to switch over to AMD's architecture versus staying with Nvidia's. As a result, AMD is stuck in second place.
To make matters worse for AMD, its embedded and client and gaming divisions do not have significant long-term potential. These are divisions that over the long term won't grow much more than 10% annually, making them essentially market performers.
This doesn't bode well for AMD, especially with its already expensive valuation.
AMD's expensive stock price is holding its long-term potential back
Despite AMD clearly being a second-place company, it's actually more expensive than its peer.
AMD's 41 times forward earnings price tag isn't cheap, and I'm not sure its growth justifies it. In 2025 and 2026, Wall Street analysts project 28% and 22% revenue growth, respectively. There are plenty of companies that are expected to grow near that level over the next few years that don't have nearly the premium that AMD does, so this also works against it.
However, that's not the only way for a company to perform. AMD is also working on improving its margins, something that it has done consistently over the past few years.
If AMD can improve its margins to 15% by 2030, it could be a winning investment. If AMD trades at a more reasonable valuation of 30 times forward earnings, grows at a 20% pace, and achieves that margin level, it could be worth about $225 per share.
However, that's only a 40% upside from today's stock price. I think there are a lot better stocks to invest in than AMD, as it doesn't have the growth that others in its industry have. Furthermore, if the AI market goes down, it will drag AMD's stock with it. It may not decline as much as Nvidia's, but it would still result in hefty losses. There are far better alternatives to invest in than AMD, and I think investors would be better off picking those stocks instead."

One of the big reasons for this is artificial intelligence (AI), which has gone from a buzzword to a full-blown spending boom. The development of AI is still in its early stages, so the winners today could continue to win for years to come.
If you've got cash to put to work, here are three tech stocks that still look like buys even after solid runs.
1. Nvidia
Everyone talks about Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), and for good reason. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for training large language models (LLMs), which has helped it take over 90% market share in the space. This lead, meanwhile, isn't going away anytime soon, mostly because of its software platform CUDA.
Companies have spent years building on Nvidia's software platform, and ripping it all out to switch to something else would be a nightmare. That's why Nvidia owns the lion's share of the AI GPU market and is still growing like crazy.
But Nvidia is more than just chips. It has also built out a powerful networking portfolio. Its proprietary NVLink interconnect system helps its chips to act as a single unit, while it also has other networking components that allow it to deliver complete turnkey AI factories to customers. This is also one of the reasons why even as the market shifts more toward inference, it's still very well positioned.
CEO Jensen Huang thinks AI infrastructure spending could hit $3 trillion to $4 trillion in the next several years. If he's even close, Nvidia should stay one of the biggest AI infrastructure beneficiaries.
2. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms (META 1.20%) has quietly become one of the biggest AI winners. The company is using the technology to keep users glued to Instagram and Facebook, with its AI recommendation engines feeding users content they are more interested in. This is keeping people on its sites longer, which is giving Meta more opportunities to feed them ads.
On top of that, Meta is also using AI to help advertisers improve their creative and ad targeting, getting them better results. That's a powerful combination, and last quarter, its ad revenue soared 22% year over year to $46.6 billion, driven by higher ad impressions and better pricing.
The really exciting part is what comes next. WhatsApp and Threads are just slowly starting to get ads, which is a nice growth lever Meta hasn't even fully pulled yet. Meanwhile, the company continues to invest in emerging ideas, including the metaverse and ""personal superintelligence."" Meta also just recently launched its first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. If any of these bets hit, the upside in the stock could be huge.
3. Alphabet
Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%) was supposed to be the company most at risk from AI, but it has flipped that narrative on its head. Search growth has actually accelerated as Google rolls out new AI features such as AI Overviews, AI Mode, Circle to Search, and Lens. The recent court decision letting Alphabet keep its search deal with Apple and preserve control of Chrome and Android was another major win, keeping its distribution edge intact. Billions of users still start their internet journeys with Google, and most people stick with defaults.
Alphabet's cloud computing business is also on fire. Google Cloud revenue jumped 32% last quarter and profits more than doubled. AI demand is a huge driver, and Alphabet is one of the few players with an end-to-end AI stack. Its custom AI chips and Gemini models give it both a cost and performance advantage.
Not to be overlooked is the fact that Alphabet also has some big emerging bets in other areas. Waymo is scaling its robotaxi business city by city, and Alphabet's quantum computing team is making progress toward reducing error rates and making the technology commercially viable. These bets will take time, but they could add entirely new growth drivers down the road.
Alphabet's stock has finally started to get the respect it deserves, but there is more potential upside ahead."

The AI hyperscalers are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on building out computing capacity, and any company that is a beneficiary of this spending is an excellent place to invest.
One of the most popular investments from the beginning of the AI race has been Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%). Despite being among the best performers over the past few years, Nvidia is still the ultimate AI stock right now, I believe, especially if its market projections come true.
Nvidia makes lots of money from each GPU it sells
Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which specialize in computing tasks that require plenty of horsepower. They can process multiple calculations in parallel, an effect that can be amplified by connecting hundreds or thousands of them in clusters. This is what occurs in giant AI data centers, where companies connect 100,000 or more GPUs to form supercomputers.
Nvidia's data center GPUs aren't cheap, so it makes a fortune off of each one sold. It's rare to see a hardware company with the margin profile that Nvidia has, but it has consistently delivered a profit margin greater than 50% over the past few years.
This allows the chipmaker to generate huge profits, which is why the stock has increased so much over the past few years. And if management is right about the general direction of AI spending, its stock is just getting started.
Nvidia's growth is far from over
During the company's second-quarter conference call, management estimated that global data center capital expenditures will rise to anywhere from $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Currently, AI hyperscalers are spending around $600 billion annually, and with Nvidia estimated to generate $206 billion in revenue during this fiscal year, it's safe to say that it gets around a third of all data center spending.
That indicates that the company's revenue could be $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion by 2030. Should it reach that level, it would be an annual growth rate of 37% on the low end of management's projection. If Nvidia can maintain its impressive profit margins, it's not unreasonable to think that its stock could rise by a corresponding amount over the next five years.
A 37% annual return wouldn't just outperform the market; it would crush it. The S&P 500 tends to return around 10% annually, so Nvidia could easily be the ultimate growth stock to buy now.
However, this projection isn't without its caveats. Its biggest clients would need to continue spending nearly all of their cash flow on AI infrastructure for this to come true. If they don't see a reasonable return on investment, they may begin to taper off their spending.
Furthermore, management's projection includes all data center spending. So, if a competitor comes out with a GPU alternative, it's possible that Nvidia loses market share and doesn't get a third of total data center spending.
Even if it falls short of its projection, there's still plenty of wiggle room for it to be a top-performing stock over the next five years. I think it's an excellent buy at this price point, and anybody who's still bullish on the AI trend should consider buying shares of Nvidia today."

Barclays hosted Bob Carroll, the former Infineon R&D executive, who explained that the industry first moved to 48V to support higher currents without extra copper but is now looking at 800V architectures, such as Nvidia’s upcoming Kyber rack design.
“Moving to 800V offers even greater efficiency, lower distribution losses and less copper in the backplane,” Carroll said.
The change is said to be enabled by advances in semiconductors like silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN).
Carroll argued that “the closer the conversion step is to the processor, the higher the current and the greater the power semi content,” highlighting silicon in low-voltage stages, GaN in mid-voltage, and SiC at the high end.
Even with rising efficiency, he does not expect semiconductor content to decline because “power requirements [are] outpacing efficiency gains.”
Barclays noted that the traditional power supply unit model is being phased out in favor of bulk rectifiers that could convert AC mains directly to DC, potentially eliminating rack-mounted PSUs.
Carroll reportedly stated that this shift creates risks for PSU makers but opens opportunities for new semiconductor solutions.
Reliability is seen as a key challenge, particularly for GaN. “If a single component fails, entire GPU cards may need to be replaced,” Carroll warned, noting that GaN’s defect density remains a concern in mission-critical datacenter settings.
Barclays highlighted Infineon as “well placed for the AI datacentre power opportunity,” citing its vertically integrated portfolio and systems approach. STMicro also has relevant products but faces pressure to move quickly to secure share.

Par Pacific Holdings Investment Narrative Recap
To be a shareholder of Par Pacific Holdings, you need to believe in continued strong refining margins, positive Pacific energy demand trends, and successful execution of renewable fuel initiatives such as the Hawaii Renewables joint venture. Recent insider selling by a director, while drawing attention to governance, is not a material disruptor to the company’s key near-term catalysts, particularly margin strength and renewable project delivery. The most relevant short-term risk remains potential operational disruptions at concentrated regional refineries.
Among recent announcements, the joint venture with Mitsubishi and ENEOS for renewable fuels stands out, directly addressing a core catalyst: Par Pacific’s exposure to the industry’s transition to cleaner energy. While this project promises new revenue streams starting in 2026, it also underscores the importance of maintaining reliable refinery operations as the company pivots toward renewables. In contrast, investors should be aware that...

Airbnb Investment Narrative Recap
To hold Airbnb stock, you need to believe the company can adapt and grow beyond its core short-term rental model, despite mounting regulatory challenges. The recent US$250 million AI-focused investment aims to expand Airbnb's appeal and capabilities, but for now, the most important short-term catalyst remains quarterly earnings momentum. The biggest risk is still intensifying government restrictions, and the recent announcement doesn’t materially change that risk in the near term.

Nucor Investment Narrative Recap
Owning Nucor often comes down to having confidence in resilient steel demand, operational efficiency, and the ability to manage costs in a cyclical industry. The newly issued Q3 2025 guidance, calling for a pullback in earnings due to lower volumes and tighter margins, may directly affect short-term sentiment; however, the primary catalyst, new capacity from major projects, remains the key factor for potential earnings growth, while exposure to volatile steel pricing stands out as the biggest risk right now.
Among recent company announcements, the scheduled release of Q3 earnings results on October 27, 2025 is most relevant to the latest guidance.

If you have been debating what to do with Lucid Group (LCID), the past week just gave you plenty to consider. The company used the spotlight of IAA Mobility in Munich to officially debut its Gravity SUV for Europe, showcasing not only a bold new product but also cutting-edge driver-assistance features developed in partnership with NVIDIA. These moves, combined with a luxury price tag and aspirations for European growth, have put Lucid back in the headlines as investors digest what these announcements really mean for the company’s future.
This product rollout comes after a year defined by both excitement and caution. While Lucid’s shares have been clawing back from a 52-week low earlier this month after a period marked by disappointing production forecasts, a reverse stock split, and executive changes, momentum has shifted. Short-term price swings have been sharp, yet over the full year, the stock is still down dramatically, reflecting deeper questions around execution, financial health, and the competitive EV landscape.
With Gravity now out in the open and Lucid aiming for innovation leadership, some may wonder if the stock is trading at a discount to its true potential, or if the market is already pricing in all the risk and future growth.
Most Popular Narrative: 9.2% Undervalued
Current valuation consensus shows Lucid Group stock is trading at a discount, implying analysts see upside potential from today’s share price.
The newly announced Uber and Nuro partnership, including a planned $300 million Uber investment and a commitment to deploy at least 20,000 Lucid Gravity vehicles as robotaxis over six years, is expected to open a large and fast-growing autonomous fleet market to Lucid. This initiative could drive significant revenue expansion and potential margin improvement through technology licensing and high-volume fleet sales.
Curious what’s behind the undervalued label? The market isn’t just betting on hopes or hype. The latest narrative draws from bold revenue growth forecasts and projections of rising profit margins to justify its fair value. The assumptions embedded in this outlook could reset how investors view Lucid’s future. So what’s the key number that could make all the difference?
Result: Fair Value of $23.25 (UNDERVALUED)
Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.
However, persistent losses and heavy reliance on external funding could undermine Lucid’s growth story if progress toward profitability stalls or if capital costs rise."

The rebranding of Payzerware to WEX Field Service Management expands its contractor ecosystem but does not materially shift the primary near-term catalyst, revenue growth from new fleet partnerships, or mitigate the central risk of declining relevance as fleets transition toward electric vehicles and alternative fuels.
The recent announcement that Lynkwell has integrated WEX payment technology into its EV charging platform is closely related, as it demonstrates ongoing efforts to keep WEX relevant as fleet fuel needs change. This move aligns with catalysts around product diversification, highlighting WEX’s intent to maintain a foothold with customers regardless of how mobility trends shift.
However, investors should note that, despite these advances, growing competition from specialized fintech disruptors could suddenly compress margins if...

That's why Nvidia's returns of 32% so far in 2025 may appear lukewarm to investors. After all, with a market cap in excess of $4.3 trillion, it is now the world's largest company. So, expecting Nvidia to replicate the eye-popping returns that it has clocked in recent years isn't reasonable, especially considering that its growth rate, though healthy, is relatively slower than it was before.
However, there are smaller companies out there capitalizing on the fast-growing demand for AI hardware that can still deliver phenomenal returns to investors. One of these is Cloudflare (NET 0.23%), which has significantly outperformed Nvidia so far this year -- it's up by a remarkable 110% -- and has the potential to fly higher.
Cloudflare's focus on building a global GPU network is paying off
Cloudflare was traditionally known for offering content delivery network (CDN) services and a reverse proxy network that helps make internet connections faster, secure, and more reliable. Its cloud security solutions also secure data across public cloud networks, private cloud networks, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, among other systems.
However, the AI trend has helped it unlock a lucrative growth avenue. It is now leveraging its massive global network of servers to deploy graphics processing units (GPUs) and bring edge AI processing capabilities to its customers. The company's network spans 300 cities, and management said last year that the entire network would be equipped with GPUs to run AI inference applications closer to end users, which will help reduce latency and improve performance.
Based on what management said on the company's latest earnings conference call, Cloudflare has achieved that goal. And demand for its Workers AI serverless GPU platform -- which allows customers to run AI models on Cloudflare's network and forego investing in and managing expensive hardware -- has been solid.
Cloudflare customers can access more than 50 AI models on the Workers AI platform to build applications based on their needs. They can also store large datasets on the Cloudflare network at competitive costs. Importantly, Workers AI has a pay-as-you-go business model, so customers aren't locked into subscription contracts.
This consumption-oriented model is working well for Cloudflare as it helps the company lower the barrier to entry for companies looking to run AI inference in the cloud. The company landed several multimillion-dollar contracts for Workers AI in the second quarter, which explains the impressive 39% year-over-year increase in its remaining performance obligations (RPO) to almost $2 billion.
This metric refers to the total value of a company's unfulfilled contracts, and it's worth noting that Cloudflare's RPO growth substantially exceeded the 28% year-over-year spike in its Q2 revenue to $512 million. What this means is that Cloudflare is landing new contracts at a faster pace, setting up a nice revenue pipeline for the long run that should lead to accelerating top-line growth. Moreover, the analysts at Fortune Business Insights forecast that demand for edge AI will increase at an impressive annualized rate of 33% through 2032.
In that context, I won't be surprised to see Cloudflare's revenue pipeline improve further, especially considering that there is a tremendous need for GPU-powered AI cloud computing capacity.
But is the stock worth buying following its phenomenal surge?
Cloudflare's big rally so far in 2025 has left it trading at 40 times sales. That's expensive when compared to Nvidia's price-to-sales ratio of 26. However, Cloudflare's RPO growth is accelerating. The company reported a 37% year-over-year increase in the metric in Q2 2024, indicating that its future revenue pipeline growth is ticking up.
As a result, it wouldn't be surprising to see Cloudflare's top-line growth accelerate in the future -- which is precisely what analysts are predicting.
For some perspective, Nvidia's top-line growth rate is expected to slow down.
So, there is a good chance that Cloudflare may be able to justify its expensive sales multiple by clocking faster growth than the AI chip leader. That's why investors who have a tolerance for risk and a willingness to pay a premium valuation for this AI stock should consider accumulating it, even after its remarkable rally this year."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-20T12:00:00,Prediction: These 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Will Be the World's Most Valuable Companies in 5 Years,Are these two companies poised to rack up huge AI wins over the next half-decade?,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=289501b4c49c951515605ebac26a772a68b67c862706dc8fd06bd467f274d312,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-artificial-intelligence-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-artificial-intelligence-stocks/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/prediction-these-2-artificial-intelligence-stocks/,fool.com,200,,"Despite incredible gains for some leading players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, there's a good chance that the AI revolution is still just starting to take flight. Investors who back the right players in the space have the opportunity to score big gains with companies that have attractive risk-reward profiles.
With that in mind, read on for a look at two leading AI players that have been identified by some Motley Fool contributors as leading candidates to be the world's top two most valuable companies five years from now.
Nvidia will still lead
Jennifer Saibil (Nvidia): AI continues to be the strongest trend in business today, and it's much more than buzzy hype. It's already changing how people do everything from read and shop to study and play, and its capabilities are only becoming more powerful as industry leaders invest in upgrading their technology. Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is at the center of AI trends. It's the highest valued company in the world today, and it's likely to remain in the top spot as clients need its best-in-class products to boost their own AI businesses.
Although it's facing new competition from other AI chip designers, it's constantly raising its game to stay in the top spot. It has as much as 95% of the market for AI chips, and it supplies the top AI companies, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.
These companies have accelerated their investments in AI, and that includes Nvidia's best -- and most expensive -- graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive the most powerful AI capabilities. Together, these three companies are spending at an annual run rate of nearly $300 billion combined, and that's expected to increase.
Nvidia's growth has been wild, especially for a company as large as it already is. In the 2026 fiscal second quarter (ended July 27), revenue increased 56% year over year, and that included a charge related to China sales that couldn't go through.
Management is looking for $54 billion in third-quarter sales, or 54% higher than last year. It's also a profit machine, with a 72.4% gross margin and a 56.5% profit margin in the quarter.
On top of upgrades to its chips, which keep becoming even more powerful, Nvidia is investing in new products like data centers and supercomputers. It just launched Rubin CPX, which it calls an entirely new category of processors that can handle AI reasoning faster and more seamlessly than anything else on the market.
At its current rate of performance and innovation, expect Nvidia to stay on top of the market over the next five years.
Don't underestimate Amazon
Keith Noonan (Amazon): Despite owning and operating the leading cloud infrastructure service, Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) has seen its stock post relatively underwhelming performance amid the rise of AI. While the company's share price has risen 50% over the last five years, the performance comes in far below the 95% gain for the S&P 500's level across the stretch.
Comparing Amazon's gains over the last half-decade to the 148% gain for Microsoft stock and the 1,260% gain for Nvidia produces an even starker contrast.
Amazon's relative underperformance can be explained by rising competition in cloud computing, pressures from tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. But while the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 and its peers in the ""Magnificent Seven"" over the last half-decade, there are some good reasons to think that it could rise to become one of the world's two most valuable companies over the next five years.
While Amazon Web Services (AWS) has seen a rise in competition in the cloud-infrastructure services space, it has also generally continued to post strong growth and encouraging margins. As the leading cloud infrastructure network, there's a good chance that AWS will continue strong growth connected to the launch and scaling-up of new AI applications.
The market's enthusiasm for AWS' momentum has also been dampened somewhat by headwinds that have faced the e-commerce business over the last five years, but that could start to change in the not-too-distant future.
Amazon's online retail business has faced challenges connected to the coronavirus pandemic, high levels of inflation, and tariffs. On the other hand, the e-commerce unit could actually be in the early stages of benefiting from powerful long-term tailwinds.
The combination of AI and robotics stands to make the company's online retail operations significantly more efficient. With new automation technologies, Amazon has the opportunity to dramatically improve margins for its huge e-commerce business and transform its profitability profile at large."

The breadth of strength is unmistakable for anyone watching their portfolios and financial headlines.
At long last, rate cut relief has arrived. And while Wall Street had priced in the Fed's shift toward easing, the actual decision brought a jolt of bullish energy.
All three major averages clinched record closes this week. And for the first time since 2021, the Russell 2000 (^RUT) notched a new closing high. Investors poured into small-cap stocks that are poised for a boost with lower interest rates on the horizon.

Tech stocks are also continuing their strong climb and have completely brushed off Chinese AI developer DeepSeek's revelation that training its R1 model came at only a fraction of the cost of its US rivals. Certainly a marked departure from the last time DeepSeek dropped big news.
With more paths to revenue and a renewed commitment to invest in AI, any shock value of DeepSeek as a competitor to the tech giants has faded. And Intel's government backing and partnership with Nvidia also added to investor optimism.
Rallying markets appear to be shaking off the initial hesitation after the rate decision.
Yes, more cuts are coming, the forecasts of central bankers showed, but there was a wide dispersion of predictions for when those cuts would show up and how many would be appropriate. New Federal Reserve governor Stephen Miran on Friday revealed that he was the outlier on the ""dot plot,"" penciling in a total of six cuts this year. But Fed officials, by and large, were less aligned than in previous forecasts.
In some ways, the meeting whose outcome was largely predicted also confused investors with mixed messages. As often happens when we get what we want, we ask what's next — and a satisfactory answer isn't immediately obvious.
The Fed, for instance, upgraded its growth outlook but flagged a weakening labor market with downside risks, suggesting that the priority for policymakers is to protect jobs, even as inflation persists above target levels. Two more cuts are likely this year, according to the Fed's ""dot plot.""
But even as Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled confidence in eventually taming inflation, he said that ""there are no risk-free paths now,"" a line we brought attention to Thursday. Central bankers now have to execute a balancing act — grappling with labor weakness and sticky pricing pressures — with unclear outcomes. Nonetheless, Wall Street is extending its record run."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-20T10:50:00,Nvidia's CEO Just Delivered Incredible News for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock Investors,TSMC is set to benefit from continued massive spending in AI.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0551dcb0d506f004dcfed2ecd8d112c65fa35c8e231ec997832ea0250e8c7a5f,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/nvidia-ceo-incredible-news-tsmc-stock-invest/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/nvidia-ceo-incredible-news-tsmc-stock-invest/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/nvidia-ceo-incredible-news-tsmc-stock-invest/,fool.com,200,,"When Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), investors listen. Huang recently predicted that global spending on AI infrastructure will surge from $600 billion this year to as much as $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade. That is a massive increase, and it is going to require a lot of advanced chips.
Huang also recently went out of his way to praise Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%), calling it ""one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity"" and saying that ""anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person."" Coming from the head of the world's most valuable company, that is not the kind of endorsement you hear every day.
What makes TSMC special
Manufacturing semiconductors isn't easy. It requires technological expertise, and fabs (manufacturing facilities) need to be running near full capacity to be profitable. The process for making these complex chips can involve 700-plus steps, with the potential for excess waste overshadowing each step. Such complexity means producing these chips at scale requires real expertise. That is why today most chipmakers don't make their own chips, but instead send their designs to contract manufacturers.
That is where TSMC comes in. It is the world's leading semiconductor contract manufacturer and the company that advanced chip designers turn to when they need their designs manufactured at scale. It runs the most advanced chipmaking facilities on the planet, known as foundries, and is the clear leader in producing advanced chips, like graphics processing units (GPUs), with the smallest nodes. Smaller nodes pack more transistors on each chip, which makes them faster and more efficient. This is not easy to do, and rivals like Intel and Samsung have struggled to match TSMC's yields.
That is why every major AI chipmaker, from Nvidia to Broadcom to AMD, relies on TSMC. It wins no matter who comes out on top in the AI chip design race, because they all need its manufacturing expertise.
TSMC's advantage is more than just its scale. It has consistently led the industry in shrinking node sizes and moving production into high volume quickly. Nearly three-quarters of its revenue now comes from chips built on nodes of 7 nanometers or smaller, with 3nm chips already making up nearly a quarter. The company is already preparing to roll out 2nm production, keeping it ahead of competitors and locking in its customers for years to come.
That technological lead has given TSMC strong pricing power. It has been able to steadily raise prices while still keeping its customers happy, which is why its gross margin has climbed over the last several years even as it spends heavily on new fabs.
The AI opportunity is massive, and TSMC is in the perfect spot to capture it. The company has said that AI chip demand should grow at more than a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. That is the kind of growth runway that few companies can match, and it gives TSMC years of visibility into its own expansion. It is already working closely with its largest customers to secure capacity and meet their growing demand.
AI is not the only major growth driver either. If robotaxis really do start lining city streets later this decade, they will each need multiple powerful chips to process real-time driving data safely. That could become another huge market for TSMC. The same goes for emerging technologies like robotics and quantum computing, which will require cutting-edge chips. Wherever computing power is headed, TSMC is likely to be right in the middle of it.
Is TSMC stock a buy?
Despite its critical role in the semiconductor ecosystem, TSMC still flies a bit under the radar. It is also currently one of the best values in the semiconductor space, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 times based on analysts' 2026 estimates, despite the huge growth still in front of it.
Investors looking for a way to play the AI infrastructure buildout should take Huang's advice seriously. TSMC is one of the best-positioned companies in the world to benefit from the coming AI spending boom, and it might just be the smartest stock to buy and hold through the next decade."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-20T10:30:00,5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Far Better Buys Than Palantir,"The market is full of reasonably priced AI investments, but Palantir isn't one of them.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7fef5ef4ba3388cbd9ac8c192a74b9747df4f63de181b1c316198b0ef30a80a5,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-better-palantir/,fool.com,200,,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR -0.11%) has been on an impressive run over the past few years. The stock is up 2,570% since the start of 2023, making it an even better performer than Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) over that timeframe. While that share price performance is great, the business is note growing at quite that pace and Palantir's stock may have gotten ahead of itself. As a result, there are plenty of stocks that look like far better buys than Palantir right now.
I've identified five companies that investors might want to consider before Palantir, and there's one glaring reason why any of this group of five stocks is a far better investment.
Palantir's stock has gotten ahead of itself
Palantir's AI software has seen significant growth recently, driving Palantir's 48% year-over-year revenue increase in Q2. I wouldn't be surprised to see the growth rate accelerate through the end of the year, but it will take a lot more than that to justify Palantir's stock price.
Although the stock price has increased 25-fold since the start of 2023, its quarterly revenue has only risen by 81%. This suggests that nearly all of Palantir's stock performance can be attributed to its valuation rising, which becomes evident when examining its valuation multiples.
At 126 times sales and 267 times forward earnings, Palantir is one of the most expensive stocks in the market.
It's rare for any stock to trade in the triple-digit price-to-sales (P/S) ratio range, let alone one that isn't doubling or tripling its revenue year over year, yet that's where we find Palantir. Palantir's stock has years of growth baked into the stock price, which will impede future returns. As a result, I think AI investors should consider other options, especially those with more reasonable valuations.
The market is full of promising AI investment opportunities
There are multiple ways to invest in the AI arms race, but my preferred approach is through companies that provide the computing hardware necessary to power AI computing. Chief among these are Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%). Nvidia manufactures graphics processing units (GPUs), which are utilized for training and running AI models. Its GPUs are responsible for almost all of the AI technology we utilize today, and it will remain a top choice in the future.
Broadcom is also making a name for itself in two areas. First, its networking switches help stitch back information that is calculated across multiple computing units. Second, its custom AI chips, which are designed in collaboration with an end user, are starting to challenge Nvidia's computing dominance. Both companies will continue to be excellent AI investments as AI infrastructure spending ramps up.
Another important field in the hardware space is chip fabrication. My favorite fabricator by far is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, as they lack the in-house capabilities to do so. It has a long track record of continuously innovating and producing the world's most powerful chips, and an investment in TSMC is a bet that we're going to need more advanced chips in great quantities in the future (which is a safe bet).
Another company along the same lines as TSMC is ASML (ASML 2.69%). ASML manufactures extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are required in the chip manufacturing process. ASML is the only company in the world with this capability, making it a technological monopoly. As more chip foundries are built to handle the massive demand for AI-related equipment, ASML is expected to continue growing.
Lastly, I like Alphabet (GOOG 2.17%) (GOOGL 2.23%), which is both a hardware player (through its cloud computing service) and an AI developer (with its leading AI model, Gemini). The market has doubted Alphabet since it fell behind at the start of the AI arms race, but it has quickly found its running legs and is back in the AI race, and is a strong bet to continue being a market leader.
A look at their valuations shows that all five of these companies are far better buys than Palantir, and investors should consider this group first."

That is why it can sometimes be smart to make note of the moves these investors are making to see if you might want to do the same.
Let's look at five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that billionaires were buying in Q2 and see if they might help you in your efforts to boost your portfolio.
Philippe Laffont: Nvidia and Broadcom
Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, which is a technology-focused hedge fund. While he may not be a household name, Laffont manages money for rich and powerful clients, including Amazon (AMZN -0.45%) founder Jeff Bezos.
Public filings show the billionaire was buying two top AI chip stocks in Q2, adding to his positions in Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) and Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%). He increased his Nvidia stake by 34% and those shares now account for 5% of his overall portfolio. He upped his Broadcom position by 58%, and it now represents 4.3% of his holdings.
With Nvidia predicting that AI infrastructure spending could climb from $600 billion to as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade, it's easy to see why Laffont is bullish on AI chip stocks. Nvidia is obviously the undisputed leader and has been the biggest beneficiary of the race to build out new AI data centers. Given the wide moat it's created through its CUDA software platform, the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are likely to remain the primary chips powering AI workloads long into the future.
However, Broadcom is also becoming a major player in the space by helping customers design custom AI chips. As good as Nvidia's chips are, customers do not want to solely rely on the chip giant, and those with deep pockets that are building massive data centers have been increasingly turning to Broadcom. While custom chips lack the flexibility of GPUs, they often can have higher performance and cost savings for the specific task for which they've been designed.
With AI chip demand surging, both Nvidia and Broadcom look like they will be long-term winners.
Stanley Druckenmiller: TSMC
Stanley Druckenmiller manages the Duquesne Family Office. This basically means that Druckenmiller became so rich that he no longer needs to manage the money of outside investors and is happy just investing his own money.
Druckenmiller was also investing in the AI chip theme, but instead of buying shares in chip designers, he added to his position in the company that manufactures the advanced chips: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%). Druckenmiller boosted his position by 28%, taking it up to a 4.3% position in his portfolio.
The beauty of investing in TSMC is that Druckenmiller doesn't have to pick a chip winner. TSMC is currently the only foundry that is able to make advanced chips with a high yield rate (this means with only a few defective chips per wafer) at scale. That has made it a close partner to every chipmaker and given it strong pricing power.
With the need for AI chips growing and potential in emerging industries like robotaxis and quantum computing, TSMC looks like a long-term winner.
Bill Ackman: Amazon and Alphabet
Famed investor Bill Ackman is head of Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman has always been fond of the consumer space, and he's playing AI in much the same way, making a large investment in Amazon in the quarter and increasing his bet on Alphabet (GOOGL 2.23%) (GOOG 2.17%). Amazon was a new investment for Ackman, and it represents a little over 9% of his portfolio, while he boosted his position in Alphabet so it now accounts for 15% of his holdings.
Both Amazon and Alphabet are cloud computing leaders that are seeing huge demand for their services. They also both have their own custom AI chips, which can help improve performance and reduce costs. This space is booming, and both are investing aggressively to take advantage of the opportunity.
Meanwhile, both companies are also deploying AI to help power their core businesses. Amazon is using AI to make its e-commerce business more efficient. This includes everything from having AI-powered robots in its fulfillment centers to using AI to optimize delivery routes and improve supply chain management. It's also using AI to drive its fast-growing sponsored ad business. This is all leading to strong operating leverage in its retail operations.
Alphabet, on the other hand, is using AI to help power its search business. AI Overviews is leading to more search queries, and it's just started rolling out its new AI Mode globally. In addition, newer features such as Lens and Circle to Search are also driving more queries, with many having a commercial intent (this is when a user is searching for products or services to purchase).

Here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week.
Intel
Intel shares closed 22.8% higher on Thursday at $30.57, a level not seen since July 2024, after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in the chipmaker.
Nvidia said it plans to purchase $5 billion of Intel shares at $23.28 per share. The investment comes as part of a broader collaboration between the two semiconductor giants to develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products.
Analysts at Baird view the announcement as ""a clear win for Intel’s CEO which has aimed to secure at least one flagship client in manufacturing,"" adding that the deal ""will promote market share gains and foundry revenue growth.""
Tesla
Tesla shares have continued to gain ground over the last week, up over 14%. Monday saw a more than 3% rise in the electric vehicle giant’s stock after its CEO, Elon Musk, disclosed a nearly $1 billion open-market purchase of the company’s stock. Musk bought 2.57 million Tesla shares on Sept. 12 at prices between $372.37 and $396.54 per share.
“We see this as a clear signal of confidence from Musk,” said analysts at William Blair. “The market has looked through our concerns over how margins will react to the elimination of environmental tax credit revenue in the second half of this year.
“With Musk’s purchase, combined with the upward momentum for delivery expectations and robotaxi rollout, we are becoming more bullish but retaining our Market Perform rating.”
Oklo/Nuclear Stocks
Oklo (+63.7% in the last week as of Friday 1:45 pm ET) hit new highs while other nuclear stocks also surged this week after the U.S. and U.K. announced a nuclear energy pact, aiming to speed up the development and deployment of nuclear technologies.
Brighthouse Financial
Brighthouse Financial surged over 30% on Friday following reports from multiple news agencies that Aquarian Holdings is in advanced talks to acquire the life insurance and annuity provider for up to $70 per share.
The potential acquisition would value Brighthouse at a significant premium to its previous trading price.
Baidu
Baidu and other Chinese tech stocks continued to rally due to renewed optimism in the AI boom.
Baidu is up 18% in the last week and over 58% in the last month. In a note to clients on Friday, Goldman Sachs lifted its target for the company to $154 from $90, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock, citing growing confidence in the company’s non-search businesses."

Further, Citadel beat the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.40%) by 9 percentage points during the last three years, which makes his portfolio a good place for individual investors to find inspiration.
Griffin made several noteworthy trades during the second quarter. He sold shares of Tesla (TSLA 1.39%) for the fourth consecutive quarter, slashing an already-small position by 30%. He also added shares of Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%), increasing his position by 900% such that it now ranks as his second-largest holding.
Interestingly, Nvidia has returned 1,100% since the artificial intelligence (AI) boom began in January 2023. But Griffin consistently sold the stock (reducing his exposure in seven of the previous eight quarters) before his big purchase in 2025's Q2. Citadel now has more money invested in Nvidia than at any point since 2022, suggesting Griffin was too quick to sell and has since realized his mistake.
Here's what investors should know.
Tesla: The stock Ken Griffin sold in the second quarter
Tesla's electric car business is struggling. Automotive sales have declined in three straight quarters as the company has navigated increased competition, elevated interest rates, and brand damage caused by CEO Elon Musk's political activities. The company lost more than 3 percentage points of market share in the last year as Chinese automaker BYD became the global leader in electric car sales.
However, Tesla has a substantial opportunity in autonomous driving technology. It recently introduced its first commercial autonomous ride-sharing (robotaxi) service in Texas. The company is also testing its vehicles in California, and it recently won approval to begin testing in Nevada. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates robotaxi revenue will reach $84 billion by 2035.
Importantly, while Tesla trails the market leader Alphabet's Waymo -- which has commercial autonomous ride-sharing services in five U.S. cities -- the company arguably has an edge. Whereas Waymo relies on a costly sensor suite that requires city streets be mapped in extensive detail beforehand, Tesla relies solely on computer vision, which is less expensive and more scalable.
Meanwhile, Tesla is also developing an autonomous humanoid robot called Optimus. Musk says it will account for as much as 80% of the company's value in the future, telling analysts earlier this year, ""Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue."" Tesla hopes to manufacture at least a million units annually within five years.
Tesla currently trades at a 170 times forward earnings based on estimates for 2026, which make it the third-most expensive stock in the S&P 500. Put bluntly, the company is wildly overvalued if it fails to deliver on robotaxis and autonomous robots. But the current price may appear reasonable in hindsight if it executes on those opportunities. Investors will have to decide which outcome they see as most likely.
Nvidia: The stock Ken Griffin bought in the second quarter
Nvidia dominates the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips often called artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators because they speed up demanding workloads like AI training and inference. Nvidia has over 80% market share today, and many analysts think the company will maintain that level for the foreseeable future.
Nvidia dominates the AI accelerator market not only because its chips consistently deliver superior results when benchmarked against alternatives but also because the company complements its GPUs with adjacent networking hardware and central processing units (CPUs), as well as software tools that streamline the development of a wide variety of AI applications.
Blayne Curtis at Jefferies last year highlighted that competitive moat in a note to clients. ""Nvidia is in control of the ecosystem on both the hardware and software front, and their current cadence of new generations should make that lead only [grow] further,"" he wrote. Indeed, while Nvidia just recently started shipping its latest GPU (called Blackwell), its next generation GPU (called Rubin) will launch next year.
Looking ahead, Nvidia is well positioned to maintain its momentum. CEO Jensen Huang expects AI data center expenditures to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by the end of the decade, up from about $600 billion today. That means its addressable market will grow at least 400% in the next five years, which implies annual revenue growth in the upper 30% range at a minimum.
Indeed, Wall Street estimates Nvidia's earnings will increase at 36% annually during the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 50 times earnings seem quite reasonable. Patient investors with a time horizon of at least three years should feel comfortable buying a position in this semiconductor stock today."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-20T09:00:00,3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy in September,"Broadcom, TSMC, and ASML are three top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy now.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9288fd2b070aa5debb26b02ee4e14115a05f3f1c6e56d1208b671ade34b9acc4,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/3-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/3-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/3-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-september/,fool.com,200,,"The biggest driver of the market remains artificial intelligence (AI), which makes it a space where investors need to have some exposure. Some of the biggest growth, meanwhile, continues to come from the build-out of the data center infrastructure needed to run AI.
Let's look at three top tech stocks set to benefit from the continued spending on AI infrastructure.
1. Broadcom
Broadcom (AVGO 2.09%) has suddenly become one of the most important players in the AI infrastructure build-out. With companies looking for alternatives to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), they are increasingly turning to Broadcom to help them design their own custom chips, which can be cheaper to operate and more efficient for inference workloads. This is an area where cost matters because inference is an ongoing expense, not a one-time training run.
Broadcom helped Alphabet design its tensor processing units (TPUs) that now help power its cloud computing unit, and that success led to Meta Platforms and ByteDance turning to Broadcom for help as well. These three customers alone represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity by fiscal 2027 (ending October 2027).
However, those customers are just the tip of the iceberg. The company recently revealed that a fourth customer, widely believed to be OpenAI, has already placed a $10 billion order for chips that will be delivered next year. With OpenAI and Oracle planning to spend $300 billion building out data centers over the next five years, Broadcom looks like it will be a key beneficiary. Meanwhile, Apple is also working with Broadcom to develop its own custom AI chips.
Broadcom's role in creating custom AI chips is only going to become more important as inference grows in importance. That makes the stock a long-term buy that investors will want to take a closer look at now in order to take full advantage of the potential gains.
2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%) has become the heart of the AI chip industry, as it is the company responsible for manufacturing most of the world's advanced chips, including those used in AI.
Manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex process that requires both technological expertise and scale. Foundries must continue to push down node sizes, which is how many transistors can fit on a chip, to help improve chips' performance and power consumption. They also need to maintain high yields, which means most of the chips on a wafer are free of defects and usable.
Competitors like Intel and Samsung have tried to close the gap in advanced chips, but they've both struggled to produce acceptable yields at smaller node sizes. This has essentially left TSMC as the only real game in town when it comes to producing advanced chips at scale with consistent yields. As a result, it has become a key partners for all the top chip designers. This dynamic has also given it strong pricing power, with the company set to raise prices next year by another 10%.
No matter who wins market share in AI chip design, TSMC is set to benefit because it is the one that builds the chips. And with AI chip demand expected to continue to soar, TSMC is poised to continue to be a big winner. Now is the time to give this stock a closer look.
3. ASML
If TSMC is the heart of the chip industry, ASML (ASML 2.69%) is the company that makes the tools that allow that heart to keep beating. ASML basically has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the technology needed to make advanced chips. Without its machines, TSMC, Intel, and Samsung would not be able to manufacture any advanced chips whatsoever.
Each EUV machine can cost $220 million or more, and its next-generation high-NA EUV machines cost nearly double the price. Intel was the first foundry to adopt high-NA EUV for use in production, while TSMC has taken delivery of its first machine and is testing it, but wider adoption may not come until later in the decade. Still, to push node sizes down even further, foundries will eventually need its newer high-NA EUV machines.
That said, with AI chip demand surging and foundries continuing to expand capacity, ASML will keep selling more of its existing EUV systems for years to come. There really is no alternative supplier for this technology, which gives ASML a very wide moat and pricing power.
The company also recently took a large stake in AI start-up Mistral AI, and it plans to incorporate its large language models (LLMs) throughout its product portfolio and operations. The collaboration looks like a low-risk move that could have solid benefits, but the biggest reason to own the stock is that it has a monopoly on the technology needed to make AI chips."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-20T08:40:00,Investors Should Ask: Who Wins More From This $6.3 Billion CoreWeave-Nvidia Agreement?,Perspectives and risk tolerances could drive this choice.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2fff1b05c97700349109550951a49eca39d12ab92c80ce8d9835871d33ea2997,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/investors-who-wins-coreweave-nvidia-deal/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/investors-who-wins-coreweave-nvidia-deal/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/20/investors-who-wins-coreweave-nvidia-deal/,fool.com,200,,"CoreWeave (CRWV 3.94%) just announced that it has landed an order from AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) worth at least $6.3 billion. The deal obligates Nvidia to purchase its residual unsold capacity until April 13, 2032, if it is not already purchased by CoreWeave's customers.
CoreWeave is a longtime Nvidia client. It has purchased hundreds of thousands of GPUs, which CoreWeave rents out to clients. With the agreement, CoreWeave gains an additional revenue source.
Still, investors need to remember that the spare capacity was valuable enough to pay CoreWeave $6.3 billion, raising questions about which company will reap the greater benefit. Thus, investors should take a closer look at the deal to see whether CoreWeave or Nvidia benefits more.
How CoreWeave benefits
CoreWeave obviously benefits from the deal since it has a guaranteed customer, and it will receive $6.3 billion in revenue over the length of the agreement.
But understanding the benefit fully means knowing what CoreWeave offers to the market. CoreWeave is an artificial intelligence (AI) based cloud computing company. It differs from cloud providers like Amazon's AWS as it builds servers specifically for workloads related to AI, machine learning, high-performance computing, and visual effects.
It also provides customers with the latest hardware, can handle heavy workloads at lower costs, and its per-instance pricing allows customers to manage their costs more closely. Such an approach makes CoreWeave valuable to the AI industry, but it can also leave it with unused capacity. Nvidia's move to claim that spare capacity should therefore provide CoreWeave with some degree of stability.
Knowing that, investors should note where CoreWeave stands financially. Its $58 billion market cap is a tiny fraction of Nvidia's $4.25 trillion size. Also, even though CoreWeave's revenue of $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 grew by 275% yearly, it still lost $605 million during that time. Such losses mean it will likely have to turn to capital markets to raise funds.
That need is even more acute because it pledged to spend between $20 billion and $23 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2025 alone. So it needs deals like the one with Nvidia so it can recoup its capex investments and eventually grow into a profitable operation.
Why Nvidia made this agreement
What may confuse investors is how the deal helps Nvidia. Even though Nvidia and CoreWeave are close partners, CoreWeave's business requires it to purchase Nvidia's latest AI accelerators. But investors may not understand why it chose to spend $6.3 billion to help this particular customer.
For one, Nvidia owns 24.3 million shares of CoreWeave as of June 30, about 5% of the outstanding shares. The agreement goes a long way toward solidifying Nvidia's investment and the relationship between the two companies.
Intense demand for AI has led to a shortage of cloud capacity, so this deal also gives Nvidia a claim over a scarce commodity. Thanks to this deal, Nvidia will have to rely less on large cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft, giving it more control over its destiny in this regard.
Furthermore, having CoreWeave in a more solid financial position means CoreWeave will more likely meet the aforementioned goals on capex spending. With that, it will spend more on Nvidia GPUs, helping to boost the size and expanse of the AI ecosystem over which it has considerable control.
What may look like charity to CoreWeave will likely serve Nvidia's interests in the end.
Does CoreWeave or Nvidia benefit more from the deal?
This deal will probably benefit both companies, although CoreWeave is likely to derive more benefit, at least from an investor perspective.
Nvidia may benefit more in an abstract sense, as it gains influence over the AI ecosystem. Nvidia's larger size also makes it a safer investment, a welcome relief to investors who feel uncomfortable buying into a money-losing company spending heavily on capex.
Still, the Nvidia deal offers a considerable boost to CoreWeave's top line. This makes it more likely that CoreWeave's massive spending will ultimately deliver positive returns for the company.
CoreWeave's much smaller size also means it can attain higher percentage growth from a much smaller base. The doubling of CoreWeave's value takes its market cap to $116 billion. The same percentage move would take Nvidia's market cap to $8.5 trillion, a challenging feat in a market that has yet to see a company with a $5 trillion market cap.
In the end, CoreWeave comes with higher risks than Nvidia. However, if you are willing to take a chance, CoreWeave offers greater potential for higher-percentage returns."

Two names that have attracted growing attention this year are Oracle and CoreWeave.
Unlike the tech titans that dominate headlines, Oracle and CoreWeave are carving out their niche at the infrastructure layer of the AI ecosystem. The opportunity they've identified is straightforward but also mission-critical: providing cloud-based access to GPUs. These chips -- designed primarily by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices -- remain supply constrained as they are largely absorbed by the world's largest companies.
This supply imbalance has created an opportunity to enable AI model development by offering GPUs as a service -- a business model that allows companies to rent chip capacity through cloud infrastructure. For businesses that cannot secure GPUs directly, infrastructure services are both time-saving and cost-efficient.
In the background, however, a small, albeit capable, company has been competing with Oracle and CoreWeave in the GPU-as-a-service landscape. Let's explore how Nebius Group (NBIS -1.73%) is disrupting incumbents and why now is an interesting time to take a look at the stock for your portfolio.
17.4 billion reasons to pay close attention to Nebius
Last week, Nebius announced a five-year, $17.4 billion infrastructure agreement with Microsoft. For reference, up until this point, Nebius' management had been guiding for $1.1 billion in run rate annual recurring revenue (ARR) by December. I point this out to underscore just how transformative this contract is in terms of scale and duration.
The Microsoft deal not only places Nebius firmly alongside peers like Oracle and CoreWeave in the AI infrastructure conversation, but it also serves as validation that its technology is robust enough to meet the standards of a hyperscaler.
For Microsoft, the partnership is equally strategic. With GPUs in chronically short supply and long lead times to expand data center capacity, this agreement allows Microsoft to secure adequate compute resources without stretching internal infrastructure or assuming the upfront capital expenditure (capex) budget and execution risks that come with it.
Why this deal matters for investors
AI investment is not a cyclical trend -- it's a structural shift. Enterprises are deploying applications into production at unprecedented speed, workloads are scaling rapidly, and new use cases in areas like robotics and autonomous systems are emerging.
For companies that supply the compute underpinning this increasingly complex ecosystem, these dynamics create durable secular tailwinds. By securing Microsoft as a flagship customer, Nebius has established itself within this foundational layer of the AI infrastructure economy.
Is Nebius stock a buy right now?
Since announcing its partnership with Microsoft, Nebius shares have surged roughly 39% as of this writing (Sept. 16). With that kind of momentum, it's natural to wonder whether the stock has become expensive. To answer that, it helps to put its valuation in context.
Prior to the Microsoft deal, Nebius was guiding for $1.1 billion in ARR by year-end. If I assume Microsoft's $17.4 billion commitment is evenly spread across five years (2026 to 2031), that adds about $3.5 billion annually -- bringing Nebius' pro forma ARR closer to $4.6 billion.
Against its current market cap of $21.3 billion, Nebius stock trades at an implied forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.6. On the surface, that looks meaningfully discounted to peers like Oracle and CoreWeave.
That said, there are important caveats to consider. My analysis assumes no customer attrition over the next several years -- this is unrealistic due to competitive pressures. While Nebius may continue winning large-scale contracts, it's also reasonable to expect some customer churn.
Moreover, comparing Nebius' future ARR to Oracle's and CoreWeave's current revenue base is not an apples-to-apples match. Oracle, for example, has reportedly inked a $300 billion cloud deal with OpenAI. Meanwhile, CoreWeave also has multiyear, multibillion-dollar commitments tied to OpenAI. The catch is that OpenAI itself doesn't have the cash on its balance sheet to fully fund these agreements -- leaving questions about their viability.
In short, Nebius appears attractively valued relative to its peers -- but the landscape is evolving quickly and riddled with moving parts. The more important takeaway is that Nebius is now winning significant business alongside its brand-name peers.
In my eyes, this validation in combination with ongoing structural demand tailwinds makes Nebius a compelling buy and hold opportunity as the AI infrastructure narrative continues to unfold."

The Financial Post explores those stories and more in The Week in Stocks.
Stock of the Week: Intel Corp.
Shares of Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC) surged as much as 30 per cent this week, with most of the gains coming on Thursday after Nvidia Corp. announced it would purchase US$5-billion worth of the beleaguered computer components producer and chipmaker’s shares. Nvidia also said it would jointly develop a data centre and other projects with Intel. The move comes weeks after the United States government took a 10 per cent stake in the company as it looks to boost semiconductor manufacturing at home. But analysts at TD Cowen think the deal represents a way for Nvidia to get the U.S. administration to unlock chip licences for the Chinese market. “We view today’s news of Nvidia meaningfully supporting a top Trump priority — reviving Intel — as a potentially significant step toward Nvidia winning over the MAGA transactional advisers and gaining Blackwell licences for China,” Paul Gallant said in a note. Blackwell is the name of a type of Nvidia chip. As for Intel’s shares, several major investing houses hiked their price targets, including Roth Capital Partners LLC, which lifted its target to US$30 from US$22, while Cantor Fitzgerald LP increased its price target for the shares to US$36 from US$26. Shares were trading Friday around the US$30 level.
Buy on the dips in the U.S. and believe in Canada, says BMO
“Canadian equities remain well-positioned to keep pace with the U.S. … period,” BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski said in a research paper updating the bank’s best investment ideas strategy. Canadian stocks are at the tail end of an earnings recovery that started in mid-2024, with profitability normalizing and growth now expected to reach double digits. “Despite narrowing valuation divergence of Canada versus the U.S., we continue to believe the Canadian small-cap universe is undervalued, underinvested and ripe with growth opportunities, even relative to their large-cap peers,” he said. With markets in the U.S. and Canada hitting fresh highs, worries about stocks being overpriced compared with earnings have especially dogged U.S. markets. However, Belski thinks the Wall Street bull market will continue to charge ahead and recommends investors “stay the course and use any potential periods of market weakness as a buying opportunity.” He also said U.S. stock gains are spread more broadly beyond the Magnificent Seven, whereas previous gains had been more concentrated. Belski believes there are opportunities for investors in the small- and medium-cap names. BMO analysts added new names across several sectors, from energy and health care to real estate and utilities.

Much like Cathie Wood's long-standing conviction in Tesla, Kindig has consistently expressed unwavering enthusiasm for semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%).
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Kindig sparked debate after revealing her forecast that Nvidia could reach a $6 trillion market cap by the end of next calendar year -- implying roughly 43% upside from its current levels.
Below, I'll outline the logic behind Kindig's projection and then examine the key drivers that, in my view, lend credibility to her thesis.
What would it take for Nvidia to reach a $6 trillion valuation?
The vast majority of Nvidia's revenue is driven by its data center segment. In the second fiscal quarter (ended July 27), Nvidia reported $41.1 billion in data center sales -- a 56% increase year over year. This translates to an annualized run rate of roughly $160 billion.
Kindig argues that the probability of Nvidia reaching $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue by year end -- or a $200 billion annual run rate -- is ""very high,"" given the company is still in the early stages of scaling its next-generation Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPU architectures.
She further contends that Wall Street is underestimating capital expenditure (capex) trends across AI hyperscalers. In her estimation, analysts are not fully modeling the scale of demand for Nvidia's GPUs.
Kindig's math suggests that surging investment in infrastructure could push Nvidia's data center operation to $75 billion in quarterly sales ($300 billion annual run rate) by the end of next year -- implying 50% growth compared to her 2025 year-end figures.
Of course, understanding the arithmetic is just one piece of the story. The larger question is why I share Kindig's bullish stance -- and what's truly at stake for Nvidia as AI infrastructure spending accelerates.
What are the pillars supporting Nvidia's data center growth?
At the core of Kindig's thesis is hyperscaler capex spending. The world's largest cloud providers -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- are committing unprecedented sums to expand compute power, setting the stage for the next phase of the AI era.
The rationale is straightforward: As AI workloads grow and new applications emerge, both training and inference require increasingly sophisticated infrastructure. With hyperscalers doubling down on budgets, Nvidia is positioned to be the primary beneficiary as its GPUs remain the backbone of these AI services.
Consider robotics as an example. Companies like Amazon and Tesla are investing in systems that can navigate warehouse operations with human-grade precision. Training physical systems to interpret and engage with real-world environments is far more complex than the reactive large language models (LLMs) that power today's chatbots. Such advancements require massive GPU clusters -- precisely the systems Nvidia delivers.
Autonomous systems in transportation, manufacturing, and defense follow a similar trajectory. Moving from proof-of-concept to commercial deployment will drive an exponential increase in demand for compute. Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and its successors are designed for this leap -- combining efficiency with processing power that makes Nvidia an indispensable supplier for enterprises building mission-critical workflows.
At the same time, cloud infrastructure is undergoing its own major transformation. A new wave of GPU-as-a-service agreements is gaining momentum, with companies renting access to GPU capacity through providers such as Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nebius Group.
This model creates a multiplier effect for Nvidia whereby the company is not only supplying GPUs to the hyperscalers, but it's also partnering with specialized cloud operators that lease its hardware downstream. As businesses increasingly adopt multi-platform cloud strategies, they distribute workloads across several providers. In turn, this expands Nvidia's footprint in the swiftly evolving AI hardware ecosystem.
Is Nvidia stock a buy now?
Taken together, these catalysts create powerful secular tailwinds supporting Nvidia's long-term growth. The company's expanding data center business is not merely a byproduct of hyperscaler infrastructure investment; rather, it is the inevitable outcome of structural shifts driving the next generation of AI applications.
At a high level, the precise timing of a $6 trillion valuation is less important than the underlying trend: Nvidia is well-positioned to remain the dominant force in AI infrastructure. Against this backdrop, I think the stock offers meaningful alpha potential and makes for a compelling long-term position."

Both the US and China have indicated that more work needs to be done to iron out final differences on a proposal for Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. to divest its majority stake in the video-sharing platform in the US. In a statement earlier Friday, China’s foreign ministry stopped short of saying that Beijing had given its final blessing and urged fair treatment of Chinese interests.
“China’s position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to a solution that complies with China’s laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides,” the ministry said in a translation provided by the embassy in Washington. “The U.S. side needs to provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors.”
The call between Trump and Xi came days after US and Chinese negotiators announced a framework deal for ByteDance to sell its US-based TikTok operations to an American buyers group. Officials from both sides have offered few details on the tentative accord, aimed at keeping the app running in the US and avoid a ban on national security grounds under a law signed in 2024 by then-President Joe Biden.
Trump has floated the idea of the US receiving what he described on Thursday as “a ‘fee plus’ for just making the deal.” Details of that fee structure, including the percentage the government might take, remained unclear. On Friday, the president declined to say whether the US would get a seat on the board of the new US venture.
Bloomberg has previously reported that a group of American buyers including Oracle Corp., Andreessen Horowitz and private equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC would take control of a new US version of the app. It’s unclear whether ByteDance or the new US-based venture would control TikTok’s lucrative recommendation software — a key sticking point for China, which has balked at the transfer of what it considers critical technology."
finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-19T22:18:00,"Did Elon Musk Just Say ""Checkmate"" to Nvidia?",Tesla's CEO recently made a bold statement about the company's progress on designing its own artificial intelligence chips.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=36f3efd480c6f5caabee21616c263f594a41c83a4cf3b49191ee5057e99270d2,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/did-elon-musk-just-say-checkmate-to-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/did-elon-musk-just-say-checkmate-to-nvidia/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/did-elon-musk-just-say-checkmate-to-nvidia/,fool.com,200,,"Few figures in the business world command attention quite like Elon Musk. Known for his ability to shape narratives and capture Wall Street's attention, he has once again grabbed the spotlight -- this time with comments about Tesla's (TSLA 1.39%) ambitions to design its own artificial intelligence (AI) chips.
Just had a great design review today with the Tesla AI5 chip design team! This is going to be an epic chip.
-- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 6, 2025
And AI6 to follow has a shot at being the best by AI chip by far.
Switching from doing 2 chip architectures to 1 means all our silicon talent is focused on making 1...
Tesla's efforts to move into custom silicon could be significant for the company's next-generation products -- but what might they mean for semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia?
What is the AI5 chip, and why does it matter?
AI5 -- and its successor AI6 -- are simply Tesla's internal codenames for its next generation of custom chips. While Musk's comments may fuel a debate over which company is designing the most advanced silicon, investors should look past the surface-level narrative. His underlying message points to something larger: Tesla is pursuing deeper vertical integration of its technology stack.
The rationale is straightforward. By consolidating its high-end computing onto a single family of purpose-built chips, Tesla gains greater control over both performance and cost -- and can streamline engineering cycles and accelerate product development. From a financial perspective, this strategy also has the potential to improve unit economics by reducing supply chain risk and expanding profit margins over time.
How do these investments impact Tesla's AI ambitions?
Tesla's AI ambitions can be divided into two categories: self-driving cars and humanoid robotics. While these markets target different end users, the unifying theme is autonomy.
Importantly, autonomy will not be achieved as a singular breakthrough -- it will be the product of constant iteration. Both Tesla's robotaxis and its Optimus robots rely on taking in fresh real-world data and using machine learning loops to steadily become ""smarter"" and more capable over time.
Is this a checkmate move against Nvidia?
Given the context above, it's critical to note that Nvidia remains the leader in powering the training side of AI workloads. Tesla may have bold ambitions in custom silicon design, but the key question for investors is whether its efforts could truly disrupt Nvidia's dominance in the data center landscape.
At present, I see that as highly unlikely. Nvidia's entrenched position -- anchored not only by its hardware but also by its widely used CUDA computing platform -- gives the company broad ecosystem advantages. Coupled with its rapid pace of product development -- it rolled out its Blackwell Ultra GPUs earlier in this quarter, and will launch its next-gen Rubin GPUs in 2026 -- these factors make it difficult for any competitor to materially erode Nvidia's lead in AI infrastructure at this time.
Nvidia's dominance is not solely a function of its chips. Rather, the company's comprehensive hardware-software stack creates immense friction for enterprises considering moving some of their business to rival platforms. This creates a formidable technological moat and durable competitive advantage for Nvidia.
With this in mind, the broader takeaway is that Nvidia's flywheel is unlikely to come to a sudden halt simply because one company is choosing to become more self-reliant. While Tesla may eventually compete with Nvidia in the autonomous vehicle chip market, it is quite likely to remain a complementary player -- or even an Nvidia customer -- when it comes to AI training protocols.
Against this backdrop, Tesla's progress in developing its own infrastructure is notable, but those efforts are still in their early stages. All the while, Nvidia continues to roll out improved successor architectures to its already industry-leading GPUs.
The bottom line is that while Tesla may find ways to meet some of its chip needs in-house over time, it is still far from achieving a checkmate position against the AI chip leader."

- Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in Intel this week, raising worries Arm and Advanced Micro Devices could face stiffer competition.
- However, some Wall Street analysts indicated the tie-up could have less of an impact on Arm and AMD than a slide in their shares would suggest.

Some investors reacted strongly—and quickly—to Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel, fearing stiffer competition for Arm and Advanced Micro Devices. Those initial worries appear to have subsided, but questions about how much to read into the deal remain.
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) design partner Arm (ARM) slipped 7% in the wake of yesterday's deal, which included a plan for Intel and Nvidia to co-develop AI chips. AMD (AMD) shed nearly 6% before recouping most of those losses. Some Wall Street analysts indicated the tie-up would have less of an impact than the initial moves would suggest.
Bank of America analysts on Friday said they see “limited near-term impact” for AMD and ARM because of the tie-up. They maintained ""buy"" ratings for both companies' shares, and pointed to potential upside for companies that sell chipmaking equipment or software used in the design process. Shares of firms in those businesses, including ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Lam Research (LRCX), have gained since yesterday's announcement.
The impact on AMD could be “less impactful than we might have thought at first blush,” Bernstein analysts wrote, saying they see sentiment for manufacturing equipment makers like ASML getting a boost.
One open question for investors: whether the Intel-Nvidia tie-up might mean more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other companies. The deal announced Thursday did not include foundry commitments.
Bernstein said Nvidia’s moves could indicate a preference for its existing manufacturing partners like TSMC (TSM)—as well as a desire to buy goodwill from the U.S. government, which now holds a 10% stake in Intel, without a deeper commitment.
“Both companies went out of their way to sing TSMC’s praises (which makes sense as neither can afford to alienate their most important supplier at this point),” Bernstein analysts said, noting that even if Nvidia moved forward with an Intel manufacturing deal, it would still continue to work with TSMC, likely not making much of a dent in that company's business.
Nvidia ""is already undoubtedly ‘engaging’ with Intel to at least evaluate their foundry prospects as, presumably, are many others,"" Bernstein wrote. ""Everyone wants to be able to have Intel as a second source."""

Wayve, the U.K.-based self-driving tech startup, could be one of those to receive funds from Nvidia’s AI investment commitment, the company told TechCrunch.
Wayve said it has signed a letter of intent with Nvidia to evaluate a $500 million strategic investment in the U.K. startup’s next funding round. Nvidia participated in Wayve’s $1.05 billion Series C round that closed in May 2024.
A Wayve spokesperson confirmed that the $500 million tentative commitment is part of Nvidia’s AI startup investment pledge.
Nvidia said during an event Thursday the £2 billion commitment would include funds from venture-capital investors Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton, Hoxton Ventures, and Phoenix Court. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the letter of intent announcement.
Wayve co-founder and CEO Alex Kendall wouldn’t provide TechCrunch with a projected closing date for its Series D round. Kendall did say the company was “working quickly towards it.”
Wayve, which launched in 2017, has gained attention and investors for its automated driving system that uses a self-learning versus rules-based approach to its self-driving software. Wayve’s end-to-end neural network doesn’t require high-definition maps and only uses data to teach the vehicle how to drive. That data-driven learning approach is used for “eyes on” assisted driving and an “eyes off” fully automated driving system.
The company plans to sell its “Embodied AI” to automakers and other tech companies.
Wayve’s self-learning approach, which is similar to the strategy that Tesla uses, is seen as particularly appealing to automakers because it’s not reliant on specific sensors or maps. This means Wayve’s system can work with existing sensors like cameras and radar. The automated driving software captures data from those sensors, which directly informs the driving decisions of the system.
And while Wayve’s software can run on whatever chip its OEM partners already have in their vehicles, the startup has had a close development relationship with Nvidia since 2018.
Wayve’s generation 2 self-driving platform, which is integrated into its Ford Mach E test vehicles, uses Nvidia GPUs. This week, the startup unveiled gen 3, a platform that uses the in-vehicle compute autonomous vehicle development kit called Nvidia Drive AGX Thor. The gen 3 will allow Wayve to offer eyes-off advanced driving-assistance systems and Level 4 driverless features that will work on city streets and highways."

The next step is for the government to arrange for Intel to go private.
Without the pressure of delivering quarterly earnings for the stockholders of today, a private Intel could divide itself into parts that no longer make sense to be conjoined. One new company should focus on manufacturing chips for all global firms with the goal of matching or exceeding performance levels that only TSMC can provide today. The other should commit to designing chips. These are two separate objective functions, markets, and missions. Ultimately, Intel should also sell its controlling stake in the autonomous driving firm, Mobileye, as well as the company’s venture capital arm. The strategic goal is to disaggregate the conglomerate that may have served Intel well in the past but no longer meets the country’s need for an American foundry nor delivers the most value for shareholders.
It is well understood that most conglomerates suffer from the so-called conglomerate discount. General Electric, once an icon of American industry, recognized that breaking itself up would make its constituent pieces more valuable and competitive in one of the most salient recent examples that demonstrates the sum of the parts can be greater than the whole.
Intel’s business model of vertical integration between design and manufacturing gave Intel tremendous market power when it was the world leader in both markets. That’s the past. Trying to recreate it, as some of Intel’s recent CEOs have done, is doomed.
Here’s the plan that seems right to us, admittedly from the perspective of outsiders who left Intel’s board some time ago.
First, the government, with support from a consortium of America’s world-leading design firms, should buy all of Intel’s public stock. Nvidia’s $5 billion investment and the subsequent surge in Intel’s stock price suggest that the capital markets would welcome such a move. Some combination of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Google — the best and biggest product design firms on the planet — could easily afford it.
The creation of a successful foundry, drawn from Intel’s manufacturing assets and separated from the design businesses, would be a big win for the Trump administration. It would be even bigger win for the big semiconductor design firms that are otherwise totally dependent on TSMC."

This morning, Citigroup downgraded Intel stock to sell. Intel stock was down 3.3% through 2:25 p.m. ET in response.
Citi's the odd one out
It's worth noting that Citi seems pretty lonely in its pessimism. According to data from The Fly, at least four separate investment banks have raised their price targets on Intel since news of the Nvidia investment appeared. One banker, Benchmark, even upgraded Intel stock on the news, and set a $43 price target.
But not Citigroup.
While reluctantly raising its price target in tandem with the rising stock price, Citi complains that ""investors expect that a foundry deal is upcoming,"" but Intel's foundry business ""has a minimal chance of succeeding,"" reports The Fly.
Is Intel stock a sell?
Foundry worries lie at the heart of Citi's decision to downgrade Intel stock and, I must admit, Nvidia does have its work cut out for it if it hopes to help turn around the fortunes of its rival.
According to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, Intel's foundry business did only $17.5 billion in revenue last year, and foundry revenue has been falling for the last two years. The foundry unit also lost $8 billion in 2024 -- meaning for every $1 worth of chips Intel makes on contract for a customer, the company loses about $0.46.
It's Intel's biggest money loser by far -- and the biggest problem Nvidia must help solve."

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 3.7% in the afternoon session after a downgrade from Citigroup analysts cast doubt on the chipmaker's valuation following a massive rally.
The stock retreated after soaring nearly 23% in the previous session on surprising news that rival Nvidia planned to invest $5 billion in the company and collaborate on new chips. Despite the positive momentum, Citigroup shifted its rating to 'Sell' from 'Neutral.' The bank's analysts argued that Intel's stock price already reflected success in its chip manufacturing business, which they believed had a ""minimal chance to succeed"" against established competitors. This bearish view contrasted sharply with Benchmark analysts, who upgraded Intel to 'Buy' on the same day, highlighting a divided view on Wall Street.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 33 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 26.6% on the news that Nvidia announced a landmark $5 billion investment in the company and a strategic pact to jointly develop new chips.
The groundbreaking deal united two of Silicon Valley's longest-running competitors to create processors for personal computers and data centers. This collaboration was seen as a potential lifeline for Intel, which had been battling declining market share. Under the agreement, Intel will build custom processing units that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure. The move sent shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, as it posed a potential risk to competitors.
For instance, TSMC, which currently manufactured Nvidia's flagship processors, could see that business shift to Intel in the future. Likewise, rival AMD, which competes with Intel in the data center market, saw its shares drop on concerns about the new competitive challenge.
Intel is up 46.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $29.60 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $30.57 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $595.23.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.4% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains, adding about 0.7%, as Apple (AAPL) stock rallied on optimism over its new iPhones hitting store shelves.
All three major indexes hit all-time highs for a second session in a row, ending the week on an upbeat note as the dust settled on the Federal Reserve's return to interest rate cuts. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq cinched their third straight weekly gains, adding 1.2% and 2.2%, respectively. The Dow climbed 1%, marking its second consecutive weekly gain.
Save for Nvidia (NVDA), the Mag 7 tech stocks all posted gains for the five trading sessions through Friday, led by Tesla (TSLA). Tesla ended the week up nearly 8%, while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) added around 6% and Apple jumped almost 5%.
Investors on Friday were focused on details from Trump's conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The US president said in a post on Truth Social following the talks, ""We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal.""
The details of the TikTok deal — which would allow the social media app owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance to continue US operations amid an impending ban — are not yet clear. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the agreement would involve a consortium of investors including Oracle (ORCL), Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz taking an 80% stake in the company.
Notably, a summary of Trump and Xi's talk in Chinese state media did not provide a detailed update on a TikTok deal beyond saying that Xi supported a commercial solution to the problem and that he wanted a set of rules that would allow Chinese companies to invest in the US.
The writeup from China also said that the US should avoid new restrictive trade measures to avoid ""undermining"" recent trade talks.

It's up 1,300% over the past five years, and it doesn't look like it's anywhere near done.
Its growth prospects are up for debate amid increasing competition and its sheer size, which makes it harder to report high percentage growth. Still, there are many reasons to believe in Nvidia's future. Here's one reason investors still have time to buy Nvidia stock.
Hyperscalers are spending
There are several ways to envision Nvidia's opportunity, and one of them is to analyze how its largest clients are spending money on its products.
Nvidia works with the largest cloud operators in the world, the hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. These companies are building out their large language models (LLM) and offering top artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to their millions of customers, who in turn are using these platforms to create the next generation of generative AI apps.
This is the AI revolution that's changing how people do business, shop, pay, and more, and these hyperscalers need Nvidia's powerful chips to drive their AI models.
Just take a look at how much these three companies are spending this year on capital expenditures, and you can see how Nvidia's business is going to be a crucial part of this process for the foreseeable future. Amazon is spending at a run rate of $120 billion, Microsoft at $100 billion, and Meta at about $65 billion. These are accelerations from last year, and as companies require more power, those numbers are likely to keep going up. Nvidia doesn't collect every dollar of these sales, but it dominates this market.
I wouldn't bet on Nvidia offering the same kind of growth it has in the past over the next five years, but it's still likely to beat the market and offer value for shareholders."

China's soybean strategy has re-emerged as a pressure point in its trade relationship with the US. For the first time since at least 1999, Beijing has held back from purchasing any American soybeans at the start of the export season, according to USDA data. This move echoes the tactics seen during the first trade war under President Donald Trump, when agriculture was deployed as leverage. Last year, US soybeans accounted for more than $12 billion of China's imports, representing a significant share of American farmers' export earnings. The absence of fresh Chinese demand this September has left growers facing a glut of supply and prices near multi-year lows.
Analysts suggest this could be part of a well-planned strategy. China's crushers and feed producers, who rely heavily on soymeal and soyoil, have already secured ample stocks from Brazil, in some cases doubling inventories. This gives Beijing breathing room to avoid US purchases until at least early 2026. The approach aligns with its broader effort to diversify away from American commodities, with imports of corn, wheat, and sorghum also reduced. At the same time, Beijing has increased pressure on US firms by launching an antitrust probe into Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), while making small conciliatory gestures such as resuming US oil imports and shelving an investigation into Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android. Market watchers note that soybean futures in Chicago have been volatile, reflecting the uncertainty over whether Beijing could step back into the market.
For the Trump administration, the pressure from America's farm belt is intensifying. Growers, a politically critical bloc, have warned that tariffs could push them toward a financial precipice, urging Washington to secure concessions from Beijing. Trump has publicly called for China to ramp up orders, with agriculture expected to dominate the trade agenda in the weeks ahead. While near-term breakthroughs may be unlikely, the prospect of a larger face-to-face negotiation later this year leaves investors watching closely. Any eventual deal could reshape the trajectory of soybean flows, but for now, the market is adjusting to a reality where China is willing to pay premiums elsewhere to keep the US on edge."

Shares of memory chips maker Micron (NYSE:MU) fell 4.9% in the morning session after reports surfaced that competitor Samsung had its high-bandwidth memory (HBM3E) qualified by key customer NVIDIA, sparking concerns about increased competition and potential pricing pressure.
A research note from Wells Fargo highlighted the development, which was detailed in a Korean Electronic Daily report, calling it an ""incremental negative for HBM pricing."" High-Bandwidth Memory is a critical component for the powerful chips used in artificial intelligence (AI). The news hit a nerve as other reports suggested Micron may be struggling to meet NVIDIA's stricter standards for the next generation of memory, HBM4, a situation from which Samsung could benefit.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Micron’s shares are very volatile and have had 27 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 5.4% on the news that a flurry of Wall Street analysts raised their price targets, citing immense demand for the company's high-performance memory chips used in artificial intelligence.
Multiple research firms showcased their confidence in Micron's trajectory. Wolfe Research boosted its price target to $180, while UBS and Mizuho set even higher targets of $185 and $182, respectively. Analysts from Rosenblatt, Susquehanna, and Deutsche Bank also echoed this bullish sentiment, raising their own targets and maintaining positive ratings.
The core reason for this optimism revolved around the surging demand for AI infrastructure. Micron stood as a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for top-tier platforms like Nvidia's Blackwell GB200. This high-performance memory is essential for running large-scale AI applications. Demand was so robust that Micron's HBM production for 2025 was already sold out, with a strong outlook extending into 2026.
Micron is up 85.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $162.19 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $168.89 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Micron’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,300.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

In a note to clients, Bank of America called the deal, which includes Nvidia’s $5 billion equity investment in Intel and plans to co-develop CPUs and PC processors, a “historic deal” with a potential $25 billion to $50 billion annual opportunity over time.
The bank noted Nvidia will integrate custom Intel x86 server CPUs into its rack architecture, previously reserved for its in-house Arm chips, while Intel intends to create “x86 RTX SoCs” combining CPU and GPU components for the laptop market.
Still, BofA warned that “collaborations can take years to deliver” and pointed to continued concerns about Intel’s lack of foundry customers.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said the immediate impact was more muted, describing it as a “positive development overall” for Intel, but with “benefits at the margin.”
For Nvidia, extending NVLink to x86 systems “extends the moat,” though the bank questioned why the move required a $5 billion outlay, adding: “investment implications are not clear.”
Bernstein was more skeptical, saying Intel “will build Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs” but stressed the arrangement does not involve Intel Foundry. The firm said that without a foundry deal, the $5 billion is “just ‘money’,” reflecting Nvidia’s reluctance to shift manufacturing away from TSMC.
Bernstein added the move could reduce TSMC’s revenue by 1% to 2% if it replaces Nvidia’s Grace CPUs, but said Nvidia’s preference for TSMC remains intact despite U.S. government pressure.
Finally, Citi analysts were more downbeat, downgrading Intel to Sell, stating they expect “minimal improvement for Intel as better graphics won’t make Intel’s CPU better than AMD’s, given the processor is the main performance driver.”
“We downgrade Intel from Neutral to Sell given our belief the stock is pricing in success in its leading-edge foundry business, which we believe has minimal chance to succeed,” added Citi.

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-19T14:56:46,Why Nvidia's $5 Billion Stake in Intel Could Extend Its Dominance in AI Chips,Nvidia is now partnering with Intel to co-develop PC and data center chips.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9cb6c8ab16dcf9210f39812bb524738aab7cf1833bb170f1e575d47bc4a511ab,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/why-nvidias-5-billion-stake-in-intel-could-extend/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/why-nvidias-5-billion-stake-in-intel-could-extend/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/why-nvidias-5-billion-stake-in-intel-could-extend/,fool.com,200,,"Last month, the U.S. government formally took a 10% stake in Intel (INTC 4.24%). This month, Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) is joining the fray, taking a roughly 4% stake in the company following a $5 billion investment.
The deal surprised many investors given Nvidia has amassed such a dominant lead in key growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI). And notably, the $5 billion price tag is relative chump change for Nvidia. That figure represents just 0.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. But when you dig deeper, the partnership between Intel and Nvidia makes a lot of sense. In fact, there are two promising reasons the deal could help solidify Nvidia's leading market share for AI chips.
The details of the Nvidia and Intel partnership are revealing
Let's take a direct look at the details of this partnership, beginning with some comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to understand what exactly is going on.
""This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem -- a fusion of two world-class platforms,"" Huang said in a news release. ""Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.""
While there is some technical jargon in these comments, they get to the heart of what this partnership is all about. Nvidia has had a heavy lead in AI chips for years. Many estimates peg the company with a 90% market share in this category. Intel, meanwhile, still holds a heavy lead in CPU market share. Its chips in that category control around 60% of the market. Around 50% of desktops run on Intel chips, plus 73% of laptops and 76% of servers. It is this server market share that Nvidia is most interested in.
Since 2021, Intel stock lost around 50% of its value. Nvidia shares, meanwhile, gained more than 1,000%. Why such a difference in performance if both companies have high market shares in their respective categories? According to the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, ""The success of modern AI techniques relies on computation on a scale unimaginable even a few years ago."" The AI chips of today, the center adds, ""are tens or even thousands of times faster and more efficient than CPUs for training and inference of AI algorithms.""
The AI market is expected to grow by 30% or more per year for decades to come. With early investment, Nvidia was able to dominate this huge growth market, which demands parallel processors designed to run thousands of simultaneous operations over more general-purpose processors that Intel produces.
Still, the AI industry requires both AI-focused GPU and CPU chips to function. CPU chips can excel in low-latency tasks where efficiency is a priority. And data centers around the world leverage both CPUs and GPUs to operate.
The partnership between Intel and Nvidia essentially commits Intel to build custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms. It also requires Nvidia to integrate its GPUs more directly into Intel's client PCs. The result is a mutually embedded ecosystem that can improve the performance and efficiency of both companies' products. It's why Huang described the partnership as a ""fusion of two world-class platforms"" that will help both companies expand their ecosystems.
Both Intel and Nvidia come out as winners
This partnership ensures two things.
First, Nvidia will now have a tighter grip on its hardware stack. As the company proved with its CUDA developer platform, Nvidia is very skilled at integrating various components to maximize performance and vendor lock-in. More control over the CPU side of the stack gives Nvidia even more ability to advance its tech stack in ways that competitors can't match -- at least for now.
Intel, meanwhile, will now be able to integrate Nvidia's leading AI capabilities in ways its competitors will find difficult to match. CPUs are already being designed with dedicated AI cores, and the combination of Intel's and Nvidia's technology should make Intel's chips more appealing to its end markets, especially data centers looking to add more Nvidia chips. Intel CPUs now become the clear complementary solution.
Nvidia's $5 billion investment isn't the key mover in this story. Instead, it's the intertwining of each company's tech stack that will provide the most long-term benefits."

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein commented about Broadcom’s potential deal with OpenAI a few weeks back during a program on CNBC. Rasgon said AVGO’s revenue ramp reminds him of Nvidia.
“You know it’s been speculated that it’s OpenAI. It’s plausible. Whoever this is is moving very, very quickly seems to sort of fit with their persona,” the analyst said. “Now this is really important. You have to remember Broadcom had three customers that were shipping these AI chips. It was Google and Meta and ByteDance. They had four others that were prospects. So one of those prospects this one is now converted into a customer. And it is a tremendous amount of revenue. They said $10 billion next year, which is a very fast ramp relative to anything we’ve seen before. And they’re I mean, they’re implicitly guiding, you know, effectively their AI revenues next year. Well over $40 billion. It was like $30 billion as of last quarter. And I don’t know that it stops in 26 either. They sounded fairly positive that it would continue into the years beyond. And so, you know, if it starts to remind me a little bit of the revenue ramp we started to see for Nvidia, like, like several years ago when this really started to kick off.”
For the fiscal fourth quarter, AVGO expects $6.2 billion in AI revenue, up 66% from a year earlier. The company said it secured $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer. Many analysts believe this customer is OpenAI. Some media reports said the two companies co-designed a chip that will be launched next year.
What’s Broadcom’s moat? It makes ASIC, chips designed for specific applications and tasks. As major companies look for custom chips to break Nvidia monopoly and lower costs, Broadcom is positioned well to thrive. Many top AI spenders are teaming up with Broadcom to develop these chips, which are expected to be high-margin, high-volume products, potentially driving substantial growth in both revenue and profits.
Renaissance Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was the largest contributor to our portfolio performance in the second quarter after reporting strong operating results and guidance. The stock benefited from continued invest tor enthusiasm for high growth momentum stocks, as well as from companies with exposure to artificial intelligence. Importantly, Broadcom has been growing its hyperscale and connectivity product portfolios, resulting in increasing revenue exposure to faster growing artificial intelligence applications and offsetting a slowdown in its legacy semiconductor business.”"

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Jeff Kilburg from KKM Financial said in a program on CNBC late July that he was selling Nvidia shares and buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The analyst at the time said there was an opportunity for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to reach $230 if the company could show something “tangible” related to AI. While the iPhone maker is yet to make a dent with its AI plans, the stock was trading at around $238 as of September 18, having gained about 4% over the past 30 days. Here is what the analyst had said about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL):
“They have to say something. They have to capture AI somehow someway. They’re not a hyperscaler, so they don’t need to spend the money, but they need to deliver something to provide some optimism. We’re seeing Apple down about 17% from its all-time high. So, there’s an opportunity for Apple to run back up to 230, but it has to be tangible. We need something AI. It’s not cheap. Apple’s not cheap here. Correct. It’s not. But I think if you look at the MAG 7, look at the MAG 7, it’s a 62% market cap concentration of the NASDAQ 100. It’s about 35% as a collective MAG 7 in the S&P 500. So Apple being the laggard, we have to remember, Melissa, that Apple, I know, has had a rough year, but the last couple years it has been producing. It’s been the cash cow. And it would be interesting to see if they make some type of purchase potentially in AI. It’d be the biggest purchase since Beats was just three billion.”

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has written a $900 million check to bring Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and a big slice of his team on board, while also locking down the startup's technology, CNBC reported. The cash-and-stock deal quietly wrapped up last week.
Enfabrica isn't just another small chip startup. Launched in 2019, its tech can knit together more than 100,000 GPUs so they behave like one massive computer. That's exactly the kind of system Nvidia needs as AI models get bigger and hungrier for compute power. Nvidia was already an early believer, joining Enfabrica's $125 million Series B in 2023. By the time the firm raised another $115 million later that year, PitchBook said it was valued at around $600 million.
Big Tech rivals are playing the same game. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have all struck deals to scoop up AI founders and their intellectual property. Nvidia's move shows it's not content to just be the chip supplierit wants to shape how those chips are used at scale.
For investors, this deal is another sign Nvidia is building an AI empire, not just selling GPUs. The question now is how fast Enfabrica's tech shows up inside Nvidia's next-gen systems."

The brokerage raised its price target to $43, or nearly 32 times estimated 2027 earnings, even after Intel shares rallied 53% so far this year, including a 23% surge on Thursday when the deal was announced.
Nvidia and Intel said they will jointly develop data center and PC products that combine Intel’s x86 CPUs with Nvidia’s GPUs.
The companies estimate the collaboration could address as much as $50 billion in annual market opportunity. As part of the deal, Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel at $23.28 a share.
Benchmark called the agreement a strong vote of confidence in Intel’s x86 roadmap, which has been steadily losing share to rival AMD and more recently to Arm-based designs.
Pairing Intel CPUs with Nvidia’s dominant AI accelerators could strengthen its server position and boost its prospects in the notebook market, where its own graphics offerings have trailed competitors.
The brokerage also said Nvidia may eventually become Intel’s first major foundry customer if its 14A process technology proves competitive, a move that would mark the most significant near-term catalyst for Intel’s shares.
“While we expect near-term volatility following yesterday’s strong move, we recommend fundamental investors use any share price weakness as an opportunity to build long-term positions,” Benchmark analysts said.
AMD is seen as the near-term loser from the agreement, though Benchmark noted Intel is unlikely to ship co-developed parts with Nvidia until 2027, leaving AMD in a strong position until then.

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-19T14:30:00,Prediction: This AI Growth Stock Will Become Europe's First $1 Trillion Company by 2035,"Even near a 52-week high, ASML has plenty of room to run for patient investors.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=2b7bde98783357de6cea9864dd5240c863df836525404dbfedb822bdd9b0168d,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/19/ai-growth-stock-asml-1-trillion-market-cap-2035/,fool.com,200,,"On Sept. 15, Alphabet joined Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple as the fourth U.S. company to surpass $3 trillion in market capitalization. But turn your attention across the pond, and there is not a single European company that is worth over $1 trillion, or even half that amount.
Here's why Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML 2.69%) is the best-positioned company to surpass $1 trillion in market cap within the next decade.
Why leading European companies are much smaller than top U.S. companies
The European stock market is highly fragmented. Instead of being viewed as European Union companies, Siemens is a German company, Novo Nordisk is a Danish company, and Shell is a British company. It would be like if U.S. investors viewed Oracle and Tesla as Texas companies versus Microsoft and Amazon as Washington companies.
There are also different regulations in Europe and more conservative pension and funding rules. Companies tend to be more specialized, although there are some conglomerates, like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, that united French luxury brands in the 1980s.
Most importantly, European stock markets simply haven't benefited from technology as much as the U.S. Many of Europe's largest companies aren't tech enterprises. In contrast, the U.S. stock market is dominated by tech-focused companies like the ""Ten Titans"" that continue to make up a larger share of the S&P 500. The U.S. is the tech capital of the world, and the tech sector makes up around a third of the S&P 500 -- illustrating its importance in the U.S. market.
ASML is an anchor in the AI industry
ASML popped 6.5% on Monday after a sell-side analyst who had been neutral on the stock upgraded it to a buy. The move pushed ASML's market cap to $341 billion -- making it the most valuable European company, even ahead of LVMH. To reach $1 trillion in 10 years, ASML would need a compound annual growth rate of 11.4% -- which seems reasonable for a cutting-edge technology company that heavily benefits from artificial intelligence (AI).
There's no contest that ASML is my top AI stock to buy now and hold for the long term. Holding a stock for years or even decades takes a lot of conviction. For ASML, the essential ingredient in the investment thesis recipe is its monopoly over the most complex part of the semiconductor manufacturing process. ASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems use lenses to print features on microchips.
There are plenty of companies that make DUV machines, including Nikon and Canon, which specialize in camera lenses. However, what sets ASML apart is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines. These machines use mirrors to reflect light because EUV light has a wavelength of just 13.5 nanometers (almost X-ray range), which is too small to pass through glass. At a wavelength that small, a glass lens would absorb the light instead of bending/refracting it.
Achieving such a small wavelength unlocks untold efficiency improvements, allowing ASML's machines to pack more transitions per chip by printing more precise features (narrower lines, smaller spacing, etc.). It's an incredible engineering feat, and one that is driving advancements in AI.
EUV's smaller wavelength, fewer steps, and high efficiency make it a must-have for fabs like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung Electronics, and Intel to handle increasingly sophisticated designs from Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices.
Steady growth at a great value
Despite the long-term potential, ASML warned investors during its last quarterly earnings release that it may not grow in 2026 -- which sparked a steep sell-off in the stock. However, ASML reaffirmed its 2030 targets. The high end of its guidance range calls for doubling revenue relative to 2024 levels. Additionally, ASML expects its gross margin to expand to the high 50% range, likely because high-margin EUVs are expected to make up an increasingly larger percentage of its sales mix compared to DUVs.
Even after its run-up, ASML sports a reasonable 31 forward price-to-earnings ratio, which is far cheaper than many other fast-growing AI stocks, especially considering ASML's strong moat in EUV technology. What's more, the company has a strong dividend. Currently yielding 0.8%, the quarterly payout is a nice cherry on top for investors seeking to add some passive income to their long-term holdings.
Round out your AI portfolio with ASML
ASML isn't a high-flying AI stock that is heavily disrupting cloud computing or making next-generation chips. Nor is it a tech conglomerate like Microsoft and Alphabet, which have a lot of moving parts in addition to their AI focus. However, ASML is well positioned to grow earnings by double digits over the long term, in lockstep with fabs expanding their manufacturing capacity to meet AI demand.
The stock is an especially attractive buy for investors who have valuation concerns about the current market, especially leading S&P 500 tech stocks. However, it's important to understand that ASML's results can swing based on its order volumes from key customers, as well as geopolitical tensions and trade policy.
Although ASML is a Dutch company, it is heavily influenced by U.S. trade actions. So, ASML's growth could stall in the near term due to factors outside of its control. Therefore, it's best to approach the stock with a long-term mindset, especially as a balanced play bridging the gap between growth and value.
In sum, ASML will benefit from higher chip demand, especially from AI. The stock may be a perfect buy for investors with exposure to other aspects of the value chain, such as the chip designers, fabs, or cloud computing plays. Adding an equipment supplier like ASML, rather than doubling down on just one part of AI, is a great way for investors to build a diversified portfolio."

Stocks Rally on Renewed Optimism
Wall Street had a volatile session on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced a quarter percentage point interest rate cut. However, investors returned with renewed vigor on Thursday on optimism that the rate cut will help boost the economy.
All three major indexes hit new all-time intraday highs. However, the biggest gains on Thursday were the small-cap companies, with the Russell 2000 small-cap index advancing 2.4%.
Small-cap companies are likely to benefit the most from the recent rate cuts, given that they rely mostly on external funding.
The Fed’s recent rate cut was highly anticipated and investors were more eager to know about the future rate cut path. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the rate cut was primarily because of a worsening labor market and cited the growing risks of employment compared to inflation.
He also warned that the inflationary risks must be managed carefully. However, he still indicated two more rate cuts by the end of this year. Investors cheered the decision, sending stocks on a rally on Thursday.
Tech Stocks Lead Rally
Thursday’s rally was primarily led by tech stocks. Intel Corporation (INTC) was one of the biggest gainers, with the company recording one of its best days in decades. Intel’s shares surged 22.8%, recording its biggest single-day gain since October 1987, after NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) announced that it will invest $5 billion in the company to co-develop data center and PC chips. NVIDIA’s shares ended 3.5% higher. Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here."

According to the Korea Economic Daily, Samsung recently passed Nvidia’s qualification tests for its fifth-generation 12-layer HBM3E product after several failed attempts. While Samsung will initially be Nvidia’s third supplier behind SK Hynix and Micron with limited volumes, the qualification represents a significant milestone for the Korean tech giant.
The development comes as Samsung appears to be gaining an edge in the race to meet Nvidia’s demanding specifications for next-generation HBM4 memory. Nvidia has requested suppliers to achieve HBM4 data transfer speeds exceeding 10 gigabits per second, significantly higher than the current industry standard of 8 Gbps. Samsung has reportedly demonstrated 11 Gbps speeds, outpacing SK Hynix’s 10 Gbps, while Micron is struggling to meet these requirements.
Samsung plans to ship large volumes of HBM4 samples to Nvidia this month to secure early qualification. The company has already been qualified by AMD and has shipped HBM3E 12-High chips to them.
Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Rocha noted this development could be ""an incremental negative for HBM pricing,"" especially if Samsung discounts its products to gain market share. Rocha added that with Micron’s stock now close to $170, ""expectations into next week are high"" for the company’s upcoming earnings report.
Despite these concerns, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Micron. TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar raised his price target on the stock to $180 from $150 while maintaining a Buy rating.
""We think MU stock will continue its outperformance in the short term as checks continue to support that momentum,"" Sankar noted. ""Typically, this part of the cycle puts more emphasis on ASP trends as we do not expect much multiple expansion from here, but rather continued growth in book value.""
Similarly, Barclays analyst Tom O’Malley raised his price target to $175 from $140 while maintaining an Overweight rating on Micron shares.
JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande viewed Samsung’s qualification as ""a positive development for the semi-cap players, particularly for ASML in Europe, as it brings the memory leader back into the advanced HBM race after lagging SK Hynix and Micron."" Deshpande noted that Samsung has available cleanroom space allowing it to install equipment quickly to scale production."

BofA raised its price objective on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to $34 from $25, citing the potential for modest product benefits from the collaboration, while reiterating a Neutral rating.
The bank’s analysts suggest that Intel’s expanded commitments could end up being a relative positive for AMD in the near and medium term.
The partnership between Intel and Nvidia, which covers new product development, has naturally sparked investor concerns given the historic zero-sum nature of Intel and AMD’s rivalry.
Yet, analysts led by Vivek Arya note that “greater chance of success for x86, especially in enterprise, benefits AMD also, not just Intel,” even if some of AMD’s edge in cloud may be blunted if Nvidia accelerates collaboration with Intel’s server CPUs.
x86 is a widely used processor architecture, created by Intel and shared with AMD, that powers most PCs and servers.
Another key point is timing. Chip collaborations typically take years before reaching the market, and BofA stresses that Intel’s competitive needs are more immediate. That gap gives AMD space to maintain momentum without an immediate headwind.
The analysts also flag the risk that Intel could become distracted by managing multiple stakeholders—SoftBank, Nvidia, and the U.S. government—which could dilute its focus and execution capacity.
Moreover, Intel’s reliance on Nvidia for graphics technology signals that its own desktop CPU graphics fix remains incomplete. That leaves AMD better positioned in that segment in the near term.
BofA maintains a Buy rating on AMD with a $200 price objective, based on 33 times 2026 expected non-GAAP EPS, near the high end of its historical valuation range.
The price target is “justified by AI growth and CPU share gains offset by slower growth in cyclical embedded/console markets,” BofA said.

Time for today's trending tickers. First, we are going to take a look at Intel and Nvidia. Intel, well, it's still seeing big swings.
In fact, earlier this morning it was down more than two and a half percent. Now, let's have a check and it's down very little, in fact, now.
Uh and Intel's stock well, it skyrocketed yesterday, remember, closing more than 22% higher after Nvidia announced its $5 billion investment in the company
as part of a push to produce more AI hardware and products in the US.
Today, some of that enthusiasm seems to be fading. We'll keep a close eye on it here on Yahoo Finance.
Next up, it's FedEx, and it's in focus after reporting results late yesterday that beat analyst expectations and that's despite tariff headwinds.
And shares are up in pre-market, as you can see, up nearly 5 and a half percent there.
Now, the delivery giant said international export volumes fell 3%, but its domestic volumes actually grew 4% and that helped offset a roughly $150 million hit from the US ending a tariff exemption on small packages made that come from China.
Part of a broader hit of a one billion from of $1 billion from trade policies alone. Now, FedEx is aggressively cutting costs, parking planes, consolidating facilities, and merging its ground and express units.
Plans that should save about $1 billion next year.
Okay, moving on to the next trending stock I want to put on your radar, a tiny company that's become the market's latest rocket ship, Brera Holdings.
The stock closed up more than, get this, 220% yesterday and is gaining another 30% or no, 20% or so in the pre-market.
That's after the Dublin-based owner of small sports clubs announced a $300 million private investment sponsored by UAE-based Pulsar Group and backed by Kathy Woods of Ark Invest.
Now, the deal will see Brera rebrand as Soulmate, a Solana-based digital asset Treasury and crypto infrastructure firm stating the obvious, shares are likely to remain very volatile.
Okay, finally, another small company that's flying and that you need to know about.
Card Cardilytics. After closing up more than, get this, 92%, it's rising another 13, no, 9% now in pre-market. It was up 13 earlier.
What's driving the rally? Well, Amex just announced a new platinum card. And one analyst firm tweeted that advertising platforms such as Cardlytics are set to benefit from increased access to first-party data."

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about.
Jeff Kilburg from KKM Financial said in a program on CNBC late July that he was planning to sell Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares despite the idea sounding “crazy.” Here is how the analyst explained his decision:
“I want to sell Nvidia. I know it sounds crazy, but Nvidia at a new all-time high of $175. I want to sell Nvidia, take profits and the reason is because of the overconcentration. If you see the NASDAQ, we’ve talked about the NASDAQ right now. It’s on its 65th day of being above its 20-day moving average. So, a little long in the tooth, but this is momentum. This is the V-shaped recovery. So, by selling Nvidia, I want to buy Apple nearly the lagger. Tesla is just below Apple in the MAG 7. So, I think there’s an opportunity. If you want to short Nvidia, this is not for you. You will have a very hard time shorting Nvidia. But there’s an opportunity to either sell or trim position. I blindly bought Nvidia back in April at $92. So I’m taking profits.”
NVDA was trading at around $176 as of July 28, while the stock price is $170 as of September 18.
Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Brown Advisory Large-Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
Information Technology was the largest detractor from relative performance during the quarter. The strategy’s underweight to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and not owning Broadcom (AVGO) were the two largest detractors during the period. NVIDIA (NVDA), a market leader in advanced graphics processing units, rebounded after a first quarter marked by a lower gross margin outlook, which was attributed to short-term complexities in ramping up Blackwell production, and a broad-based decline in AI infrastructure stocks. The company’s most recent quarterly earnings were modestly ahead of consensus expectations, and management expects gross margins to increase by year-end as yield and throughput on Blackwell racks continue to improve."

But the investment does little to solve what is arguably Intel's biggest problem: how to fix its ailing contract chip manufacturing business.
As part of the deal — which gives Nvidia a 4% stake in Intel — Nvidia will use Intel's CPUs (central processing units) in its AI data center server systems, and Intel will use Nvidia's AI tech in its semiconductors for personal computers.
But crucially, the agreement made no mention of Intel's manufacturing business, Intel Foundry Services, the segment of Intel that has drawn widespread attention from investors and the US government and is struggling with heavy losses as AI has upended the chip market.
Intel has always manufactured its own semiconductors, but the company opened that manufacturing business to outside customers in 2021. The chipmaker, helmed at the time by former CEO Pat Gelsinger, launched Intel Foundry Services in a bid to revive the company as its product business lost share to competitors. The plan entailed spending hundreds of billions of dollars on new factories that would make chips for other companies.
But Gelsinger's high hopes for the business largely floundered due to a lack of big customer commitments. Intel Foundry Services' losses ballooned to $13 billion in its 2024 fiscal year from $7 billion in 2023. Those losses helped send Intel's stock plunging 60% last year. Gelsinger was ousted by the company's board in December.
The foundry business remains Intel's biggest concern, Wall Street analysts say. Some argue for selling it, while others point out that doing so would make it more expensive for Intel to manufacture its chips due to economies of scale.
""This is a business that will continue to bleed cash at least through 2027,"" CFRA analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance.
Citi (C) analyst Chris Danely downgraded Intel stock Friday, saying its recent rally was overdone given that contract manufacturing business has ""minimal chance to succeed.""
At a press conference with reporters to discuss Thursday's deal, the CEOs of Intel and Nvidia left open the possibility of Nvidia becoming a customer of Intel Foundry Services. But they indicated that in the immediate term, the companies would partner with Intel rival TSMC (TSM) to produce new chips that they designed.
Meanwhile, the US has an interest in the success of Intel's manufacturing business. Intel is the only large-scale, leading-edge US chipmaker and makes chips for the Department of Defense. Most of the world's most advanced chips are made by Taiwan's TSMC."

This is because this security in the Semiconductor – General space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.
This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Semiconductor – General space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 47 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.
Meanwhile, NVIDIA is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm’s prospects in both the short and long term.

Details of the deal haven’t been announced, and Trump remained noncommittal in an interview with Fox News that aired Thursday, signaling that a lot rides on how Xi responds.
“It sounds like they’ve approved TikTok, and TikTok is a tremendous amount of money for the United States so that was nice, but we’ll see how that all works,” Trump said.
The leaders’ conversation will be their first since June, with the two countries locked in a standoff over trade restrictions ensnaring key industries including semiconductors and rare earths. That includes wrangling over the future of chipmaker Nvidia Corp.’s access to China, currently hampered by US export controls and Chinese efforts to curb local demand for its products.
“We’re very close to deals on all of it,” Trump said, alluding to trade talks as well as TikTok. “And my relationship with China is very good.”
The call may also tee up a potential in-person meeting, in what would be a first since Trump returned to office. That engagement should yield a broader agenda including an expected Chinese order for Boeing Co. planes and potentially deeper discussion of geopolitical issues as conflicts continue to rage in Ukraine and the Middle East and skirmishes escalate in the South China Sea.
Trump’s interest in wielding his transactional diplomacy to notch a TikTok deal has drowned out any lingering national security concerns that had underpinned the bipartisan law that initially set a January deadline for divestiture. The president has signed several executive orders extending the law’s deadline — though his legal footing for flouting the law and allowing the app to continue operating is not fully clear.
“There is tremendous value, and I hate to give away value,” Trump said of the popular app on Thursday in the UK after a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. “I’d rather reap the benefits.”"

Sep 19 - According to sources, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) pays more than $900 million to bring Enfabrica's CEO Rochan Sankar and other engineers onto its team and to license the startup's AI-hardware design.
The company uses a mix of cash and equity in the package and closes the deal last week. Enfabrica, founded in 2019, builds fabric technology that links huge numbers of GPUs so clusters behave like a single computer, a capability that fits well with Nvidia's push to sell integrated systems around its chips.
Nvidia previously backed Enfabrica in a $125 million Series B in 2023; investors later contributed roughly $115 million, leaving the startup's disclosed funding at about $240M$260M.
Industry watchers note similar moves from other big tech firms: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) struck a major AI deal with Scale, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also paid for talent plus licensing in recent months.
Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Intel (INTC) all pursue talent-and-tech deals as they race to scale AI infrastructure. Nvidia says nothing beyond a standard comment policy; Enfabrica does not respond to requests for comment."

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) is betting big on Intel (INTC, Financials). The world's most valuable chipmaker is investing $5 billion for about a 4% stake in Intel and teaming up to develop new PC and data center chips.
The deal immediately lit up Wall Street. Intel shares soared 23% as investors cheered the prospect of new life for a company that has struggled to keep pace with rivals. For Nvidia, it's a chance to deepen ties with a potential partner while tightening its grip on the fast-growing AI market.
For Asian chipmakers, though, the picture is more complicated. Taiwan's TSMC still produces the vast majority of AI chips, including those designed by Nvidia. Some analysts say a healthier Intel actually helps TSMC by spreading U.S. government support and easing political pressure.
Others warn that if Intel eventually wins Nvidia's manufacturing business, it could chip away at TSMC's dominance.Samsung is in a similar spot. Both it and TSMC are building costly plants in the U.S. under government pressure. Their shares dipped Friday TSMC down 1.6%, Samsung off 1% as investors weighed the longer-term threat.
Another company caught in the middle is AMD. Analysts said tighter cooperation between Intel and Nvidia could hurt AMD's server chip sales, since Nvidia is essentially pulling Intel closer in its fight against a key rival."

shares of Intel are rising by over 20%, almost 30% after Nvidia announced a 5 billion dollar investment into the company to develop PC chips and data centers. Joining me now for more on this Stacy Raskin, Bernstein Managing Director, senior analyst, long time cover follower of this industry. Stacy,
this was quite a surprise this morning. I think it is uh fair to say. what what's your sort of first blush reaction?
I I mean look, so, you know, we we've had a number of other if you want to call them co investments in Intel over the last few weeks. We have the we have the big governmental investment uh for a little under nine billion. We have the Softbank investment for two. I think it's not people were expecting that we might see others. I I'd say with this one it was surprising maybe for two reasons. One is the magnitude of the investment, 5 billions least at least for Intel is a lot of money, maybe not as much just not for Nvidia a lot of money, but for Intel a lot of money.
And uh quite a bit bigger than say what we saw for Softbank. And and second, I think the nature of the the the the the other collaboration. I think a lot of folks have been hoping for a manufacturing or foundry partnership. This is not that. This is a a product partnership. And and I think it makes sense because, you know, there's there's Intel's process tech and their manufacturing flow is still up in the air. We don't know.
But their their product business needs actually a lot of help as well. I mean, they've been kind of bleeding share in a lot of areas and so, uh to the extent that, you know, a partner like Nvidia who is, you know, big and and important to the extent that they can come in and maybe help uh uh Intel's product business. Maybe that can help carry Intel along to the point where they can get the rest of the company together. But I don't know that people were expecting like a very significant product partnership and that's actually what
at least at first glance it looks like we have here today.
Well, and Stacy, I earlier talked to Pat Morehead, another, you know, long time um veteran chip analyst and he you know, pointed out Nvidia's partnership and partnership might be even too light of a word for its involvement with TSMC, its reliance on TSMC. So, you know, at some point, do you expect it to give some of its manufacturing to Intel, but does it how does it do that in a sort of delicate way given the partnership with TSMC?
I I mean look, no, don't get TSMC's a fantastic company. Everybody relies on them. and that that's part of the issue. Nobody likes to be single sourced for these for these sorts of things. You want other sources and there are aren't really a lot of other options right now. There's only three companies that even in theory can do leading edge manufacturing. It's TSMC, Samsung and Intel and and mostly it's TSMC. So people do want second sources. I'd also say just given, you know, the the USA first kind of dynamic around the new administration.
I mean clearly there is a broader desire to do more in the US and they can only one of those three companies is US headquarters that that is Intel. Now, that being said, like there's there's not a lot that can happen you know, to force or encourage customers to use Intel's manufacturing be because there there's nothing to use yet. and I've made this point before. Nobody really needs to force or or encourage customers to use Intel. If if Intel can prove that they can make products in high volume that meets spec at a good
cost that are available on time. That that's table stakes for a foundry, but if they can prove they can do that, they'll have customers lined up around the block to to use them. Like I guarantee you, nobody will you know TSMC partnerships or no. If Intel cannot prove that they can do that, no customer in their right mind would ever put any kind of meaningful volume at them. So it's on Intel to execute there. Um and and we're not there yet. So I I mean like it's it's going to take a while. We'll have we'll have to see.
In the meantime, though, I mean if you could help Intel support the product business and and improve the market share and the competitiveness of of those products, that also brings more money and further competitiveness into the into the company and maybe it helps them along that path as they are trying to get their manufacturing ducts in a row."

LONDON, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced an investment of £2 billion in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally.
Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups.
“This is the age of AI — the big bang of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The United Kingdom is in a Goldilocks moment, where world-class universities, bold startups, leading researchers and cutting-edge supercomputing converge. There has never been a better time to invest in the U.K. — AI is unlocking new science and sparking entirely new industries. With new capital and advanced infrastructure, we are doubling down to empower the U.K. to lead the next wave of AI innovation.”
The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. NVIDIA’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups.
“NVIDIA’s investment is a major vote of confidence in the U.K. both today and long into the future,” said U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “By backing our startups, empowering our researchers and connecting capital with talent, this partnership will create jobs, spark new industries and ensure the U.K. remains at the forefront of global AI leadership.”"

China's biggest tech firms are now putting their chip ambitions front and center, and investors are responding with conviction. Over the past few weeks, Huawei Technologies and Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) have rolled out bold AI roadmaps, sparking a $240 billion rally that pushed the Hang Seng Tech Index to its highest level since 2021. Huawei laid out a three-year plan featuring super clusters designed to replace restricted Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) accelerators, while Alibaba showcased the sharp rise in AI sales from its cloud division, which alone triggered a $50 billion jump in its stock after earnings.
Momentum is spreading across the sector. Baidu recently secured a 1 billion yuan contract with China Mobile for servers built on its Kunlun chips, and Cambricon Technologies posted record first-half profits, a sign investors view as evidence that local semiconductors are starting to gain traction. Huawei has acknowledged its per-chip performance trails Nvidia, yet it emphasized scale and cost advantages by clustering up to a million chips. Analysts point out this clustering approach, alongside proprietary interconnects, could help narrow performance gaps while bolstering confidence in domestic innovation.
The policy backdrop is equally important. Beijing is pressing local firms to stop testing Nvidia's latest workstation chips, while SMIC is experimenting with homegrown tools to lift yields. These moves underscore both the ambition and risk in China's strategy: scaling advanced manufacturing while trying to establish real self-reliance. For investors, the question is whether this surge represents the start of a structural re-rating or another speculative swing. What seems clear is that 2025 could be a pivotal year for China's semiconductor push, with execution now as critical as ambition."

Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) stock just delivered its sharpest rally in nearly four decades, and the trigger came from an unexpected alliance. Shares surged as much as 28% after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel and co-develop chips for PCs and data centers. The move follows President Donald Trump's recent agreement for the US government to take a roughly 10% stake in Intel at $20.47 per share, a bet that has already gained $4.9 billion on paper as the stock touched $31.79. For a company long viewed as struggling to stay relevant in the semiconductor race, the sudden market reaction underscored how quickly sentiment can shift.
The Nvidia partnership could mark a pivotal moment in Intel's turnaround narrative. After years of manufacturing setbacks and a shrinking role in the era of AI-driven chips, Intel now has both financial backing and a potential technological partner with unmatched momentum. According to Intel's filing, 274.6 million shares have already been issued to the Department of Commerce, while another 158.7 million remain in escrow to be released as disbursements are made under the Chips Act. This structure reflects not only Washington's push to revive domestic chipmaking but also Nvidia's willingness to test Intel's ability to reassert its position in advanced computing.
Yet valuation signals caution. Intel's surge has lifted its multiple to 57 times projected 12-month earnings, a level not seen since 2001. Neither Intel nor Nvidia has offered a timeline for the rollout of co-developed products, leaving investors to weigh enthusiasm against execution risk. Seaport Securities trader Ted Weisberg described the rally as a breath of fresh air, but noted the outcome remains uncertain. For now, the combination of government backing and Nvidia's capital could give Intel a second chance, though its long-term trajectory will depend on whether these commitments translate into real competitive strength."

It had no permanent CEO until March, when industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan took over after former CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced out. Intel's foundry business, a capital-intensive endeavor meant to open up Intel's manufacturing technology and facilities to third-party customers, wasn't winning meaningful customers. Tan made it clear that without significant external revenue, Intel may have to get out of the chip manufacturing business altogether.
For the foundry to work, Intel needs plenty of cash to scale up its Intel 18A process and complete development of its upcoming Intel 14A process. It also needs enough external customers to justify those massive investments. The company got both on Thursday, courtesy of Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%).
A game-changing deal
Artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader Nvidia has agreed to a deal with Intel that will see both companies jointly develop multiple generations of data center and PC products. For the data center, custom x86 chips will be used by Nvidia and sold to other customers. In the PC market, Intel's CPU technology will be combined with Nvidia GPU chiplets to create system-on-chips that will be offered to external customers.
This announcement comes on the heels of Intel's push into custom silicon. Earlier this month, Intel disclosed that it was creating a new group that would design custom semiconductor chips for external customers. Nvidia appears to be the first such customer.
Importantly, Intel will also manufacture these custom Nvidia chips. The company didn't disclose timelines, process nodes, or much other information, but the announcement noted that Intel would both ""design and manufacture"" custom data center and client CPUs integrating Nvidia technology. Intel desperately needed a major external foundry customer, and now it has one.
Intel also desperately needs capital to fund its foundry business, and the other part of the deal with Nvidia provides just that. Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel, buying shares at $23.28 a pop. Intel didn't disclose the planned use of this capital injection, but the company certainly needs cash to scale up its latest process nodes.
Cash infusions are adding up
Nvidia's $5 billion investment adds to Intel's haul over the past month. In August, Intel reached a deal for the U.S. government to invest $8.9 billion in the company. Some of the funding came from previous grants under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which had not yet been paid, although those grants originally had conditions that were then dropped as part of the deal. Intel confirmed that it had received a $5.7 billion payment from the U.S. government in late August related to the deal.
Intel also received a $2 billion investment from Softbank in August, announced a few days before the deal with the U.S. government. The Softbank investment, the Nvidia investment, and the payment from the U.S. government add up to a $12.7 billion cash infusion. Intel also recently closed on its sale of a majority stake in Altera, which brought in an additional $3.3 billion. All told, that's around $16 billion in cash, before any taxes related to the Altera sale.
These cash infusions give Intel some breathing room, and the collaboration with Nvidia provides an enormous vote of confidence for Intel's custom silicon business and its foundry business. While Intel's turnaround will still be a slow process, things are clearly looking up for the struggling chip company."

The investment represents a significant commitment to Intel's turnaround efforts. Nvidia joins Japanese investment giant SoftBank and the US government in backing the once-dominant chipmaker, which has fallen behind in recent years after missing key technology shifts.
""This marks a fusion of two world-class platforms,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. ""Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.""
The Trump administration surprised the tech industry last month by taking a 10 percent equity stake in Intel, recognizing the strategic importance of the company that powered the PC and internet revolution with its processors.
It is very rare for the US government to take shares in private companies, and Trump has signaled he is willing to pursue more such deals that he sees as strategically necessary.
""This is a game-changer for Intel as it now brings the company front and center into the AI game,"" said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.
""Along with the recent US government investment of 10 percent, this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors,"" he added.
Huang insisted that the Trump administration ""had no involvement in this partnership at all, though they would have been very supportive, of course.""
The deal was ""an incredible investment...it's going to be fantastic for Intel and fantastic for us,"" Huang told reporters.
However, the deal made no mention of Nvidia using Intel's struggling manufacturing business to build chips, with Huang praising TSMC, the AI giant's main manufacturer.
Bringing manufacturing of high-tech products back to the United States has been a major priority of the Trump administration.
Intel largely missed the smartphone boom and failed to develop competitive hardware for the AI era, allowing Asian manufacturers TSMC and Samsung to dominate the custom semiconductor market.
Most notably, Intel was blindsided by Nvidia's rise as the world's leading AI chip provider.
Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), originally designed for gaming systems, have become the essential building blocks of artificial intelligence applications, with tech giants scrambling to secure them for their data centers and AI projects.
The partnership announced Thursday will focus on creating custom data center and PC products designed for AI applications. Nvidia will purchase Intel common stock at $23.28 per share, subject to regulatory approval."

One analyst hiked their price target on the news as well, showing that the deal is bullish for ASML.
As of 11:58 a.m. ET, the stock was up 7% on the news.
ASML rides Intel's coattails
ASML, which is the only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) to make semiconductors, counts Intel, one of the world's biggest chip manufacturers, as a major customer, along with TSMC and Samsung, though Intel has struggled badly in recent years.
The thinking seems to go that the Nvidia partnership could breathe new life into Intel, boosting its foundry and creating new demand for ASML, though the deal doesn't directly focus on Intel Foundry.
In response to the news, Bank of America raised its price target from $724 to $941 and reiterated a buy rating on the stock, noting that a more competitive Intel should be a positive for semiconductor equipment companies.
Can ASML keep gaining?
After missing out on the AI rally over much of the past year, ASML is finally gaining traction, as investors have responded positively to recent news, including its deal to take a stake in Mistral AI for 1.3 billion euros, and signs that TSMC is increasing its capital expenditures budget.
ASML has a strong competitive advantage in semiconductor equipment, but it needs demand from its customers. As we move further into the artificial intelligence (AI) era, signs are picking up that demand could be returning."

The big move comes as a consequence of the announcement that Nvidia would invest $5 billion in Intel stock, and the two companies would collaborate to develop ""custom data center and PC products that accelerate applications and workloads across hyperscale, enterprise, and consumer markets,"" according to Nvidia.
Where Synopsys comes in
Intel and Synopsys are long-term partners , and the market is pricing in an increased level of demand from Intel for EDA solutions as it collaborates with Nvidia to develop chips.
This is a particularly pertinent consideration, because Synopsys recently disappointed the market with its third-quarter earnings report. One of the three issues that Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi highlighted on the earnings call was ""challenges at a major foundry customer are also having a sizable impact on the year.""
In addition, he noted, ""We made certain roadmap and resource decisions that did not yield their intended results,"" which include the impact of the changes at the foundry customer. While Intel wasn't explicitly named, it appears that investors are assuming that it's the major customer Ghazi is referring to.
Where next for Synopsys?
As recently discussed, it will take time for Synopsys to adjust to the issues it faced in the third quarter, not least as one of them relates to the uncertainty among customers in China over whether Synopsys will face restrictions on what it can sell to those customers in the future.
That said, Nvidia's investment in Intel (whether Intel is the customer Synopsys' management referred to) is indicative of a growth industry. Moreover, the long-term case for buying Synopsys stock is a powerful one."

""The United States, as we know, has to become a chip manufacturer,"" Cohn, who served as director of the National Economic Council during President Trump's first term, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. ""We cannot be dependent on the rest of the world for chips.""
His remarks come after Nvidia (NVDA) said it would take a $5 billion stake in Intel (INTC) this week. As part of the investment, the two tech giants will co-develop chips for PCs and data centers. The tie-up also makes Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, potentially giving Intel the lift it needs as it falls behind in the global chip race.
Currently, Intel is America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer. In late August, the federal government agreed to invest $8.9 billion in the company in exchange for a 9.9% stake.
Cohn, now IBM (IBM) vice chairman, described the Nvidia-Intel deal as having ""some good,"" noting that it highlights a larger push to bolster domestic chip production.
He pointed to lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We understood that without chips being imported to the United States, our economy, our manufacturing economy [would] shut down,"" he said.
He added that the federal government encouraging domestic chip manufacturing is a ""good thing,"" referencing the CHIPS Act, which was signed in 2022 during the Biden administration.
Still, Cohn stressed the government's role isn't to pick winners and losers, but to protect national security and the economy. ""To be able to defend ourselves, to be able to build military equipment, we need to be in the chip manufacturing business here,"" he said.
Even so, the comments come amid a $42 billion US-UK tech agreement dubbed the ""Tech Prosperity Deal,"" a major catalyst for AI chip demand in the UK. Big Tech players like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Google (GOOG), and OpenAI (OPAI) are part of the investment.
More broadly, Cohn highlighted the long-term infrastructure investments required for AI, particularly new data centers, which he estimates will come online in three to five years.
He is bullish on AI's potential, expecting it to expand beyond the software used today. He cited AI agents as an example of tools that currently ""solve a specific AI problem.""
IBM is also betting that the next decade will push beyond AI into quantum computing. ""Where I believe this is going, where IBM believes is going ... to an enterprise-wide solution where all of these AI programs … will work together. They'll be more coherently, more cohesively related, and they'll have a big infrastructure behind that,"" he said."

With signed multibillion-dollar contracts already driving cloud consumption and more deals in the pipeline, the company is positioning itself as a key player in the fast-growing AI infrastructure market. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, management disclosed landmark agreements with OpenAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD. These agreements contributed to the surge in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), providing investors with exceptional visibility into future revenues.
The long-term prospects of these contracts are substantial. OpenAI alone reportedly signed a landmark $300 billion deal for computing power over five years, one of the largest cloud contracts ever. Oracle noted that 33% of total RPO will convert into revenues within 12 months, offering meaningful near-term upside. Management also expects to sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers by the end of fiscal 2026.
To meet this demand, Oracle is investing aggressively in infrastructure. It has committed $35 billion in CapEx for fiscal 2026 to build 37 new multi-cloud data centers. This capacity expansion aligns directly with its AI-driven backlog, ensuring the company can deliver on existing contracts while positioning itself for new opportunities as AI adoption accelerates.
While execution and margin pressures remain challenges, Oracle’s expanding AI deal pipeline represents a powerful growth lever. With the Zacks Consensus Estimate projecting 16% revenue growth in fiscal 2026 and nearly 19% in 2027 year over year, the company’s AI partnerships are set to transform its revenue mix, providing a compelling case for long-term upside.
Oracle & Competitors: The Cloud Partnership Race
Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud is rapidly expanding its global reach through multi-billion-dollar partnerships. Its most notable partnership was with Meta in 2025, which signed a six-year cloud deal worth more than $10 billion to leverage Google's servers, storage and advanced networking. Meanwhile, Atlassian has chosen Google Cloud to host Jira and Confluence in a multi-cloud strategy. With AI/ML, advanced analytics and global leadership, Google Cloud is further strengthening its role as a premier enterprise partner.
Amazon AMZN, through Amazon Web Services (AWS), is strengthening its dominance through a vast partner ecosystem and high-profile alliances. In 2025, AWS partnered with Nvidia for AI infrastructure, launched its Secret-West Region for government clients, and deepened ties with OpenAI and CrowdStrike. The London Stock Exchange Group chose AWS as its preferred cloud provider, while enterprises like PepsiCo, Airbnb, Nissan, GitLab, SAP and Warner Bros. These partnerships highlight AWS’ scale, resilience and leadership in driving global digital transformation."

Nvidia's planned 4% Intel stake would bring recent investment in chipmaker to $16 billion
Nvidia's (NVDA) $5 billion planned investment in Intel common shares announced Thursday would represent a 4% stake and bring recent outside investment in the ailing chipmaker to $16 billion.
""This is a game changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Thursday. Intel stock soared more than 25% after the market open Thursday.
In an unusual move, the Trump administration took a 10% stake in Intel in August with a roughly $9 billion investment, and Japanese investment holding company SoftBank Group (SFTBY) made its own $2 billion investment last month.
Still, the Nvidia-Intel deal would not bolster Intel's ailing manufacturing business as it looks to bring on outside customers, noted Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.
Intel designs chips for data centers and personal computers, and while it has always manufactured its own semiconductors, the company opened up that manufacturing business to outside customers in 2021 under former CEO Pat Gelsinger. Intel has aimed to both compete with Nvidia's AI chips in its design segment and draw in customers such as Nvidia in its manufacturing business — but both efforts have fallen short.
Intel recently said it would only pursue the development of its new 14A manufacturing process, which would be used to develop cutting-edge chips, if it can bring in such customers.
""But frankly Intel can use the help on the product business just as much given share position in key markets has been bleeding,"" Rasgon said in a note Thursday.

Nuclear power could be a $10 trillion market opportunity
Nuclear energy represents a $10 trillion potential market opportunity that could hold ""the answer to the world's power shortages,"" according to a new report from Bank of America.
Rising demand, combined with strong support from the Trump administration and a public narrative turning positive after years of a dour outlook on the sector, has given a share price boost to companies operating throughout the nuclear sector supply chain in 2025.
""In many ways,"" Bank of America analysts wrote, ""nuclear energy has been 'rediscovered' amid surging electricity demand ignited by the rise of AI/data centers, building electrification, industrial growth, and EVs.""
According to Bank of America, the answer to meeting this demand amid a ""rediscovery"" of nuclear's potential benefits may lie in what the bank calls ""one of the most consequential energy technologies for the next 25 years"": small modular reactors, or SMRs.

US stocks had finished mixed Wednesday over uncertainty about the path forward following the Fed's announcement.
But the mood changed Thursday, with investors confident that more cuts are coming this year, analysts said.
""Markets are betting policymakers will continue to prioritize jobs over inflation, even with headline prices still running hot,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com.
The decision to cut came even as US inflation runs well above policymakers' two-percent target, but analysts said the main focus was on the jobs market.
Fed policymakers are split between those who expect at least two interest rate cuts later this year and those who anticipate one or fewer.
Fed boss Jerome Powell remained cagey, telling reporters decision-makers were approaching it ""meeting by meeting.""

Huawei says it is ready to launch what it calls the world's most powerful AI system, stepping up competition with Nvidia Corp. (NVDA, Financials) just as U.S. restrictions tighten China's access to advanced chips.
The new Atlas 950 SuperCluster, powered by Huawei's Ascend processors, is slated for release next year and will run on more than 500,000 chips. The company claims it will outpace Nvidia's planned NVL144 system and even Elon Musk's xAI Colossus supercomputer.
The move comes as Beijing urges self-reliance in semiconductors and expands an antitrust probe into Nvidia. Reports also suggest Chinese firms have been told to stop testing Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, sending Nvidia shares lower this week.
For investors, the question is whether Huawei's scale-first approach can chip away at Nvidia's lead in AI computing or whether U.S. export rules will keep reshaping the competitive field."

Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 3% in the morning session after its key rivals, Nvidia and Intel, announced a major strategic collaboration, creating a formidable competitor in the chip space.
The surprise deal saw Nvidia invest $5 billion in Intel, and the two semiconductor giants teamed up to jointly develop new chips for both AI data centers and personal computers. This partnership directly challenged AMD's position in those critical markets. The collaboration aimed to fuse Intel's x86 CPUs with Nvidia's powerful RTX graphics chiplets. This move appeared to worry investors because it threatened to weaken a key advantage AMD held. The new alliance between two of its biggest rivals presented a significant competitive threat, raising concerns about AMD's future market share.

What Is The Market Telling Us
AMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 23 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago when the stock gained 3.9% on the news that a strong outlook from software giant Oracle (ORCL) fueled optimism for companies exposed to artificial intelligence demand. Oracle's shares soared after the company boosted its outlook, citing booming AI demand.
This positive sentiment rippled across the semiconductor industry, lifting shares of AI chipmakers like AMD, Nvidia, and Broadcom. The move is also supported by broader strength in the sector, as recent data showed global semiconductor sales hit $62.1 billion in July 2025, a 20.6% year-over-year increase. This growth has been fueled by high demand for data center chips and memory products, reinforcing investor confidence in the industry's prospects.
AMD is up 27.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $154.06 per share, it is still trading 16.5% below its 52-week high of $184.42 from August 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,056.

onsemi’s shares are very volatile and have had 29 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 16 days ago when the stock dropped 3% on the news that the major indices continued to retreat (Nasdaq -1.5%, S&P 500 -1.2%) amid profit-taking and renewed concerns about tariffs.
Investors reacted to a federal court ruling that most of President Trump's global tariffs were illegal, raising uncertainty over trade policy and the fiscal impact of potential refunds. Rising Treasury yields added to the pressure, with the 10-year climbing above 4.2% and the 30-year nearing 5%, intensifying worries about stretched equity valuations. September's historically weak track record for stocks further dampened sentiment, leaving traders cautious ahead of the jobs report later in the week and the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision.

Shares of memory chips maker Micron (NYSE:MU) jumped 5.4% in the morning session after a flurry of Wall Street analysts raised their price targets, citing immense demand for the company's high-performance memory chips used in artificial intelligence.
Multiple research firms showcased their confidence in Micron's trajectory. Wolfe Research boosted its price target to $180, while UBS and Mizuho set even higher targets of $185 and $182, respectively. Analysts from Rosenblatt, Susquehanna, and Deutsche Bank also echoed this bullish sentiment, raising their own targets and maintaining positive ratings.

Citigroup analyst Christopher Danely maintained a 'Buy' rating on the stock while increasing the price target to $175 from $150. The move reflects growing confidence in Micron's position as a key beneficiary of the AI revolution. Analysts point to increased demand for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, which are essential components for AI infrastructure. The positive analyst action contributed to the stock's recent momentum, which has seen shares reach new all-time highs.

Nvidia’s shares are quite volatile and have had 18 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was about 21 hours ago when the stock dropped 2.3% as reports surfaced that China's internet regulator banned the country's largest tech companies from purchasing the American firm's artificial intelligence (AI) chips.
The directive from Beijing's Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) specifically told major firms, including Alibaba and Bytedance, to stop using Nvidia's products. This ban reportedly included a chip model that Nvidia had specifically designed to comply with existing U.S. export rules for the Chinese market.
This development heightened investor concerns about Nvidia's access to one of its key markets, adding to the regulatory pressures the company already faced in the region. The news sent ripples through the market, weighing on the broader technology sector and contributing to a drag on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.

Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Cracker Barrel, Ticketmaster and Live Nation and semiconductor stocks. First up, Cracker Barrel. The company reporting earnings for the first time since its logo fiasco, joining us for more, Yahoo Finance's Brooke De Palma. Of course, we're referring to the situation where it said it was going to change its logo, there was a big backlash against change the logo, then it said no, never mind, we're not going to change it after all. Well, how did all that translate into sales for the company?
Yeah, well, what we saw in this past quarterly report is ultimately this quarter did end on August 1st. And so they didn't really get an exact take on how exactly this hubbub, all this drama of the back and forth, the pull of the designs, the reverting to the former design actually ended up going, but that happened on August 19th when they officially introduced that logo. And what we did hear on the call was that ultimately what led them to really cut this outlook was because they did say
that in the first half of August, they did see traffic that had been down about 1%. And then after that logo change was announced on August 19th, they did see traffic decline approximately 8% since then since then. And so ultimately that led to the company to say that they expect a traffic decline between 4 to percent to 7% for fiscal year 2026. Keep in mind that
the way the cracker bar reports, they're already in fiscal year 2026 and so the current fiasco that's going on is the first quarter of their next fiscal year already.
I mean, I never thought that much about corporate logos of places where I eat out, but I guess a lot of people do.
A lot of people do. Absolutely. and it definitely hit their younger consumer, which they've been trying to trying to get as well.
All right, let's talk about Ticketmaster and Live Nation now. The FTC and seven states sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster for failing to stem the use of automated ticketing bots and large-scale resell operations. The shares of Live Nation down about 2.2%. And this is not um surprise surprise necessarily because the administration has been talking about, Congress has been investigating, all of this has been leading up to this.
Yeah, certainly leading up to this. And in some you know, anecdotes that we're getting this morning saying that a settlement's also possible here right now. this is particular um between Ticketmaster and Live Nation. They did say that Live Nation could be on the hook for billions of dollars as the law allows potential penalties of $53,000 per a violation. So really we are seeing that stock dip just a bit based upon this news. It did dip lower upon the initial announcement of this FTC uh
rather investigations here as well. But year to date, Live Nation has been doing well. There is still a lot of bulls on the street when it comes to the support or rather ratings for buys. There's 19 buys, there's three holds and just two sells. And this company year to date is up about 27 and a half percent. And so despite this noise in the background that's surrounding the company, this ultimately has gotten a lot of rhetoric for the potential outlook
on the street. I'm reading a note right now from CFRA and they said that concert touring ecosystem changed and scales matters and well, this also plays into the investigation here. There's no other competitor really to live Nation. and that's where we're hearing a lot of this background noise as well.
Yeah, I mean there are some other ticketing platforms here and there. StubHub also just went public, although it's mostly secondary ticketing that it does. Um, and there's also the question of if Ticketmaster does eliminate the bots or cut down, successfully cut down the bots, it'll still have majority market share, presumably. So we'll see how all of this plays out. It's a fascinating story though.
Yeah. And I feel like the attention was really broad when people tried to get those Taylor Swift tickets.
Well, I was just talking in the break to the CEO guest we just had on a few moments ago. He was trying to get Taylor Swift for his daughter's 17th birthday. ended up having to get tickets in Chicago instead of New York, had to get it on a secondary platform. As we know, those tickets were very, very pricey.
But hey, that played into the whole people traveling, the ecosystem, the boom to the economy, all because of Taylor Swift and now we're even hearing it once again in this today.
We are. All right, we'll see how it plays out. And then finally, let's talk about chip stocks because ETFs in the space are outperforming after the Nvidia Intel deal. Of course, Nvidia, the announcement this morning that it was going to invest $5 billion in Intel, the two are going to develop uh CPUs together. You can see um the VanEck Semiconductor ETFs, SMH, which we used to track the industry
is up 4.2%. And the trending ticker's page here at Yahoo Finance is just littered with companies that are sort of tangentially related to this.
Absolutely. We see AMD. they're up we're down rather about nearly 3%. We have strategy down more than 6%. We also do have uh others as well, also trending, but really when you think about that SMH ticker right there, that includes Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, it includes Broadcom, AMD, Micron. And so really all these companies have really outperformed once again this year, and now we're seeing the back tail of that news on an Nvidia Intel deal here once again playing into that.
Yeah, you also have, you know, kind of other things helping out matters here. Yeah, the announcement that Microsoft was increasing an investment in data centers in Wisconsin, I think, to $7 billion. So this sort of waxing and waning of the AI spending, how what's the cadence of it. Um, and so today you have it on the upswing. I also notice um Synopsys shares are trending. That's the design chip design software company um that counts Nvidia among one of its biggest clients. So it too is getting a boost today.
Yeah, and if I'm looking at the semiconductor stocks on our wife interactive, we do have that mostly in the green today. and Intel of course leading that charge is up nearly 29% just today alone. Year to date, this company has certainly seen a roller coaster of investor response based upon honestly what's happening with its relationship with the Trump administration, the investments that it's getting and the support that it's getting there. Now on top of that we're hearing that Nvidia also investing in the company, but really mostly in the green. We have AMD and arm down today and broadcom just up ever so slightly about 70 of a percent.
Concern that they might have the most to lose from this partnership. but we'll see how it plays out. Thanks, Brook. I appreciate it. As always, you can scan the QR code below to track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance's trending tickers page."

finnhub,NVDA,2025-09-18T16:37:00,Cathie Wood Just Bought Baidu Stock. Should You?,The iconic growth investor is buying China's leading search engine operator for the first time in almost four months.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=0a70246007fcdae8e0ce3d6b5b7a02ac769d5e816a6d134b4eaf8c1dcb4a86aa,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://www.fool.com/investing/cathie-wood-just-bought-baidu-stock-should-you/,https://www.fool.com/investing/cathie-wood-just-bought-baidu-stock-should-you/,https://www.fool.com/investing/cathie-wood-just-bought-baidu-stock-should-you/,fool.com,200,,"Cathie Wood did something on Wednesday that she hasn't done in nearly four months. The Ark Invest founder CEO added to her existing stake in Baidu (BIDU 1.33%). It seems like a good time to buy China's leading search engine operator. The stock is rallying lately, as analysts warm up to Baidu.
Baidu is becoming an unlikely winner in the tariff trade war. Despite its recent sluggish growth, Baidu is emerging as a beneficiary of the import restrictions of potent artificial intelligence (AI) chips into China. Toss in an iconic hometown brand with a rock-bottom valuation, and Baidu could be the market's latest momentum play.
Back to the future
Baidu is in a funk. Revenue is declining for the fourth time in the last six years. Last month's second-quarter report failed to impress. Revenue declined 4%. The news only gets worse at the other end of the income statement, with adjusted earnings plummeting 35%. The stock was barely trading higher in 2025 a month ago, but Baidu has soared 53% since then.
You can thank Chinese import restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip and other U.S. AI solutions for the rally in Baidu. Nvidia and its peers may have rallied earlier this summer when the framework of a deal with the White House was in place. Nvidia would offer the U.S. 15% of the revenue it generates in China as a way to get back into world's second-largest economy. It was losing billions in quarterly revenue with the restrictions, so keeping 85% of the revenue of high-margin AI training chips was better than nothing.
Unfortunately it takes two to trade tango. Reports this week out of China find Beijing internet regulators blocking companies from buying chips like Nvidia's China-specific RTX Pro 6000D, jump-starting the prospects for homegrown solutions. This is the opportunity that Baidu has been waiting for.
Baidu was a Chinese pioneer in AI before it was cool. It has more AI-related patent applications -- topping 5,700 -- than any other company in China. Being early isn't enough. Its AI cloud business posted 34% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter, but it wasn't enough to lift overall top-line results into positive territory. It's hard to move the needle when the sluggish online advertising business from its flagship search engine continues drum up almost two-thirds of Baidu's core revenue.
Analysts are starting to connect the dots this week. Arete boosted its rating on Baidu from sell to buy on Tuesday, a rare double upgrade. The firm believes that Baidu's Kunlun AI chip business will be a beneficiary of supply shortages in China given the trading restrictions with Nvidia. The new price target of $143 seemed high two weeks ago, but after two days of pops the stock is now just a 4% gain away from hitting that goal. On Wednesday it was Thomas Chong at Jefferies raising his target on the shares from $108 to $157, also citing the golden opportunity for Baidu's AI chips.
A cheap AI chip stock
There is still a lot of money to be made in operating the country's largest search engine. Revenue may be heading in the wrong direction, but this is still a cash cow worth milking. Other businesses -- like its iQIYI video streaming service -- are faring even worse. Search provides Baidu with the means to make big early bets on emerging industries, like it did with AI that could be the ticket to make it a market darling again.
In the meantime, Baidu is cheaper than you probably think. Despite soaring more than 50% over the past month, the stock is trading for less than 13 times trailing adjusted earnings. Profits are going the wrong way right now, but analysts see a return to bottom-line growth starting next year. Analysts see Baidu trading for just 9 times their profit targets for 2028 and less than 8 come 2029. The shares moving higher will naturally also drive those multiples higher, but Wall Street pros aren't baking in the kind of profitability that Baidu can achieve if its AI chip business continues to take off. The margins won't be as wide in AI as its search business, but this could become a major contributor if Baidu continues to sign up major Chinese customers.
If you're looking for a cheap AI stock that is somehow becoming a winner at the expense of Nvidia and the trade war, this could be it. Ark Invest's Wood seems to think so. It will be interesting to see if she continues to build up her stake as analysts revisit the former market laggard."

AMD, it turns out, is down 3% through 10:55 a.m. ET.
Intel + Nvidia = bad news for AMD
In case you haven't heard the news, here's a quick rundown. This morning, Nvidia announced it will buy $5 billion worth of Intel stock at $23.28 per share. (That's a 6.5% discount to Intel's closing share price Wednesday, a sweet deal on Intel stock for Nvidia). The two chips giants will also team up to build new ""custom data center and PC products"" together.
""Seamlessly connecting Nvidia and Intel architectures using Nvidia NVLink,"" Nvidia will add its own artificial intelligence (AI) to Intel's leading position in chips for PCs to dominate the market for PCs using AI.
Is AMD stock a sell?
Now, if all of this sounds to you like bad news for AMD, I agree. Two of the company's biggest rivals -- in AI, in PCs, in everything high-tech, basically -- can now team up to squash AMD like a software bug. Granted, I personally can't imagine antimonopoly regulators agreeing to let anything like this happen, and I'd expect court challenges to arise.
If they don't, however, and this partnership is allowed to proceed, I foresee trouble ahead for AMD.
Now, factor in the fact that AMD stock costs an incredible 95 times earnings already -- a premium valuation that's probably no longer justified in light of its diminished prospects -- and now might be a good time to sell your AMD stock."

A top government advisor in Beijing has recently called on the country to ditch Nvidia for China’s own technology.
While speaking to a forum in Singapore, Professor Wei Shaojun said that Asian countries, including China, should develop their own chips to create AI and reduce reliance on general-purpose GPUs that are used to power platforms like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, while adding that Asian firms were at risk of becoming beholden to American technology.
“It’s unfortunate to see that we in Asia, including China, are emulating the US when it comes to developing algorithms and large models.”
U.S. curbs have prevented Chinese firms from acquiring cutting-edge chips for several years now, with companies having to grapple with a lack of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI accelerators.
Despite DeepSeek’s recent emergence on the global stage, Chinese companies are still a few years behind the best that is commercially available today. However, it did show the ability of Chinese firms to enhance their AI algorithms even without the most advanced hardware.

Well, first up, it's Nvidia and shares are bouncing back after dipping in yesterday's trade. The swings are linked to trade negotiations, some big headlines. So, let's recap. Yesterday, Nvidia found itself in the crosshairs of US-China negotiations when Chinese authorities essentially blocked sales of Nvidia processors to big Chinese tech companies.
The CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, said he's disappointed, but he's he understands the geopolitical backdrop and competition is getting more heated. Just today, Chinese giant Huawei unveiled a new chip cluster to challenge the American market leader.
Today, analysts are still cautiously optimistic that Nvidia will deliver on its sky high growth projections in the long term. And importantly, the Fed rate cut is driving stocks higher overall. And we've just had some breaking news on Nvidia. It's said to invest up to $5 billion into struggling chipmaker Intel. And that's just broken in the last few moments.
Okay, next up, it's Ionic, the quantum computing company stock remains hot.
I Ion Q, sorry, the quantum the quantum computing company stock remains hot, up about 6% this morning near 60 5% up near $68.70 as you can see there. Pushed up by a series of catalyst. This week, the firm secured final UK regulatory approval for its $1 billion acquisition of Oxford Ionics.
That news extended a new rally that began at its 2025 analyst day where IonQ unveiled a road map to build a powerful quantum cubit system and announced its IonQ federal division to serve US government customers. Analysts at Needham and Canter Fitzgerald raised price targets to $60 to $80, but keep in mind, it's been a very volatile stock this year with more than 100 moves greater than 5%.
Very quickly, let's take a look at how Lift is doing this morning. The ridehailing company closed 13, over 13% down, higher, sorry, last night and was up another two, 2%, 2.4% this morning in pre-market. Now down up just 1.4%. Now, it's pulled back a bit as you can see there. Investors are bullish after the ridehailing company announced a partnership with Waymo, that's Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit. The partnership triggered a raise in price targets and plenty of optimism.
Finally, Novo Nordisk, the maker of a Zempic and Wegovi. The news is that shares in Copenhagen are up pretty sharply, up nearly six nearly 7% now this morning and these days seeing any green at all is a big win for the Danish drug maker. If we can pull up the chart, I want to show you just how dreadful the past six months have been. But today, there might be some light at the end of the tunnel. Overnight, the company delivered positive results for its new obesity drug.
The Oasis 4 phase 3 trial showed that a once daily pill delivered a weight loss of between 16.6 and 20%. It's a big step in Novo's push to offer a more convenient pill, but of course, big challenges remain with competition from Eli Lilly and internal restructuring under a new CEO.
Okay, time to hear from a CEO who's just pulled off a much anticipated IPO. Let's take a look at that this new ticker that just hit the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Stub had a bit of a difficult start there. It's again in the red after closing down over 6% on its first day of trading."

“This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
Nvidia will buy Intel shares at a price of $23.28, slightly less than the company's closing price on Wednesday, but more than the $20.47 per share the government paid. The deal will require regulatory approvals and will make Nvidia a 4% owner of Intel.
The CEOs of the two companies will hold a news conference Thursday at 1 p.m. E.T. to discuss the deal.
While the companies will work together to develop the new chips, Nvidia has not yet committed to a manufacturing deal with Intel for them. Instead, it will design custom processors for data centers, which Nvidia will sell alongside its AI GPUs. Nvidia will ensure its chips and the Intel chips communicate at higher speeds, which will encourage adoption.
At least one analyst said that while this is certainly a win for Intel, it could be a bigger victory for Nvidia in the long run.
""What this move really signals is Nvidia locking down the rules of the new digital economy,"" Futurum Group wrote in a note to investors. ""For the last decade, CPUs were the tax you paid to plug GPUs into racks. Now Nvidia is flipping that: the CPU becomes an extension of the GPU fabric. By taking a 5% stake in Intel and co-developing a NVLink-capable Xeon, Nvidia is ensuring that the world’s most entrenched compute base -- x86 -- becomes natively interoperable with its accelerators.""
For the PC market, Intel will build and offer chips that integrate Nvidia's RTX GPU, which should be popular with gamers and individuals who still attempt to mine Bitcoin from home.
“Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry,"" said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel.
It has been quite a ride recently for Tan. Last month, Donald Trump demanded his resignation, accusing him of having ties to China and saying Tan ""must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem.""
Two weeks later, the government announced an investment in Intel and halted all criticism of Tan. The stock has increased 28% since Trump's comments, not counting Thursday's pre-market gains. With those, the jump is 65%."

2. Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates, But Outlook Unclear for Additional Cuts
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered the quarter percentage point interest rate cut that investors expected, but Chair Jerome Powell couldn’t guarantee that more were on the way. Fed officials on average expect two more rate cuts in the Fed's remaining two meetings of the year, but Powell said those projections were dependent on upcoming economic data releases. Meanwhile, the Fed’s economic outlook projected moderate growth, stable unemployment, and slowing inflation, with officials split on how aggressively to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings.
3. Intel Stock Soars as Nvidia Announces $5 Billion Investment
Nvidia (NVDA) will invest $5 billion in embattled rival Intel (INTC) as the two tech firms agreed to jointly develop chips for personal computers and data centers. As part of the agreement, Intel will build custom processing units that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure, while it will also integrate Nvidia chips into its personal computers. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The move comes after the federal government took a 10% stake in Intel. Shares of Intel were up about 30% in recent premarket trading, while Nvidia shares added 3%.
4. Meta Showcases New AI-Powered Glasses
Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday unveiled new AI-powered glasses as part of its developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which the company said “takes microphones, speakers, cameras, and a full-color display backed with compute and AI — and puts it all together in a single device that’s stylish and comfortable.” The device also comes with the Meta Neural Band wrist monitor that tracks movements to help control the glasses. The glasses will be priced at $799, the company said. Meta shares were little change in premarket trading.
5. StubHub Falls in First Trading Session
Ticket reseller StubHub (STUB) shares fell in their first session of trading yesterday after its initial public offering. StubHub priced shares at $23.50, and the stock climbed to above $26 during the session before closing at $22. StubHub sold 34 million shares and raised $800 million in the IPO. The money will go toward paying down debt, CEO Eric Baker said on CNBC. StubHub shares were down 2% ahead of the bell on Thursday."

The decline came after Nvidia and Intel revealed plans to collaborate on developing multiple generations of custom data center and PC products. Intel will build Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs for AI infrastructure platforms and develop x86 system-on-chips that integrate Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets for personal computing devices.
The partnership represents a significant shift in the semiconductor landscape, as Nvidia has traditionally relied heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing for producing its advanced chips. Intel’s manufacturing capabilities could now capture some of that business, particularly as Nvidia commits to a $5 billion investment in Intel’s common stock.
Taiwan Semiconductor has been the world’s leading contract chip manufacturer, with Nvidia as one of its most important customers amid the AI boom. The Intel-Nvidia collaboration signals a potential diversification of Nvidia’s manufacturing strategy, which could impact TSM’s future revenue streams.
The announcement sent Intel shares surging approximately 30% as investors viewed the partnership as validation of Intel’s manufacturing turnaround efforts and its potential to compete more effectively in the AI chip production space.
The news also impacted other semiconductor companies, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) each falling 5%. Investors appear concerned that the Nvidia-Intel partnership could reshape competitive dynamics in the semiconductor industry, potentially reducing TSM’s manufacturing role as Intel leverages its own fabrication capabilities

- Nvidia stake follows big investment from US government
- Nvidia's $5 billion investment makes it one of Intel's largest shareholders
- Intel-Nvidia partnership poses risk to TSMC and AMD
- Collaboration aims to enhance AI and computing capabilities
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nvidia said on Sept. 18 it would invest $5 billion in Intel, throwing its heft behind the struggling U.S. chipmaker just weeks after the White House engineered an extraordinary deal for the federal government to take a massive stake in the company.
The deal, however does not address the root problem facing Intel's construction project in central Ohio.
The stake will instantly make Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, giving it roughly 4% of the company after new shares are issued to complete the deal. Nvidia's support represents a new opening for Intel after years of turnaround efforts failed to pay off, and it triggered a 25% jump in the U.S. manufacturer's shares.
The company – once the chip industry's flag bearer that claimed to put the ""silicon"" in Silicon Valley – appointed a new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, in March. He quickly came under fire from U.S. elected officials, including President Donald Trump, who called for him to resign due to concerns about his connections with China. That led to a swiftly arranged meeting in Washington that ended with Intel's unusual arrangement to give the U.S. a 10% stake in the company.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters on a call that the Trump administration had not been involved in the partnership deal but would have been supportive. Huang was seen with Trump and other business leaders during the U.S. president's state visit to the United Kingdom on Thursday.
This new pact includes a plan for Intel and Nvidia to jointly develop PC and data center chips, but crucially will not involve Intel's contract manufacturing business, known as a ""foundry"" in the chip industry, making computing chips for Nvidia. Intel's foundry business will, however, supply the central processors and advanced packaging for the joint products. Huang said his company was continuing to evaluate Intel's foundry technology and had been working with the rival for nearly a year.
Neither CEO addressed how the deal would affect Intel's ambitious plan to invest $28 billion into two chip manufacturing facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany. The project was originally slated to open this year, but Intel's problems have forced that to be delayed until 2030 at the earliest.
Most analysts believe that for Intel's foundry to survive, it would need to win a large customer such as Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm or Broadcom.
""This may be the first step of an acquisition or breakup of the company (Intel) among U.S. chip makers though it is entirely possible the company will remain a shadow of its former self but will survive,"" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments.
Nvidia, whose must-have chips are powering a global artificial intelligence boom, said it would pay $23.28 per share for Intel common stock, slightly below the $24.90 Wednesday closing price but higher than the $20.47 price the U.S. government paid. Nvidia shares were up 3.8% on Thursday.
The companies did not disclose the financial terms of their collaboration but said they would make ""multiple generations"" of future products.
The deal adds to Intel's growing reserve of capital, following a $2 billion investment from Softbank and the $5.7 billion investment from the U.S. government.
CEO Tan has vowed to make Intel's operations lean and build factory capacity only when there is demand to match it.
""This is a massive game-changer for Intel and effectively resets its position of AI-laggard into a cog in future AI infrastructure,"" said Gadjo Sevilla, senior AI and tech analyst at eMarketer.
Risks to TSMC, AMD
The pact represents a potential risk to Taiwan's TSMC, which currently manufactures Nvidia's flagship processors, a business the world's most valuable company could one day extend to Intel. AMD, which competes with Intel for supplying chips to data centers, also stands to lose thanks to Nvidia's backing.
TSMC declined comment; AMD did not respond to a request for comment.
""AMD has been seizing market share in desktops and laptops for quite some time and this will help Nvidia out against its closest domestic peers, but I think TSMC may have the bigger risk to its operation over the long term,"" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors.
Under the terms of the deal, Intel will design custom data-center central processors Nvidia plans to package with its AI chips, known as GPUs. A proprietary Nvidia technology will let the Intel and Nvidia chips communicate at higher speeds than before.
Speedy links are a key differentiator in the AI market because many chips must be strung together to act as one to chew through massive amounts of data. Currently, Nvidia's best-selling AI servers with those links are only available using Nvidia's own chips; this deal would put Intel on equal footing, giving it a chance to make money off each Nvidia server.
The combined Nvidia-Intel chips could challenge AMD, which is developing its own AI servers, and Broadcom, which also has chip-to-chip connection technology and helps companies such as Alphabet's Google develop AI chips. Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment.
For consumer markets, Nvidia will provide Intel with a custom graphics chip that Intel can package with its PC central processors with the same speedy links, potentially giving it an edge against AMD.
The companies did not say when the first joint products would come to market, but said their product plans prior to the deal had not changed."

The two companies will team up to work on custom data centres that form the backbone of artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as personal computer products, Nvidia said in a press release.
Nvidia said it will spend five billion dollars (£3.6 billion) to buy Intel common stock at 23.28 dollars a share.
The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the US government took a 10% stake in Intel.
“This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said.
“Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”
The two companies said they will work on “seamlessly connecting” their architectures.
For data centres, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms.
While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.
The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut.
Intel fell even further behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that has propelled Nvidia into the world’s most valuable company.
Intel lost nearly 19 billion dollars (£13.9 billion) last year and another 3.7 billion dollars (£2.7 billion) in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.
The US government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel’s biggest shareholders.
US President Donald Trump made the announcement weeks after he initially criticised the company’s chief executive as a conflicted leader unfit for the job.
Chief executive Lip-Bu Tan and Mr Trump later reconciled after meeting in person.
Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialised chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom.
The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.
The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on US semiconductor technology.

The collaboration between AMD’s two main rivals sent shockwaves through the semiconductor industry, with Intel shares surging 30% while AMD investors showed concern about potential competitive challenges. The partnership will focus on connecting Nvidia and Intel architectures using Nvidia’s NVLink technology, combining Nvidia’s AI expertise with Intel’s CPU technologies.
Under the agreement, Intel will manufacture custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure platforms. For the personal computing market, Intel will create x86 system-on-chips that integrate Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets, producing products that directly compete with AMD’s offerings in both data center and consumer segments.
Nvidia also announced a $5 billion investment in Intel common stock at $23.28 per share, further strengthening the alliance between the two technology companies.
The collaboration creates a significant competitive challenge for AMD, which has been gaining ground in both CPU and GPU markets. AMD has established itself as a strong competitor to both Intel in CPUs and Nvidia in GPUs, particularly in AI applications.
Mizuho TMT Sector Specialist Jordan Klein wrote, ""THIS IS BAD FOR AMD and will add pressure to ARM! No way to sugar coat or look past that NVDA could have gone with AMD who has CPU and gaming for PCs, but had to buy into INTC due to Trump. NVDA uses ARM for their Grace CPU, but now they moving towards x86 and INTC to offer a compliment and some next gen products.""
Klein added, ""To me this sort of pressures and squeezes AMD overall a lot more. They face intense pressure vs NDVA for GPUs. AVGO dominates on custom silicon that AMD does not have. And now you have a lot more pressure and risks to your GPU / CPU product platform from NVDA & INTC.""
The partnership announcement comes as competition in AI computing infrastructure has intensified, with AMD working to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing AI chip market.

Nvidia's support represents a new opening for Intel after years of turnaround efforts at the famed U.S. manufacturer failed to pay off. Intel shares climbed more than 25% in early trading.
Here are some comments from analysts on this deal.
COMMENTS:
NANCY TENGLER, CEO AND CIO AT LAFFER TENGLER INVESTMENTS ""The private sector can and will solve the INTC technology problem—one way or another—the government has an abysmal record in trying to do so. My guess? This may be the first step of an acquisition or break-up of the company among U.S. chip makers though it is entirely possible the company will remain a shadow of its former self but will survive.""
STEVE SOSNICK, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, CONNECTICUT
""The $5 billion investment is a relatively minor one from NVDA's point of view, but highly significant for INTC. It gives them a direction and a role in AI chip development that it didn't have yesterday. That's why INTC stock is reacting so strongly to the news while causing only a modest rise in NVDA.""
""The open question, which I hope we'll learn the answer to later, is how much of a role the Administration played in this deal. It was reported that the President would be speaking with (Nvidia CEO) Jensen Huang, so it is probably not a coincidence. It certainly raises the value of the government's investment, but it could call into question the idea of the government picking winners and losers since the deal is not good news for AMD because the INTC/NVDA linkup makes them a more formidable competitor.""
PIPER SANDLER ANALYSTS
""We think this initiative protects NVDA against a core competency that AMD currently holds, as AMD has been steadily gaining share and highlighting the role of its server CPUs in AI infrastructure.""
""In addition, the partnership extends to personal computing, with NVDA contributing RTX GPU chiplets to INTC's x86 CPUs. We view this development as a positive for NVIDIA and a negative for AMD over the longer-term.""
GADJO SEVILLA, SENIOR AI AND TECH ANALYST, EMARKETER
""This is a massive game changer for Intel and effectively resets its position of AI-laggard into a cog in future AI infrastructure. Nvidia's investment and 4% to 5% ownership of Intel ensures Intel's short-term survival, opens the door for a larger takeover (not likely due to antitrust), and gives Nvidia a direct line to Intel's foundry business for future GPU production."""

While many institutional traders do employ advanced algorithmic strategies, their moves are not entirely hidden from the public.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires firms managing $100 million or more in stocks to file a form 13F at the end of each quarter. These filings reveal which stocks were bought and sold, offering investors a rare window into where ""smart money"" is moving. One investor I follow closely is Stanley Druckenmiller of the Duquesne Family Office.
Earlier this year, Druckenmiller exited Duquesne's stake in data analytics specialist Palantir Technologies. Meanwhile, over the past four quarters, he has been steadily building a position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.22%).
Let's examine why trimming exposure to Palantir could prove a timely decision -- and how reallocating capital into Taiwan Semi could generate stronger returns in the long run.
Does Selling Palantir stock make sense right now?
Palantir has been a dominant force in the AI revolution over the past three years. The launch of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has ignited unprecedented demand for the company's Apollo, Gotham, and Foundry applications -- each of which are deeply integrated across major corporations and government agencies. The company's meteoric rise has been remarkable, giving investors a compelling narrative outside of the traditional ""Magnificent Seven.""
That said, I see Palantir's valuation as its most glaring concern. With a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 126, the stock trades at levels not only well above its software peers, but also beyond the extremes that were witnessed during the dot-com bubble.
While Palantir remains a company with meaningful upside potential in the long run, the stock has become frothy at the moment. Druckenmiller's decision to reduce exposure to Palantir reflects prudent risk management -- something he has demonstrated with Palantir stock previously, too.
What might Druckenmiller like about TSMC stock?
For years, investors have heard about big tech pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and network equipment to power the next generation of data centers. The obvious takeaway is that rising capital expenditures (capex) create a powerful tailwind for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, given their role in supplying the GPUs that make generative AI a reality.
What is discussed far less, however, is that designs from Nvidia, AMD, and many others ultimately depend on the foundry services of Taiwan Semiconductor. Put simply, TSMC (as it is also known) is the company actually assembling the chips. The metaphor that I like to use is that Taiwan Semi is selling the shovels during the AI gold rush.
This story doesn't end with generative AI, either. New classes of applications across autonomous systems, robotics, and quantum computing are only just beginning to emerge. As they scale toward commercial viability, TSMC's unrivaled foundry capabilities should once again serve as a critical backbone to ongoing AI infrastructure investment.
I suspect that these secular tailwinds are precisely what Druckenmiller is trying to capitalize on: a company positioned not just to participate in the AI movement, but ultimately remain an indispensable foundation to its evolution.
Is Taiwan Semi stock a buy right now?
At first glance, it's difficult to argue that Taiwan Semi stock is ""cheap"" with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 26. Valuation expansion is clearly happening at the moment, fueled by a bullish macro backdrop in the technology landscape.
Yet beneath the surface, investors like Druckenmiller seem to recognize TSMC's role in the AI value chain. Despite this, the company remains overshadowed by flashier peers. Some investors are also likely hesitating over investing in Taiwan Semi due to potential geopolitical tensions with China.
While these concerns are valid, I think the perception around Taiwan Semi's long-term potential has become distorted. In other words, some of these factors as well as hype concentrated in other chip stocks are undermining what is otherwise a clear investment case.
To me, TSMC may be the single most critical variable in the broader AI equation. For long-term investors, Taiwan Semi stock looks like a no-brainer opportunity to buy and hold as the AI narrative continues to unfold."

Nvidia on Thursday said it plans to purchase $5 billion of Intel shares at $23.28 per share. The investment comes as part of a broader collaboration between the two semiconductor giants to develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products.
The news also drove shares of NVIDIA higher. The AI giant’s stock closed up 3.5%.
The partnership will focus on connecting Nvidia and Intel architectures using Nvidia NVLink technology, combining Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing capabilities with Intel’s CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem.
Under the agreement, Intel will build Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms. For personal computing, Intel will develop x86 system-on-chips that incorporate Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets, which will power various PCs requiring integration of high-performance CPUs and GPUs.
At a joint Nvidia/Intel conference call midday on Thursday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that he believes the ""return on Intel investment will be fantastic,"" adding that the company is also ""becoming major customer of Intel server CPUs,"" as well as ""evaluating Intel’s foundry technology.""
Analysts at Baird view the announcement as ""a clear win for Intel’s CEO which has aimed to secure at least one flagship client in manufacturing,"" adding that the deal ""will promote market share gains and foundry revenue growth."" Additionally, they see it as positive ""for Nvidia (TAM expansion), for Rambus (x86 demand resurgence and higher content in AI architectures), and for Micron. Some headwind for AMD (combination of CPU and GPU leaders). Neutral at best for custom ASICs (Nvidia’s custom x86 CPUs could potentially reduce AI BOMs in certain applications).""
Wedbush echoed the positive sentiment, noting that the ""announcement further strengthens the US lead in the AI Arms Race against China,"" and turns Intel ""from a laggard to a catalyst.""
Speaking of the broader impact on the semiconductor space, Wolfe Research sees the deal as ""very marginally negative for AMD (since it potentially makes INTC a bit more competitive), and also very marginally negative for ARM (since it makes x86 more competitive on NVDA’s AI platforms).""
This announcement follows August agreement between Intel and the Trump Administration, which included an $8.9 billion government investment in Intel. That investment comprised $5.7 billion in previously awarded but unpaid grants under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, plus $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program."

What Wall Street Has Been Saying
Recent analyst commentary on NVIDIA continues to highlight a dynamic mix of optimism and caution. The majority of research reports following the latest earnings cycle have delivered upward price target revisions and reaffirmed the secular bull thesis, although some voices urge restraint given valuations and competitive pressures. Below are key themes emerging from Wall Street’s latest views:
🐂 Bullish Takeaways
-
Several analysts, including Morgan Stanley with a target lift to $235, have cited persistent, outsized demand for NVIDIA’s AI compute products. They applaud the accelerated ramps of Blackwell and GB300/B300 platforms as critical growth drivers.
-
Bullish sentiment builds on NVIDIA’s demonstrated execution and operational transparency. Analysts reward the company's cost control, expanding production capacity, and clear multi-year revenue guidance anchored by data center growth.
-
Resumed shipments to China, following regulatory clearances for the H20 and other GPUs, are seen by names like Goldman Sachs as a potential $2 billion to $5 billion near-term revenue tailwind. This further underpins positive earnings revisions.
-
Reservations are primarily focused on valuation concerns. Some analysts, such as BofA Securities, are raising targets (now $230) but noting that much of the anticipated upside may already be reflected in the share price and that steep investor expectations leave little room for disappointment in the near term.
🐻 Bearish Takeaways
-
A minority of analysts maintain a cautious stance. Firms like UBS are trimming their target to $200, expressing concern that increasing competition from Broadcom, Alphabet’s TPUs, and other emerging solutions could begin to erode NVIDIA’s dominant position.
-
Bears highlight that the bar for execution remains high. NVIDIA’s market-leading valuation and price-to-earnings multiples hinge on flawless delivery, and any missteps or “imperfections” in quarterly results could catalyze pullbacks.
-
The risk that institutions remain underweight in the stock relative to S&P 500 benchmarks is also flagged as a potential headwind should sentiment shift or market leadership rotate away from AI.
-
While acknowledging the secular, long-term AI compute growth story, cautious voices contend that significant future gains may already be discounted into the current valuation. This could limit near-term appreciation unless fundamentals outpace even the loftiest Street projections."

Fed officials voted in favor of a 25 basis point reduction, a move highly anticipated by the market, following the central bank's two day policy meeting.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped 0.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.3%.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference that the Fed decision was a ""risk management cut"" as the labor market has been deteriorating against a backdrop of elevated inflation.
In addition to the rate cut, Fed policy makers also signaled two more rate cuts this year. A labor market slowdown was expected to convince Fed officials to pivot toward more rate cuts, despite an uptick in inflation.
The Fed's decision came amid growing concerns over the central bank's independence. While President Trump has lambasted Powell, he may soon be able to exert more direct influence over policymakers. Newly confirmed Fed governor Stephen Miran, nominated by Trump, was the only dissent, wanting a 50 basis point cut, instead of 25. Meanwhile Lisa Cook took part in the policy decision after an appeals court rebuffed Trump's attempt to oust the Fed governor.

Powell: 'There are no risk-free paths now'
Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the central bank’s difficult task of balancing its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.
The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut rates by 25 basis points comes as the job market shows signs of slowing, while inflation remains elevated.
“There are no risk-free paths now,” Powell said, noting a wide dispersion of forecasts among Fed policymakers.
During the press conference following the decision, Powell described the move as “a risk management cut.”

Powell: Diverging Fed projections natural in 'unusual' economy
Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the limits of the central bank’s economic projections on Wednesday, underscoring that policymakers remain data-dependent even as the Fed embarks on a new easing cycle.
“It’s an accumulation of the individual projections of 19 people,"" Powell said. ""We’re not on a preset path. Actual decisions will be based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.”
That balance of risks, Powell noted, is unusually complex: “Ordinarily, when the labor market is weak, inflation is low. And when the labor market is really strong, that’s when you should be careful about inflation. We have a situation where we have two-sided risk. There’s no risk-free path.”
The Summary of Economic Projections showed a wide range of views among Fed officials, with most penciling in at least one additional cut this year. But opinions diverged on how far policy should ease.
Powell said the dispersion was “natural” given the highly ""unusual"" backdrop facing the US economy.
“It would actually be surprising if you didn’t have a pretty wide range of views in this kind of situation,” he said.

Powell frames Fed’s rate cut as 'risk management' amid weakening labor market
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell framed the central bank’s rate cut as a way to guard against rising risks in the labor market.
“Yeah, I think you could think of this in a way as a risk-management cut,"" Powell told reporters during his post-decision press conference.
Powell noted that the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections still shows slightly stronger growth for this year and next, with inflation and unemployment largely unchanged. What has shifted, he said, is the outlook for the labor market, where the risks now look far more pronounced.
“We were looking at 150,000 jobs a month at the time of the last meeting,"" he explained. ""And now we see the revisions and we see the new numbers, and I don't want to put too much emphasis on payroll job creation, but it's just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off.”

Powell: 'Low hiring, low firing' economy straining young, minority workers
Fed Chair Powell acknowledged growing cracks in the labor market on Friday, citing particular strain for young workers and recent graduates.
He pointed to those “on the margin” — recent grads, younger workers, and minorities — who are struggling to find jobs.
""The overall job-finding rate is very, very low,"" he said. ""However, the layoff rate is also very low. So you’ve got a low firing, low hiring environment. And the concern is that if you start to see layoffs … there won’t be a lot of hiring going on.""
That backdrop echoes recent data showing the unemployment rate for Americans ages 16 to 24 climbed above 10% in August for the first time since the pandemic. For recent college graduates, the picture is also troubling: Their jobless rate now exceeds that of the broader workforce for the first time in more than a decade, according to Bank of America Institute analysis of BLS and Census Bureau data compiled by the New York Fed.
Powell warned that in a “healthier economy,” displaced workers would be able to quickly find new opportunities, but today’s weak hiring rate raises the risk of unemployment rising more sharply.
“That’s been a growing concern over the last few months,” he said.

Powell asked about 2% target and persistent inflation
Powell was asked repeatedly about persistent inflation and whether the Fed's 2% target is achievable.
""No one really knows where the economy will be in three years,"" said Powell.
However, the Fed chair reiterated that the base case is that tariff impacts will result in a one-time price jump and inflation should not remain persistent, especially given a weaker labor market.

Fed 'dot plot' reveals officials expect 2 more cuts in 2025
The Federal Reserve's latest ""dot plot,"" which outlines policymakers' interest rate projections, now signals two additional rate cuts in 2025, on top of the quarter-point move announced Wednesday.
That path would bring the benchmark rate down to a range of 3.50% to 3.75% by year-end.
On Wednesday, the Fed lowered its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 4.00% to 4.25%, marking its first cut of the year. Back in June, officials had penciled in two cuts in total, which would have taken the benchmark to a range of 3.75% to 4.0% by December.
Alongside the policy decision, the Fed released updated economic forecasts in its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), offering fresh insight into how officials expect growth, inflation, and unemployment to evolve in the months ahead.
The central bank raised its projections for economic growth at the end of the year and held steady its forecast for inflation and unemployment, although the central bank did say in its policy statement that the downside risks to employment have risen.

Powell: 'We have begun to see goods prices showing through' in higher inflation
Powell was asked about tariffs and the deteriorating labor market. The Fed chair indicated the impact has been seen on inflation.
""We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation, and actually the increase in goods prices accounts for most of the increase in inflation, or perhaps all of the increase in inflation over the course of this year,"" he said.

Powell: 'Downside risks to employment appear to have risen'
Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged on Wednesday that the labor market has been deteriorating, while inflation has risen recently and remained somewhat elevated.
""Overall, the market slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual,"" said Powell during the Federal Reserve's press conference following a two-day policy meeting.
""In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,"" he added.
Powell's comments come after Fed officials voted to cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.

The bullish reaction in stocks immediately following the Fed decision faded with just 15 minutes to go before Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks at his 2:30 p.m. ET presser on Wednesday.

S&P 500 turns positive
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) turned positive after the Federal Reserve cut the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, to a new range of 4%-4.25% and signaled two more rate cuts this year.
The decision was not unanimous. Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut by 50 basis points instead of 25.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up more than 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) trimmed session losses, but still stayed in red territory.

Cracker Barrel to report latest earnings as it aims to move past logo backlash
Cracker Barrel (CBRL) is set to report its quarterly results Wednesday after market close.
The stock has faced a turbulent month as investors responded to backlash against its new logo and redesigns.
The company has since reverted to its previous logo and paused restaurant redesigns. Now, investors are eager to hear more about how its the logo-related 'hubbub' drove near-term traffic to the country restaurant.
Based on Bloomberg consensus estimates, Wall Street expects Cracker Barrel's fourth quarter revenue for its 2025 fiscal year to fall 4% from a year ago to roughly $855 million and adjusted earnings per share to fall 22% to $0.76 from $0.98. Its fourth quarter ended Aug. 1, prior to the unveiling of the company's new logo on Aug 19.
Despite the recent noise, same-store sales for the quarter are expected to rise 3.49% compared to the 0.45% decline it saw in the same time period last year.
For the full year, Cracker Barrel previously said it expected fiscal 2025 revenue to come in between $3.45 billion and $3.5 billion.
Investors are also eyeing the company's long-term outlook. Cracker Barrel previously said it projects 2027 sales between $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion.
At the time of that multiyear guidance, the company said it was in the ""process of testing [restaurant] remodel prototypes"" and expected ""to complete 25 to 30 remodels in fiscal 2025.""
But those remodels have been suspended, and Cracker Barrel has said it will instead invest in its existing restaurants ""to make sure that they are in good shape"" and meet customers' expectations.
The stock is down roughly 4% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 12% gain.

Reddit pares losses on news of talks for AI content deal with Google
Reddit stock pared losses from earlier in the trading session after Bloomberg reported that the social media platform is in talks with Google for its next content-sharing agreement.
Reddit shares sank as much as 6.5% Wednesday but were down a more modest 3% in afternoon trading following the Bloomberg report.
The outlet said Reddit is in talks with the tech giant to more deeply integrate its data into Google's AI products following a $60 billion content sharing deal at the start of 2024. Bloomberg reported that Reddit is also talking with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Google to be paid more as its role in the companies' AI products becomes more important.

HIMS stock extends decline in wake of FDA warning letter
Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) stock fell nearly 3% on Wednesday morning, after dropping nearly 6% in the previous trading session.
The declines come after the US Food and Drug Administration sent the telehealth platform provider a warning letter last week. The FDA said Hims & Hers made false or misleading claims in its online marketing of its compounded semaglutide products.
HIMS stock has had a volatile year so far, but the San Francisco company's shares are up roughly 104% in 2025. In June, the stock suffered after Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) ended its partnership with Hims & Hers, accusing it of ""deceptive"" marketing.
HIMS is one of the top 10 most-shorted stocks in the US, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence Data, with some 30% of shares currently sold short.

Oracle stock drops, snapping a blistering rally for now
Oracle shares fell more than 2% early on Wednesday, halting its recent rally for now.
The AI cloud provider's stock has been on a tear after its latest quarterly financial report showed a massive backlog of contracts in its cloud business, reportedly led by OpenAI.
Adding to that winning streak was Oracle's reported role in a preliminary US-China deal for TikTok to continue operations in the US ahead of a ban. The deal is expected to be finalized on Friday during a call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Oracle's upswing added $193 billion to the software giant's market cap. But that gain has sparked bubble fears, given the stock is now more expensive than eight of the nine most valuable companies in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).
Plus, concerns have persisted over Oracle’s reliance on OpenAI and the ChatGPT maker’s ability to fund its reported $300 billion deal with the software giant.

Nvidia stock extends decline amid AI chip ban in China
Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell 2% after the market open on Wednesday, as investors weighed a Financial Times report that Chinese authorities told leading tech companies in the country not to use Nvidia's AI chips.
""The decision underscores Beijing’s push to cut reliance on US semiconductors amid intensifying AI competition with the US and the promotion of domestic chip and tool utilization,"" Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Felix Wang wrote in a note after the news.
China's internet regulator told companies to halt orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, which Nvidia custom-made for customers in the country.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly stressed the importance of the Chinese AI market, what he sees as a rapidly growing $50 billion market opportunity.
The exec lobbied the Trump administration to lift a US ban on exports of its lower-power H20 chips to China this summer in an unprecedented deal that involved Nvidia sharing its revenue from those sales with the government. Huang said in August that Nvidia is working on a less powerful version of its Blackwell chips for China.
But Huang told reporters during a briefing in London on Wednesday: “I think that we could only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be.”
“I’m disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out, you know, between China and the United States, and I’m understanding of that, and we’re patient about it,"" he added.

Lyft jumps 15% on Waymo partnership
Lyft (LYFT) shares jumped as much as 30% in premarket trading Wednesday after the ride hail company and Uber (UBER) rival said it's partnering with Alphabet-owned (GOOG, GOOGL) robotaxi firm Waymo to offer self-driving cabs in Nashville in 2026.
“We’re delighted to partner with Lyft and launch in Nashville next year, as we continue to scale our Waymo ride-hailing service to more people in more places,” Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a statement Wednesday.
Waymo is in expansion mode: the company on Tuesday said it obtained a permit to test its driverless taxis at the San Francisco International Airport, and its cabs are already available in the city of San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.
Uber shares fell 4% on news of the Waymo-Lyft partnership. Lyft shares pared initial gains, up 15% shortly before the market open.

Meeting takeaway: Eric Trump on crypto
I spent some time with first son Eric Trump and one of his crypto partners Asher Genoot of Hut 8 at Trump Tower on Tuesday afternoon. A large chunk of that time was devoted to all things crypto, naturally.
Besides being President Trump's son and EVP of the Trump Organization, Eric is also the co-founder of the newly public crypto miner American Bitcoin (ABTC). Genoot's Hut 8 — where he is CEO — provides the infrastructure (power, back office services, etc.) that allows American Bitcoin to mine bitcoin (BTC-USD).
I'll have a story out from this meeting on Yahoo Finance later today. But the one thing I haven't appreciated enough with the crypto story is how global and institutional it's becoming.
Sure, it's one thing to read a press release from BlackRock (BLK) saying it's trying to do more in the space. It's something else entirely to sit next to ultimate crypto insiders (Trump and Genoot in this case) and hear them walk you through the sovereign wealth funds plowing into various crypto investments.
""Every person I know is trying to buy bitcoin,"" Trump told me.
And I believe him.
If you are thinking that crypto is still all about retail traders buying with one eye closed, hoping another crypto winter is coming, you are missing the narrative that has helped propel the space in 2025 ... and will likely do so in 2026.

China's internet watchdog has ordered major tech firms to stop buying Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) AI chips and to cancel deals already in place, the Financial Times reported Wednesday.
ByteDance and Alibaba were among the firms told to halt testing of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a chip made for the Chinese market. The order goes beyond earlier curbs, which only covered the older H20 version.
The move comes just days after Beijing accused Nvidia of breaking anti-monopoly rules. And it lands against the backdrop of U.S. export controls that have already limited China's access to advanced chips.
Demand for the RTX6000D had been lukewarm anyway. Some firms had started trial runs with servers but pulled back once the regulator's notice arrived.
Nvidia shares slipped about 1% in premarket trading."

Sep 17 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell nearly 3% on Wednesday after reports said Chinese regulators ordered major tech firms to halt purchases of one of its latest artificial intelligence processors.
The Cyberspace Administration of China has told companies including Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and ByteDance to stop testing and ordering the RTX Pro 6000D, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The chip was designed specifically for the Chinese market and introduced in July.
The move marks another setback for Nvidia's ambitions in the world's second-largest economy. Earlier this year, Beijing signaled caution over the use of its H20 semiconductors. Nvidia has already excluded sales to China from its financial outlook.
Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at a London event on Wednesday that Nvidia can only operate in markets where it is welcomed. He added that broader issues between Washington and Beijing remain in play but said the company would remain patient.
Nvidia declined to comment on the reported restrictions. Alibaba and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment, according to the report."

China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips on Wednesday, as first reported by the Financial Times.
The agency also told tech companies including ByteDance and Alibaba to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.
Beijing had previously discouraged companies from buying these chips in late August, instead promoting alternatives from local manufacturers.
This ban will deliver quite a blow to China’s tech ecosystem. While companies like Huawei and Alibaba design AI chips locally, Nvidia is by far the global market leader, and its chips are considered to be some of the most advanced on the market.
When asked for comment, Nvidia provided the following statement from CEO Jensen Huang at a press conference on Wednesday: “We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,” Huang said. “I’m disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I’m patient about it. We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish.”
The Trump administration hit semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, with licensing requirements to sell their AI chips in China in April.
On Nvidia’s first-quarter earnings call, Huang had said Nvidia was going to endure $8 billion of revenue loss in the second quarter alone by not being able to sell its H20 AI chips in China.
In June, Nvidia said that it wouldn’t include China in its future profit and forecast as it was essentially locked out of the market.
In July, the Trump administration reversed course and gave semiconductor companies the green light to sell their chips in China again. In August, the White House announced it would grant the licenses needed to sell in China, but with a catch: the U.S. government would get 15% of the revenue from the chips sold. But as of Nvidia’s latest earnings, the company had yet to sell any units to Chinese customers under the plan, citing the slow implementation of President Trump’s proposal."

Groq just pulled in a massive $750 million, pushing its valuation to $6.9 billion and sending a loud signal to markets: investors are still hunting for credible challengers to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in AI infrastructure. After initially closing the round at $600 million, Groq reopened it to accommodate a wave of new capital from some heavyweight namesBlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Samsung (SSNLF), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, among others. Jonathan Ross, Groq's CEO, said the cash will go straight into expanding data center capacity, with new locations coming online this year and next. An Asia-Pacific facility is already on the roadmap for 2025, with the company racing to meet customer demand that's currently outstripping supply.
While Nvidia continues to dominate the training side of AI workloads, Groq is doubling down on inferencerunning models in production environmentswhere the race is wide open. The company isn't just shipping chips; it's selling compute power bundled with custom silicon across 13 global sites. Ross confirmed that all of Groq's recently added capacitymore than 10% in just the past monthis already spoken for. Groq has also become a key infrastructure partner for Saudi Arabia's Humain and supported OpenAI's GPT-OSS model deployment in the region, suggesting early traction in key international markets.
Still, expectations around revenue may require recalibration. According to The Information, Groq has trimmed more than $1 billion from its 2025 revenue outlook. Bloomberg later reported that the company believes the cut revenue could materialize in 2026 instead. Ross declined to comment on specific sales targets, but the reopened roundand the appetite that drove itsuggests investors are betting Groq could eventually scale into the gap left by today's chip bottlenecks."

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) just took a punch in the ribs from Beijing. According to Financial Times, China's internet regulator this week told companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to halt testing and cancel orders of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000Da high-end GPU designed specifically for the Chinese market. The directive, issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China, comes after earlier government pressure on firms to avoid Nvidia's H20 chips, which were allowed into China under President Trump's recalibrated export rules. This latest move could suggest Beijing's appetite for Nvidia hardware is waningor that the chips have become pawns in a bigger geopolitical chess game.
Adding fuel to the fire, China also ruled this week that Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Mellanox violated anti-monopoly laws, just days after launching an antidumping probe into U.S.-made analog semiconductors. Investors shouldn't mistake this for isolated skirmishing. The timingright before a scheduled call between President Trump and Xi Jinpingsuggests these actions could be calibrated bargaining chips. Nvidia, once the unlikely poster child for U.S.-China tech entanglement, now finds itself squarely in the crosshairs of regulatory and trade friction.
Still, this isn't necessarily a demand death knell. The RTX 6000D was never Nvidia's flagshipit was more of a workaround product, built to navigate Washington's restrictions. But China's confidence in local alternatives seems to be rising. Alibaba, for instance, has already lined up one of the country's top wireless carriers as a customer for its homegrown T-Head AI chips. Whether that signals a true turning point in China's tech self-sufficiencyor a temporary pressure tacticremains to be seen. For now, though, Nvidia's China outlook just got murkier."

On September 9, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has announced plans to launch a new AI chip called “Rubin CPX” by the end of 2026.
This new chip is based on the company’s next-generation Rubin architecture, following its recent Blackwell technology. Management noted that the new chip targets complex AI tasks such as video creation and AI-assisted software coding.
Data-heavy operations such as generating video or writing code require more processing power, which the current GPUs are struggling to handle. For instance, processing one hour of video can require handling up to 1 million tokens. To address this, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new chip integrates multiple processing steps, such as video decoding, encoding, and AI inference, into a single system. This integration aims to improve efficiency and speed for AI workloads.
The company plans to invest $100 million in these new systems and expects this to help unlock $5 billion in token-related revenue.
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs advanced computing products focused on accelerated computing and graphics.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Broadcom? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.
What Is The Market Telling Us
Broadcom’s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 8.2% on the news that software giant Oracle (ORCL) boosted its outlook, citing booming demand for its cloud services from artificial intelligence firms.
Oracle's shares soared after the announcement, creating a positive ripple effect across the semiconductor industry. The surge in demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure from AI companies highlights the massive computing capacity required to compete in the AI race. This translates into significant investment in the underlying hardware, directly benefiting AI chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. The positive sentiment underscores what some analysts call an ongoing “AI supercycle,” reinforcing investor confidence that the demand for advanced data center chips and related products remains robust.
Broadcom is up 49% since the beginning of the year, and at $345.67 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $369.57 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Broadcom’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $9,446.
Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."

Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR) appears positioned for meaningful upside, driven by its strong foothold in enterprise AI and semiconductor markets. The company’s ASIC business, already fast-growing, is likely to benefit from continued AI capital expenditure, potentially outpacing competitors like NVIDIA in certain segments. Enterprise Data is emerging as a significant driver, with projected growth of 40–50% year-over-year in the second half of the year. This segment could account for more than half of MPWR’s business within a few years, particularly if the company captures a larger share of NVIDIA’s spend than the market currently anticipates. Meanwhile, the non-enterprise Analog business may be bottoming out, providing further upside potential.
MPWR has a long track record of disciplined execution under an owner-operator leadership model, gradually taking market share from competitors such as Texas Instruments (TXN) across multiple end markets, including robotics, EVs, and AI chips. While the company faced temporary setbacks, including the loss of NVIDIA exclusivity, current valuations appear overly penalized, as consensus growth estimates for non-Enterprise Data segments remain conservative. The short-term outlook is strong, with near-term enterprise AI demand expected to drive revenue beats over the next few quarters.
Overall, MPWR presents a compelling investment case with a combination of resilient long-term growth, structural market share gains, and a growing contribution from high-margin enterprise AI products. At current levels, the stock appears underappreciated, with potential upside of roughly 25% to a fair value estimate of $922 per share. While caution is warranted due to recent tepid results in comparable analog segments, the company’s robust strategy and exposure to secular growth markets make it an attractive opportunity for investors seeking both near- and long-term upside.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR) by Hidden Market Gems in April 2025, which highlighted the company’s fabless operations, high margins, strong pricing power, diversified customer base, and AI exposure. The stock has appreciated approximately 52.2% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as MPWR executes on growth. Fierce Beast shares a similar perspective but emphasizes the accelerating Enterprise Data segment, fast-growing ASIC business, and potential to capture more NVIDIA market share."

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of Jim Cramer’s favorite stocks. He believes the firm is heralding a new industrial revolution and can play a key role in the robotics industry as well. Given its status as the most valuable company in the world, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is often the focus of a myriad of reports daily. Some of these are negative, and they have made Cramer repeatedly comment that the “long knives” are out for NVIDIA. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares were turbulent at trading start yesterday after China accused the firm of violating anti-monopoly laws:
“[On China ruling about NVIDIA’s monopolistic behavior] I know, five years I remember they left it open. Mellanox is a great company, let them expand the data centers, I totally get it. I think it’s interesting as Treasury Secretary Bessent says it, it’s poorly timed.

As is the case for Apple, Cramer also believes that one should not be influenced too much by the daily movement in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares either. For instance, he commented on September 8th:
“However, I got real bad news for those who are trading, not owning NVIDIA. The price performance of NVIDIA is so much better than any other company, including the one that’s our larger position, that we say we don’t care. I got another idea: why not own both? Today was the Citi analyst day to shine. Oh yeah, after four weeks down for NVIDIA, he really nailed it. Did I mention that he lowered his price target and then the stock actually finished up on the day but he did break ranks.”

It’s Fed decision day for the markets.
Market bulls have sent stocks to fresh records this week, banking on a big gift from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and leave the door open for more rate cuts.
Anything short of that will be a big gift for … you guessed it … the bears! Such is life in the markets.
""If we see Jay Powell become maybe more dovish than what the market expects, that could be actually taken as a negative because more dovish would suggest maybe he's panicking a little bit. Maybe he feels he's behind the eight ball. And then you could see the market retrace,"" said Slatestone Wealth Management chief markets strategist Kenny Polcari on Opening Bid.

Around the horn
The AI trade spreads
President Trump has landed in the UK with First Lady Melania and tech leaders from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). AI giants are wasting no time making announcements that coincide with Trump’s UK arrival.
Marc Benioff-led Salesforce (CRM) said it will invest $6 billion into its UK operations by the end of the decade as it tries to make the country its European AI hub. Microsoft (MSFT) said it’s investing $30 billion in the UK between 2025 and 2028.
Meanwhile, China’s AI stocks have ripped to new records as optimism spreads further. The Hang Seng Tech Index (HSTECH.HK) closed at its highest level since Nov. 21. Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA) saw very strong sessions.
""I don't know if this is a bubble,"" Polcari said, adding that the infrastructure buildout for AI remains in its early innings. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar drove home that point to me in a recent chat, and so did CoreWeave's (CRWV) co-founder and CEO Michael Intrator.
Crypto comeback
Somewhat under the radar, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices have broken out of a trading range the last five days as the US dollar reached a four-year low. Crypto insiders tell me the crypto market is also readying another charge higher as the Fed begins to cut rates — which could create even more pressure on the US dollar.
I spent some time with first son Eric Trump and one of his crypto partners, Asher Genoot of Hut 8, at Trump Tower on Tuesday afternoon.
Besides being executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Eric is also the co-founder of the newly public crypto miner American Bitcoin (ABTC). Genoot's Hut 8 — where he is CEO — provides the infrastructure (power, back office services, etc.) that allows American Bitcoin to mine bitcoin."

Even if Elon Musk increases his focus to fix the company’s problems, it would take a lot of effort to come out of the demand crisis. For example, in California, the largest U.S. market for electric vehicle adoption and sales, Tesla sales fell about 12% year over year in 2024, causing its market share to drop from 60.1% in 2023 to 52.5% in 2024. Was it because Californians are buying fewer EVs? No. Californians purchased more than 2 million electric cars during the year, almost double when compared to the past two years.
Baron Focused Growth Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles (EVs), solar products, and energy storage solutions, while also developing advanced real-world AI technologies. Despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and regulatory complexities, shares climbed after Tesla completed a limited commercial rollout of its highly anticipated robotaxi business in Austin—following more than a decade of development and billions of dollars in investment. This milestone signals a potentially transformative shift in the automotive industry and opens up a sizable new market beyond the company’s core operations. Investor sentiment also improved after Elon Musk stepped back from government-related engagements, boosting confidence in Tesla’s near-term execution. Tesla introduced a refreshed Model Y globally, featuring design and performance upgrades, and outlined plans to unveil new mass-market models starting next quarter. Meanwhile, the company is progressing toward scaling production of its humanoid robot, adding another dimension to its long-term growth story.”"

The Cyberspace Administration of China has told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
The report comes ahead of a call scheduled between President Trump and China's Xi Jinping to discuss trade this Friday. Semiconductor technology has been a focal point in trade tensions between the two countries.
Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Felix Wang wrote in a note following Wednesday's news, ""The decision underscores Beijing’s push to cut reliance on US semiconductors amid intensifying AI competition with the US and the promotion of domestic chip and tool utilization.""
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly stressed the importance of the Chinese AI market, which he sees as a rapidly growing $50 billion opportunity.
Huang lobbied the Trump administration to lift a US ban on exports of its lower-power H20 chips to China this summer in an unprecedented deal that involved Nvidia sharing its revenue from those sales with the US government.
Analysts noted at the time that the deal — which has not yet been finalized — could lead Chinese firms to shift toward domestic chip suppliers because the Chinese government wouldn't want companies effectively handing over money to the US government.
Huang said in August that Nvidia is working on a less-powerful version of its latest Blackwell chips for China.
When asked about China on Wednesday during a briefing in London, Huang told reporters, “I think that we could only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be.”
“I’m disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out, you know, between China and the United States, and I’m understanding of that, and we’re patient about it,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Chinese chip firms are working to fill the gap.
The Wall Street Journal reported in late August that Alibaba is testing a new chip for AI inferencing and that a slew of highlighted Chinese companies are developing substitutes for Nvidia's H20 China chip.
Jefferies analyst Edison Lee has noted that Chinese AI cloud spending is accelerating. In a note in early September, the analyst said that capital expenditures from China's three big cloud service providers — Tencent (0700.HK), Alibaba (BABA), and Baidu (BIDU) — as well as ByteDance, are ""quickly catching up"" with US counterparts."

In addition, software giant Salesforce (CRM) pledged to put a further $2bn into its UK business through 2030, extending a previous five-year investment of $4bn made in 2023.
The commitments came ahead of the UK and US revealing details of their Tech Prosperity Deal on Tuesday evening, as US president Donald Trump arrived in Britain for his state visit.
Richard Clode, portfolio manager on the global technology leaders team at Janus Henderson, said: ""AI is a scale game in terms of infrastructure and scarce AI talent. The UK has the latter while these announcements give us more confidence in the UK having the former. That should pave the way for continued strong AI innovation in the UK with natural advantages versus the rest of Europe.""
With that in mind, here's a closer look at the main companies with which US tech giants are partnering as part of their investments.
Nscale
Nvidia (NVDA) said it was partnering with UK-headquartered AI-infrastructure company Nscale to scale up 300,000 of the chipmaker's Grace Blackwell graphic processing units (GPUs) worldwide, with up to 60,000 in the UK.
Nscale has also entered into a commitment with Microsoft (MSFT) to deliver the UK's largest AI supercomputer at its campus in Loughton, Essex. Nscale said that the site will deliver 50 megawatts (mw) of AI capacity, scalable to 90mw, and will initially house 23,040 Nvidia GB300 GPUs, which will be delivered in the first quarter of 2027.
In addition, Nscale is teaming up with ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Nvidia (NVDA) to establish Stargate UK, an infrastructure platform designed to deploy OpenAI’s technology in the UK.
Nscale, which was founded by CEO Josh Payne in 2023, has already partnered with OpenAI to launch Stargate Norway: an AI infrastructure project in Narvik aiming to deliver 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026."

- China has reportedly banned its largest tech firms from buying Nvidia AI chips, adding pressure on the U.S. chipmaker’s sales in the country.
- The country’s internet regulator told firms including TikTok owner ByteDance and e-commerce giant Alibaba this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia's latest tailor-made chip, according to the Financial Times.
- Speaking in London, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he is ""disappointed"" about the reported ban.
China has reportedly banned its largest tech firms from buying Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips, adding pressure on the U.S. chipmaker’s sales in the country.
Shares of Nvidia, which entered Wednesday's session up roughly a third this year, fell about 3% in recent trading following the news.
The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, told firms including TikTok owner ByteDance and e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D—the chip Nvidia introduced in July for the Chinese market, according to the Financial Times. Beijing had concluded that homegrown chips are now performing on par with the Nvidia chips allowed in China under export controls, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
The FT report said the companies that started testing and verification work on the chip with Nvidia's server suppliers have since told their suppliers to stop the work. The new ban is stronger than prior guidance from regulators that focused on curbing use of the H20, an earlier version of Nvidia's China-tailored AI chip, and comes after China recently accused Nvidia of antitrust violations.
Nvidia CEO Huang Says He's 'Disappointed'
Asked at a press conference in London about the reported ban, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was ""disappointed."" Huang is among U.S. tech executives accompanying President Donald Trump on a state visit to the U.K.
""We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,” Huang said, according to a transcript provided to Investopedia by the company. “I’m disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I’m patient about it. We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese [government] and Chinese companies as they wish.”
Nvidia faces U.S. export restrictions on sales of its most advanced chips to China and has tailor-made some of its semiconductors for the country's market. In August, Trump ended H20 restrictions his administration had placed earlier earlier in the year in exchange for a 15% share of revenues."

Stephen Weiss, the Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner of Short Hills Capital Partners, said in a recent program on CNBC that Broadcom is expensive. However, he believes it’s a good “alternative” for people looking for “less advanced” chips.
“I’m not worried about Nvidia given its growth rate. Sure, it’s expensive, but given its growth rate, the peg is not overly out of sight. Broadcom, on the other hand, I think Broadcom is too expensive, and I don’t think they’re going to take over Nvidia anytime soon. But for less advanced chips that people want, it’s a good alternative.”
For the fiscal fourth quarter, AVGO expects $6.2 billion in AI revenue, up 66% from a year earlier. The company said it secured $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from a new customer. Many analysts believe this customer is OpenAI. Some media reports said the two companies co-designed a chip that will be launched next year.

And finally, let's talk about President Trump's visit to the UK. He's been greeted with a lot of fanfare, not just from officials there, you know, royalty, etc., but from companies that are also uh inking partnerships there, Ramzan.
That's right. There's a lot of pageantry, but it's interesting to note that President Trump isn't in London, he's in Windsor. There have been protests as well. But he has been accompanied by uh quite a few of the, you know, leading names in technology, US leading names. Among them, uh Jensen Huang, from Nvidia's Jensen Huang and also Microsoft's Satya Nadela are all are with him as well. And what they've the two countries have agreed is a big, what they called a tech prosperity deal. And it's estimated to be worth around 42 billion dollars. And some of the investments that have been promised include Microsoft saying it'll spend around 30 billion dollars expanding cloud and AI infrastructure in the UK. Google's promised almost 7 billion dollars in spending on a new data center and AI research. Nvidia said it would deploy 120,000 advanced chips across the country. So, a lot of US investment uh in the UK, uh also Salesforce has said they're going to invest, Core Weave as well. So, that's good for the UK, but what about the US? Well, on the flip side, the British pharmaceutical firm GSK said it's going to invest 30 billion dollars in US research and development and supply chain infrastructure over the next five years. Now, remember, Pharma is a bit of a hot topic because of President Trump's threat to potentially somewhere down the line to hit hit uh the these drug companies with 200% tariffs. Well, a lot of companies are already making that move to invest in the UK to avoid that. So, that's quite an interesting take. Also an interesting thing on the tech front, the investment in um the UK could be quite significant because just across the water, across the channel, uh in Europe, there's a bit of a an uneasy relationship with US tech firms and these and uh the European regulators there. And President Trump has often criticized you the EU uh in terms of their how how they hit US tech firms. So maybe going to the UK is is one way of showing, well, actually, we don't need you, we can go to the UK and we can be as prosperous there. Uh also, the UK is desperate as well for this investment. GDP growth in the three months up to July was just 0.2% in the UK. So the economy not really firing on on all cylinders. So this investment will be uh very much welcome here in the UK."

But looking ahead, AI use cases are expected to grow even more complex and reach broader end markets.
One of the more intriguing frontiers is quantum computing -- an emerging technology with the potential to transform mission-critical industries such as energy and financial services. Analysts from McKinsey & Company are projecting that quantum applications could unlock trillions in economic value in the long run.
Naturally, investors are curious: Which of today's AI titans are positioning themselves to lead the quantum era? In my eyes, two companies stick out as particularly well positioned to dominate the next wave of the AI narrative.
Nvidia: Building the hardware + software quantum stack
It wasn't long ago that Nvidia (NVDA -0.17%) was perceived as a niche hardware designer that primarily catered to online gamers. That narrow view dramatically underestimated the foresight of Nvidia's visionary CEO, Jensen Huang. Nearly two decades ago, Huang recognized that GPUs had the potential to impact industries far beyond gaming.
Today, these same chipsets serve as the foundation for deploying generative AI models like ChatGPT. But what truly sets Nvidia apart from the competition is its comprehensive ecosystem that extends beyond hardware expertise.
At the core is CUDA, Nvidia's software architecture that layers on top of its GPUs. This end-to-end integration has helped Nvidia build a powerful lock-in effect with developers -- essentially turning the company into a full-spectrum backbone for building AI systems.
While these dynamics have helped Nvidia form a technological moat, the company is quietly working to extend its dominance even further. CUDA is now becoming a bridge connecting conventional (classical) GPU programming with quantum workloads, helping position Nvidia at the center of emerging frontiers in the AI landscape.
The combination of hardware and software stack has helped Nvidia create a platform with durable competitive advantages. This flywheel effect not only reinforces its leadership in the AI industry but also positions the company to benefit from new tailwinds such as quantum computing.
Alphabet: Purpose-built for the quantum era
When most investors think of Alphabet, their minds go straight to Google search or YouTube. Advertising still fuels the majority of Alphabet's cash flow, but beneath the surface, the company has quietly built one of the most advanced AI ecosystems on the market. And a particularly important -- albeit overlooked -- pillar of that strategy is quantum computing.
On the hardware side, Alphabet developed a quantum processor called Willow. In benchmark tests, Willow solved an equation in minutes that would take today's most powerful supercomputers an estimated 10 septillion years to complete.
On the research side, one of Alphabet's lesser-known subsidiaries is a research lab called DeepMind. The advantage of DeepMind is that Alphabet can quickly and constantly test and refine new chip architectures and AI applications -- making them readily available for the company's enterprise and consumer product suites.
Lastly, on the infrastructure side are Alphabet's tensor processing units (TPUs) and its open-source software framework, Cirq. This combination has the potential to usher in a new wave of AI workloads into Alphabet's budding cloud computing network, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In the long run, this could prove to be an interesting differentiator for GCP over larger incumbents like Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The key takeaway is that Alphabet's ambitions in quantum computing are far from a theoretical exercise. By deliberately building a vertically integrated stack across chips, research, software, and infrastructure, Alphabet underscores its AI-first identity well beyond search and advertising.
This breadth not only augments the core business, but more importantly, it provides some needed optionality -- ultimately ensuring that Alphabet remains nimble and adaptive in a fast-changing technology landscape."

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief.
I want to turn to another story that we are watching closely, and that is the continuing negotiations between the US and China with Nvidia sort of in the middle as a pawn and all of this. As we talked about, the FT is reporting that China's instructed its companies to not buy Nvidia chips. And I recently had a talk the chance to talk to Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Wong, following its earnings and asked him, you know, how necessary is China even for the business? This is what he said.
Every American technology company, um, for every every American technology company, China is important to them. It's an important market. It's also, as you know, it's just really large. It's the second largest computing market in the world. Um, and um, I I'm I'm just delighted that President Trump uh sees the wisdom of American leadership and and particularly at this time uh where AI is taking off, it's vital that America wins the AI race.
And yet, Ally, you know, the shares, yes, they're down this morning a little more than a percent, but we it doesn't seem as though investors are especially concerned. Um, you know, the shares are still up 30% this year for example.
Right. and China is an important market to Nvidia, but it is not the most important market. There certainly is a lot of demand here in the US as well. But this does mark a significant escalation. Now, regulators have previously targeted Nvidia's H20 chips. Those were those paired back processors meant to uh comply with those US export controls. Now the directive extends to the RTX Pro 6000D. That's Nvidia's newest AI chips, customized for China, a lower-powered version of its flagship processor, meant to comply with those same rules. But the timing is also notable. Just a few days ago, uh China accused Nvidia of violating its anti-monopoly law. This comes as President Trump continues to push policies restricting China's access to US chips. At the same time, China is trying to lessen its dependence on US technologies for these exact reasons. And like you said, shares are down slightly in pre-market trading. We did hear from Nvidia's CEO Jensen Wong responding to this report. He said he was quote disappointed, but understood that China and the US have larger geopolitical issues to work out. He described Nvidia's business in China as a bit of a roller coaster and stressed that the company has guided Wall Street not to factor China into its financial forecast given the policy uncertainty. And that may be why we're seeing a bit more muted reaction in shares, because even without China, guidance wasn't too bad in the latest quarter. So, if this China uh issue is resolved, that could be a further boon for Nvidia down the line here. But like you said, Nvidia once again a pawn in this game between the US, China as these trade negotiations continue. President Trump will be meeting with Xi Jinping on Friday. I'm sure this will be a big talking point."

California-based Nvidia's specially designed chips have catapulted the company to become the world's biggest by market capitalisation, with China seen as a crucial market.
But geopolitical tensions between the United States and China have seen Nvidia caught up in relations between the superpowers.
Washington restricts Nvidia from exporting its most advanced products to China and last month confirmed the company would pay the US government 15 percent of revenue from certain AI chip sales in the country.
Beijing has responded by expressing national security concerns about Nvidia chips and urging Chinese businesses to rely on local semiconductor suppliers instead.
In the latest development, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday that China's internet regulator has instructed companies including Alibaba and ByteDance to terminate orders for Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D chips, state-of-the-art processors made especially for the country.
""We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,"" Huang said at a press briefing in London, responding to a question about the FT report.
""I'm disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I'm patient about it. We'll continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish.""
According to the FT, citing unnamed sources, the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered companies to end all testing and purchase plans for Nvidia's restricted chips.
The ban would follow a decision by Chinese regulators on Monday finding that Nvidia had run afoul of the country's antitrust rules.
Observers believe that Beijing's moves to wean Chinese tech companies off Nvidia's offerings are part of its effort to accelerate domestic production from companies like Huawei.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks to watch in September.
Dan Niles from Niles Investment Management, in a recent program on CNBC, reiterated his concerns about a potential slowdown in AI demand. This time, Niles highlighted Nvidia’s data center miss in its latest quarterly report.
“Over the weekend it came out that OpenAI has sort of pushed up their revenue forecast for 2030 by about $26 billion to $200 billion,” Niles said. “But to get that revenue increase of $26 billion, they’re going to have to burn $85 billion more in cash. So the data points are definitely there, but you know, we’re in this business to make money. So you have to go, all right, well, do the fundamentals matter right now, or is it the fact you’re going to get even more easy money? The 10-year yields going down to 4%. And so this market, much like in 2021, will keep going up right up until it doesn’t. And so I think you have to look at that. And Nvidia missing on data center revenues, and you can say yes the growth was so high and all this, but they missed, so that should give you another data point. And you throw on top of that Dell or Marll or the fact that AVGO got more ASIC revenues because companies want to cut their costs—those all speak to the same narrative, so don’t confuse the actual data with what the stock prices are doing.”

Nvidia’s Hopper Infrastructure and now Blackwell form the core of AI infrastructure for LLM training and inference. But Nvidia’s growth is slowing compared to previous quarters amid competition and capex spending limitations from major companies. In the recently reported quarter, Nvidia’s annual revenue growth came in at 56%, compared with nearly 100% YoY growth in the past.
With its strong position in the data center market and rising demand, Nvidia is likely to keep growing, though not at the same pace it has in the past. Increasing competition from major companies like Broadcom is also expected to impact Nvidia’s margins in the long term.
Loomis Sayles Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, which enables computers to mimic human-like intelligence for problem solving and decision making capabilities. Founded in 1993 to develop faster and more-realistic graphics for PC-based video games, Nvidia created the first graphics processing unit (GPU), a dedicated semiconductor that employs a proprietary parallel processing architecture to perform superior graphics rendering outside of a computer’s standard central processing unit (CPU). The parallel processing capability of Nvidia’s GPUs, which contrasts with the linear processing requirement of CPUs, can accelerate computing functions performed by standard CPUs by greater than ten times. As a result, Nvidia extended its visual computing expertise beyond its legacy gaming market into innovative new and larger markets, including data centers, autos, and professional visualization. The parallel processing capability facilitates pattern recognition and machine learning functions that have enabled Nvidia to be at the forefront of growth in artificial intelligence applications. As a result, the data center business, which first surpassed the gaming business to become Nvidia’s largest revenue and profit generator in its 2023 fiscal year, grew to represent over 88% of revenue in the company’s most recent fiscal year. The company is also focused on building out its GPU-computing-based ecosystem and is helping to enable breakthroughs in autonomous driving, and virtual reality."

They Sold Their Last Real Estate Company for Nearly $1B — Now They're Building the Future of U.S. Industrial Growth
The investor said that he began buying Nvidia shares back in 2017 because he believed the company's graphics processing units would be used for mining cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin hit $20,000 for the first time that year, but soon ""collapsed,"" introducing the Redditor to the volatility of the crypto world, he said. However, he did not sell Nvidia because he believed crypto was in its ""early adoption stage.""
From Crypto to Electric Vehicles
The Redditor said he kept slowly adding to his Nvidia stake over the next couple of years, and by 2019, he owned about 6,000 shares of the company. In 2019 and 2020, the investor began to feel that Nvidia GPUs were not as closely tied to the crypto industry as once thought. However, there was a new reason for him to keep holding Nvidia in his portfolio.
""The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs,"" he said. ""So my mentality moved from crypto to electric vehicles.""

Then came 2023, and the world started to see the impact of generative AI, thanks to the launch of ChatGPT in the previous year. The Redditor said he started seeing ""mainstream use cases"" for AI because he worked in the photography and videography industry.
The investor said his portfolio started to ""skyrocket"" because of Nvidia. His position in the chip maker was up 4000% and the ""temptation"" to sell was growing.
""Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds,"" he wrote.

OK, first up, we've got General Mills. Now you might be tucking into one of their cereals like Cheerios or Lucky Charms, but they've just reported earnings. And actually, the earnings beat consensus, and adjusted earnings per share came in at 86 cents. The markets were looking for 82 cents, and net sales actually came in at $4.52 billion which was in line with expectations, but that's had very little impact on the share price in pre-market.Down there a little bit there. Now for context, General Mills has been under pressure amid inflation pushing consumers to cheaper products and changing consumption patterns as people seek more healthy products. Pet food has been one bright spot for General Mills, and now we'll see how investors will react to these results which follow aggressive cost cuts and new product launches. One thing that that General Mills did say is that more people are choosing to eat at home.OK, now you need to know that Workday, the enterprise software is up more than 9% in pre-market. The company held an event for analysts yesterday and it announced some new plans, including snapping up the AI startup Sanna. The growth plans got a thumbs up uh from activist investor Elliott Management. OK, next up, a stock you want to watch closely, blockchain lender figure.The stock is up again, more than 3% in pre-market after it jumped 30% yesterday and gave up some gains to close about 8.4% higher, actually it's now up 4% in pre-market. Now, investors are loading their portfolios ahead of the Fed's decision today and figure is attracting optimism after what is widely seen as a successful IPO last week.In which it raised about $790 million. And while we're talking about this company will also bring you a headline about another tech company called Fi. This one is Fi AI which makes humanoid robots and is based in San Francisco. The startup is private, so harder to trade, but the news is that it has reached a $39 billion valuation after it raised over $1 billion in a Series C funding round that involved giant names including Intel Capital, Salesforce, Qualcomm and Nvidia.Well, speaking of Nvidia, we've been watching news today that the stock is coming under even more pressure from China. So let's take a look at some key AI stocks this morning that are moving on US China negotiations. But Nvidia, we're not seeing great giant swings, we can see that the stock is sliding again.Uh, maybe there might be some profit taking there as the FT reports that a Chinese government entity has instructed leading tech companies to stop purchasing and even to cancel existing orders of Nvidia's GPUs. This comes on top of more bad news for Nvidia this week in China, where it faces an antitrust probe.And as Beijing steps up its pressure on on Nvidia amid trade negotiations with the US, China's homegrown chip companies are gaining momentum.

What to Expect from the Stock Market Tomorrow
Tuesday morning brings us a truckload of new economic data, with U.S. Retail Sales, Import/Export Prices, and Industrial Production/Capacity Utilization for August before the opening bell. We’ll also get a look at Business Inventories for July and Homebuilder Confidence for September a little later on that morning.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) starts its two-day meeting tomorrow, as it deliberates on monetary policy and decides on interest rate levels the following day. Expectations are for the first of three 25 basis-point (bps) cuts to the Fed funds rate through the end of the calendar year, which would bring down rates initially to 4.00-4.25%. By the December meeting, interest rates are now expected to be 3.50-3.75%.
Also, we may see a last-minute addition to the FOMC at these meetings, as long as the Republican-run Senate continues to do President Trump’s bidding: Stephen Miran, currently the president’s Chair of the Presidential Council of Economic Advisors and likeminded with Trump that interest rates are about 300 bps too high, will likely get a vote early this evening. It is also likely Fed Governor Lisa Cook will stay on the FOMC, despite President Trump attempting to fire her.

The DOJ had proposed stronger remedies, including that Alphabet-owned Google be forced to sell Chrome. Tech companies like Perplexity and Ecosia lined up with unsolicited bids. But that possibility has been nixed.
Beyond Google’s cash cow of search, its cloud computing business is also growing rapidly on the strength of its AI offerings. Alphabet now joins Nvidia ($4.3T), Microsoft ($3.8T) and Apple ($3.5T) in the three-t club with Amazon next up but a lap behind ($2.5T)."

China has decided Nvidia (NVDA) broke antitrust rules tied to its $7 billion purchase of Mellanox Technologies back in 2020, putting fresh strain on U.S.China relations just as trade talks are heating up.
The country's market regulator said a preliminary review found Nvidia failed to live up to certain conditions agreed to when China cleared the deal. Officials didn't spell out what exactly was violated, but the ruling highlights how closely Beijing is watching U.S. tech firms. Nvidia stock slipped about 2% in premarket trading on the news.
Nvidia bought Mellanox, an Israeli company that makes networking gear for data centers and servers, to strengthen its AI and cloud ambitions. Chinese regulators reopened their look at the deal late last year, signaling ongoing concerns about how much control Nvidia wields in the market.
The move lands at a delicate time, raising questions about whether this is strictly about competitionor another shot in the broader U.S.China tech fight."
