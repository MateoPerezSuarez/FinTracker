Sometimes, it is the subtle shifts that spark the biggest questions, especially when a well-known company like Carlsberg starts moving in a different direction than the market expects. This quiet slide could make investors wonder whether there is something brewing beneath the surface or if the stock might be coming back into undervalued territory.
Looking over the past year, Carlsberg’s stock delivered a modest 3% total return, with most of that progress happening earlier in the year. Shorter-term momentum, however, has faded. Returns slipped by over 18% in the past 3 months and more than 6% across the past month alone. There have not been major announcements or clear catalysts in this timeframe, just a steady decline that stands out against the company’s earlier gains and decent long-term earnings growth.
Given this slide and the absence of big news, is Carlsberg quietly setting up for a value-driven rebound, or is the market already adjusting its expectations for future growth?
Most Popular Narrative: 21% Undervalued
The current most widely followed narrative positions Carlsberg as significantly undervalued, with a fair value estimate about 21% above its present price. The outlook hinges on the company’s ability to leverage international growth and margin expansion, even as its share price trails analysts’ optimistic projections.
""The rapid expansion and premiumization of Carlsberg's business in high-growth markets such as India and China, driven by rising middle-class consumers and favorable demographic shifts, is positioning the company for robust long-term revenue and earnings growth as these economies return to stronger consumption and as premium segment share increases.""
Ready to uncover what big assumptions are fueling this bullish valuation? The narrative is built on ambitious revenue and profit growth forecasts, with a future profit multiple that may surprise many. Are you curious about which critical financial levers are making analysts so optimistic? The answers might just change the way you see Carlsberg’s future.
Result: Fair Value of DKK 972.95 (UNDERVALUED)
Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.
However, persistent declines in core European beer demand or challenges with integrating new acquisitions could undermine Carlsberg’s premium growth strategy and analyst optimism."

Time for our trending tickers and I told you about a stock that was up over 80%. What was it? Well, it was Webtoon. Disney has reached an agreement with Webtoon entertainment to host a variety of its iconic IPs, such as Star Wars and Marvel on its platforms. Initially founded in South Korea, but now listed in New York and based in LA, Webtoon specializes in vertical scroll comics, primarily for viewing on mobile phones. Shares jumped over 80%, as I said, and continue to be positive in the pre-market. Webtoon has over 150 million monthly users and reported $348.3 million in revenue in its Q2 earnings in June, an 8.5% increase. It's also partnered with another favorite of mine, Crunchyroll, the anime streaming service and DC Comics, the home of Batman and Superman. Moving on to a very different stock now and one that's suffering this morning, Carlsberg. Shares of the Danish beer maker are down around 6.5%, dragged down by disappointment, it's over 7% now, dragged down by disappointment from its half-year earnings. Carlsberg reported just 2.3% operating profit growth, below analyst expectations of 7.35 billion Danish crowns, and volumes dropped nearly 1.7%. Despite raising its full year guidance, management warned that consumer demand is unlikely to improve through the remainder of 2025. Now Carlsberg is the third major brewer to acknowledge struggles in recent weeks after AB Inbev and Heineken. Expect further volatility in this sector as investors and consumers' tastes appear to shift away from established brands. Now onto Tempus AI, the startup backed by Cathy Woods and Nancy Pelosi has been rising in the past day and is now trading around the $70 mark. Tempus beat Q2 expectations and is riding the wave of renewed optimism around healthcare AI. Tempus is developing what it calls precision medicine systems to collect and analyze health data for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The stock is benefiting from being one of the largest positions in Ark Investments portfolio. That's Kathy Woods' fund, and some analysts see it rising much further from here."

LONDON/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Carlsberg missed half-year profit and volume forecasts on Thursday and warned it did not expect the consumer environment to improve in the rest of 2025, sending the Danish brewer's shares down almost 7% in early trading.
The latest report by the world's third-largest brewer - behind Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken - was received with similar pessimism to those of its rivals in recent weeks as investors sent shares declining.
While Carlsberg, which makes Kronenbourg 1664, Tuborg and Somersby, raised the bottom end of its annual profit guidance, that did not offset slower-than-expected first-half operating profit growth of 2.3%, and a 1.7% decline in volumes.
CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen said on a media call that the brewer's performance was strong in a difficult year, and that it anticipated slightly better volume growth in the second half.
Still, he wasn't optimistic on consumer spending, which was being reined in by price increases and uncertainty, adding: ""There is no indication as we move into the second half that that's going to change.""
Big brewers have been battling reduced demand, the impact of U.S. tariffs and poor weather, and their weak performance or volume expectations have left investors fretting over growth prospects.
Carlsberg's shares were down 5.8%, after earlier falling as much as 6.7%, its steepest decline since July 2024.
Haider Anjum, analyst from Jyske Bank, said he was surprised by the share price reaction, given Carlsberg's relatively strong performance.
But Laurence Whyatt, analyst at Barclays, said the market had been ""punishing volume misses"" like Carlsberg's, which was driven by a weaker-than-expected performance in Asia.
OPTIMISM FADES
As well as temporary challenges, brewers also face questions around longer-term shifts, such as some consumers cutting back on alcohol for health reasons.
Altogether, these issues have dampened earlier optimism around the sector.
Carlsberg had also pledged to deliver revenue growth of between 4% and 6% annually each year until 2027, but Aarup-Andersen told investors on a call that in a year like 2025, that may not be ""fully realistic.""
While it narrowed its expectations for annual operating profit growth to 3% to 5%, compared with 1% to 5% before, analysts said they were already expecting 4%.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.
Right now, both Carlsberg AS and Diageo are sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.
CABGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.38, while DEO has a forward P/E of 15.80. We also note that CABGY has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. DEO currently has a PEG ratio of 3.24.
Another notable valuation metric for CABGY is its P/B ratio of 3.85. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, DEO has a P/B of 4.8.
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CABGY's Value grade of B and DEO's Value grade of D.
Both CABGY and DEO are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CABGY is the superior value option right now.

This was mainly due to a significantly lower contribution from Moët Hennessy and adverse currency effects.
On a reported basis, net sales slipped 0.1% year over year to $20.2 billion. The decline was due to unfavorable currency impacts and acquisition and disposal adjustments, offset by improved organic sales. The negative impacts of acquisitions and disposals primarily reflected the Guinness Nigeria divestiture and the Cîroc brand transition in North America.
Organic net sales rose 1.7% year over year, aided by organic volume growth of 0.9% and improved price/mix of 0.8%. Excluding the Cîroc transaction impacts in North America, organic net sales were up 1.5%, with 0.8% volume growth and a 0.7% price/mix.
Diageo plc Price and Consensus
Diageo plc price-consensus-chart | Diageo plc Quote
The contribution to growth from volume and price/mix was relatively balanced. Three of the company’s five regions delivered volume growth, while four recorded a positive price/mix.
Volume declined in North America and Europe, reflecting a continued cautious consumer environment amid macroeconomic uncertainty and inflationary pressure. However, this was more than offset by volume gains in the Asia Pacific, led by India, and in Africa and Latin America (LAC).
In terms of price/mix, North America saw positive contributions, driven by tequila, particularly aged variants, with Don Julio showing notable strength. In Europe, Guinness remained the key growth driver. LAC delivered a continued positive price/mix as the region rebounded from prior consumer downtrading and intense competitive pressures, with additional benefit from favorable year-over-year comparisons. In the Asia Pacific, the price/mix declined due to consumer downtrading in Southeast Asia and China, compounded by an unfavorable market mix.
Shares of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have lost 16.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 15.6% decline.

The company’s reported operating profit declined 27.8% year over year to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2025 due to exceptional impairment and restructuring charges, unfavorable currency movements, and a contraction in organic operating margin. Organic operating profit fell 0.7% year over year, reflecting continued investment in overheads, partially offset by modest gross margin expansion.
The reported operating margin contracted 819 bps year over year, while the organic operating margin contracted 68 bps. Excluding the impacts of the Cîroc transaction, organic operating profit declined 1%, consistent with prior guidance, while the organic operating margin contracted by 70 bps."

Molson Coors’ Q2 Details
Financial volumes decreased 7% year over year due to lower shipments across the Americas and EMEA&APAC segments. Brand volumes fell 5.1%, with a 4% dip in the Americas and a 7.8% decline in EMEA&APAC.
Net sales were positively influenced by the price and sales mix, which increased 4.4% year over year, driven by a favorable sales mix and higher net pricing across both segments.

Marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) expenses declined 4.9% year over year on a reported basis to $693.1 million due to the timing of marketing investments and lower general and administrative expenses resulting from lower incentive compensation, partly negated by unfavorable currency impacts. Underlying MG&A declined 5.8% in constant currency.
Underlying earnings before taxes (EBT) rose 0.1% year over year to $531.5 million. On a constant-currency basis, underlying EBT declined 0.8%, led by lower financial volumes and cost inflation with respect to materials and manufacturing expenses, partly offset by a favorable mix, higher net pricing, lower MG&A expenses and cost savings initiatives.

Financial volumes were down 6.6% year over year, resulting from lower U.S. brand volumes, and a 3% impact of lower contract brewing volume due to the exit of contract brewing arrangements across the United States and Canada at the end of 2024. This was partly negated by the favorable timing of U.S. shipments. Brand volumes in the Americas were down 4%, including a 5.3% decline in the United States, due to the macroeconomic impacts of industry softness and a lower share performance.
The price and sales mix positively impacted net sales by 4%, mainly owing to a favorable sales mix from lower contract brewing volumes, positive brand mix and higher net pricing. Underlying EBT improved 5.4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by a favorable mix, higher net pricing, lower MG&A expenses, and cost-saving initiatives, partly offset by lower financial volumes and cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses.
EMEA&APAC: The segment’s net sales (on a reported basis) rose 3% year over year to $703.9 million and fell 2.3% on a constant-currency basis. Reported sales benefited from a favorable price and sales mix, and favorable currency effects, partially offset by lower financial volumes. The price and sales mix improved 5.5% on geographic mix, premiumization and higher factored brand volumes, along with improved net pricing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales was pegged at $687 million.
Financial and brand volumes dipped 7.8% year over year due to lower volumes across all regions, led by soft market demand and a heightened competitive landscape. The segment’s underlying EBT declined 17.9% year over year on a constant-currency basis due to lower financial volumes and increased U.K. waste management fees from changes in extended producer responsibility regulations. These pressures were partially offset by reduced MG&A expenses, led by lower incentive compensation and cost-saving initiatives, as well as improved net pricing and a favorable product mix."

The company’s earnings per share (EPS) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. However, the top line declined and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Bottom-line growth reflected positive business momentum, owing to the strength of its diversified footprint and consumer demand for its megabrands.
AB InBev reported an underlying EPS (normalized EPS, excluding mark-to-market gains and losses related to the hedging of share-based payment programs and the impacts of hyperinflation) of 98 cents, up 8.7% year over year. The rise was driven by 10.2% EBIT growth and the continued optimization of net finance costs. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. On a constant-currency basis, underlying EPS improved 17.4%.
Revenues of $15 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.33 billion and declined 2.1% year over year. The company reported organic revenue growth of 3%, driven by revenue increases in 70% of its markets. Growth across markets was driven by a focus on ongoing premiumization and disciplined revenue management, contributing to higher revenue per hectoliter (hl).

BUD’s Q2 Details
Revenue per hl improved 4.9% year over year in the quarter, backed by revenue-management initiatives. The total organic volume fell 1.9%, including a decline of 2.2% in the own-beer volume, offset by a 0.3% rise in the non-beer volume. The volume decline was led by soft industries, and performance in China and Brazil. Excluding these countries, momentum was strong, with volume rising 0.7%.
Revenues reflected the strong performance of its premium and super premium beer brands. The company’s revenues for the megabrands increased 5.6% year over year. Within its megabrands, Corona led the performance with a 7.7% revenue increase outside of Mexico, including double-digit volume growth in more than 30 markets. The company’s above-core beer portfolio delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 5.1%.
AB InBev has been keen on making investments in its portfolio over the years, and rapidly growing its digital platform, including BEES and Zé Delivery. Its digital transformation initiatives have been on track, with B2B digital platforms contributing about 71% to its revenues in second-quarter 2025. Its omnichannel, direct-to-consumer ecosystem of digital and physical products generated $335 million in revenues in second-quarter 2025.
BUD has been focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line. Notably, the Beyond Beer portfolio recorded a 6.4% revenue rise, driven by double-digit growth in key brands such as Cutwater and Nütrl in the United States, and Beats in Brazil."

HONG KONG, July 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Carlsberg Asia wrapped up a high-energy week of football celebrations in support of Liverpool FC's 2025 Asia Pre-Season Tour — culminating in Hong Kong, where the club faced off against AC Milan on July 26. While the result didn't define the occasion, the unity, passion, and electrifying atmosphere across the city offered a powerful reminder of Carlsberg's long-standing partnership with Liverpool FC, and the deep connection shared with fans across the region.
Spanning seven Carlsberg Asia markets — Cambodia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Vietnam — the campaign brought together fans, communities in a shared moment of passion and celebration. From eye-catching installations to exclusive promotions across on-trade and off-trade channels, Carlsberg Asia once again proved its ability to deliver immersive and engaging experiences across the region.
A standout highlight was the launch of the limited-edition Miracle Can, inspired by Liverpool FC's unforgettable 2005 comeback in Istanbul. The collectible can receives overwhelmingly positive feedback across multiple markets, becoming a symbol of legacy, resilience, and shared fandom.
Arindam Varanasi, Commercial Vice President, Carlsberg Asia, said: ""This regional Carlsberg - LFC campaign has profoundly united fans from diverse backgrounds, sparking excitement and passion for football. The vibrant energy we experienced in Hong Kong and other Asia markets reflected the creativity and the superior execution capabilities of our teams to capitalize on the power of two global brands on the ground. The impactful brand visibility and presence in key tourist locations, retail stores and the on-trade not only captivated all adult consumers but also significantly strengthened our market presence, especially with the Carlsberg brand. We are genuinely thrilled to have welcomed our valued partners, customers, and consumers in Hong Kong for this extraordinary and unique activation campaign, reinforcing our commitment to the spirit of football and our enduring partnership with Liverpool FC.""
In Hong Kong, the heart of the celebration, the Walk of Fame exhibition on the Avenue of Stars honoured Liverpool FC's legendary legacy and vibrant fan culture. Featuring a Carlsberg x Liverpool FC lightbox with ""CHAMPIONS"" lettering set against the stunning Victoria Harbour skyline, the installation drew large crowds of fans eager to snap photos and express their pride."

The company is actively shifting its portfolio toward higher-margin products such as Peroni, Madrí and Blue Moon, while also expanding its presence in the non-alcoholic and beyond-beer categories. Brands like Fever-Tree and ZOA are key investments in this space, reflecting Molson Coors’ ambition to serve a broader range of occasions and consumers, especially among Gen Z. These moves are designed to capitalize on evolving consumption trends and strengthen the company’s position beyond mainstream beer.
Despite these efforts, Molson Coors is grappling with a challenging macroeconomic backdrop that continues to weigh heavily on volume performance. In first-quarter 2025, consolidated net sales revenues declined 10.4%, and U.S. financial volume dropped 15.7%, reflecting softer consumer demand and shipment headwinds. Although net sales revenue per hectoliter rose 4.8% in the Americas, driven largely by premium mix gains and pricing, this was not enough to fully offset the steep volume declines. These results suggest that while premiumization is helping to cushion the impact, it alone cannot fully counteract broad-based volume pressures.
However, early signs from newer premium products are encouraging. Peroni, for example, has seen increased on-premise placements and retail expansion in the United States, aided by cost savings from onshore production. Similarly, Madrí is showing strong global growth, now a top 10 global brand for Molson Coors despite being just four years old. The company also launched Blue Moon Non-Alc and Blue Moon High ABV extensions, aiming to attract health-conscious and value-seeking consumers. These brands not only support margin growth but also help Molson Coors diversify away from declining contract brewing volumes.
While premiumization is a vital part of Molson Coors’ growth story, it is not yet sufficient to fully offset the volume losses that are caused by macroeconomic headwinds and changing industry dynamics. Nonetheless, the company’s commitment to strengthening its premium portfolio, combined with disciplined cost management and innovation, positions it well for the medium to long term. If the broader beer category stabilizes and premium innovations continue to gain traction, Molson Coors could see greater balance between volume and value growth in the future.

With Hong Kong as the lead market, the campaign brings together fans, customers, and partners in a shared moment of passion, purpose, and celebration - all rooted in the enduring legacy between Carlsberg and Liverpool FC.
Building on a global partnership that spans over three decades, the campaign spans seven Carlsberg Asia markets including Cambodia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Vietnam.

By bringing this moment to life in a way that resonates across markets, we are accelerating growth in Asia by strengthening our commercial impact and deepening the emotional connection consumers have with our brands.""
In Hong Kong, the celebration will reach its peak as Liverpool FC takes on AC Milan on 26 July, a rematch of the unforgettable UEFA Champions League Final in 2005. From 22 to 26 July, the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui will be transformed into a ""Walk of Fame"" honouring Liverpool FC's history and culture. The experience will feature visual tributes to the club's 20 league titles, creative nods to the Shankly Gates, and Carlsberg x Liverpool FC installations that bring together the brand's hop leaf and the Liver Bird.
A Carlsberg-branded sailboat will also cruise through Victoria Harbour, offering fans a floating tribute and a striking backdrop to this summer's football fever. On 25 July, the celebration continues in Lan Kwai Fong, where Carlsberg will host a Reds-themed street party filled with music, atmosphere, and ice-cold Carlsberg beer.
Jeff Chong, Director, International Premium Brands, Carlsberg Asia, added: ""This is a proud moment for all of us at Carlsberg Asia. While each market engages at different levels, we are united in our passion for football and our commitment to bringing fans closer to the game, especially as lucky winners have the chance to travel to Hong Kong for the match or enjoy an unforgettable experience in Liverpool.

Despite top-line challenges, it has successfully defended and expanded its margins through a disciplined focus on pricing, operational efficiency and strategic investments. This margin stability reflects the strength of the company’s brand equity and its ability to adapt quickly to evolving market conditions without sacrificing profitability.
In first-quarter 2025, Monster Beverage’s gross profit margin improved meaningfully, rising to 56.5% from 54.1% a year earlier. This uplift was primarily driven by pricing actions and supply chain optimization, which helped absorb the impact of foreign currency headwinds and soft sales performance. Operating income increased by more than 5% year over year, supported by a decrease in distribution and warehouse costs as a percentage of sales. Even when excluding the Alcohol Brand segment, margins showed improvement, further emphasizing the effectiveness of MNST’s core operating model. Additionally, the company’s ability to manage aluminum tariff exposure and hedge input costs played a crucial role in maintaining margin integrity.
Looking forward, management acknowledged that some pressures, such as rising Midwest aluminum premiums, could weigh on margins in upcoming quarters. However, Monster Beverage’s proactive mitigation strategies, such as localized production, partial hedging and facility expansion in Brazil, are expected to help offset some of these impacts. Moreover, the continued rollout of the company’s AFF flavor facility in Ireland supports more efficient regional operations, offering lower landed costs and better service levels across EMEA. These strategic moves not only support gross margins but also strengthen Monster Beverage’s ability to scale efficiently in international markets.
Monster Beverage’s path to sustained margin strength also relies heavily on its innovation pipeline and global brand execution. New product launches across categories, from Ultra Blue Hawaiian to Killer Brew coffee drinks, are aimed at expanding the brand's premium mix. At the same time, affordable energy offerings like Predator and Fury are gaining ground in emerging markets, offering incremental growth without diluting margins. By staying agile with pricing strategies and leaning into consumer demand for functional, energy-forward products, Monster Beverage is positioning itself to protect and potentially grow its margins, even in the face of economic uncertainty."

The company’s approach blends acquisitions and partnerships, like its full distribution integration of GHOST Energy, a growing partnership with C4 and support for emerging brands like Bloom Sparkling Energy and Black Rifle Energy.
Energy drinks are not just a standalone offering for KDP; they are a broader, synergistic platform. Each brand serves a unique consumer niche: C4 appeals to performance-focused consumers, GHOST targets lifestyle enthusiasts, Bloom focuses on female-forward positioning and Electrolit extends into the sports hydration space. This multi-brand approach enhances KDP’s credibility in the energy category while diversifying its risk and maximizing reach.
KDP's energy drinks portfolio contributed 6.4% constant currency net sales growth in first-quarter 2025. GHOST Energy, now fully integrated into KDP’s DSD network, posted double-digit retail growth and contributed 4.8 points to volume mix growth. C4 remained strong, Bloom scaled quickly to half a share point and Electrolit gained traction in sports hydration. Together, these brands drove 11% growth in U.S. Refreshment Beverages, boosted further by solid Dr Pepper performance, highlighting that KDP’s energy play is gaining scale and shelf impact.
Keurig Dr Pepper expects energy and sports hydration to remain high-growth categories and is well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum. With favorable consumption trends and compelling innovation planned across its brands, management is bullish on continued growth in energy drinks through the rest of 2025 despite macroeconomic uncertainties and tariff pressures. The energy drink’s momentum is also expected to offset headwinds in other segments like coffee and reinforce KDP’s broader beverage leadership.

The company has leaned heavily into higher-end offerings across its core categories, particularly tequila (Don Julio, Casamigos), Guinness variants and strategic restocking of premium spirits in North America. This price-led strategy is a hallmark of Diageo’s premiumization playbook, enabling it to deliver consistent revenue growth even in markets experiencing softer consumer demand or downtrading.
The company’s regional performance reflects contributions from its premiumization efforts. North America saw a 6.2% organic net sales increase, driven by strong US Spirits shipments and tequila demand, with favorable mix effects amplifying growth. In Europe, Guinness’ double-digit growth and pricing strength offset declines in spirits, again signaling Diageo’s brand-led premium execution. However, Asia Pacific saw pressure on price/mix due to downtrading and an unfavorable market mix, indicating that while the company's premiumization efforts are gaining ground, they remain sensitive to regional economic shifts and consumer affordability dynamics.
Diageo’s newly launched “Accelerate” program reinforces its premiumization strategy through a $500 million cost savings initiative in three years, funds earmarked for reinvestment into brand-building and innovation. This initiative, combined with a disciplined approach to portfolio management and a focus on digital and data-driven consumer engagement, strengthens the company’s ability to elevate its premium positioning. The strategic divestment of lower-margin assets and a sharper focus on core premium brands highlight DEO’s intent to prioritize high-margin growth, even amid ongoing global uncertainty.
Tariff pressures, particularly the ongoing 10% duties on U.K. and European spirits imported into the United States, present a notable headwind for Diageo. However, the company’s premiumization strategy offers a partial buffer against such cost shocks. Higher-end brands like Don Julio, Johnnie Walker and Guinness typically command strong brand equity and pricing power, allowing Diageo to pass through a portion of these increased costs to consumers without significantly eroding demand. This ability to sustain premium pricing amid tariff-related margin pressures underscores the resilience of the company’s premium portfolio and reinforces the strategic value of focusing on high-margin, high-loyalty brands in a volatile trade environment."

finnhub,CABGY,2025-07-02T15:39:00,FEMSA Completes the Divestiture of Logistics Operations to Grupo Traxion,"FMX sells its logistics arm to Grupo Traxion, focusing on core retail and beverage businesses to drive growth and strengthen its digital and ESG initiatives.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=bf639ed0aac10245b6b0db69cee65879ae2e86614b966e9241e5ee069d9c3475,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/femsa-completes-divestiture-logistics-operations-153900081.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/femsa-completes-divestiture-logistics-operations-153900081.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/femsa-completes-divestiture-logistics-operations-153900081.html,yahoo.com,200,,"As part of its broader strategic realignment, Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. or FEMSA FMX has successfully completed the divestiture of a substantial portion of its logistics operations conducted under the Solistica brand to Grupo Traxión, S.A.B. de C.V., a leading transportation and logistics provider in Mexico. The transaction, first disclosed on Oct. 10, 2024, is valued at 4,040 million Mexican pesos on a cash-free, debt-free basis.
The deal includes FEMSA’s transportation management operations in Mexico, along with its contract logistics operations across Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. It excludes the company’s less-than-truckload (LTL) operations in Brazil. This move represents a significant step in FMX’s portfolio restructuring, enabling the company to focus more intently on its core businesses and long-term strategic priorities.
FEMSA's recent divestiture of its logistics arm, Solistica, marks a pivotal strategic move that aligns with its long-term goals of portfolio optimization and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) excellence. By offloading non-core assets, the company reinforces its focus on high-margin retail and beverage operations, while Traxión strengthens its scale and capabilities in Latin America’s logistics sector. The transaction also highlights how ESG alignment can drive value creation for both companies.
FEMSA Forward Strategy: Boosting Core Operations & Unlocking Value
The divestiture is part of the company’s broader FEMSA Forward strategy, launched in early 2023, which is focused on driving long-term value across its core business units Retail (including Health), Coca-Cola FEMSA and Digital@FEMSA while actively exploring strategic alternatives for non-core assets. Since introducing the strategy, FEMSA has significantly streamlined its portfolio by reducing its stake in Heineken to a minimal level, merging Envoy Solutions with BradyIFS while retaining a minority interest, and selling its refrigeration and food service equipment businesses Imbera and Torrey to a private equity firm. Additionally, the company divested its plastics solutions operations, further sharpening its focus on core growth areas.
These restructuring efforts enable FEMSA to redeploy capital toward high-growth areas, especially within its Retail division. Core to this strategy is the expansion of its OXXO convenience store network, which now exceeds 1,000 stores in Mexico, and the continued rollout of new formats like Bara and coffee drive-thrus. Internationally, FEMSA is rapidly scaling its Proximity operations across South America, surpassing 500 OXXO stores in Brazil and nearing that milestone in Colombia. In the United States, the acquisition of 249 Delek convenience stores marked a strategic entry into the North American market and aligns with FEMSA’s goal of building a diversified, high-return retail footprint.
In parallel, FEMSA continues to scale its digital and fintech platforms under the Digital@FEMSA umbrella. The company’s digital wallet, Spin by OXXO and its loyalty program, Spin Premia, have shown strong momentum, reaching 13.8 million and 55.7 million active users, respectively, by the end of first-quarter 2025. With Spin by OXXO now fully authorized as a fintech in Mexico, FMX is poised to further deepen customer engagement and unlock cross-platform synergies across its ecosystem.
Despite the company's strategic progress under its FEMSA Forward plan, several challenges continue to weigh on its performance. Soft consumer demand in Mexico, particularly in core consumption categories like beverages and tobacco, has led to declining store traffic and margin compression in the Proximity Americas segment. Additionally, broader cost pressures from inflation, rising labor expenses and raw material inflation are straining profitability across key divisions, including Proximity Europe and the Coca-Cola FEMSA bottling business. These headwinds, coupled with increasing competitive intensity and heavy reliance on Coca-Cola trademark products, pose risks to sustainable margin expansion and earnings visibility.
Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have gained 2.6% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 4.3%."

Segment sales rose 5% year over year, supported by a 3.5% increase in shipment volumes. Organic sales grew an impressive 11%, driven by a 15.7% rise in organic shipment volume. Growth was underpinned by contractual distributor payments, a favorable product mix, strength in the U.S. wholesale channel and robust international volumes, particularly from Canada. Despite a 2.4% decline in depletions, the underlying performance signals improving momentum in the business.
As part of its long-term strategy to elevate its portfolio, STZ has signed an agreement with The Wine Group to divest a set of mainstream wine brands, associated vineyards and facilities. The deal, expected to close shortly after the first quarter of fiscal 2026, supports the company’s premiumization agenda. By shedding lower-end offerings, STZ aims to sharpen its focus on high-end wine and craft spirits brands that align with evolving consumer preferences. This move not only improves product mix but also strengthens brand equity across key markets.
Constellation Brands is also implementing a broad organizational restructuring expected to yield more than $200 million in annualized cost savings by fiscal 2028, with the majority realized in fiscal 2026. These cost efficiencies, combined with a more premium-focused brand portfolio, are expected to drive margin expansion and long-term growth. Overall, the recovery in wine & spirits marks a pivotal step in STZ’s journey toward sustainable, high-value performance.
STZ’s renewed focus on premiumization, strategic divestitures and structural efficiencies is positioning its wine & spirits business for sustained profitability and relevance in a dynamic market. The turnaround marks a critical milestone in its transformation journey.
STZ’s Valuation Picture
Constellation Brands is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 12.34X, which positions it at a discount compared with the industry’s average of 15.35X. Also, STZ is priced lower than the sector’s average of 17.37X.

See our latest analysis for Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad is not owned by hedge funds. Carlsberg A/S is currently the largest shareholder, with 51% of shares outstanding. This implies that they have majority interest control of the future of the company. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 3.1% and 2.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."
finnhub,CABGY,2025-06-20T16:00:04,Carlsberg (CABGY) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why,"Carlsberg (CABGY) might move higher on growing optimism about its earnings prospects, which is reflected by its upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=37fe8ad07cebc1f0857a37bc90dd025eb552db98020b471166d530a220d97501,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carlsberg-cabgy-upgraded-strong-buy-160004972.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carlsberg-cabgy-upgraded-strong-buy-160004972.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carlsberg-cabgy-upgraded-strong-buy-160004972.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Investors might want to bet on Carlsberg AS (CABGY), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.
As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Carlsberg is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.
Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Carlsberg imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Carlsberg AS (CABGY) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.
Carlsberg AS is one of 178 individual stocks in the Consumer Staples sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #13 in the Zacks Sector Rank.

Carlsberg AS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).
Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CABGY's full-year earnings has moved 7.4% higher. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.

In Coca-Cola's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 0.2% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
To break things down more, Carlsberg AS belongs to the Beverages - Alcohol industry, a group that includes 17 individual companies and currently sits at #71 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has gained an average of 8.7% so far this year, so CABGY is performing better in this area.

What to expect from the Global Week Ahead?
· U.S. nonfarm jobs data from May
· A European Central Bank meeting, and
· Big global oil producers all vie for investor attention in coming days
Finally, as a new month dawns, court rulings on U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs suggest further plot twists to the trade story.
Next are Reuters’ five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—
(1) On Friday at 8:30 am ET, June Federal Nonfarm Jobs Report Lands
As ever-changing tariff developments muddy the growth outlook, the May U.S. jobs report will provide key insight into the state of the economy heading into another bout of trade turbulence.
Friday's report is expected to show the economy created 130,000 new jobs, according to a Reuters poll, down from a higher-than-expected 177,000 in April.
The data comes as Federal Reserve officials acknowledge they could face ""difficult tradeoffs"" in coming months with rising inflation alongside rising unemployment, minutes from their latest meeting show.
Investors have reduced bets on the amount of expected Fed monetary policy easing, with fewer than two rate cuts now priced in by December.
They're also watching the progress of tax-and-spending legislation in Washington, with Trump ally Elon Musk arguing that the tax bill detracts from efforts to reduce the budget deficit.
(2) Global Macro Financial Markets Worry, Uncertainty Remains High
Investors must be relieved to leave behind another roller-coaster month. But the back-and-forth in the courts on Trump's tariffs heightens uncertainty ahead.
Still, there's no stopping world stocks, which have long forgotten their ""Liberation Day"" losses. The S&P 500 index, up over +6% in May, is set for its best performance since November.
The picture is bleaker with focus on fiscal discipline, underscored by the U.S. losing its last top AAA rating.
U.S. 30-year Treasury yields are holding around 5% and led a recent global bond selloff, with Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill seen further raising the already-high U.S. budget deficit.
The dollar has remained -4% lower since April 2 when Trump announced his tariffs.
Debt worries reverberate elsewhere. Japan, where longer-dated bond yields soared to record highs and the sale of such debt has seen tepid demand, remains in focus.
(3) OPEC+ Meets
Eight OPEC+ members, in the process of gradually raising output, should meet online on Saturday to decide on an increase in oil production in July.
They may agree to an output hike of 411,000 barrels per day, the same as in May and June, OPEC+ delegates tell Reuters. Others say the number has yet to be decided.
OPEC+ pumps about half the world's oil and has agreed on three layers of output cuts since 2022 to support oil prices. Two of these are in place until end-2026, one is currently being unwound by the eight members.
The May and June hikes are faster than originally planned.
The strategy of producers Saudi Arabia and Russia is partly to punish over-producing allies and win back market share. OPEC+ cites healthy market fundamentals as its reasoning.
Oil hit four-year lows in April below $60 after OPEC+ announced accelerating output hikes and as U.S. tariffs stoked growth worries.
It has recovered to about $65 but is still down -13% for the year so far.
(4) On Thursday, June 5th, the European Central Bank (ECB) Should Take Its Policy Rate Down — Again
A quarter-point ECB interest rate cut on June 5th that takes the key rate to 2% is a done deal for traders.
The question now is whether the ECB pauses after what will be an eighth rate reduction in the past year. Economists expect the ECB to hold steady come July before cutting once more before year-end.
The economy is holding up better than anticipated and pausing allows ECB chief Christine Lagarde time to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs.
Eurozone inflation data on Tuesday could show headline inflation hit the ECB's 2% target in May. Finally, expect Lagarde to be put on the spot about whether she's likely to complete her term after a press report that she held talks about leaving early to lead the World Economic Forum.
(5) Will Asian Central Banks Keep Cutting Their Policy Rates?
Upcoming inflation readings across emerging Asian economies could give investors further clarity on the extent policymakers in the region could go in cutting rates.
Central banks like Bank Indonesia have already resumed easing cycles recently and the market consensus is for more to come, as Trump's sweeping tariffs pose significant headwinds to growth in export-reliant Asia.
With inflation trending downwards and amid a recent surge in Asian currencies, policymakers have found greater comfort in lowering rates. The question now is by how much.
The Asian Development Bank expects growth in developing Asia will ease slightly in 2025 to its slowest pace since 2022.
Elsewhere, Australia releases first-quarter growth data on Wednesday. The numbers pre-date April's tariff chaos so any optimism from an upbeat number is likely to be short-lived.

finnhub,CABGY,2025-05-20T16:44:00,PepsiCo Strengthens Wellness Brands Portfolio With Poppi Acquisition,"PEP's acquisition of Poppi strengthens its position in the fast-emerging functional beverage space, signaling a bold strategic pivot toward health innovation.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=9e4abdb76c5dfc0463ae7a17abae43db878758f6cc6b80870d64f05356fa3162,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-strengthens-wellness-brands-portfolio-164400500.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-strengthens-wellness-brands-portfolio-164400500.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-strengthens-wellness-brands-portfolio-164400500.html,yahoo.com,200,,"In a bold step to reshape the future of refreshment, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP has officially completed its acquisition of Poppi, the fast-growing prebiotic soda brand, for $1.95 billion. With an estimated $300 million in tax benefits, the net purchase price comes to $1.65 billion. The deal also includes a performance-based earnout, further tying Poppi’s valuation to its future success.
Poppi, known for its vibrant branding and gut-healthy sodas made with prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider vinegar, has gained popularity among health-conscious Gen Z and millennial consumers. With no more than 5 grams of sugar per serving, Poppi has carved out a leading role in the functional beverage category, a space PepsiCo is eager to dominate as part of its long-term strategic transformation.
Pepsi-Poppi Deal Explained
This acquisition marks a pivotal milestone in PepsiCo’s ongoing portfolio transformation, underscoring the company’s commitment to evolving with consumer demand for great-tasting, functional products that support overall well-being. As part of its broader strategy to build a future-ready beverage and snack portfolio, Poppi joins a growing roster of wellness-oriented brands such as Siete and Sabra.
With health-conscious consumers driving demand for gut-friendly and low-sugar beverage options, Poppi has quickly become a standout name in the industry, known for its vibrant branding, influencer-fueled momentum and functional benefits. By bringing Poppi into its fold, PepsiCo is doubling down on a key growth area, functional wellness, positioning itself ahead of the curve as legacy soda makers adapt to evolving consumer preferences.
As demand grows for beverages that offer health benefits beyond hydration, Poppi provides PepsiCo with a differentiated, science-backed product in a fast-rising segment. Poppi’s meteoric rise has been fueled by a savvy digital strategy and influential partnerships that have made it a staple on platforms like TikTok, an advantage PepsiCo plans to scale globally. The prebiotic soda space is still nascent, giving PepsiCo an edge in shaping consumer behavior and owning a greater share of the emerging health beverage shelf.
With this acquisition, PepsiCo is not just buying a brand, it is buying cultural relevance, health innovation and the future of soft drinks. The integration of Poppi is set to accelerate the company’s transformation into a next-generation food and beverage powerhouse.
Trading PEP Stock in the Face of Headwinds
Despite this strategic win, PepsiCo’s stock has faced persistent pressure over the past year due to ongoing soft top-line trends and operational challenges, particularly in its North America business. Management has pointed to rising global macroeconomic volatility, including trade disruptions, tariffs and sourcing constraints, as key contributors to higher supply-chain costs, threatening margins.
Adding to the uncertainty, consumer demand remains sluggish across many key markets. High inflation continues to constrain household spending, leading to more price-sensitive behavior and reduced discretionary spending, especially in categories like snacks. While PepsiCo has introduced more value-oriented offerings focused on flavor, functionality and portion control, consumer engagement has yet to fully rebound.
In response, PepsiCo is implementing cost containment and productivity strategies, including automation, digital transformation and global supply chain standardization. The company is focusing on international expansion and targeted brand investments to reinvigorate performance in North America.
Nonetheless, the challenging operating environment has prompted PepsiCo to revise its full-year guidance. The company now expects core constant-currency EPS to remain flat year over year, down from its prior outlook for mid-single-digit growth. Organic revenue growth is projected in the low-single-digit range, reflecting constrained consumer spending and ongoing cost pressures.
This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have declined 27.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 4%."

ALBANY, N.Y., August 26, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Soluna Holdings, Inc. (""Soluna"" or the ""Company""), (NASDAQ: SLNH), a developer of green data centers for intensive computing applications, including Bitcoin mining and AI, announced today that the company has reached a key milestone with One Gigawatt (""GW"") of clean computing projects in either operation, construction, or development, positioning the company to lead the way in sustainable data center development in the United States.
The milestone was reached with the launch of two new Texas-based sites: Project Fei, a solar-powered facility in northern Texas, and Project Gladys, a wind-powered facility in the southeast region of the state.
Project Fei is a 100 MW data center co-located with a 240 MW utility-scale solar farm, Soluna’s second solar-based project to date. Developed in partnership with a global leader in energy infrastructure investment, Project Fei will convert underutilized solar energy into clean, high-performance computing power. The project is currently advancing through land acquisition, power contract negotiation, and ERCOT interconnection planning.
The project honors Dr. Fei-Fei Li, a pioneering AI researcher, whose work, including the creation of ImageNet, has helped shape the modern era of artificial intelligence and ethical computing.
""Reaching one gigawatt of clean computing projects in our total development pipeline is a transformative moment for Soluna. Getting these projects from development to operational will put us on par with some of the biggest companies in the world when it comes to clean-powered computing capacity, including Amazon, Meta, and Google,"" said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. ""This means we may be able to effectively displace nearly 48 million metric tons of CO₂, equivalent to removing 11 million cars from the road over the life of these assets, and we believe this is just the beginning of what clean computing can do.""
Project Gladys, a 150 MW facility, will be co-located with a 226 MW wind farm and developed in partnership with a prominent U.S.-based independent power producer (IPP) managing over $40 billion in assets and more than 80 energy facilities nationwide.
The project is currently advancing through land acquisition, power contract negotiation, and ERCOT interconnection planning. It is named after Dr. Gladys West, the mathematician whose groundbreaking work in geospatial modeling paved the way for modern GPS technology."

Soluna expects Kati 1 to be operational in Q1 2026 and called the deal its largest single‑partner deployment to date, following a recent 30 MW rollout with another miner. Galaxy is slated to be the first customer to start mining at the site once construction is complete.
Under the arrangement, Soluna will provide power infrastructure and operations, and deployment is scheduled across Q1–Q2 2026. Soluna also noted a prior $5 million loan facility with Galaxy established in Q1 2025 and said the expansion would lift its operating capacity to 206 MW when fully deployed.

SEC DISMISSES CIVIL ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST COINBASE: The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Thursday that the Commission has filed a joint stipulation with Coinbase (COIN) and Coinbase Global to dismiss the ongoing civil enforcement action against the two entities. On January 21, the Commission announced the formation of the Crypto Task Force, which is dedicated to helping develop a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets. Given the pending work of the Crypto Task Force, the Commission is dismissing this matter, the SEC said.
“For the last several years, the Commission’s views on crypto have been largely expressed through enforcement actions without engaging the general public,” said Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. “It’s time for the Commission to rectify its approach and develop crypto policy in a more transparent manner. The Crypto Task Force is designed to do just that.
On Tuesday, BofA lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase to $311 from $363 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares after the company reported adjusted EPS of $3.38 excluding a $357M after-tax impact from gains on their crypto asset investment portfolio. The firm is raising its 2026 and 2027 EPS estimates to $9.55 and $10.35 from $8.57 and $9.08, respectively, driven by accelerating on-chain volumes and utilization of subscription and services revenue sources, but applying a lower multiple on its 2027 EPS estimate given heightened volumes, which it expects to decelerate near-term in-line with sentiment.
CRYPTO EARNINGS: On Monday, Riot Platforms (RIOT) reported FY24 earnings per share of 34c on revenue of $376.7M, which compared to a loss per share of (28c) on revenue of $280.7M last year. The company produced 4,828 bitcoin, as compared to 6,626 during the same twelve-month period in 2023 and held 17,722 unencumbered bitcoin, equating to approximately $1.65B.
“Riot had a remarkable year in 2024, generating record revenue of $376.7M and net income of $109.4M,” said Jason Les, CEO. “These results are particularly noteworthy in the context of the Bitcoin network’s ‘halving’ in April of 2024, and an increase in global hash rate of 67% over the course of the year. Riot also generated record adjusted EBITDA of $463.2M in 2024, demonstrating the value of our Bitcoin treasury policy of retaining Bitcoin production rather than selling. Due to our efforts over the prior year, we are in an exceptionally strong position and focused on executing on the exciting opportunities ahead of us to maximize shareholder value, particularly on the AI/HPC front.”"

Management Commentary
“The second quarter of 2025 marked a return to growth in book value and strong net earnings due to performance of our Helios Managed Investments and improved expectations of value realization from the underlying investments,” said Tope Lawani and Babatunde Soyoye, Co-CEOs of Helios Fairfax Partners. “We actively seek investments in innovative and value-creating sectors of the African economy, and in keeping with that strategy we deployed capital towards a number of existing investments, including Helios Fund IV, Helios Digital Ventures and Helios Sports & Entertainment Group. We are encouraged by the improving environment for fund raising and remain well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities that will drive long-term capital appreciation for Helios Fairfax Partners.”
Highlights During and Subsequent to the Second Quarter of 2025
-
Book value per share for the second quarter of 2025 was $3.96, compared to $3.85 in the first quarter of 2025.
-
HFP reported net earnings of $11.6 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to net earnings of $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2025.
-
The increase in book value per share compared to the first quarter of 2025 and the net earnings in the second quarter of 2025 were primarily due to unrealized gains related to the Helios Managed Investments and TopCo LP Class A. These unrealized gains were offset by unrealized losses on the company’s investments in TopCo LP Class B and Indirect equity investment in Nova Pioneer.
-
HFP deployed $1.2 million under the loan facility with Digital Ventures and $1.5 million under the $13.5 million loan facility with HSEG during the quarter. HFP also entered into a new loan facility with HSEG for $10 million during the quarter and deployed $5.0 million under that facility.
-
HFP funded capital calls of $6.2 million for Helios Fund IV and $0.9 million for TopCo LP Class A during the quarter.
-
HFP redeemed part of its investment in Seven Rivers for $18.0 million during the quarter, $9.0 million of which was received in cash and $9.0 million of which was receivable at June 30, 2025.
-
Subsequent to the second quarter of 2025, HFP committed to investing $20.0 million in Helios Fund V, which completed its first close. HFP also committed to contribute $2.0 million in respect of the management team commitment for Helios Fund V, which will entitle HFP to a 50% share of any carried interest that the fund generates in the future through its ownership of TopCo LP Class A. Through its ownership of TopCo LP Class B, HFP will also be entitled to receive Excess Management Fees from this fund."

“In 2024, we further advanced our strategy by deploying $55 million across high-growth sectors and divesting a key Legacy Non-Core asset for $16.3 million,” said Tope Lawani and Babatunde Soyoye, Co-CEOs of Helios Fairfax Partners. “Our investments contributed to the advancement of a number of new and exciting businesses including PFL Africa, a new regional league of the rapidly-growing Professional Fighters League; SeamlessHR, a Cloud-based HR and payroll platform digitizing employee lifecycle management; M2P Solutions, a rapidly expanding provider of infrastructure API and Banking-as-a-Service technology; and Moment, which offers integrated payments and other financial services to businesses and consumers.

Highlights During the Fourth Quarter of 2024
-
Book value per share for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $3.84, compared to $4.23 in the third quarter of 2024.
-
HFP reported a net loss of $41.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to net earnings of $4.0 million in the third quarter of 2024.
-
The decrease in book value per share compared to the third quarter of 2024 and the net loss in the fourth quarter were due to unrealized losses from the company’s investment in TopCo LP. These losses were offset by unrealized gains related to the Helios Managed Investments as well as interest and dividend income. Also contributing to the decrease in book value per share and net loss for the quarter was a loss on the forgiveness of the GP and management company loans and other expenses.
-
HFP deployed $5.1 million under the loan facility with Digital Ventures during the quarter.
-
HFP disposed of $16.3 million of Legacy Non-Core investments during the quarter, comprising $2.4 million for the sale of Indirect equity interest in AGH, $4.4 million for the sale of the AGH Loan, and $9.5 million for the sale of the Philafrica Facility."

Management Commentary
“The fair value of our Helios Managed Investments continued to grow in the third quarter of 2024, increasing by $7.2 million or 3% from the second quarter of 2024 and by $15.7 million or 8% over the same period last year,” said Tope Lawani and Babatunde Soyoye, Co-CEOs of Helios Fairfax Partners. “In keeping with our strategy of investing in businesses that benefit from the long-term secular trends of demographics & urbanization and technology & innovation, in the third quarter we made a new investment in Taj Holdings, which owns an equity interest in a leading fintech that provides infrastructure API and Banking-as-a-Service BaaS technology and is expanding rapidly across Africa and the wider region. We also deployed additional capital into Helios Sports & Entertainment Group, Helios Digital Ventures and Helios Fund IV. Our Legacy Non-Core investments now represent less than 8% of our investment portfolio, and we remain focused on exiting these assets in an orderly fashion. We intend to deploy the proceeds, and the over $27 million in cash on our balance sheet, in innovative and value-creating businesses that will drive Africa’s economy for years to come.”

What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.
If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.
Fund Sponsor & Index
SFY is managed by Sofi, and this fund has amassed over $516.29 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Growth. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the SOLACTIVE SOFI US 500 GROWTH INDEX .
The Solactive SoFi US 500 Growth Index follows a rules-based methodology that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest U.S.-listed companies weighted based on a proprietary mix of their market capitalization and fundamental factors.
Cost & Other Expenses
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.
Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.05% for SFY, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.54%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
For SFY, it has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector --about 39% of the portfolio --while Financials and Healthcare round out the top three."

The fund is sponsored by Sofi. It has amassed assets over $503.25 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.
Why Large Cap Growth
Large cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.
Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Further, growth stocks have a higher level of volatility associated with them. They are likely to outperform value stocks in strong bull markets but over the longer-term, value stocks have delivered better returns than growth stocks in almost all markets.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.05%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.55%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 38.80% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Nvidia Corp (NVDA) accounts for about 12.18% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).
The top 10 holdings account for about 41.32% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
SFY seeks to match the performance of the SOLACTIVE SOFI US 500 GROWTH INDEX before fees and expenses. The Solactive SoFi US 500 Growth Index follows a rules-based methodology that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest U.S.-listed companies weighted based on a proprietary mix of their market capitalization and fundamental factors.
The ETF has added roughly 9.41% so far this year and is up about 17.21% in the last one year (as of 07/09/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $90.76 and $119.23."

(stock code: 1093.HK), has been accepted by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). KN026 has been applied for as a Class 1 therapeutic biological product and the indication is for use in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who have failed at least one prior systemic therapy (which must include trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy).
This NDA for KN026 is primarily based on a pivotal Phase II/III clinical trial (Study ID: KN026-001). Results from the first interim analysis of the Phase III clinical study demonstrated that, compared to the current standard of care, KN026 combined with chemotherapy significantly improved clinical efficacy, by prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Furthermore, the combination showed no new safety signals, with a low incidence of cardiotoxicity and low immunogenicity in terms of safety profile. Previously, results from the Phase II clinical study, presented at the 2024 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, showed that KN026 in combination with chemotherapy achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 40.0%, with a median PFS of 8.6 months as assessed by the independent review committee (IRC). KN026 was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the NMPA on November 4, 2023, and received Priority Review status on August 28, 2025.
Currently, there are no approved anti-HER2 therapies for the second-line treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer. KN026 is the first HER2 bispecific antibody to demonstrate positive results in the second-line treatment of gastric cancer in China. Meanwhile, multiple pivotal Phase III clinical studies of KN026 in gastric cancer and breast cancer are undergoing smoothly, with the aim of benefiting more patients.
About KN026
KN026 is an anti-HER2 bispecific antibody independently developed by Alphamab Oncology using the proprietary Fc-based heterodimer bispecific platform technology called CRIB (Charge Repulsion Induced Bispecific). KN026 can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes of HER2, leading to HER2 signal blockade. KN026 has demonstrated better tumor inhibition in HER2-positive tumor cell lines compared with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in combination. Additionally, KN026 has also shown inhibitory effect on tumor cells with trastuzumab-resistant cell lines."

Seeking to expand treatment of the liver disease MASH, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals is paying $120 million to Hong Kong-based drugmaker CSPC Pharmaceutical Group for global rights to an oral GLP-1 drug in preclinical development. The deal offers CSPC potentially $2 billion in additional payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. Madrigal executives said they plan on combining the CSPC drug, called SYH2086, with the company’s MASH drug Rezdiffra in a once-daily pill. They envision treatment could combine the benefits of weight loss from a GLP-1 pill with the antifibrotic and fat reducing qualities of Rezdiffra to give people with MASH additional disease control. — Jonathan Gardner
Kissei Pharmaceutical is paying $70 million upfront and offering up to $315 million in milestone payments to Viridian Therapeutics for Japanese rights to two antibody drugs for thyroid eye disease. Viridian has already announced positive Phase 3 study data for the most advanced drug in the deal, called veligrotug. The second, called VRDN-003, is in ongoing Phase 3 testing. The company hopes to compete with Amgen’s marketed drug for thyroid eye disease, Tepezza, by offering a more convenient dosing regimen.— Jonathan Gardner
The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved broader use of Apellis Pharmaceuticals’ rare disease drug Empaveli, clearing it for the kidney diseases C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in people 12 years of age or older. In testing, treatment with Empaveli reduced urine protein levels by significantly more than placebo and stabilized kidney function. Earlier this year, Novartis won FDA approval of its drug Fabhalta for use in adults with C3G. — Ned Pagliarulo
People with the rare disease phenylketonuria, or PKU, have a new treatment option after the FDA on Monday approved the drug Sephience from PTC Therapeutics. In a statement, the company highlighted what it described as a broad label that includes all disease subtypes in people who are 1 month of age or older. News of the approval sent shares in PTC higher by nearly 10% this week. The company is also awaiting agency decisions on drugs for Friedrich's ataxia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. — Ned Pagliarulo
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals said Monday that it had earned a $100 million milestone payment from Sarepta Therapeutics under their research alliance, after meeting a patient enrollment target in a Phase 1/2 trial of its treatment for myotonic muscular dystrophy. Such fees are part of the normal course of business in biotech, but payment by Sarepta had suddenly become in doubt after the company’s standoff with the FDA over whether it could continue selling its gene therapy Elevidys. The Duchenne treatment is vital to Sarepta’s financial future, so the prospect of it being removed from market sparked concerns Sarepta might reach a point when it would no longer be able to meet its obligations. That risk appears to have receded for now, after the FDA relented Tuesday. Arrowhead expects to receive the $100 million within 60 days. — Ned Pagliarulo"

Combining Rezdiffra with the oral GLP-1, SYH2086, offers potential for a best-in-class MASH treatment in a once-a-day, well-tolerated pill
CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa., July 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDGL) (“Madrigal”) today announced that it has entered into an exclusive global license agreement with CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited (HKEX Stock CodeL 1093) (“CSPC”) for SYH2086, a preclinical oral small molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist and orforglipron derivative. Madrigal plans to initiate clinical development in the first half of 2026.
“We’ve made remarkable progress this year advancing our strategic priorities – from the continued successful launch of Rezdiffra, to securing new IP protection through 2044, to laying the groundwork for Rezdiffra’s next stages of growth in F4c and Europe,” said Bill Sibold, Chief Executive Officer of Madrigal. “This agreement to acquire global rights to SYH2086 aligns perfectly with our long-term goal to extend our leadership in MASH by building a pipeline anchored by Rezdiffra. We believe a combination of Rezdiffra and SYH2086 has the potential to deliver a best-in-class oral treatment for patients with MASH.”
David Soergel, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Madrigal, added, “The clinical rationale for developing a combination therapy with Rezdiffra and an oral GLP-1 is clear: we want to optimize efficacy and tolerability in MASH by balancing the weight loss from a GLP-1 with the fibrosis and lipid reduction of Rezdiffra in a once-a-day pill. In the pivotal Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH trial, even modest weight loss of five percent or more enhanced Rezdiffra’s antifibrotic benefit, so we are confident that combination therapy with SYH2086 has the potential to provide increased efficacy for patients with MASH.”
“We are pleased to announce the in-license of our oral GLP-1 by Madrigal, an innovative company that pioneered the first approved treatment for MASH,” said Dongchen Cai, Chairman of the Board, CSPC. “We believe Madrigal’s strong clinical development and commercial capabilities will help unlock the full potential of SYH2086 to benefit patients.”
Financial Considerations
Under the agreement, CSPC has granted Madrigal an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SYH2086. CSPC will receive an upfront payment of $120 million and is eligible to receive up to $2 billion in milestone payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved, as well as royalties on net sales. CSPC may develop and commercialize other oral GLP-1 agonists in China subject to certain conditions. The transaction is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to the applicable regulatory clearance."

The agreement covers exclusive commercialization rights to RB-164 in the United States of America (USA), Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Australia. CSPC will retain all rights to SYS6005 in the remaining global markets.
ROR-1 is highly expressed in embryonic tissue, and a variety of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. ROR-1 expression is low in healthy adult cells but is closely related to disease progression and treatment response in cancer. This makes ROR-1 an attractive therapeutic target for anti-cancer drug development. RB-164 employs a novel Fc-silenced monoclonal antibody targeting ROR-1, site specific conjugation to deliver a homogeneous Drug-to-Antibody distribution and prevent retro-Michael elimination (high stability) which provides an improved pharmacokinetic and toxicology profile.
An Investigational New Drug (IND) application for RB-164 has been cleared by China's regulatory agency, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). RB-164 is currently being investigated by CSPC in a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in advanced liquid and solid tumors in China. Radiance and CSPC will work collaboratively to file an IND application with the USA Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to execute the clinical development of RB-164. Radiance will be responsible for the clinical development of RB-164 in the US and other licensed territories.

Overview: CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited is an investment holding company involved in the research, development, manufacture, and sale of pharmaceutical products across China and internationally, with a market cap of HK$50.61 billion.
Operations: The company's revenue is primarily derived from Finished Drugs, generating CN¥24.97 billion, along with contributions from Bulk Products - Vitamin C at CN¥1.91 billion, Functional Food and Others at CN¥2.02 billion, and Bulk Products - Antibiotics at CN¥1.82 billion.

The company reported significant progress in product development, including marketing approvals for Enlonstobart Injection and Omalizumab for Injection. CSPC's financials show a robust balance sheet with short-term assets exceeding liabilities and debt well-covered by operating cash flow.

You are not alone. Whether you have been tracking the stock for years or just came across it during a recent surge, figuring out your next move can feel daunting when opinions differ widely. Let’s cut through some of the noise by focusing on what really matters: how the market is valuing the company today, and how that compares to its recent moves.
IAS shares have been on a bumpy ride lately. Over the past month, the stock surged 13.2%, a move that outpaces many peers in the industry, even as it held basically flat over the last week. If you look further back, the returns tell a more complex story. Year to date, shares are down 3.8%, and over the past year, the decline stands at 2.4%. Looking at the three-year performance, however, the stock is up 31.2%, which suggests there may be more going on beneath the surface than short-term headline swings.
From a valuation standpoint, Integral Ad Science Holding currently earns a value score of 3 out of 6. This means it is undervalued on half of the major measures analysts track. This raises some interesting questions about both upside potential and risk, especially as shifting industry dynamics drive new interest in ad verification and digital measurement firms like IAS.
Let’s break down how that value score was reached by using the different approaches analysts rely on. At the end, I will share an even more practical lens for understanding whether IAS is truly a bargain or just looks good on paper.
Approach 1: Integral Ad Science Holding Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis
A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company’s value by projecting its future free cash flows and then discounting those cash flows back to today’s dollars. This technique aims to determine what the business is fundamentally worth, regardless of recent market movements.
For Integral Ad Science Holding, the current free cash flow stands at $111.56 million. Analysts forecast significant growth, with the company’s free cash flow projected to reach $242.9 million by 2029. Only the next five years have detailed analyst estimates, while projections beyond that are extrapolated by Simply Wall St. The DCF calculation in this case uses all these estimates to determine a fair valuation.
According to this method, the intrinsic value of IAS shares is $40.32 each. Based on recent prices, this model indicates that the stock is trading at a 74.8% discount to its fair value, which suggests undervaluation from a long-term cash flow perspective."
finnhub,IAS,2025-09-25T18:41:00,Integral Ad Science (IAS) Surges 20.5%: Is This an Indication of Further Gains?,Integral Ad Science (IAS) witnessed a jump in share price last session on above-average trading volume. The latest trend in earnings estimate revisions for the stock doesn't suggest further strength down the road.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=503e650ff315d855664615dcfe463b066f37d0388725e3e316aabd43f566c19b,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/integral-ad-science-ias-surges-184100013.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/integral-ad-science-ias-surges-184100013.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/integral-ad-science-ias-surges-184100013.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Integral Ad Science (IAS) shares ended the last trading session 20.5% higher at $10.19. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 4.2% loss over the past four weeks.
The stock rose after the company announced a definitive acquisition agreement with Novacap, a North American private equity firm. Under the deal, Novacap will acquire IAS for $10.30 per share in cash, effectively taking the company private.
This digital advertising verification company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10%. Revenues are expected to be $149.2 million, up 11.7% from the year-ago quarter.
Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.
For Integral Ad Science, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on IAS going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Integral Ad Science’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Integral Ad Science and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock gained 3% on the news that investors scooped up equities, shaking off the initial concerns inferred from the Fed's dot plot, with tech stocks leading the charge.
As a reminder, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points the previous day and signaled that more reductions could come before year-end and beyond. Initially when the cut was announced and Fed Chair Powell held his press conference, there was a pullback in the market as the Fed's ""dot plot"" revealed that only one cut was likely for 2026. This was below the three cuts that had been priced into the markets. This was the first interest rate cut of 2025, a move investors had widely anticipated. In response to the decision, stocks rose significantly, positioning major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to open at record levels.
The Fed's decision was influenced by signs of a weakening labor market. Lower interest rates are generally seen as positive for stocks because they reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make fixed-income investments like bonds less attractive by comparison, driving capital into the equity market. While Fed Chair Powell noted the path forward has risks, the prospect of looser monetary policy has fueled optimism on Wall Street.
Integral Ad Science is down 3.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $10.20 per share, it is trading 19.8% below its 52-week high of $12.72 from November 2024.

What Happened?
A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after investors scooped up equities, shaking off the initial concerns inferred from the Fed's dot plot, with tech stocks leading the charge.
As a reminder, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points yesterday and signaled that more reductions could come before year-end and beyond. Initially when the cut was announced and Fed Chair Powell held his press conference, there was a pullback in the market as the Fed's ""dot plot"" revealed that only one cut was likely for 2026. This was below the three cuts that had been priced into the markets. This was the first interest rate cut of 2025, a move investors had widely anticipated. In response to the decision, stocks rose significantly, positioning major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to open at record levels.
The Fed's decision was influenced by signs of a weakening labor market. Lower interest rates are generally seen as positive for stocks because they reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make fixed-income investments like bonds less attractive by comparison, driving capital into the equity market. While Fed Chair Powell noted the path forward has risks, the prospect of looser monetary policy has fueled optimism on Wall Street.
The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

New collaboration offers advanced emissions measurement at no additional cost for all IAS customers globally
NEW YORK, Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Integral Ad Science (Nasdaq: IAS), a leading global media measurement and optimization platform, today announced a significant step forward in the universal decarbonization of digital media, in partnership with responsible media platform Good-Loop. Following the launch of the Global Media Sustainability Framework 1.2 (GMSF) at Cannes, IAS is now enabling advertisers to directly and seamlessly measure emissions of every ad impression delivered across the open internet, at no additional cost.
With new carbon emissions legislation rolling out across the globe and brands setting new sustainability goals, carbon emissions measurement is rapidly becoming an essential pillar of media quality metrics, standing alongside IAS's established standards such as viewability, fraud prevention, brand safety & suitability, and geographic accuracy. By seamlessly integrating sustainability metrics with its comprehensive suite of media quality solutions for advertisers, IAS is empowering advertisers to not only ensure their ads are seen by real people in appropriate environments, but also to measure and reduce the environmental impact of every digital campaign on the open internet—helping brands drive results with greater transparency and responsibility.
Good-Loop, a certified B Corporation on a mission to deliver positive, climate-friendly advertising, has been powering emissions measurement within the IAS platform for the past three years. During this time, IAS and Good-Loop collaborated with early-adopter advertisers to establish crucial benchmarks, all while supporting the Advertising Association and Ad Net Zero in the development of a universal industry standard.
""As the methodologies and technologies have matured in this space, so too has our ambition,"" said Good-Loop Founder & CEO Amy Williams. ""We now know, in no uncertain terms, the environmental impact that media buying has, and it's time to take this information into the mainstream – to change our industry for the better. That's why I am so excited to announce today that IAS customers globally will be able to understand, and therefore take action to reduce, the carbon footprint of their media investments across a vast majority of their digital campaigns.""
""Sustainability in advertising requires more than promises — it needs accountability. We believe this level of transparency is essential to driving meaningful change across the industry, and we are delivering it to the highest industry standards by partnering with the world's leading carbon measurement providers,"" said Lisa Utzschneider, CEO at Integral Ad Science. ""We're proud to take this next step with Good-Loop so that every impression we measure across the open internet is backed by tangible data on its environmental impact as part of its media quality metrics, and help to make this standard practice for every advertiser we work with, no matter where they are in the world."""

IAS’s trailing and forward P/E were 26.44 and 25.00 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
Integral Ad Science (IAS) is a $1.5 billion digital advertising verification company operating in a duopoly with DoubleVerify (DV) after Oracle’s exit from the space. IAS ensures ads are viewed by real people in brand-safe environments, with revenue divided across optimization ($67.9m, +16% YoY), measurement ($57.0m, +8% YoY), and publisher services ($24.3m, +36% YoY). Its top 100 advertisers, including Meta, Samsung, TikTok, and Volkswagen, have stayed loyal for more than eight years, highlighting its sticky customer base.
Financially, IAS is highly attractive FCF positive, debt-free, with $90.7m in cash and Q2 2025 revenue of $149.2m (+16% YoY). Guidance was raised for FY2025, with revenue now expected at $597–605m and adjusted EBITDA at $208–214m (35% margin). Valuation remains favorable at ~2.5x sales and 7.5x EBITDA, cheaper than DV at 3.3x sales and ~10x EBITDA. Growth is supported by international expansion, including a push into China, where ad spend is expected to surpass $140 billion, offering both “China-in” (serving multinationals advertising domestically) and “China-out” (Chinese brands advertising abroad) opportunities. Additionally, looser content moderation by Meta enhances brand safety demand, providing a secular tailwind.
Ownership dynamics add to the intrigue: Vista Equity Partners (~40%) and Atlas/Accomplice (~14%) face exit pressure, while CEO Lisa Utzschneider and new CFO Alpana Wegner hold meaningful equity incentives that align with a sale. Reports from Bloomberg and Business Insider suggest IAS is actively exploring strategic alternatives with Jefferies, supported by rising professional fees. With rumors of KKR’s interest, IAS appears well-positioned for a potential acquisition. Risks include pricing pressure, litigation involving Vista, customer concentration (notably Meta), and ecosystem changes. However, IAS remains a solid standalone business with durable profitability, international upside, and a likely M&A catalyst, offering investors both resilience and optionality.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Integral Ad Science Holding Corp. (IAS) by P14 Capital in May 2025, which highlighted its duopoly position, innovation edge, and undervaluation versus DoubleVerify. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately 24% since our coverage. This is because IAS continued to deliver strong execution. The thesis still stands as valuation remains attractive. Show me the incentives... shares a similar view but emphasizes China expansion and M&A catalysts."

Why Is Integral Ad Science Not Exciting?
Even though the stock has become cheaper, we're swiping left on Integral Ad Science for now. Here are two reasons you should be careful with IAS and a stock we'd rather own.
1. Long-Term Revenue Growth Disappoints
A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, Integral Ad Science grew its sales at a 15.4% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell slightly short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds.
2. Cash Flow Margin Set to Decline
Free cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.
Over the next year, analysts predict Integral Ad Science’s cash conversion will fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 26.4% for the last 12 months will decrease to 21.6%.
Final Judgment
Integral Ad Science isn’t a terrible business, but it isn’t one of our picks. After the recent drawdown, the stock trades at 2.4× forward price-to-sales (or $8.97 per share). This valuation is reasonable, but the company’s shakier fundamentals present too much downside risk. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now. We’d suggest looking at a safe-and-steady industrials business benefiting from an upgrade cycle.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.
In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.
However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Integral Ad Science (IAS) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this digital advertising verification company a great growth pick right now.
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Integral Ad Science is 69.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 47.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.2%.
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Integral Ad Science is 63.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.6%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 38.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.4%."

Integral Ad Science (IAS) closed the last trading session at $8.83, gaining 9% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $13.25 indicates a 50.1% upside potential.
The mean estimate comprises 14 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $2.61. While the lowest estimate of $9.00 indicates a 1.9% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 103.9% to reach $18.00. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.
While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.
However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in IAS. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.
Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets
According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.
While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?
They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.
However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces."

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Integral Ad Science Holding (NASDAQ:IAS). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.
How Fast Is Integral Ad Science Holding Growing Its Earnings Per Share?
Strong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It is awe-striking that Integral Ad Science Holding's EPS went from US$0.018 to US$0.34 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement.
It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of Integral Ad Science Holding shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 8.8% to 13% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.

StockStory’s Take
Integral Ad Science delivered a quarter that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, driven by robust adoption of its AI-enabled ad verification and optimization solutions across key channels. Management pointed to strong momentum in connected TV (CTV) and social measurement offerings, with CEO Lisa Utzschneider highlighting expanded partnerships and wins in international markets. Utzschneider credited ongoing investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure and enhanced product offerings as central to the company’s ability to secure new customers and deepen existing relationships. Notably, Prebid Social Optimization and new CTV solutions contributed significantly to customer retention and growth, while recent partnerships, such as the two-year expansion with Samsung and new agreements in EMEA and APAC, underpinned the quarter’s outperformance.
Looking ahead, Integral Ad Science’s updated outlook is shaped by continued investment in AI-driven product development and global expansion initiatives. Management emphasized the potential for further growth in optimization and publisher segments, as well as ongoing opportunities to upsell recently acquired Oracle customers. CFO Alpana Wegner noted that the company expects gross margin improvements and operational efficiencies in the second half of the year, while Utzschneider stated, “We believe there is significant runway for growth as we scale product adoption, add new customers and partners, and deepen existing relationships.” Management also highlighted the expansion of social measurement capabilities and new strategic partnerships, such as with Meta and Lyft, as key to driving future adoption and revenue."
finnhub,IAS,2025-08-11T16:45:03,Integral Ad Science (IAS) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Integral Ad Science (IAS) could produce exceptional returns because of its solid growth attributes.,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=1f3f17f7380219c971ccc9362a5d85b3d25ae3bde59556167ced759a53b786e1,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/integral-ad-science-ias-incredible-164503898.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/integral-ad-science-ias-incredible-164503898.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/integral-ad-science-ias-incredible-164503898.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.
By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.
However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Our proprietary system currently recommends Integral Ad Science (IAS) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this digital advertising verification company a great growth pick right now.
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Integral Ad Science is 69.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 30.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 19.8%.
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Integral Ad Science is 63.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.6%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 38.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.4%."
finnhub,IAS,2025-08-11T13:55:01,Wall Street Analysts Believe Integral Ad Science (IAS) Could Rally 48.33%: Here's is How to Trade,"The consensus price target hints at a 48.3% upside potential for Integral Ad Science (IAS). While empirical research shows that this sought-after metric is hardly effective, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions could mean that the stock will witness an upside in the near term.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3c069e48a1934eca8a137398b2661be0a0a766a98488a9f2c552c806a7fe5eda,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-believe-integral-135501289.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-believe-integral-135501289.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-believe-integral-135501289.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Integral Ad Science (IAS) closed the last trading session at $8.98, gaining 14.5% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $13.32 indicates a 48.3% upside potential.
The average comprises 14 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $9.00 to a high of $18.00, with a standard deviation of $2.64. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 0.2% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 100.5% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.
While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.
But, for IAS, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.
Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets
According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.
While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?
They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.
However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces."

The shares rose a hearty 12%-plus following the release of second-quarter earnings after market close on Thursday. That was far more than good enough to beat the benchmark S&P 500 index, which ticked up 0.8% Friday.
A good client list
Integral's revenue rose 16% year over year during the period to slightly north of $149 million. Much of this growth came from the company's optimization services, which drew nearly $68 million for a 16% rise.
Measurement revenue also advanced, although at a more modest 8%, to $57 million. Bringing up the rear was publisher revenue, enjoying a 36% increase to over $24 million.
The improvement on the bottom line was more impressive, with net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) more than doubling to $16.4 million ($0.10 per share) from the year-ago profit of $7.7 million.
Both headline numbers were well above the consensus analyst estimates. On average, pundits tracking Integral stock were estimating the company would register a bit over $143 million on the top line and earn a GAAP profit of $0.04 per share.
We live in a world awash with advertising, and the digital segment is particularly active. There is a right time/right place quality to Integral, which has secured heavyweight clients such as social media giant Meta Platforms and ride-sharing specialist Lyft.
Topping up top-line guidance
Compounding the solid second-quarter results, Integral also increased revenue guidance for the entirety of 2025. It now believes its total top line will come in at $597 million to $605 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are forecast to hit $208 million to $214 million."

What Is The Market Telling Us
Integral Ad Science’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 11 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Integral Ad Science and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 4.4% on the news that the White House announced a new round of steep global tariffs, sparking concerns of a trade war and its impact on the U.S. and global economies. This move creates significant uncertainty for businesses and investors. The new tariffs, with rates of up to 41% on imports from 68 countries and the European Union, prompted a broad market sell-off, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index showing notable weakness. Adding to the bearish sentiment was a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which revealed that employers created only 73,000 jobs, far below economists' expectations. This combination of trade fears and signs of a slowing labor market has created a ""risk-off"" environment, leading investors to pull back from growth-oriented sectors like software and technology.
Integral Ad Science is down 15.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $8.91 per share, it is trading 30% below its 52-week high of $12.72 from November 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Integral Ad Science’s shares at the IPO in June 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $432.75.

Company Overview
Founded in 2009, Integral Ad Science (NASDAQ:IAS) provides digital advertising verification and optimization solutions, ensuring that ads are viewable by real people in brand-safe environments across various platforms and devices.
Revenue Growth
Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, Integral Ad Science grew its sales at a 15.4% compounded annual growth rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell slightly short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds. Luckily, there are other things to like about Integral Ad Science.
This quarter, Integral Ad Science reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.7%, and its $149.2 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 11.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.
Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 10% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. This projection is underwhelming and suggests its products and services will face some demand challenges. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health."

Shares of ad verification company Integral Ad Science (NASDAQ:IAS) jumped 3.2% in the afternoon session after the stock gained ground amid a broader market rally as investors anticipated a busy week of corporate earnings reports.
There was no significant, company-specific news to explain the move for the digital ad verification company. Instead, its shares appeared to be lifted by positive market sentiment, with U.S. stock futures pointing to a higher open. This upbeat mood came as Wall Street braced for a significant number of earnings reports from major U.S. companies during the week. Notably, the earnings season got off to a strong start: More than 85% of the S&P 500 stocks that reported earnings exceeded expectations, according to FactSet data. This robust performance fueled positive sentiment, suggesting that corporate profitability remained resilient despite ongoing economic uncertainties.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $8.53, up 3.2% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Integral Ad Science’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 13 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock dropped 8.9% after stocks gave back some of the gains from the previous day as the White House clarified the tariffs on imports from China would add up to 145%, while the baseline 10% tariffs remained in place for all countries. This reminded markets that the global trade environment remained volatile, limiting the potential for sustained gains. Also, President Trump said he was willing to accept pain in the short term, and was aware his policies could cause a recession, but he remained more mindful of a more severe case of economic depression (higher unemployment and prolonged downturn). For investors, this suggested that the administration could prioritize long-term structural shifts over near-term economic stability, further increasing policy-driven risk in the markets.
Integral Ad Science is down 19.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $8.53 per share, it is trading 32.9% below its 52-week high of $12.72 from November 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Integral Ad Science’s shares at the IPO in June 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $414.67.

A marketing manager looking at the data dashboard of a marketing automation software showing successful campaign results.
Integral Ad Science (IAS) delivered a strong 1Q25 performance amid a broader ad tech downturn, yet the market reaction was subdued, likely due to conservative guidance. Revenue rose 17.1% Y/Y to $134.1M, while adjusted EBITDA jumped 26% Y/Y, driven by strong adoption of its Optimization pre-bid stack, which now represents 48% of total revenue. The company continues to gain traction as advertisers pivot toward performance-focused strategies.
New launches such as Dynamic Performance Profile and audience-enriched contextual targeting are already demonstrating meaningful improvements in conversion and efficiency. Strategic integrations with TikTok, Amazon, and Reddit, along with international expansion and strong mid-market momentum, highlight IAS’s growing footprint. Publisher revenue rose 33% Y/Y, led by the Publica SSP, while international sales grew 18.5% despite APAC headwinds.
IAS is also making an early push into China, with alpha tests and brand events underway, signaling a meaningful long-term growth opportunity. The company’s cost discipline stood out, with sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue down 380 bps Y/Y, even as IAS scales mid-market operations via an efficient inside-sales model. Despite outperforming peers like DoubleVerify (DV) on margins and growth, IAS still trades at a steep valuation discount, which may narrow with continued execution.
The bear case, while possible, assumes a prolonged macro slowdown and disruption that current client trends do not support. With improving fundamentals, speculative upside from a potential Google ad-stack breakup, and past private equity interest, IAS offers a compelling risk/reward at today’s valuation, with both operational momentum and strategic catalysts aligning.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Integral Ad Science Holding Corp. (IAS) by P14 Capital in May 2025, which highlighted IAS’s dominance in ad verification, sticky customer base, and potential re-rating or acquisition upside. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 4.3% since our coverage. P14 Capital shares an identical view but emphasizes recent product momentum and accelerating international growth."

Shares of biotechnology company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped in the afternoon session after the company presented promising early data for its investigational cancer antigen therapy, mRNA-4359, from a Phase I/II study.
The therapy, when used alongside Merck's Keytruda, showed positive results in melanoma patients. Data presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress revealed a 24% objective response rate, which measures tumor shrinkage. The rate of response increased significantly to 67% in a subgroup of patients whose tumors were positive for the PD-L1 biomarker. Furthermore, the study recorded a 60% disease control rate, meaning patients either saw their tumors shrink or their disease stabilize. The company also noted that the therapy had a manageable safety profile.
Contributing to the positive momentum, the major indices rebounded as signs of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China emerged over the weekend.
The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite jumped around 1.7%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.2%. This rebound follows a significant sell-off the previous trading day, which saw the Nasdaq plummet 3.6% and the S&P 500 sink 2.7% after threats of new tariffs heightened fears of a trade war. Investor sentiment improved after the U.S. President adopted a more conciliatory tone toward Beijing in a social media post. The shift in language helped calm market jitters and spurred a broad-based rally as investors welcomed the potential de-escalation of the trade dispute.
After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $27.00, up 0.5% from previous close.

Not all companies are worth the risk, and that’s why we built StockStory - to help you spot the red flags. Keeping that in mind, here are three cash-burning companies to avoid and some better opportunities instead.
MarineMax (HZO)
Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: -2.3%
Appropriately headquartered in Clearwater, Florida, MarineMax (NYSE:HZO) sells boats, yachts, and other marine products.
Why Are We Cautious About HZO?
-
Store closures and poor same-store sales reveal weak demand and a push toward operational efficiency
-
Weak same-store sales trends over the past two years suggest there may be few opportunities in its core markets to open new locations
-
Unfavorable liquidity position could lead to additional equity financing that dilutes shareholders
MarineMax’s stock price of $23.90 implies a valuation ratio of 15.1x forward P/E. If you’re considering HZO for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.
Tilray (TLRY)
Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: -10.7%
Founded in 2013, Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) engages in cannabis research, cultivation, and distribution, offering a range of medical and recreational cannabis products, hemp-based foods, and alcoholic beverages.
Why Are We Out on TLRY?
-
Costs have risen faster than its revenue over the last year, causing its operating margin to decline by 248.3 percentage points
-
Cash burn has widened over the last year, making us question whether it can reliably generate shareholder value
-
Negative returns on capital show management lost money while trying to expand the business, and its falling returns suggest its earlier profit pools are drying up
At $1.67 per share, Tilray trades at 27.3x forward EV-to-EBITDA. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than TLRY.
Moderna (MRNA)
Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin: -113%
Rising to global prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic with one of the first effective vaccines, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) develops messenger RNA (mRNA) medicines that direct the body's cells to produce proteins with therapeutic or preventive benefits for various diseases.
Why Should You Sell MRNA?
-
Annual sales declines of 46.3% for the past two years show its products and services struggled to connect with the market during this cycle
-
242.8 percentage point decline in its free cash flow margin over the last five years reflects the company’s increased investments to defend its market position
-
Limited cash reserves may force the company to seek unfavorable financing terms that could dilute shareholders"

mRNA-4359 has advanced into the Phase 2 portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial
CAMBRIDGE, MA / ACCESS Newswire / October 12, 2025 / Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) today announced that clinical, safety and translational data from its Phase 1/2 study evaluating mRNA-4359 in combination with pembrolizumab in checkpoint inhibitor-resistant/refractory(CPI-R/R) melanoma patients will be presented at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, October 17-21, 2025, in Berlin, Germany. mRNA-4359 is an investigational immune-evasion targeted cancer antigen therapy (CAT) that encodes epitopes of two common immune escape pathways, PD-L1 and IDO1, to elicit antigen-specific T cell responses that may directly kill tumor cells and deplete tumor suppressor cells.
The presentation includes data from 29 participants with CPI-R/R melanoma who have had ≥1 prior checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy. Participants received the combination therapy at 400 µg (n=14) or 1,000 µg (n=15), given intramuscularly every three weeks for up to nine doses. Across all evaluable patients, the objective response rate (ORR) was 24% and disease control rate (DCR), or the combination of patients achieving tumor response and stable disease, was 60%. Among those with response-evaluable disease and PD-L1+ (TPS≥1%) tumors, the ORR was 67% (6 of 9 participants), with treatment successfully inducing peripheral antigen-specific T cell responses and novel T cell receptor clones. The median duration of response (DOR) was not reached. The improved efficacy in PD-L1+ patients supports PD-L1 as a potential predictive biomarker in this high unmet need population.
""While early, today's mRNA-4359 melanoma data in highly CPI-refractory metastatic patients are unique in the field and incredibly promising for future development options. We are encouraged by its potential to address such a high unmet need for many patients,"" said Dr. Kyle Holen, Head of Development, Therapeutics and Oncology, Moderna. ""Where other checkpoint inhibitors restore non-specific T cell activity, mRNA-4359 encodes two critical immune escape pathways to help generate new, target-directed T cells. This could enable broader and more durable immune responses for patients who have not had success with prior lines of therapy. We are proud to present these data and to demonstrate the role our mRNA-based therapies could play in transforming the lives of those affected by cancer.""
mRNA-4359 in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated a consistently manageable safety profile, with no new immune-related adverse events (AEs). mRNA-4359 continues to be evaluated in an ongoing phase 1/2 study (NCT05533697) as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."

Zooming In On AMN Healthcare Services (AMN)
AMN Healthcare Services’s shares are very volatile and have had 29 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 4% on the news that reports revealed a potential drug-pricing agreement between the White House and the pharmaceutical industry.
The Trump administration is advancing its “Most Favored Nation” initiative, which aims to lower prescription drug costs for Americans. This policy would tie the prices of medications in the U.S. to the lowest costs paid by other wealthy nations. As part of this push, Pfizer has reportedly entered into an agreement to voluntarily sell its medications through Medicaid at these reduced prices. The move comes as the administration intensifies pressure on drugmakers to make prices more affordable. While pricing controls can often be a headwind, the market's positive reaction suggests that investors may see this voluntary agreement as a way to resolve regulatory uncertainty, providing a clearer path forward for the industry."

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist
The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Moderna (MRNA) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$1.73 a share, just 27 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 6, 2025.
MRNA has an Earnings ESP figure of +11.41%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$1.73 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$1.95.
MRNA is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Medpace (MEDP) as well.
Medpace, which is readying to report earnings on October 22, 2025, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. Its Most Accurate Estimate is currently $3.65 a share, and MEDP is 12 days out from its next earnings report.
Medpace's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at +4.31% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.5.
MRNA and MEDP's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.

AstraZeneca has upped its planned investment in a new drug manufacturing facility in Virginia. In a Thursday announcement, the company said it’s adding $500 million to a previously announced $4 billion commitment to the Albemarle County, Virginia, plant, which will produce drugs like its experimental obesity pill, a blood pressure medication and an oral PCSK9 inhibitor. AstraZeneca is now adding antibody-drug conjugates to the facility’s manufacturing capabilities as well. The plant will employ 700 workers, once operational. — Ben Fidler
Venture firm Ascenta Capital announced Thursday the closing of a $325 million fund to back development-stage biotechnology companies. The firm, which was founded in 2023 by Moderna veterans Evan Rachlin and Lorence Kim, has already put more than $100 million into six biotechs, among them Odyssey Therapeutics, OrsoBio, and Cardurion Pharma. In a statement, the company said its preference is to lead or co-lead investments in “multi-medicine” biotechs at the “early stages” of human testing. — Delilah Alvarado
Expedition Therapeutics raised a $165 million Series A round to support testing of a lung disease drug it recently licensed from Fosun Pharma. The drug is part of a class of medicines that target the enzyme DPP-1, which is linked to the development and progression of multiple inflammatory conditions. Expedition’s financing, co-led by Sofinnova Investments and Novo Holdings, will fund a Phase 2 trial in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The company is run by former Goldman Sachs banker Yi Larson and is one of many recently formed startups aiming to in-license assets from China. — Ben Fidler
Ferring Pharmaceuticals plans to lay off up to 500 employees in an effort to cut costs. The Switzerland-based company said Tuesday it is “aligning its operations” with a recently announced “Enterprise Model” that’ll boost its core business and provide “flexibility to pursue new opportunities.” Chief Medical and Science Officer Pierre-Yves Berclaz took an “early retirement” as part of the initiative, and a new company council was formed to replace an old advisory committee as well. Ferring didn’t say when the job cuts would be completed. — Delilah Alvarado
Sanofi said on Wednesday an experimental radiopharmaceutical it’s developing succeeded in a mid-stage trial. The French pharmaceutical company didn’t provide specifics, but said the therapy, dubbed AlphaMedix, met all of its main goals and displayed “clinically meaningful” response rates as well as “prolonged clinical benefits” in people with a type of neuroendocrine tumor. Sanofi got the drug through a 2024 deal with Orano Med. Full findings will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress this month and form the basis of discussions with global health authorities. — Delilah Alvarado"

Moderna Investment Narrative Recap
To invest in Moderna, you have to believe in the company's ability to diversify beyond COVID-19 and maintain strong momentum in its mRNA pipeline, while navigating uncertain vaccine demand and profitability. The recent surge in share price, driven by improved revenue growth and renewed optimism for upcoming earnings, may boost short-term sentiment, but it does not materially change the main catalyst or the biggest risk: continued volatility in vaccine sales and whether new products can offset declining COVID revenues.
Of Moderna's recent updates, Health Canada's authorization of the updated Spikevax KP.2 variant stands out, as it reinforces the company’s ongoing role in global COVID-19 immunization. While such regulatory wins can influence investor confidence, the much larger and more persistent challenge remains whether non-seasonal pipeline products can deliver the needed revenue stability as dependence on COVID-19 vaccines continues to wane.
However, investors should be mindful that even with upbeat headlines, one of the most crucial risks is...

Lab equipment scheduling platform supporting pharma and life sciences R&D organisations’ AI journey amidst industry upheaval
LONDON, October 08, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clustermarket, the lab equipment scheduling platform, has today announced it is rebranding to Calira and welcoming non-executive director and investor Edmund Wilson, co-founder and former CEO of Titian Software (now Cenevo), to capitalise on increasing enterprise demand for optimising lab operations.
The company’s software has been popular with academic institutions and SMBs for several years, but has seen a recent upsurge in interest from enterprise research and development organisations—such as Merck (MSD), Moderna, Eli Lilly, Takeda and Lonza—as pharma and life sciences companies navigate market turmoil. This follows wider industry data that shows global biopharma lay-offs rose 63% in 2024 compared to 2022.
This disruption is forcing businesses to look at return on investment in R&D, and Calira says this will put increased pressure on LabOps teams to justify existing CapEx investments and provide the data needed to support tighter procurement rules. However, with McKinsey estimating that average asset utilisation in pharma stands at 35%, it is clear that this is easier said than done.
Demand for R&D ROI increases
Calira’s equipment scheduling platform helps teams reduce booking conflicts, enable usage tracking, gather accurate data to inform CapEx investments, and cut downtime. The platform incorporates AI to automate booking multiple pieces of equipment, working out the best schedules to suit different requirements.
Johannes Solzbach, CEO and co-founder, Calira, said: ""Lab operations are the critical foundation supporting R&D; without them, expensive assets and lab space are underused, equipment can become misused and damaged, maintenance is less effective, and investments are not maximised. In an environment where every decision is under increased scrutiny, effective, AI-driven lab operations will have a major impact.""
Leading Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation (CDMO) Lonza, turned to Calira to help manage equipment bookings at its Cambridge lab. In doing so, the company’s lab manager, Bishoy Habib, now has the data needed to ""justify new equipment or flag things to get rid of.""
Accelerating momentum
Leading investment firm 24Haymarket and other existing investors are also increasing their backing for the business, underlining investor confidence in Calira and its direction. Alan Jamieson, investor director at 24Haymarket and Calira Chairman, said: ""Calira is at an exciting point in its growth trajectory, and having worked with the team for a number of years, we could see that it is well placed as a company to capitalise on current market opportunities. With our additional backing, we are looking forward to continuing our support of Johannes and the team."""

Biotech companies developing mRNA-based vaccines face uncertainty as the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) – led by health secretary Robert F Kennedy (RFK) Jr – announced on 5 August 2025 cuts of $500m in grant funding for projects involving the development of mRNA vaccines, stating that they “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid[-19] and flu”.
mRNA-based drugs, which include vaccines and therapeutics, deliver synthetic mRNA to cells using lipid nanoparticles or other delivery vehicles, resulting in the production of proteins that can prevent or treat disease. The success of mRNA vaccines – notably Pfizer’s Comirnaty and Moderna’s Spikevax – against the Covid-19 pandemic fuelled investor confidence, and spurred efforts to expand mRNA technology into broader therapy areas such as cancers and genetic disorders.
Access deeper industry intelligence
Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.
Venture financing for companies developing innovator mRNA-based drugs more than halved from $1.1m in 2023 to $488m in 2024, then recovered slightly to $539m by 2025 YTD (Figure 1). Oncology and infectious diseases were the top therapy areas for venture financing involving mRNA-based drugs, totaling $1.3m and $936m, respectively, over the 2023 to 2025 YTD period. Oncology and infectious diseases also accounted for the largest numbers of mRNA-based drugs in active development, accounting for 32% and 31% of drugs in the discovery and preclinical stages, respectively, and 22% and 65% of those in the combined clinical, preregistration, and marketed stages, according to GlobalData’s Pharma Intelligence Center Drugs Database. However, excluding infectious disease and oncology, 91% of the total mRNA-based drugs remain in the preclinical or discovery stages of development with no marketed drugs, reflecting hurdles such as achieving targeted delivery and minimising immunogenicity.
Since RFK Jr’s funding cuts primarily target mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases, investor interest may shift towards other applications of mRNA technology. Following the HHS announcement, the largest round of venture financing for mRNA-based drugs was received by US-based biotech Strand Therapeutics in August 2025, raising $153m in venture financing towards the development of its portfolio of mRNA-based drugs. The company’s lead drug, STX-001, is an interleukin-12-targeting mRNA-based therapy that is currently in Phase I/II trials for the treatment of solid tumours.
The Trump administration’s efforts to scale back federal support for mRNA-based vaccines could disrupt early-stage drug development, which relies on government support to de-risk research and development and attract subsequent private investment. In addition, government skepticism of mRNA technology, especially its use in vaccines for infectious diseases, could create investor uncertainty and lead to a downturn in venture financing for mRNA-based drugs. Future investment in mRNA-based drugs may increasingly favour biotech companies headquartered outside of the US, as well as shift away from US-based sources of capital.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist
The Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.
The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 28 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 3, 2025, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.89 a share.
By taking the percentage difference between the $4.89 Most Accurate Estimate and the $4.56 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has an Earnings ESP of +7.18%.
VRTX is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Moderna (MRNA).
Slated to report earnings on November 6, 2025, Moderna holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and its Most Accurate Estimate is -$1.73 a share 31 days from its next quarterly update.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Moderna is -$1.95, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +11.41%.
Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, VRTX and MRNA could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.

Moderna’s recent 12% share price jump is breathing new life into a stock that’s spent much of the past year out of favor, with its latest financial results prompting renewed optimism about future growth.

Given recent gains and an improving outlook, the big question for investors is whether Moderna’s stock remains undervalued compared to its potential, or if the market is already anticipating future growth in its price.
Most Popular Narrative: 83.7% Undervalued
With Moderna's fair value set at $175 according to its top-followed narrative, and a recent closing price under $30, the narrative positions the stock as deeply discounted. This wide gap highlights an unusually bullish long-term view, despite recent underperformance in the share price.
Currently, the company is trading below its book value, with the potential for explosive growth depending on how any one of its numerous drug and treatment investments pan out. Even without any additional investment in medical innovation, the company has a lot of products in its pipeline ready to go.
Want to know if this optimism holds up? The most important driver behind this sky-high fair value is how the narrative treats Moderna’s evolving product pipeline and long-term profit potential. What are the make-or-break numbers that make this projection so bullish? Get all the details in the full story.

Now time for some of today's training tickers. We are watching Palenteer, AI stocks more broadly and pharma stocks. First up, Palenteer. A few items moving that stock today including a push to end use of the software in Denmark and an army memo. Joining us now for more, Yahoo Finance's Ali Canal. So, lawmakers in Denmark, you know, we've seen in different places, voices push various entities to stop using Palenteer for various sort of political reasons.
Yeah, and it also stems from what Denmark, the government there is calling privacy concerns. And they really want Palenteer to share their source code. Uh lawmakers lawmakers there passing a motion urging officials to quote commit to purchase or developed fully-fledged alternatives to Palenteer and demand that Palenteer disclose that source code saying regulators have no access to how the software handles citizens personal data. So that's something that Palenteer is dealing with uh from the Dutch Parliament. And then you mentioned that army memo and this is an internal memo, first reported by Breaking Defense and Reuters, and it called the system a very high risk system and it warned that enemies could gain undetectable access to sensitive data. That's not something you want to hear from a company that really has centered itself on data and defense. The report saying that authorized users could see all applications no matter their clearance level and that some outside apps weren't properly vetted. Now, army officials saying that this is all part of the normal security review, but investors clearly taking that in combination from what we're hearing with with Denmark and you're seeing shares down around 4% today, but I will say year to date, we are up over 140%. So longer term, um it feels like people are still bullish on Palenteer. There were those question marks of whether or not this was a company that operates like a meme stock, but I think at this point there's enough bulls out there that make the case that this is a company that you should be taking seriously.
Well, yes, taking seriously, maybe buying, maybe that's another question, but it is interesting that, you know, the the that army memo, um the push to modernize the military, they have been really front and center in that. so.
And it's the system designed to connect soldiers, vehicles and commanders in real time. And it also involves other players, Microsoft and Aal, yeah. So it'll be interesting to see how this develops and I guess if this eventually gets cleared too.
Right. Yes, good point. And speaking of Pateer by the way, we are looking at AI stocks more broadly. Uh there is a conference going on in Italy where a lot of various um CEOs are speaking. Among them Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, and they're both addressing the question of whether AI, the AI trade is in a bubble. Some really interesting stuff coming out of that.
Really interesting because a little bit more of caution, I would say than what we've heard from even some of our guests on this show. You have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon saying that investors may be overlooking things to be skeptical about, saying that markets could see a drawdown in the next year or two as capital flows into projects that quote, don't deliver returns. Now, this is something we've been discussing because even if you look at Open AI, which is the most valuable private company now, doesn't turn a profit. So that's some of the
I mean, not only does it not turn a profit, it's like way far from turning a profit.
Yes. And that is what some investors and market watchers have flagged when it comes to potential bubble risks. And then to that point, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos called this a possible industrial bubble. He did say though that AI is real. It's going to change every industry, but right now, you have a lot of money that's chasing anything that AI touches, whether it's good, bad, profitable, unprofitable. And and that is the concern here that we're maybe getting into levels that are potentially just a bit too frothy. Uh so this is something we've been tracking, we've been talking about. Uh there is a lot to be said when it comes to the earnings uh momentum that we've seen from some of these companies. And then on the productivity side too, I mean AI, you continuously hear it that for GDP growth, that is going to be the thing to watch.
We keep hearing it. When is it? We keep hearing it. I'm really curious to see, you know, because we all also, as we talked about earlier in the show with the guest from indeed, like we're getting some conflicting sort of how it's affecting the job market, for example, and you know, so I think it's still a little bit TBD on the on the macro level.
Yeah, and the timing, right? Like how long will investors have that patience until we start to actually see those returns and it's not just growth at all costs.
Looks like they're pretty patient so far. They're pretty patient so far. But if you look look at the Nasdaq, look at all those charts. But still, yes. All right, let's talk about pharma stocks as well. poised to cap off their best week in 16 years as a drug pricing and tariff deal with the US government helped ease an overhang that's been weighing on the sector. Pfizer's sort of kicking it off and that creating a lot of hope for the other stocks.
And Pfizer serving as the blueprint for what this deal could look like and Pfizer essentially promising to cut Medicaid uh drug prices in exchange for a tariff freeve of at least three years. They also are planning to invest $70 billion dollars here in the US. and this is something the Trump administration has been pushing for, not just with the pharmaceutical sector, but the larger tech sector as well. We've seen him cozy up to CEOs like Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and those companies have committed hundreds of billions of dollars back into US investments. Seems like Eli Lily is the next pharma company that the White House is targeting here. Uh so again, just takes the worst case scenario of tariffs off the table. That's leading to a boost in some of these pharma names. You got Pfizer, Merk, Lily all surging double digits this week, each posting their biggest weekly gain since 2009. and analyst saying that if more companies follow Pfizer's lead, this could ease a lot of those pressures that we've seen when it comes to tariff and drug pricing headwind, something we've really been talking about all year.
Yes. Thanks so much Ally. Appreciate it.
Of course.

finnhub,MRNA,2025-10-02T14:32:00,Could MRNA's Upcoming Product Launches Reduce COVID Sales Dependency?,"Moderna plans up to 10 product launches over four years, aiming to cut reliance on fading COVID-19 vaccine sales.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=8d687c97057e476f96c06879559a7b7f894130bb1ceea45fbd112b66696ef077,https://s.yimg.com/rz/stage/p/yahoo_finance_en-US_h_p_finance_2.png,Yahoo,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-mrnas-upcoming-product-launches-143200209.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-mrnas-upcoming-product-launches-143200209.html,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-mrnas-upcoming-product-launches-143200209.html,yahoo.com,200,,"Moderna MRNA is focusing on launching up to 10 new marketed products over the next four years, targeting a market opportunity of over $30 billion. These launches are central to Moderna’s strategy to drive revenue growth and reduce its dependence on the COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax.
Spikevax was Moderna’s first marketed product, which helped transform the mRNA-based vaccine-maker into one of the most profitable players in the healthcare sector. However, sales have declined sharply as pandemic-driven demand has faded. Though the company added a second marketed product to its portfolio last year with its RSV vaccine mResvia, the initial uptake was significantly weaker than expected. More recently, the company secured approval for a third marketed product, mNexspike, a next-generation, refrigerator-stable version of Spikevax.
To offset declining COVID sales, Moderna is advancing a broad, late-stage pipeline across respiratory, infectious disease and oncology categories. Key vaccine programs include mRNA-1647 (for CMV), mRNA-1083 (for COVID-19 plus influenza) and mRNA-1010 (for standalone influenza) vaccines. Before the end of 2025, the company intends to report data from the CMV study and resubmit a regulatory filing to the FDA for the COVID/flu combination vaccine.
An important candidate in the company’s pipeline is intismeran autogene (formerly, mRNA-4157), a personalized cancer therapy being developed in partnership with Merck MRK. Both Moderna and Merck are evaluating the therapy in three pivotal phase III studies, one in the melanoma indication and the other two in the non-small cell lung cancer space. It is also being evaluated in separate mid-stage studies for high-risk bladder cancers, adjuvant renal cell carcinoma and first-line metastatic melanoma. A potential launch for intismeran is targeted for 2027.
MRNA Faces Stiff Competition in Target Markets
Like Moderna, Pfizer PFE and its partner BioNTech BNTX are notable peers that have experienced significant revenue fluctuations with their jointly developed COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty. As demand for the vaccine continues to wane, both companies have turned to adjacent vaccine and therapeutic areas. While Pfizer and BioNTech are jointly developing a COVID-19 and influenza combination vaccine, they are also working independently to advance standalone pipeline candidates.
Pfizer also competes with Moderna in the RSV space, marketing Abrysvo. It is also focused on diversifying its portfolio of marketed drugs, particularly in oncology, which should support top-line growth in 2025 and beyond."
finnhub,MRNA,2025-10-02T13:30:01,Moderna (MRNA) Recently Broke Out Above the 50-Day Moving Average,"When a stock breaks out above the 50-Day simple moving average, good things could be on the horizon.

MRNA recently overtook the 50-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.
The 50-day simple moving average is one of three major moving averages used by traders and analysts to determine support or resistance levels for a wide range of securities. But the 50-day is considered to be more important because it's the first marker of an up or down trend.
MRNA has rallied 14.8% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests MRNA could be on the verge of another move higher.
The bullish case solidifies once investors consider MRNA's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 6 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.
Given this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on MRNA for more gains in the near future.

Shares of global pharmaceutical company Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) jumped 5.9% in the afternoon session after the company reached an agreement with the U.S. government to lower drug prices and reported positive trial data for a weight-loss drug from a recently acquired company.
The drugmaker voluntarily agreed to reduce prices for certain medications through Medicaid and sell them directly to consumers on a new platform, TrumpRx. As part of the deal, Pfizer also committed to investing $70 billion in domestic research, development, and manufacturing. Separately, Metsera, an obesity-focused startup that Pfizer is in the process of acquiring for $4.9 billion, announced promising results from a mid-stage trial. Its experimental weight-loss drug demonstrated a mean weight loss of up to 14.1% in patients, which likely added to investor optimism.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Pfizer’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 2 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 18 days ago when the stock dropped 3.5% on the news that reports revealed federal health officials are planning to link COVID-19 vaccines to the deaths of children.
The decline followed a Washington Post story stating that officials intend to present data to advisors for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) connecting the vaccines to 25 child deaths. This development has heightened investor concerns about vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna, which also saw their shares fall. The negative sentiment builds on recent headwinds for the sector, as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposed new restrictions in late August, limiting the next round of vaccines to people over 65 or those with qualifying health conditions.
Pfizer is down 5.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $25.25 per share, it is trading 16.4% below its 52-week high of $30.19 from October 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Pfizer’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $688.10.

The former is down by 75% over this period, while the latter has dropped 32%.
Should you avoid Moderna and Regeneron? Not in my view. Though both biotechs have faced challenges, they could be solid stocks to own through the next 10 years. Let me explain.
1. Moderna
Moderna made a fortune thanks to its success in the coronavirus vaccine market. Although the worst of the pandemic is behind us, the biotech company should continue to benefit from its work in this area for some time. Moderna is still generating decent sales from its coronavirus vaccine franchise. It expects revenue of between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion this year, mostly from its products in this area.
COVID-19 may no longer be a severe global health emergency, but the disease is here to stay, and people, particularly those at high risk of severe disease, will continue to seek vaccination against it. And Moderna should remain a leader in the field.
Moderna also improved its pipeline over the past three years, in efforts that should lead to brand-new approvals. The biotech has already launched mResvia, a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It has other exciting candidates in late-stage trials, including a vaccine for cytomegalovirus (CMV).
The company's investigational influenza vaccine, mRNA-1010, performed well in clinical studies. Though there are plenty of options in that area, their efficacy tends to be unimpressive. In a phase 3 clinical trial, mRNA-1010 conferred greater protection against the flu than an approved vaccine.
Perhaps its most promising candidate is a personalized cancer vaccine called mRNA-4157, which Moderna is developing in collaboration with Merck; in combination with Merck's cancer therapy Keytruda, it helped decrease the risk of recurrence or death in patients with melanoma, compared to treatment with Keytruda alone. It's also being tested across several other forms of cancer.
Moderna has several other candidates in phase 1 and phase 2 studies; it should record significant pipeline progress over the next couple of years, enhance its lineup, and generate strong financial results into the next decade. The stock is down significantly, but there's plenty of upside left for patient investors.
2. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
Regeneron's struggles over the past few years may have started with the 2022 approval of Vabysmo, a competitor (produced by Genentech, a division of Roche Holding) for its treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, Eylea. The company then had to contend with biosimilar competition for the medicine.
Thankfully, Regeneron is slowly moving beyond these issues. Its newer, high-dose formulation of Eylea comes with a less stringent dosing schedule. It's now better able to compete with Vabysmo (one of Vabysmo's selling points was its friendlier dosing schedule), while many patients on the original Eylea are also switching to the newer version.
Regeneron's revenue in the second quarter increased by 4% year over year to $3.68 billion. That's not phenomenal top-line growth, but it's pretty strong considering Eylea's challenges. Furthermore, Dupixent, Regeneron's current biggest growth driver, is performing very well and will maintain its momentum for some time.
Regeneron has also earned brand-new approvals, and there should be more on the way. Its cancer medicine Lynozyfic received approval earlier this year. And the company reported positive phase 3 results for cemdisiran as a potential treatment for myasthenia gravis, a disease that causes muscle weakness; Regeneron should submit regulatory applications for it sometime next year.
The pipeline features many more products, including in the hottest area in the pharmaceutical industry: weight management. Regeneron should continue to enhance its pipeline while relying on Dupixent to drive excellent financial results in the meantime. The stock remains a solid choice for investors to buy and hold for the long term."

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.5% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.38%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.5%.
The biotechnology company's shares have seen an increase of 3.11% over the last month, surpassing the Medical sector's loss of 0.7% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.74%.
Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Moderna in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be -$1.95, reflecting a 6600% decrease from the same quarter last year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $925.77 million, indicating a 50.28% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.
MRNA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of -$9.59 per share and revenue of $1.93 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -8.12% and -40.37%, respectively.
Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Moderna. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.
Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.

The company said the Moderna Innovation and Technology Centre (MITC) at the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, near Chilton, is the UK’s first facility to manufacture mRNA jabs onshore.
The facility can make up to 100 million doses per year, rising to 250 million in a pandemic, and will create around 150 highly skilled jobs, the Government said.
It comes amid a challenging backdrop for investment for the sector.
Last week, UK pharmaceutical giant GSK revealed plans to put nearly £22 billion into US research and development and manufacturing over the next five years.
It came after US-based drugmaker Merck said its UK operation will scrap plans for a £1 billion site in London’s Kings Cross, which had been due to open in 2027.
Bosses blamed the Government for paying too little for medicines and not investing enough in the sector, as it confirmed the move, which will impact around 125 jobs.
Days later, AstraZeneca announced it had paused plans to invest £200 million at a Cambridge research site.
Industry bosses recently told MPs that a “difficult” environment and pressure on pricing had made the UK a less attractive investment environment than other countries such as the US.
Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the “new cutting-edge facility” in Oxfordshire marks the “next pivotal moment in boosting our nation’s health, innovation and economy”.
He went on: “The Government is investing billions into this vital sector, and partnering the might of Moderna with the brilliance of our NHS will enable us to benefit from innovative vaccine technology as we shift healthcare from treatment to prevention.”
Darius Hughes, UK general manager of Moderna, said the site strengthens the country’s “pandemic preparedness”.
Stephane Bancel, chief executive of the firm, added: “This latest milestone underscores the UK’s commitment to improving health security, both against global health emergencies and ongoing seasonal respiratory threats.”
Moderna is investing more than £1 billion in UK research and development as part of 10-year strategic partnership with Government."

Shares of biotechnology company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped 6.1% in the afternoon session after the company announced it delivered the first mRNA vaccines fully manufactured in Canada to the nation's provinces and territories.
This event marked a major milestone in the company's partnership with Canada, boosting the country's ability to produce its own vaccines and strengthening its national health security. The delivered vaccines were the updated Spikevax shots, which targeted the SARS-CoV-2 LP.8.1 variant. The entire process occurred within Canada, with the drug substance made at a facility in Laval, Quebec, and the final fill-and-finish steps completed in Cambridge, Ontario. This development provided a positive signal for the company, potentially supporting investor sentiment as Moderna worked to offset declining global sales of its COVID-19 vaccine.
The shares closed the day at $26.56, up 5.2% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us
Moderna’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 50 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.
The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock gained 4% on the news that the company announced positive preliminary data for its updated 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax®.
The new formula, which targets the LP.8.1 variant, generated a strong immune response in a Phase 4 clinical trial, showing an 8-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies in high-risk individuals and adults over 65. Moderna reported that the vaccine's safety profile remains consistent with previous studies, with no new concerns identified. The positive clinical update suggests continued demand for the company's key product. Further bolstering investor confidence, UBS reiterated its 'Buy' rating and a $70 price target on the stock.
Moderna is down 37% since the beginning of the year, and at $26.48 per share, it is trading 60.4% below its 52-week high of $66.83 from September 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Moderna’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $385.33.

MRNA operates globally with manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe, leveraging strategic alliances and technology transfers to scale its operations.
In September 2025, Moderna, Inc.

Policy shifts, including Florida’s removal of vaccine mandates, further cloud near-term demand forecasts.
Despite these challenges, the firm emphasizes transparency and scientific rigor, citing extensive real-world data with over a billion doses administered worldwide. This ongoing focus on safety underpins public trust and regulatory engagement.
Innovation remains central to Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)’s strategy, with the company broadening mRNA applications beyond COVID-19. AI and machine learning are increasingly integrated into MRNA’s R&D pipeline to accelerate mRNA design, optimize vaccine formulations, and predict immune responses. This combination of scientific rigor and technological edge reinforces MRNA’s standing among the best biotech stocks adapting to future healthcare needs.

Drug makers are battling vaccine restrictions, pricing pressures, tariff threats, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

When a newly reconstituted federal vaccine committee meets this Thursday and Friday, it is widely expected to consider a controversial report prepared by federal health officials that purports to link coronavirus vaccines to the deaths of 25 children, despite little evidence. That report is the latest salvo in a battle being waged by the Trump administration against the drug industry that has created turmoil for pharmaceutical and biotech companies and their investors.
The battle lines were drawn last November when President Donald Trump announced that he would name Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time critic of the drug industry and a vaccine skeptic, as his nominee for Health and Human Services Secretary. The stocks of vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna lost almost $8 billion in market value on the news — a taste of things to come.
Since Kennedy was confirmed in January, he has doggedly pursued his goal of ending what he calls “pharmaceutical capture” of America’s health agencies. He regularly claims that staffers at the agencies under his purview are too friendly to the companies they regulate.
The Department of Health and Human Services, responsible for the public health of Americans, oversees the Food & Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. On taking office, Kennedy quickly announced plans to reduce the HHS workforce by 25%, or approximately 20,000 employees, shrinking what he called a “bloated bureaucracy compromised by industry ties.”
His tenure has been marked by a stream of high-level resignations at the FDA, and in late August Kennedy stunned the health world when he fired CDC director Susan Monarez, just weeks into her job. In Congressional testimony on September 17, Monarez described a private meeting with Kennedy in which he called the CDC “the most corrupt federal agency in the world” and said its employees were “bought by the pharma industry.”
Monarez said she was fired because she would not commit in advance to approving every recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an influential vaccine advisory panel meeting this week, regardless of the scientific evidence, and because she would not fire CDC scientists without cause.
She also testified that Kennedy told her he plans to change the childhood vaccine schedule in September, without giving her any scientific evidence to justify that change, and that he said he speaks to Trump “every day” about changing the childhood vaccine schedule.
ACIP plays a critical role in determining national vaccine policies by making recommendations of who is eligible for shots and whether the vaccines should be covered by insurance. When ACIP meets this Thursday and Friday, HHS officials are expected to present the report that COVID vaccines may be responsible for childhood deaths.
The report appears to be based on information submitted to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which contains unverified reports of side effects or bad experiences with vaccines that can be submitted by anyone, be it patients, doctors, pharmacists, or even someone who sees a report on social media. The database is not designed to assess whether a vaccine caused a death.
According to the CDC, at least 1,289 children in the United States between the ages of 0 to 19 died from COVID-19 between April 2020 and July 2022, 234,000 were hospitalized, and about 1 million children have long COVID, with symptoms that persist or emerge at least three months after an infection. Claims that the vaccines can be dangerous to children have been disproven by several studies.
Kennedy already caused an outcry from critics and the industry in June when he fired all 17 members of ACIP and stacked the panel with vaccine skeptics. This week he named another five to the panel, including one who advocated unproven COVID treatments such as ivermectin and one who pushed back on pandemic mandates.
In August, Kennedy announced plans to cancel $500 million in funding for the development of vaccines for bird flu and other viruses based on the mRNA method used for COVID vaccines. That action shut down 22 projects led by major pharmaceutical companies, including, again, Pfizer and Moderna.
In a contentious Congressional hearing in August, Kennedy said he believes mRNA vaccines can cause a form of AIDS and can damage children’s organs, brains, hearts and immune systems or even lead to death. Numerous studies have demonstrated that shots using mRNA technology are safe and effective, and serious side effects are extremely rare.
Kennedy’s adversarial position towards the drug industry has influenced a number of Trump administration pharma policies beyond vaccines. Kennedy has long wanted to end drug advertisements, saying that such ads “allow companies to market powerful drugs with half-truths,” and he is close to getting his wish. On September 9, the president signed an executive order announcing sweeping changes to rules governing direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertisements, while the FDA sent out thousands of letters warning drug companies to remove misleading ads and issued approximately 100 cease-and-desist letters to companies it said had deceptive ads.
In addition, the FDA is initiating rulemaking that would require an end to a 1997 policy change that allows drug companies to disclose only some of the safety risks associated with a prescription drug in broadcast and digital ads, which enables them to make the ads short enough to advertise on television.
“Pharmaceutical ads hooked this country on prescription drugs,” Kennedy said in a press release. “We will shut down that pipeline of deception and require drug companies to disclose all critical safety facts in their advertising.”
In an editorial published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on September 12, FDA director Martin Makary wrote that the agency would also police drug advertisements on social media, which he said “are often presented as entertainment, blurring the boundaries between editorial content, user-generated media, and pharmaceutical advertising.”
Reverting to pre-1997 drug advertising laws would require drugmakers to disclose all risks in the ad. Given that ""drug ads on TV are typically around a minute long, this rule, if enforced, would effectively nullify every pharma commercial in its current form,” wrote Emarketer healthcare analyst Raj Leventhal.
The United States is one of only two countries that allows direct-to-consumer advertising (New Zealand is the other). Various estimates have put drug industry ad spending at $14 billion a year, and a 2023 HHS study estimated that direct-to-consumer drove nearly one-third of the increase in spending on prescriptions by consumers since 1997.
Drug prices are also in the line of fire. On July 31, President Trump sent letters to 17 major drug makers demanding that they bring down the prices of prescription drugs in the United States to match the lowest price offered in other developed nations — known as the most-favored-nation price.
Trump tried to implement a most favored nation policy during his first term, but it was blocked by legal challenges, and the same is widely expected to happen this time around. It could still be a powerful negotiating ploy, however.
“I think this is the administration saying to itself, what's the worst imaginable thing I think I can do within the bounds of my authority to the industry to get them to the table so that they will announce and change some behaviors,” said Neal Masia of EntityRisk in a recent panel discussion.
Meanwhile, Trump is imposing a 15% tariff on medicines imported from the European Union, home to some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. That ends a decades-long agreement to have no tariffs on innovative medicines between the United States and Europe
The industry is pushing back. Merck, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb Company, and Eli Lilly recently banded together to form a new lobbying group, IRA Watchdog, in order to present congressional lawmakers with research on what the industry sees as the negative impacts of drug price negotiations.
Kennedy also has some very prominent critics, among them Trump’s Surgeon General during his first term, Jerome Adams. Adams recently called for Kennedy to be removed from his post, saying “Leadership means showing up, telling the truth, and putting people first. RFK hasn’t done that.”"

The update follows a media report on Friday that Trump administration health officials intend to link the vaccines to 25 child deaths. This assertion is reportedly based on unverified submissions to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
The data from an ongoing Phase 4 trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the 2025-2026 formula of Spikevax showed, on average, greater than an 8-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the LP.8.1 variant in individuals 12 through 64 years with at least one underlying condition and all adults 65 years of age and older.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
The safety profile of the vaccine was consistent with previous studies, with no new safety concerns identified.
Recent surveillance data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows the U.S. wastewater viral activity for COVID-19 is high, and LP.8.1 and its familial strains, XFG and NB.1.8.1, continue to dominate.
The preliminary analysis confirms Moderna’s updated COVID-19 vaccine is a match to the currently top circulating strains in the U.S.
These clinical findings also reinforce preclinical data that supported the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the 2025-2026 formula of Spikevax, which is approved by the FDA for individuals 6 months through 64 years who are at high risk for COVID-19 infection and all adults 65 years of age and older.

Recent FDA Nod to Updated COVID-19 Jabs for MRNA & Others
Last month, the FDA approved updated COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer PFE/ BioNTech BNTX and Novavax NVAX for the 2025-26 vaccination season, targeting the LP.8.1 strain of the virus. All these vaccines are cleared for use in adults aged 65 and older.
However, for those under 65, the vaccines are permitted only for individuals with underlying conditions that raise the risk of severe COVID-19.
The FDA approved Moderna’s two COVID-19 vaccines — Spikevax and the recently approved next-generation refrigerator-stable version called mNexspike. While Spikevax was cleared for use in individuals aged six months to 64 years who have at least one high-risk condition, mNexspike was approved for use in those aged 12 to 64 years.
Pfizer’s/BioNTech’s Comirnaty was approved for at-risk individuals aged five years and older.
Earlier this month, PFE/BNTX announced top-line data from an ongoing phase III study, which evaluated the updated formulation of Comirnaty in at-risk individuals aged between 12 years and 64 years and all adults aged 65 years and above. The updated vaccine demonstrated a 4-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the LP.8.1 variant on average, across the age groups.
Novavax’s protein-based vaccine Nuvaxovid was approved for at-risk individuals aged 12 to 64 years. Novavax’s Nuvaxovid is the only non-mRNA-based vaccine that is currently available."

In August 2025, Vertex’s phase II study on the oral formulation of next-gen Nav1.8 inhibitor, VX-993, for treating acute pain after bunionectomy surgery did not show a statistically significant improvement on the primary endpoint. Following the disappointing results, the company decided not to advance VX-993 into pivotal development as a monotherapy for acute pain, as it felt that it would not be superior to its other NaV1.8 inhibitors.
In March 2025, Vertex discontinued the development of VX-264 (cells device program), as a phase I/II study on the candidate in type 1 diabetes failed to meet its efficacy endpoint.
In December 2024, Vertex announced unimpressive data from a phase II study on suzetrigine for treating people with painful lumbosacral radiculopathy (“LSR”), a form of peripheral neuropathic pain. The data showed largely undifferentiated pain reduction from placebo. In August 2025, the company said it would not begin a phase III study on suzetrigine for the LSR indication, and it wouldn’t be moving forward with a broad peripheral neuropathic pain label for suzetrigine. Suzetrigine was approved as Journavx in the United States in January for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain.
Vertex’s recent price decline has left investors wondering if they should sell the stock now or hold a little longer. Let’s understand the company’s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play VRTX stock amid this scenario.
Consistent Rise in VRTX’s CF Product Sales
Vertex holds a dominant position in the cystic franchise (CF) market. Its CF sales continue to grow, driven by demand growth of Trikafta/Kaftrio in younger age groups. While in the near term, Trikafta’s expansion to younger age groups should continue to drive CF sales growth, the launch of Alyftrek, a next-in-class triple combination regimen, should drive growth in the medium term.
However, there are some concerns regarding Vertex’s CF sales that are slightly slowing down.
Vertex is also evaluating its medicines in younger patient populations and aims to have small-molecule treatments for most people with CF. Additionally, Vertex is developing an mRNA therapeutic, VX-522, in partnership with Moderna MRNA for approximately 5,000 people with CF who do not make the CFTR protein and who cannot benefit from its CFTR modulators. A single ascending dose portion of a phase I/II clinical study on VX-522 is complete, while a multiple ascending dose portion of the study is on a temporary pause, which is expected to resume in the near term."

Eli Lilly on Wednesday said its closely watched obesity pill orforglipron led to greater weight loss and blood sugar control than an oral version of Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide in a head-to-head trial. The Phase 3 trial pit orforglipron against the approved dosage for Rybelsus, an oral form of semaglutide used to treat Type 2 diabetes, in nearly 1,700 patients with the disease. At one year, orforglipron met all of its main and secondary study goals. Patients on the highest dose experienced lower A1C levels by more than 2 percentage points and lost an average of 9.2% of their body weight. Novo has a higher-dose version of oral semaglutide that it’s tested in obesity, however, and could gain approval by the end of the year. — Ben Fidler
AstraZeneca reported divergent outcomes from two late-stage studies on Wednesday. In one Phase 3 trial, a subcutaneous form of its marketed medicine Sophnelo helped lower signs of disease activity in people with the most common form of lupus. In the other, its drug Fasenra, used to treat asthma and a few other conditions, failed meaningfully lower the rate of moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease attacks. The under-the-skin injection of Sophnelo is being reviewed by regulators. AstraZeneca will analyze the Fasenra data to “further understand the results,” the company said. — Ben Fidler
Novo’s experimental drug cagrilintide helped people with obesity lose almost 12% of their body weight after 68 weeks of treatment, a finding the Danish company said Tuesday is sufficient to support further assessment in a Phase 3 clinical trial. The data came from a sub-analysis of a late-stage study called Redefine-1, which evaluated the combination obesity drug CagriSema as well as its individual components, one of which is cagrilintide. Cagrilintide, which targets a digestive hormone called amylin, is one of several prospects Novo hopes can help shore up its position in the competitive obesity drug market. Novo said the new trial will start in the fourth quarter. — Jonathan Gardner
Moderna said on Tuesday its updated COVID booster generates a strong immune response against currently circulating coronavirus strains in a post-approval trial. The company released the data one week after a similar announcement from Pfizer, responding to President Donald Trump’s call for COVID vaccine makers to make their results public despite the availability of scores of study findings. Moderna said its shot, a new formulation of its vaccine Spikevax, generated greater than an eight-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the so-called LP.8.1 variant across age groups. The shot is approved for adults 65 years of age and older, and in those aged 6 months through 64 years with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe disease. — Delilah Alvarado
Lila Sciences, an artificial intelligence-focused biotechnology startup backed by Flagship Pioneering, announced its second “ megaround” so far this year. On Monday, Lila revealed a $235 million Series A, adding to a $200 million seed financing announced in March. With the new funding, the firm plans to open hubs in Boston, San Francisco and London housing “AI science factories” capable of designing and running large-scale experiments. The round was co-led by Braidwell and Collective Global and included a dozen other investors, including Flagship.— Gwendolyn Wu
Dualitas Therapeutics launched Tuesday with $65 million in funding to help develop bispecific antibody drugs for immune disorders. The South San Francisco-based biotech debuted with six publicly disclosed programs, the most advanced of which are targeting autoimmune conditions and allergic diseases. The Series A round was co-led by Qiming Venture Partners and Versant Ventures, and involved Eli Lilly and Alexandria Venture Investments, among other investors. — Gwendolyn Wu"

Moderna Investment Narrative Recap
To be a Moderna shareholder, you need to believe that its mRNA platform will produce new blockbuster products and effectively replace COVID-19 vaccine revenues as they decline. The recent government scrutiny over vaccine safety in children has disrupted sentiment, creating a risk of new eligibility restrictions; while it amplifies near-term uncertainty, the most important short-term catalyst, future product launches from its mRNA pipeline, remains unchanged. The principal risk now is further regulatory tightening or reputational damage, which could delay approvals and limit near-term revenue potential if perceptions worsen.
Among recent announcements, Moderna confirmed in early September at the International Congress of Inborn Errors of Metabolism that its pipeline is advancing despite the external pressures, signifying ongoing R&D momentum. This focus on expanding clinical research and product candidates is especially relevant as pipeline progress is the main lever for offsetting vaccine revenue volatility and supporting investor confidence moving forward.
However, investors should pay special attention to how a changing regulatory climate might further limit...

- The Recommerce Caucus, aimed at championing legislation and initiatives that prioritize the buying and selling of pre-owned, refurbished and secondhand goods, launched last month.
- The caucus, spearheaded by U.S. representatives Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., and Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., is endorsed by online platforms including eBay, Depop, Etsy, Mercari, OfferUp, Pinterest and Poshmark. The caucus aims to prioritize “empowering small sellers, expanding digital access, and strengthening sustainability,” per the release.
- The recommerce sector is projected to reach $1.04 trillion globally by 2035, and this caucus will work to support initiatives “that extend product life cycles, cut down on landfill waste, and encourage environmentally responsible commerce,” per the release.
Dive Insight:
The bipartisan Recommerce Caucus is designed to advocate for policies that help individuals and small businesses earn income through resale, repair and refurbishment on digital platforms, according to the press release. The group also wants to reduce participation barriers to online platforms and promote digital access “so all Americans can fully benefit from recommerce’s economic potential.”
Ashley Shillingsburg, head of Americas government relations at eBay, said the caucus will directly benefit not only platforms, but individual consumers.
“By aligning public policy with the realities of modern commerce, the caucus has the potential to unlock new opportunities for online platforms and deliver meaningful benefits to consumers nationwide,” Shillingsburg said in an email.
According to ThredUp’s 2025 Resale Report, the U.S. secondhand apparel market grew five times faster than the overall retail clothing market last year, and it’s expected to reach a $74 billion valuation by 2029.
Cathy Moscardini, head of sustainability at Depop, said the new group will facilitate access to that revenue stream.
“The Recommerce Caucus can help mainstream circular practices, drive economic opportunity for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs championing the circular economy,” Moscardini said in an email. “At a time when consumers are prioritizing affordability, it can also mean greater access to desirable, secondhand fashion — making it easier and more attractive to buy and sell across the circular economy.”
Some coalition members stressed the importance of prioritizing and engaging with small sellers in future policy decisions, particularly when it comes to ensuring digital access to platforms that facilitate buying and selling refurbished and secondhand goods.
“We’re aligned on being good actors in this space and really championing the concept of reccomerce in a responsible way,” Nathan Garnett, chief business officer at OfferUp, said. “Buyers and sellers might be interested in remaining in their community. For example, children’s clothes — if your kids grow out of them, you might like having somebody down the street who has a child a year or two younger than yours, and you can exchange clothing that way. It can be local.”
The Recommerce Caucus has also received endorsements from member organizations including American Circular Textiles, a group of fashion industry leaders advocating for policy solutions to promote textile and garment sustainability, and the Coalition to Protect Small Sellers (PASS Coalition), a group of third party e-commerce marketplaces that enable individual buyers and sellers to exchange goods.
“Our mission as an organization is to target policies at the state and federal level that are supportive of the circular economy in the United States specifically,” Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of American Circular Textiles, said. “And so whether that is enabling consumers to more easily participate in buying and selling on used clothing platforms or making it more cost effective to stand up these businesses and run them and grow them and be prosperous … that’s our goal.”"
